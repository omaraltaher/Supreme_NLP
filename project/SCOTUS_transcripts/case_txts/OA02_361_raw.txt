CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in No. 02-361, the United States v. the


American Library Association. 


General Olson.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


When libraries block Internet pornography from


their computer terminals, they are simply declining to put


onto their computer screens the same content they have


traditionally excluded from their bookshelves.  By


offering Internet access without pornography, freedom of 

speech is expanded, not abridged.  Under the Children's


Internet Protection Act, or CIPA, no Internet speech is


prohibited, inhibited, threatened, or chilled.  Libraries


are simply exercising their discretion as to the content


that their libraries will contain, the historic discretion


to exercise that -- that authority, and to how their


library resources will be used.


QUESTION:  Mr. Olson, you have a number of


important legal concepts to address.  I have three factual


questions.  I've been through the extensive opinion of the

Three different things.


When the library patron requests that the filter


be disabled, does he have to explain why he wants it


disabled?


asked --


MR. OLSON:  No.  Shall I wait until you've


QUESTION:  Go ahead. 


MR. OLSON:  It's my understanding that the --


the library patron would not have to explain any reason


why he was asking a site to be unblocked or the filtering


to be disabled.


QUESTION:  That's the next question.  Do you ask


site by site or can I -- can the library patron say,


unblock the whole thing?


MR. OLSON:  The library patron, if the patron is


an adult, can ask the -- the entire filtering to be


disabled, and the library may disable -- I mean, eliminate


the filtering with respect to specific sites either on


their own or at the request of a patron. 


QUESTION:  All right. 


And third, the district court said in some cases


it takes 24 hours to a week.  Is that the usual thing or


does -- in many cases can the librarian just push a


button?

 MR. OLSON:  I think that it is -- it is -- the


record is not clear on that, and I -- but my -- my


experience and my judgment in connection with our


preparation is that it need not be a very difficult thing. 


It's something that libraries can do without a great deal


of difficulty.  But to the extent that it took any time at


all, it would be the same as asking for a book that is not


on the shelf or asking for an inter-library loan, the kind


of customary things that library patrons do when they ask


for a book or a resource in a library.


QUESTION:  Is -- is there anything in the


statute that would prohibit a library from doing the


following?  Any adult who wants to watch the thing without


the screen, come up and ask, do you want to do it, and you


-- we can tell you, don't watch these obscene child 

pornography, et cetera.  Then we disconnect it.  Does the


statute prohibit the library from doing that?


MR. OLSON:  If I understand your question


correctly, I -- I know of nothing in the statute that


would prohibit the library from doing that, provided that


the -- the person asks and the patron asking is an adult.


The First Amendment does not require libraries


to sponsor the viewing of pornography.  When Government


gives financial aid to speech on Government premises, it


may make rational choices as to what not to finance.

Those -- that -- that doctrine is consistent with this


Court's previous decisions.  In connection with this


particular content, Congress and this Court have found


that Government has -- the Government has a compelling


interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity,


child pornography, and in the case of minors, material


that is harmful to children.  Such material has been


traditionally excluded from public libraries, and


Government has a basic, fundamental right in addition not


to associate with or finance pornography.


QUESTION:  Isn't part of the problem that a lot


more is being excluded?  I mean, as I understand it, the


statute requires that a -- a filter of some sort be used. 


Filters are not sold -- the blocking devices are not sold


or prepared apparently in terms of the concepts that the 

statute uses.  The companies that do prepare them will not


even disclose what in fact they are blocking so that it


seems that an inevitable price of this is blocking more


than -- than the statute requires, and that's even without


getting into the question of blocking material for adults


as -- as opposed -- that -- that might be unsuitable for


children, but certainly aren't for adults. 


How do you -- how do you get over the problem of


the -- sort of the -- the imprecision, the crudity, the


overkill of the blocking devices?

 MR. OLSON:  Justice Souter, that is -- that is


true that any system is going to involve some over-


blocking and under-blocking because it's impossible to


know what is going to be coming over the Internet or


impossible to make systems that are perfect.  But that's


consistent with what -- the historical decisions that


libraries have made. 


QUESTION:  But there's one thing that is clearly


inconsistent I think, and that is when the libraries make


-- historically have made these decisions, they've known


what they weren't buying or weren't stocking on their


shelves, and here they don't --


MR. OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- because they -- the blocking


makers regard that as proprietary information. 

MR. OLSON:  It's -- there's several answers to


that it seems to me.  In the first place, libraries have


known that they have not stocked pornography, and it's not


because of space, popularity, or expense.  They have


chosen traditionally not to stock that type of material.


Every time a library decides not to subscribe to a


magazine, it is over-blocking in a sense.  A magazine may


have three pornographic pictures in it or sexually


explicit pictures in --


QUESTION:  But it -- but it does know what the

magazine is, and here it does not know what the website


is.


MR. OLSON:  It knows what the magazine has been. 


It may not know what the magazine is in the future. 


Furthermore, librarians don't read every book.


QUESTION:  No, but it -- you know, it knows it's


Playboy or whatever the magazine is, and here it doesn't


know what the website is that's being excluded.


MR. OLSON:  Yes, but it can -- it can test this


-- what we're saying here with respect to that is over-


blocking or under-blocking is a necessary part of the


library function of making appropriateness judgments with


respect to content generally.  That's the type of


distinction --


QUESTION: 


Well, I -- I have a problem with --

with that.  It -- it seems to me a large part of your


argument is you want us to think of this just in the same


context of the librarian going through a list of books and


deciding what books to buy.  But the Internet isn't like


that.  What is it?  There's a -- 1.5 million new entries


into the system every day?  This is a whole new medium. 


It's not like a library.


MR. OLSON:  Yes.  And, Justice Kennedy, it seems


to -- it seems to the Government and it seemed -- it


seemed to Congress that gross judgments are going to have

to be made.  These libraries, as the record reflects and


the findings of the district court reveal, traditionally


or -- or customarily block e-mail, chat, gambling, gaming,


dating services, and some of them, as reflected -- I think


it's on page 37, 38 of the appendix to the jurisdictional


statement -- make -- make judgments with respect to what's


appropriate, what's offensive.  Those types of judgments


are being made.


Yes, this is a new medium and it's --


QUESTION:  Well, but General Olson, there are


supposed to be 90,000 books a year published in the United


States.  Do you think librarians know the contents or even


know of the existence of all of those 90,000 books?


MR. OLSON:  No, that -- Mr. Chief Justice,


that's our point. 


This is a difference in quantity, but 

it is not a difference generically from what libraries


traditionally have done.


QUESTION:  But when the library makes a book


decision, doesn't it make a decision that says, we will


not put God's Little Acre on our shelves?  It's a yes or


no decision with respect to the book.  It's quite true


there are lots of books out there that the library not --


may not know about, but when it makes a decision not to


put it on the shelf, it knows what it's deciding not to


do, and here it doesn't.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, in a specific situation, a


library might know that.  A library might decide that it


would just stock history books or just stock -- stock


novels of a particular period.  There's nothing to suggest


that libraries don't have the right to make those


decisions and customarily make those decisions.


QUESTION:  Sure, but somebody along the line


knows what they've decided to buy within the category and


what they haven't decided to buy. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, that's right, but the


traditional decisions that libraries have made -- and the


appellees do not dispute this -- is that libraries have


not chosen to stock the types of material on their shelves


that they're now being asked to keep out with respect to


the Internet. 


This is a similar decision with a different 

medium.


QUESTION:  No, but that's -- that's true.  But I


think the thing that -- one of the things that's troubling


us is they're -- they're -- they are -- they are forced,


by virtue of that decision, not to stock a lot of other


material, and they don't even know what it is and there's


no way for them to find out.


MR. OLSON:  But, Justice Souter, they -- they


may on their own -- there's a -- there's -- one of the


materials that's in the record is someone that made a

study of several hundred thousand sites and decided which


ones were properly blocked or improperly blocked.  Those


types of studies may be used to unblock sites, to modify


the filtering system.  Libraries could get together and


create their own filtering system rather than the ones


that are --


QUESTION:  Could the library in -- General


Olson, in view of what you answered earlier, you said any


patron could say, I want to unblock everything.  Could the


library say, well, we want our staff to have access to


everything?  Therefore, we are going to unblock everything


for the computers that we use internally.  I thought the


answer to that question was no, but it seems inconsistent


with the answer that you gave.  A patron says, I want to


see everything.  Fine.


MR. OLSON:  Well, I -- I believe that the answer


is that, A, the librarian can, in response to a request


from a patron, unblock the filtering mechanism altogether. 


And secondly, I think it's not entirely -- it's not -- the


statute doesn't get into it, but it -- but it seems


entirely consistent with what I've just said, and I think


consistent with the import of your question is that the


library staff can disable the filter in order to make


judgments about whether something has been, quote,


properly or improperly blocked.

 QUESTION:  Because one of the things that was


criticized about this statute was that every terminal,


even the ones in the librarian's own office, closed


office, has to have this filtering.  But your answer is,


no, they don't.  You -- you make it sound like it's really


the library's option.  If they want to put everything on,


they can. 


MR. OLSON:  I -- I was answering your question


with respect to what the staff may review in making the


administrative decisions with respect to unblocking or


other decisions with respect to the implementation of the


statute.  The statute speaks in terms of having in place


this technological mechanism by which this material can be


filtered out or is designed and calculated to do that.  It


doesn't -- the statute does not require perfection.  It


doesn't require librarians to act in --


QUESTION:  General Olson, if I understand the


situation correctly, the libraries are wasting a lot of


money litigating.  They could simply hire somebody to come


into the library everyday and say, please unblock


everything, and then they could do it.


MR. OLSON:  With respect to that patron.  I


mean, the -- the -- if my answer suggested that the


library could just switch off the filter on a daily basis,


I didn't mean to say anything remotely like that.

 QUESTION:  Oh, okay.


MR. OLSON:  It -- this -- particular patrons may


say, I'm investigating breast cancer.  This -- the sites


-- some of the sites that I'm looking for I can't find,


and they appear to be on block.  Can those sites -- or


I've heard about these sites -- be unblocked?


QUESTION:  But do they have to --


QUESTION:  Or -- or he can say, according to


you, what do you care what I'm investigating?  I just want


the site unblocked.  Isn't that right? 


MR. OLSON:  That's -- that's correct.  Yes,


that's correct. 


QUESTION:  I wonder how -- how effective that --


that system is in -- in achieving some of the goals of the


statute which -- which is not just that -- that some 

people using the -- the Net happen to stumble across


pornographic stuff but also, passing by, see it, and --


and including children. 


MR. OLSON:  That -- that may happen, Justice


Scalia.  The system is not perfect.  It is not going to be


perfect.  But what it does, it's a reasonable, rational


articulation by Congress of an attempt to decide --


QUESTION:  Why couldn't the -- why couldn't the


children be protected by having two screens?  One screen


for the kids; the other for the adults.  One is blocked;

the other isn't. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, I think that is -- again, is a


practical judgment that may work in some libraries.  It


might require a great deal more resources from librarians. 


It might require establishing different screens and


mechanisms.  Yes, there are ways in which Congress could


have done this differently, but this is a rational


judgment, consistent with --


QUESTION:  May I go back to Justice Ginsburg's


question with respect to the library staff on the


unblocking?  I -- I think her original question was, could


the library say, we want our staff to have free access on


the computers that they use, not that we want them to be


able to look behind the block to see what's being kept


out.  We just want them to have a free computer.  Is -- is


that a violation of the statute?  I had thought it was --


MR. OLSON:  I think that the -- my answer to


your question, if I understand it correctly, is that the


computers in the library, if the library uses the -- the


Federal funds with either respect to the discounts or the


subsidies, direct subsidies, all the computers in that


library must be equipped with the technology protection


measure with respect to each of those computers.


QUESTION:  And that would include the staff


computers.

 MR. OLSON:  Yes.  But that does not preclude the


staff from determining, in connection with specific


requests --


QUESTION:  Yes, but that's not the question. 


The question is can the library say, this is ridiculous


blocking this stuff for our staff.  We're not going to


block them.  The staff computers are either going to have


no blocks or every morning we will press the button that


unblocks the staff computers. 


MR. OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  That would violate the statute,


wouldn't it?


MR. OLSON:  Well, one could -- you're in an


area, it seems to me, that -- where there might be an as-


applied challenge. 


We're talking about a facial challenge 

to the constitutionality of the statute.


QUESTION:  And we want to know the extent of the


statutory prohibition.


MR. OLSON:  I -- I understand that.  I -- and


the -- your -- the import of your question suggests that


in this situation a librarian might exercise this


discretion with respect to a filter.  I don't think in the


first place --


QUESTION:  All I want to know is whether they


can do it without violating the statute.

 MR. OLSON:  My answer to your question is that


to the extent that librarians are disabling the filter for


the performance of their administrative function --


QUESTION:  That's not my question.  The library


simply says, we want our staff to have free computers.


MR. OLSON:  I don't think so, Justice Souter. 


QUESTION:  That would violate it. 


MR. OLSON:  That's right.  But remember, this is


in the context of -- of material that's been traditionally


excluded by libraries, that libraries are free to put on


their shelves in the form of books anytime they want.


It -- the -- the position of the district court


and the position of the appellees is that the libraries,


by doing this, violate the First Amendment right of their


patrons. 


I don't think that would be an issue in that 

context, and we're suggesting that the patrons have a


right to Internet access anywhere they want outside the


federally subsidized library. 


And the library has several choices it may make


here.  The library might not have Internet.  Maybe it's


not appropriate for that particular library.  The library


may have Internet with the filtering and accept Federal


money with respect to putting in the computers.  Or the


library --


QUESTION:  Could the library do this?  Could the

library say, okay, we're -- we're certainly going to


comply with the statute for the library, but we are going


to -- we are going to establish -- or the city says, we


will establish a separate office?  It's called the -- the


computer viewing office.  It has a separate budget from


the library.  It's in a separate building.  It has a


separate staff.  Administratively it's different.  And


with respect to the computers in -- in that establishment,


we're not going to ask for any Federal subsidies and the


computers are going to be wide open.  Any reason they


couldn't do it?


MR. OLSON:  I -- I think they could.  They could


either have a separate branch where separate Federal funds


are not being obtained, or you're talking about a separate


administrative ability --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. OLSON:  -- facility.  I don't -- I don't


believe that the statute would prohibit that set of


operations.


QUESTION:  Yes, but it would apply if they had,


say, ten computers and nine of them were financed by the


Federal subsidy and one of them was independently


financed.  That one would be covered by the statute.


MR. OLSON:  Yes, it would, Justice Stevens,


although --

 QUESTION:  And if you rely on the -- on the

how does that justification apply to that tenth computer?


MR. OLSON:  Because it's a reasonable condition


to the operation of the funds.  In the first place,


Justice Stevens, in -- the Internet is going to come


through one opening, and the -- the various different


computers will be plugged up to that one opening so that

is it's -- the -- the library would have to decide --


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you could have it on a


separate phone line, it seems to me. 


MR. OLSON:  Yes, the library could do that sort


of thing, but it would --


QUESTION: 


The statute would still apply. 

MR. OLSON:  Yes, it would.  Yes, it would.


QUESTION:  And how do you justify that under the


Spending Clause? 


MR. OLSON:  We believe that it's a reasonable


condition that Congress reasonably -- the patrons may not


be able to distinguish where the --


QUESTION:  Well, wouldn't it be equally


unreasonable if we said it applies to separate facilities


too?  I don't know why -- I don't understand the


distinction between a branch library that has one computer

in it and a big central library with 10 computers, one of


which is separately financed.


MR. OLSON:  Well, again, as we said in our


briefs, that to the extent that that is an issue, it


should be made -- that point should be made in a -- in an


as-applied challenge to the statute, as opposed to a


challenge on the face.  We don't think it's


technologically going to be a problem and we do think that


Congress can reasonably have assumed we're using Federal


money to finance Internet in this library.  Patrons are


going to be exposed.  If you're going to take the money,


we would like patrons not to be exposed in this manner to


that material, and the Congress could well have decided


that it -- the taxpayers don't want to be associated with


a subsidy of that types of material -- that type of 

material which has traditionally been excluded from the


libraries in any event.


QUESTION:  Well, you're saying not only that


they -- that they don't want to be associated with the


subsidizing of it, but they -- you're saying they don't


want to subsidize an operation which includes some non-


subsidized material of this sort.  Don't you have to say


that in --


MR. OLSON:  I -- well, I think that that would


be a reasonable choice for Congress to make.

 QUESTION:  You say they've made it.


MR. OLSON:  Well, with respect to all of the


computers in the library in -- in that narrow context,


yes, but I do think that that's the -- we're getting down


to the refinements of particular applications and those


types of challenges have not yet been made.


QUESTION:  General Olson, the words of the


statute itself, though -- there is some ambiguity.  It's


-- with regard to disabling the filter, the words are for


bona fide research or other lawful use.  And am I right in


thinking that your prior answer meant other lawful use


means anything?  So, in effect, for an adult anything but


obscenity would be a lawful use.


MR. OLSON:  I believe that that's -- that's --


well, child pornography would also be excluded.  Both


obscenity and child pornography --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. OLSON:  -- there are Federal criminal


statutes with respect to both of those.  And -- and again,


this is a reasonable effort by the library -- by the


Congress to make rational decisions with respect to


allowing for some escape for people who are doing research


or for other appropriate purposes. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but -- but how would that


authorize the unblocking entirely which would let in not

just the material that's useful for research, but also


obscenity, also child pornography?  How is that allowing a


-- a lawful use?  That's allowing an unlawful use, isn't


it?


MR. OLSON:  Well, I -- I agree with that, but --


QUESTION:  So if you agree with it, it means


that -- that --


MR. OLSON:  If -- if -- excuse me, Justice


Scalia. 


QUESTION:  No.  I think if you agree with it, it


-- it means that you can't unblock a whole channel.  You


can say, I'll let you have this material, but I can't


unblock this channel.


MR. OLSON:  The -- the --


QUESTION: 


God knows what else there is out 

there. 


MR. OLSON:  The statute put it in terms of bona


fide research or other lawful purposes.  That -- there's


bound to be some interpretive -- given the joints there. 


And again, to the extent that that would trigger a funding


decision with respect to the enforcement authority or


something, that's appropriately raised in an as-applied


challenge. 


I think it's important to stress the converse of


what the appellees are asking for here.  They're asking

this Court to make a judgment that the First Amendment


prohibits them from exercising the discretion to make that


kind of choice with respect to the Internet that they've


always made or traditionally made with respect to the


books on their shelf.


The consequence of that, it seems to me, would


be strict scrutiny applicable to librarians' judgments


with respect to not just the Internet, but microfilm,


television, other medium that might -- other media that


might come into the library, and that librarians, instead


of spending money on books, are going to be spending money


on lawyers defending cases brought by authors saying, you


-- you violated my First Amendment right not to have


strict scrutiny, and that instead of librarians making


these --


QUESTION:  But, General Olson, Justice White


wrote a number of opinions in the First Amendment area


where he started out saying, this is a case about


billboards, or this is a case about something else.  I


would think this is a case about the Internet.  It's not a


case about books.


MR. OLSON:  Well, it might be if the decision


was written that way, Justice Stevens, but if -- if the


appellees are right, the types of decisions that


librarians have been making, appropriateness is -- is the

word, quality, appropriateness, and appropriate decisions


-- it's -- it's in the record.  Those types of decisions


the librarians are saying -- asking this Court to say are


subject to strict scrutiny and violate the Constitution. 


This Court would have to make a First Amendment


distinction between the selection of a book and the


selection of another source of information. 


QUESTION:  But isn't there a practical


distinction that's got to be taken into consideration in


your argument?  And that is, not every library can have


every book.  Something has got to be excluded.  So we


start with the assumption that the librarians have got to


make these judgments.  We don't start with that assumption


in the case of the Internet at all.


And the question in the case of the Internet is 

the different one.  Can you require them to exclude


certain materials that it would be illegal for them to


have as -- as an abstract matter?  Sure, I suppose. 


But the -- the tough question is, can you


require them necessarily to exclude a great deal more


about which they make no decision whatsoever and which


would be perfectly legal for them to have?


MR. OLSON:  Justice Scalia -- I mean, Justice

MR. OLSON:  Nothing is being required of the


library.  The library, if it chooses --


QUESTION:  If -- if they want them.  But you're


-- but you're right, sure.


MR. OLSON:  If it wants to. 


But the case comes to this Court in the posture


that the district court has held and the appellees are 

arguing that for the library voluntarily to make that


choice on their own, irrespective of any Federal


Government subsidy or anything, would violate the First


Amendment rights of their patrons.


QUESTION:  General Olson, what does the record


disclose is the percentage of lawful material that is


excluded under these software programs as opposed to


material that is unlawful for the library to --


MR. OLSON:  Well, the -- the testimony was


varied, Justice O'Connor.  One of the -- one of the

findings of the district court was that tens of thousands


of pages of material may be erroneously blocked.  Now, the


problem with that is that different filters might block


different things.  Sites may be unblocked.  The filter may


be set aside.  But even if it's tens of thousands of the


-- of the 2 billion pages of material that is on the


Internet, we're talking about one two-hundredths of 1


percent, even if it's 100,000, of materials would be


blocked. 


If it -- if it please the Court, I would like to


reserve the remainder of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, General Olson.


Mr. Smith, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. SMITH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


The Children's Internet Protection Act is


unconstitutional for two separate reasons. 


First, the act does require libraries accepting


Federal funds to engage in conduct that is itself at least


presumptively unconstitutional.  Strict scrutiny does


apply, we say, because the --


QUESTION:  What -- what cases are you relying on


to say that the libraries would be required to engage in

-- in conduct that is presumptively unconstitutional? 


MR. SMITH:  This Court's whole series of cases


involving the public forum doctrine, Your Honor, which I


noticed was -- was not really mentioned by my colleague,


Mr. Olson.


The Internet, when it comes into the library, is


-- all of the information available on the Internet, as


diverse as human thought -- immediately available to the


patron.  It is the most pure form of public forum that you


can possibly imagine. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but it begs the question.  The


-- the point is that the Government is saying, if you want


to get our money, you don't let it all come in.  So it is


not -- it is not a public forum once -- once the -- once


the blocking is applied. 


MR. SMITH:  Well, Your Honor, the whole question


about whether the library could do it this way depends on


how you view the public forum doctrine.  And the -- what


the Court has said again and again is in deciding whether


something is or is not a public forum, you look at whether


the access is selective or general.  That -- that's what


the terminology was in the Court's case --


QUESTION:  You're not relying, at any rate, on


cases dealing with libraries as such. 


MR. SMITH:  No.  No, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  You're relying on a more general --


MR. SMITH:  Applying the Court's general


holdings in -- in a whole series of cases to try to decide


whether this is a public forum, a designated public forum,


created --


QUESTION:  You conclude that -- you conclude


that a library is a designated public forum.


MR. SMITH:  The Internet terminals in the


library are a designated public forum, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Not the whole library?


MR. SMITH:  Certainly not.  We do not say that


strict scrutiny applies to the decisions that the library


makes about which book to buy because when the library


buys books, it chooses books one by one.  It engages in


selective access as opposed to general access. 

With the Internet, on the other hand, the entire


world of -- of content that is on the Internet is there


available to the patrons.  It has not been selected --


QUESTION:  Not --


MR. SMITH:  -- by the library in any way. 


QUESTION:  Not necessarily.  I mean, a library


says -- and some have -- some did this before -- before


the Federal statute was in effect.  A library says,


there's this whole wide world of the Internet out there,


but we don't want all of it.  Some of it is garbage, and

therefore we're going to block the obscenity.  We're going


to block the child pornography, and we're going to block


the -- the pornography that's harmful to children.  Now,


once they've made that decision, hey, presto, it is not a


public forum anymore.


MR. SMITH:  That -- that -- with respect,


Justice Scalia, the way the public forum doctrine works in


our judgment -- and we're basing this as -- as close as we


can on this Court's cases -- is that the one thing that


Government can't do is allow all content under the sun,


not even knowing what content is there, and then exclude,


cull out one area of disfavored content.  If -- if you say


that that exclusion, that -- that pointing at that one


particular area of content and excluding it, is the same


as not making it a public forum, then -- then the public 

forum doctrine no longer has any meaning.


QUESTION:  Is it also a public forum if it's a


public school library?


MR. SMITH:  The -- the case of a public school


library is a -- is a more difficult case.


QUESTION:  I just want a yes or no answer.  On


your theory is it or is it not a public forum if it's in a


public school library?


MR. SMITH:  I think, Your Honor, I can't give


you a yes or no answer.

policies are of the school --


QUESTION:  No, no.  Exactly everything is the


same.  I just want to know on your theory of the public


forum doctrine is the 10th grade library or in an


elementary school or a high school -- they have -- they do


exactly what the libraries do here.  Is it a public forum?


MR. SMITH:  Then I -- then I do say it's a


public forum, Your Honor.  If they allow students --


QUESTION:  All right.  So on your theory of the


case --


MR. SMITH:  Yes. 


QUESTION: 


-- then if it is a public forum, the 

elementary school, Addison Hill Elementary School, has to


let the worst possible pornography go over the computers


that come into the public school library.


MR. SMITH:  Certainly not, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Because? 


MR. SMITH:  Certainly not. 


QUESTION:  That's what I want my answer to --


MR. SMITH:  First of all, all that holding that


it's a public forum does is -- is give you the level of


scrutiny that applies to the rule.  Then you have to look

at the rule, apply the usual standards of narrow


tailoring, less restrictive alternatives, compelling


interests --


QUESTION:  No.  We make all those same arguments


that you've just made and say, look, there would be all


these other alternatives and all -- all the -- I'm -- I'm


just -- I'm not putting a -- I'm putting a difficult --


what to me is -- is a difficult problem with your


doctrine.  And I -- I want to see how it works here.


MR. SMITH:  But I think the Constitution


analysis may well come out differently with respect to


young children, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Well, but I -- I need to know fairly


specifically because I don't want if there -- if -- to me


frankly if -- if your theory of it means that every public 

school has to have a computer attachment which bring this


material into the school, I suppose a lot of schools


wouldn't have computers at all in their libraries.  And --


and that is worrying me.  So I'd appreciate --


MR. SMITH:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- a fairly definite answer on this. 


MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, I think that -- that,


first of all, classrooms are different from libraries even


in the school context because a school classroom --


library -- a computer is obviously not used for

independent research.  If the -- in the library situation


in the school, you would have different age groups.  You'd


have different considerations.  You'd have different


policies.  There's a lot of different things that could be


distinguished from this case. 


And I think it -- it's important --


QUESTION:  So your answer is that in your


opinion now you think it probably would be constitutional


as applied to school libraries but not as to public


libraries? 


MR. SMITH:  It -- it may well be, Your Honor,


depending on the age group, depending on the


circumstances, depending on the way the -- the library is


used by the students. 


QUESTION: 


Mr. Smith, why shouldn't we be 

conscious of the holding of this Court in Denver Area v.


the FCC where the Court concluded it might be premature to


apply forum analysis due to changes taking place in the


law, the technology, and the industrial structure related


to telecommunications?  I mean, this too seems to me an


area for caution, is it not, in importing wholesale public


forum analysis in the library?


MR. SMITH:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  I would think Denver Area would have


some bearing on that.

 MR. SMITH:  Denver Area has a substantial


bearing and I think it's one of the strongest cases


supporting our position.  It is true that the Court did


not go -- it -- the -- the plurality opinion in -- in the


case did not go so far as to say we're going to apply a


public forum analysis and strict scrutiny, but -- but


Justice Breyer's opinion went much -- very close to that


and said we're going to apply very heightened scrutiny. 


We're going to look very carefully at this.


And this was a law that is in many ways closely


analogous to what's going on here.  It was a law that


said, we have a public access station.  Anybody from the


outside world can come in and put whatever programming


they want on that station, but we're going to exclude


indecency, just that one area of content, because we don't 

think that belongs in the home.


QUESTION:  But the -- the other part -- assuming


it's some kind of stricter than just reasonable, however


that is brought about, the -- I'm very much concerned also


about something Justice Kennedy raised.  If all that this


statute means is that a person who wants access to the


10,000 deep -- whatever it's called -- what's the -- some


special word.  It's -- it's deeply like Star Wars almost. 


It's some kind of like an extra galaxy that's very hard to


get to.

 All right.  These 10,000 pages which now were


blocked -- what he has to do -- that person -- is he goes


to the desk and says, please unblock it.  I want to use --


I want to do research and this is blocking things that I


want.  I'm not going to look at material that is


absolutely unlawful, such as this very obscene material,


child pornography.  And then the library is free -- will


say, fine.


MR. SMITH:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Now, if all that's necessary, you


have to go to the desk, what is the great burden on


speech?  After all, I grew up in a world where they used


to keep certain materials in a special place in the


library and you had to go and ask for them.  So?


MR. SMITH: 


Well, Your Honor, the -- the way the 

disabling provision is set up, first of all, is it's


designed to give the library some job to determine whether


your purpose is bona fide or not.  It says bona fide


research or other lawful purpose.  So the first problem is


you go to the librarian's supervisor who has the authority


under the statute to turn off the filter and you have to


explain to them what your purpose is to look at the --


QUESTION:  General Olson said no, you don't have


to explain.


MR. SMITH:  Well, the -- the statute on the face

of it says the library is required to inquire into your


purpose and make a decision about whether it is a bona


fide research purpose or other lawful purpose for looking


at the material which has been filtered out by the -- by


the filter.


So you have a discretion problem of severe


proportions, I submit.  Plus, you have a stigma problem,


very much like the one --


QUESTION:  But not if you read other lawful


purpose to mean everything except the specific categories,


child pornography, obscenity.


MR. SMITH:  They will presumably have to have


some information about what sites you're interested in


looking at in order to determine whether that would be


lawful or not. 


So they will then have to inquire into, 

well, what's -- what is it you need to get that's being


blocked?  Why are you looking at it?  Is it lawful?


QUESTION:  It doesn't say that in the statute. 


All it says in the statute is that the administrator may


disable a technology protection to enable access for a


lawful purpose.  So why couldn't you just sign a piece of


paper saying I do not want to use this for an unlawful


purpose?  Period.  End of the matter.  What in the statute


prevents the library from accepting that?


MR. SMITH:  Well, clearly the library is

explanation, you still have the problem that you're going


up to the -- to the librarian and saying please turn off


the smut filter.  I need to get access to some material. 


So that -- that you're being required to do that.  There's


a stigma problem very much like --


QUESTION:  Is there any other problem? 


MR. SMITH:  There's a third problem, which is


you have -- a lot of times this will only come up in the


middle of your research session.  You won't know that


you're going to be blocked getting access to the


Republican National Committee site or to the site for some 

orphanage that is trying to raise money.  There's -- since


the -- many of the blocks are so irrational, you can't


anticipate it.  So you'll have to stop your session and go


talk to a librarian about getting this thing turned off or


getting this site unblocked.  Somebody will then have to


look at the site --


QUESTION:  But in a library, when you're looking


for a book, it might not be there, and you might have to


go to the librarian and order it or borrow it from another


institution.  I don't think that's atypical of what

happens in research. 


MR. SMITH:  But certainly, Your Honor.  But --


but our submission is that you shouldn't just willy-nilly


compare the Internet in the public library to books and


how they're handled by libraries because the Internet is a


public forum.  It is all of this content that has not been


prescreened or preselected by the Government which they


are making available to you --


QUESTION:  But in this context, perhaps we


should not import public forum analysis.  It creates lots


of problems --


MR. SMITH:  Well, perhaps --


QUESTION:  -- for instance, in public schools,


as has already been discussed.  So it's -- and there is no


case from this Court saying that having an Internet in a 

library creates a public forum.  That's what we're here to


decide I think. 


MR. SMITH:  Indeed, Your Honor.  And -- and the


Court has repeatedly cautioned that when you're making a


decision about whether something is a public forum, you


have to look at the particular medium of communication


that is at issue, not the broader context.


So, for example, when the Court in Cornelius was


looking at the Combined Federal Campaign and trying to


decide whether that was a public forum, the Government

said, well, it's the Federal work force.  The Federal work


force is not a public forum.  But the Court said, no, we


have to look and see what kinds of people have been given


access to the Combined Federal Campaign and allowed to


solicit funding from the Federal -- the Federal workers


and has it been done on a selective basis or a general


basis.  Because it was selective, the Court ultimately


determined that it's not a public forum.


It may well be that --


QUESTION:  Well, if you say that the world we


look at is the people using these programs under the


Federal law requirements in libraries, then it isn't a


public forum.


MR. SMITH:  Well, Your Honor, if you allow the


Government to define its forum as all content under sun --

under the sun ever invented by mankind except the piece


that they don't like, then I submit that -- that will be


the end of the public forum doctrine because there will


never be any situation in which the Government will be


constrained in any way to censor out a particular piece of


content that it -- from the public forum.


QUESTION:  Designated public forum doctrine.


MR. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Traditional public forums will always


be public forums.

 MR. SMITH:  Right, but I'm -- we're here in the


context of designated public forums.  And if you allow


content --


QUESTION:  I've always had trouble with that


doctrine anyway. 


MR. SMITH:  If -- if you allow the content --


(Laughter.) 


MR. SMITH:  -- to be defined as everything but,


that's okay.  Then there -- there is no doctrine.


QUESTION:  So -- so a -- a library that chooses


not to get the Internet at all is not a public forum. 


It's only when it gets Internet terminals that it becomes


a public forum?


MR. SMITH:  Well, and it -- and then it has to


make another decision. 


Is it going to just turn the 

Internet on or is it going to do what it could do, which


is to say we are going to treat websites like we treat


books.  We're going to look at them one by one and decide


whether they should be available, whether they meet our


collection development policies. 


QUESTION:  But I thought -- you said there are


two reasons why you should prevail, and we're still on the


first. 


MR. SMITH:  I appreciate that, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  But -- but you -- you said at the --


at the outset that it would be -- as I understood it, that


it would be unconstitutional for you to do this on your


own initiative.  And now you're saying that you could? 


MR. SMITH:  No, no, no.  It would be -- it would


trigger strict scrutiny for a library to do exactly what


the statute requires.  That's our submission, which is to


say if they allow the whole Internet in except this one


piece of content under the public forum doctrine -- or


perhaps the Court wants to apply the kind of public forum


doctrine light of the whole question of whether --


QUESTION:  I just want to be -- I just want to


be clear.  Suppose this is a general public library.


MR. SMITH:  Yes, sir. 


QUESTION: 


Could it voluntarily do exactly what 

the statute tells it it must do?


MR. SMITH:  Our position is that that would


trigger strict scrutiny that they would then have to


satisfy and --


QUESTION:  Well, and how would the strict


scrutiny come out? 


MR. SMITH:  Excuse me?  Well, in -- in most, if


not all, cases it would come out against it.  It would be


unconstitutional, clearly, because they're blocking a vast


amount of speech that is not even sexually explicit.  And

so we have a narrow tailoring problem.  And there are much


more -- much more effective, less restrictive alternatives


which we had all this evidence at trial about.


QUESTION:  And that -- and that is -- and that


is because legally you would be a state entity denying


access to a designated forum to a -- a listener who is a


member of the public.


MR. SMITH:  Exactly, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


QUESTION:  What was your --


QUESTION:  What if the -- what if the facts were


changed in this way?  The library -- I'm sorry.  Did I --


no.  Please go ahead. 


QUESTION:  No.  I think we're still pursuing the


first --


the --


MR. SMITH:  Yes.  I'm trying to make sure I get


QUESTION:  Sooner or later, I want you to get to


the second --


MR. SMITH:  I appreciate it, Your Honor. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Okay.  One last question before you


get to the second one. 


What if the library said, we're not letting in


the whole Internet?  We think there are some sites that it

would be valuable for our research patrons to have.  We're


going to -- we're simply going to select 100 websites or


1,000 out of the millions that are there and we're going


to let them in.  Would that be a violation of designated


public forum?


MR. SMITH:  Clearly not, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. SMITH:  There's no -- there's no argument


that we -- we'd make that that would be unconstitutional. 


They would then be letting them in as they would books,


using their collection development policies, deciding


what's valuable, and that would not be a violation.


QUESTION:  But -- but how did -- I mean, it's


fine to say it's no violation of the Constitution.  But


you're also saying yet it remains a designated public 

forum.


MR. SMITH:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Oh, it -- you agree it would not be a


designated public forum.


MR. SMITH:  Absolutely not.  If they're not


letting everybody in, as -- as general access.  They're


exercising selective access. 


QUESTION:  But don't -- don't many libraries


already exclude, for example, chat rooms?


MR. SMITH:  It's not a question of exclusion.

It's a question of affirmative inclusion through


selection --


QUESTION:  No, no.  I mean, but -- but my


understanding was that some libraries that -- that have


access to the Web do not allow access to chat rooms.  They


don't think that that's a proper library -- library


function or whatever.  At least as to those libraries, I


assume you would acknowledge that there's no designated


public forum.


MR. SMITH:  No, Your Honor.  We don't


acknowledge that excluding --


QUESTION:  I didn't think you would.


MR. SMITH:  -- excluding an area of content can


take it out of the forum doctrine.


Let me get to my second point, though, which --

which is --


QUESTION:  When you start on your second point,


let me just ask you to comment on one thing because I want


to be -- I want the Solicitor General also to comment on


the same thing.  Do you think, given the state of the


record now, if we agreed with the Government's submission


that the district court's rationale was wrong, would it be


proper for us to decide to rule on the second theory?


MR. SMITH:  Oh, clearly, Your Honor.  I don't


think there are any -- any facts that it would be

necessary for the Court that haven't been brought out in


that -- that trial and that lengthy opinion. 


Now, our position with respect to point two


is --


QUESTION:  What is point two?


MR. SMITH:  It is that libraries --


(Laughter.) 


MR. SMITH:  -- even -- even if the Internet is


precisely analogous to books in the library context, that


something about the library context lets librarians in the


exercise of professional judgment that they ordinarily


exercise, even in deciding to edit the Internet, that the


Federal Government under the First Amendment has no


business using the spending power to try to distort that


medium and push librarians away from their professional 

judgment toward the most restrictive possible policy on


information flow into the library setting. 


In other words, our second point is that a


library is very much like a public university which this


Court has several times indicated is a -- is a special


sphere set off for the governmental promotion of private


and free expression, that in that kind of a setting, the


Federal Government should not use the spending power to


impose a one-size-fits-all policy about --


QUESTION:  Is this a federalism concept and you

-- and you would cite our cases like Printz and so forth?


MR. SMITH:  No, Your Honor.  I'm citing only


First Amendment cases.  I believe it is a First Amendment


concept that there are certain kinds of relationships or


certain kinds of institutions in which the amount of


speech that is being allowed is decided by the people who


are designated as professionals to run that institution. 


For example --


QUESTION:  So -- so your argument would be the


same if the -- if the State of California were doing it. 


It's not just the Federal Government. 


MR. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor. 


If it was done by statute.  But -- but, for


example, professors should set the curriculum at a public


university. 


I don't think that the Congress can say to 

the universities of this country, we've given you money, 


you therefore have to cut your departments.  If you -- if


you take the money --


QUESTION:  How about -- can the board of regents


set the curriculum?


MR. SMITH:  I think it -- when you get to the


people who run the -- run the university as their job,


that's fine, yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  I mean, that's pretty far-reaching. 


It's very interesting.  But the -- the question -- I'm --

I don't suppose you object to the Federal Government


saying, even if it's money to be spent on books, you


cannot spend this money for material that it is unlawful


for the student to see, such as child pornography.  Are


you objecting to that?  Suppose the Federal Government


were to say, no child pornography.


MR. SMITH:  Certainly not, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Certainly not, okay.  So then what


you're objecting to is we let them cut that stuff out, but


you're objecting to the requirement of a particular


technology where the technology may exclude some other


things. 


MR. SMITH:  Well --


QUESTION:  That's your objection. 


MR. SMITH: 


-- first of all, let me address the 

book question.  What this law is analogous to is, as


applied to the book context, a law where the Government


says we're going to help you buy books.  Here's 10 percent


of your book budget a year, and it doesn't just say you


can't spend our money on books of a particular content. 


It says you can't have in your library books of a


particular content.  It starts to try to invade the


professional judgments of librarians about what books


would need to be to their patrons.


And we have here a situation where 93 percent of

the libraries have made a more liberal, more open policy


decision than the one that the Congress favors, and


they're now using the spending power to push them in --


QUESTION:  Well, what if -- what if the Federal


Government said, we're going to give you 10 percent of


your annual appropriation and you can't use that money to


acquire a particular class of books? 


MR. SMITH:  I think as long as it was viewpoint


neutral, Your Honor, and otherwise a legitimate line, that


would be not a problem.  But -- but here --


QUESTION:  Well, supposing you -- you can't use


it to acquire soft pornography.


MR. SMITH:  To the extent one could define that


concept, I think that generally the Government -- the


Court has said the Government can decide what -- what the 

money that it uses to subsidize the -- the local


government with -- what it will be spent on, but it can't,


I think, then expand the subsidy into attempting to


regulate things like the other book decisions that the


library might make.


QUESTION:  Well, even in areas where it's


already against the law to have materials that are obscene


or harmful to minors?  You think the Government has no


authority to prohibit its aid to be used for that?


MR. SMITH:  Of course not, Your Honor.

Certainly the Government can say that you shouldn't make


available materials to people that -- that -- for whom


they have no constitutional right to see them, obscenity


for adults --


QUESTION:  Right.  Now, should we make any


allowance here?  Is there any leeway, if you will, simply


because the technology is not yet available to filter


perfectly where it's evident that there isn't a huge


percentage amount of things that are being excluded, but


the software isn't perfect? 


MR. SMITH:  Well --


QUESTION:  Should -- should our doctrine take


that into account, do you suppose?


MR. SMITH:  If -- if I might, just in answer to


that question, Your Honor, take a moment to describe what 

-- what it really is that the record shows about how these


filters operate because I -- I think that that's really


very helpful. 


What these -- these filters are, are lists of --


of sites that are banned for access in the -- in the


setting where they're -- where they're in effect, and the


-- the findings are that there's about 100,000 sexually


explicit sites on the Internet at the time of trial.  And


so we can assume that some high percentage of that 100,000


are on the list, 90,000 perhaps, because there were some

that they missed constantly. 


Now, in addition, the court found that the --


the very same list blocks at least tens of thousands of


additional sites that are not sexually explicit at all or,


if they have sexually explicit materials, are educational. 


They -- they teach people about gay sexuality or they


teach them about safe sex techniques.  And so we have --


on these lists is a proportion, a huge proportion, perhaps


25, perhaps 50 percent of the sites that are blocked that


are not illegal even for children. 


Now, of the 90,000 or so that are blocked that


are sexually explicit, there isn't a shred of evidence in


this trial record that the Government attempted to put in


about whether any of those are obscene.  There was no


showing of any kind that the filters ever actually find 

speech that is illegal for adults.  And there's good


reason to think that there isn't a lot of it on there


because clearly illegal material is distributed in a


different way than the -- than the way that would allow


the filtering --


QUESTION:  Mr. Smith, you used -- you said


perhaps 50 percent.  This -- and General Olson said tens


of thousands of pages, but consider the --


MR. SMITH:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- in relation to the Internet.

 In this record, at least in this opinion, this


was the finding made more often than any other by that


three-judge court, but every time they used the word


substantial -- and they don't give us any 50 percent. 


Substantial over-blocking is the word that's come up over


and over again.  I think you must have said it in at least


a dozen findings. 


MR. SMITH:  If I could -- if I could address


that, Your Honor.  The -- the court did say at least tens


of thousands and they used the word pages at that point. 


But it's quite evident, if you look at the way they were


reasoning from the evidence, that they meant sites.  And


the evidence is that there's about 11 million websites on


the Internet, in -- in the accessible part of the Internet


and that 100,000 of those are the sexually explicit ones 

and that the -- there are at least tens of thousands more


that are on the list. 


So it's -- the Government also says in their


brief that about one percent of the Internet is over-


blocked, which would be about 100,000 sites. 


So it is a substantial percentage.  It is also a


substantial amount.  And most importantly, it's a very


large percentage of what they're blocking is not what they


intend to block.

 QUESTION:  Oh, you mean the Government --


QUESTION:  -- can I ask you a question about --


about the public forum doctrine?  As I understood your


earlier answer, the Internet is not a public forum if a


library does not take all of it and chooses to exclude


chat boxes.


MR. SMITH:  No, that is not my answer.


QUESTION:  Oh, that isn't your answer.


MR. SMITH:  No.  Our answer is --


QUESTION:  It -- it remains a designated public


forum even if you don't take all of it, you say.  Chat


rooms.  We don't want them.


MR. SMITH:  The way for it not to be a public


forum is for them to decide affirmatively what they do


want to include, not simply to say we'll take the -- the 

content of 400 million people contributing to the


Internet, but we'll carve out one thing.  If you allow


that, then there is no designated public forum doctrine,


and the Court has repeatedly said the distinction between


a public forum and not is whether or not there's been


selective access, which -- by which it means case by


case --


QUESTION:  Why isn't that selective access?  I


-- we don't want chat rooms.  And it's not a total free-


for-all, anybody wants to come in and talk.  No, we don't

want chat rooms.


MR. SMITH:  Maybe chat rooms are okay because


the question is whether that's a content-based exclusion. 


But clearly, here you have a content-based exclusion. 


QUESTION:  It isn't content-based.  No.  Okay. 


It's not a content-based --


MR. SMITH:  And it --


QUESTION:  Now, so if they say no chat rooms, it


doesn't become a designated public forum.


Why does it remain a designated public forum if


what they say is, in addition to chat rooms, we don't want


that portion of the Internet that runs a risk of bringing


into our computers obscenity, child pornography, material


harmful to children?  We don't -- I don't really know what


it is but it's not worth it to us. 


So we don't want chat 

rooms and we don't want this -- you say it's over-


inclusive.  It's not over-inclusive.  It's whatever it


takes to keep out of what we're bringing into our library


those harmful materials.  Now, why does that mean I've


created a public forum?


MR. SMITH:  The fact that they may -- may or may


not think they have a good reason for doing it can't


factor into the analysis, Your Honor.  The way the -- the


public forum doctrine works is you look at whether or not


they -- they have allowed access generally or not, and if

they have allowed access generally and then they say, but


we don't want this, then that's a violation or at least it


triggers strict scrutiny.


QUESTION:  And that would also be a violation if


the Government paid for 100 percent of the cost of the


computer, both the hardware and the monthly billing for


the Internet.


MR. SMITH:  Yes, because it lets in everything


in the world.  Every commercial site, every catalog,


everybody's personal website, and a million other things I


can't even conjure up are all being allowed in and


provided to people in that setting.  And then they're


saying, except you can't have this.


Now, if that's permitted under the forum


doctrine, how can Southeastern Promotions be right where 

they said you can have any -- any play except Hair?  We


don't like Hair.


QUESTION:  Well, you can have it.  You just have


to go up to the desk and ask for it.


MR. SMITH:  And you have to deal with exactly


the -- the discretion of -- of the librarian and about


whether or not he or she is going to allow you -- allow


it.  You have to deal with the stigma, and you have to


take the time out from your research session to go do that


if it turns out in the middle of your research session

that -- that some site that you need to go to.  And you


have to decide to do it not seeing the site because you


can't see it to know whether it's valuable to you.  So


when you're surfing the Internet, the vastly more likely


outcome will be that anything that's blocked people will


just bypass and go on to something else.


QUESTION:  What would your response be if -- if


you start where Mr. Olson started and said, you don't have


to go through all of this?  All you have to do is walk up


to the librarian and say, I'm an adult.  I want it


unblocked.  And it will be unblocked.  Where -- where does


that leave your position?


MR. SMITH:  Well, it's not clear that the


librarian would say yes.  The librarian certainly doesn't


have to say yes.


QUESTION:  I -- I think Mr. Olson's suggestion


was that the librarian, absent some extraneous reason,


would say yes.  So -- so let's add that to the mix.  The


librarian says yes, unblock.  What is -- where's your


position? 


MR. SMITH:  It seems he's on a horn -- the horns


of a dilemma.  Either that is something that has got a lot


of stigma to it that very few people are going to do, so


it has the -- the effect of suppressing speech, or


everybody --

 QUESTION:  Is that your position --


MR. SMITH:  That is my position.


QUESTION:  -- that even to do that would be


stigma?


MR. SMITH:  Yes.


QUESTION:  So that doesn't solve the problem. 


MR. SMITH:  Sure.  You've got to go up and say


please turn off the porn filter, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  That isn't what he says.


MR. SMITH:  Well, that's what it is.


QUESTION:  He says, look, you block a lot of


stuff.  Just please unblock it.


MR. SMITH:  Well, if it turns out that people


wouldn't be stigmatized by that -- and I think the court


below was correct to conclude that they will be -- then --

then there's the second problem, which is what -- what is


the purpose that you've accomplished by requiring people


to go through this meaningless exercise other than to


deter them.  That is apparently then the only purpose of


it and --


a child. 


QUESTION:  Well, it distinguishes an adult from


MR. SMITH:  You can do that in many different


ways, Your Honor, that don't require anybody to approach


anybody.  You simply have a -- a card that they put in the

computer that shows their age, and then it gives them


whatever access the library decides is appropriate or


whatever the parents may have decided is appropriate for


the children.  There are many less restrictive


alternatives including use of the filtering technology as


an option, at the parents' option for different ages that


-- that can be considered and which were explored in depth


by the district court, which I must say looked at this


issue very carefully, was very sympathetic to the problems


that arise with the -- with the sexually explicit content.


It said the one thing we can't do is have one


across-the-board answer even in one library, especially


nationally, to have Congress which has no knowledge at all


about what conditions may prevail in any given library,


saying, well, we're going to push you, through the 

budgetary process, toward our position even though 93


percent of the librarians have found a much more suitable


set of solutions in less restrictive, somewhat more


subtle, more mixed policies than the one that Congress


decided in its wisdom it should try to force on the


library community using the spending power.


QUESTION:  Mr. Smith, this -- this law covers


elementary and secondary schools as well, but this


challenge relates only to libraries.


MR. SMITH:  Only to public libraries, Your

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Smith.


General Olson, you have 5 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. OLSON:  I would like to invite the Court's


attention to page 37a of the appendix to the


jurisdictional statement which is the decision of the


court below.  In the first full paragraph, the court found


approximately 95 percent of libraries with public Internet


access have some form of acceptable use policy or Internet


use policy governing patrons' use of the Internet. 


Now, what the libraries are saying here is the


exercise of certain discretion violates the First


Amendment rights of their patrons, and therefore every 

time they exercise that type of discretion in this


context, they're subject to strict scrutiny. 


What this statute does is gives the libraries


the right, if they choose to accept Federal funds, to make


what kind of decisions, to exclude pornography which


there's no dispute in the record libraries have, from time


immemorial, chosen not to put in their libraries.  So the


decision that they're making is the same one they have


already voluntarily made over the years.


It would inhibit their decisions to exclude

e-mail, chat, gambling, dating services, and the other


things that this part of the court below's decision held


that they are doing already.  It's the traditional type of


discretion that libraries have exercised with respect to


whether they be -- want to be a fiction library or a


library that's specializing in this or that or technology


or anything along those lines.  So the type of discretion


that the librarians are saying violate their First


Amendment rights are the types of discretion precisely


that they've been exercising for years.


QUESTION:  General Olson, I hate to use part of


your rebuttal time.  But would you tell me whether the


Government thinks we should address the unconstitutional


conditions issue that's discussed at length in the


footnote if we agree with you on your principal 

submission?


MR. OLSON:  I -- we have no problem if the Court


decides it, although it wasn't briefed and it wasn't the


decision below, but we don't think it's remotely possible


for this Court to decide that question in this context


against the Government.  If -- if the libraries are right,


they're saying they don't have a First -- they can't have


it both ways.  They don't have a First Amendment right to


make this discretion -- discretionary decision with


respect to their -- the -- the materials in their library,

and then they turn around and say, allowing us to make


that is an unconstitutional -- or giving us an incentive


to make that very decision is an unconstitutional


condition.


This is a condition that's connected with


libraries' traditional decisions.  It's in an area where


the Government -- the Congress of the United States and


this Court has said the Government has a compelling


governmental interest already.  It's a condition to the


use of the funds.  This is not extracting from libraries


some separate, unconnected decision.  It's connected with


the actual use of the funds. 


And it does not say that libraries may not stock


pornography.  If they want to abandon the years of


tradition of not stocking pornography on their bookshelves 

or in some other form, movies, whatever it might be, they


can still do that without violating this condition. 


So the libraries have plenty of choices.  They


can not accept the public money.  They can accept the


public money and use it in -- in the way that Congress


decided, which is consistent with their traditional


exercise of discretion. 


There's many distinguishing factors between this


case and the cases in -- in which the Court has exercised


-- expressed some concern with respect to the First

Amendment issues here.  It is not -- this case is not a


regulation of speech, but the actions of a Government


acting in a proprietary capacity -- a library to make its


own decisions, deciding what to subsidize, what speech to


have in that library, what speech not to have in that


library. 


The Government is merely -- is making a content


decision, not a viewpoint decision.  There's no contention


that there's a viewpoint decision.  The type of decision


that they say is being forced upon them, which is actually


voluntary, is the same type of decision that libraries --


librarians customarily make. 


The Federal statute and the library policy that


they're complaining about expands information, it doesn't


contract information. 


And this Court said in the Arkansas 

Educational Television case, a jurisprudence that would


result in the constriction of speech, rather than the


expansion of speech, would be a repression of First


Amendment rights.


If Congress can't put this condition --


QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson.
