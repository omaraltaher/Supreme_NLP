CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 00-10666, William Joseph Harris v. the United


States. 


Mr. Ingram.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. INGRAM


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. INGRAM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The petitioner in this case is asking the Court


to rule that the brandish clause of 18 United States Code,


Section 924(c) is an element to be charged and proved


beyond a reasonable doubt and not merely a sentencing


enhancement, based on two separate and independent bases. 


The first is the statutory analysis under Jones v. United


States, and the second basis is the constitutional


analysis under Apprendi v. New Jersey.  And I will address


the Jones argument first. 


The carjacking statute in Jones v. United States


had, as additional elements, serious injury and death,


which the Court held to be additional elements after the


statutory analysis was completed.  And the carjacking


statute in that case and 18 United States Code, section


924(c) in this case are virtually mirror images of each

other structurally and grammatically. 


The Court looked at the text of the statute, the


legislative history behind those facts, and how


legislatures historically had treated those facts in


determining that serious injury and death were, in fact,


elements to be proved and not merely sentencing


enhancements. 


Likewise, we contend that brandish, based on the


-- the text of the statute, the -- how legislatures have


typically treated that fact and the fact that it involves


a mens rea element -- that is, brandish is -- is defined


as displaying or making the presence known of a firearm in


order to intimidate and -- and mens rea has traditionally


been an element -- and then based on the legislative


history that those statutes would lead the Court to


conclude, based on the statutory analysis, that brandish


is in fact an element to be proved and not merely a


sentencing enhancement. 


QUESTION:  But it's not so -- it seems to me


that -- I understand your argument, but it's not so clear


as it was in Jones.  I mean, the difference between use


and brandish is -- is a -- is a smaller difference in


degree.  The difference in the penalties are smaller


differences.  It's just a couple of years, the difference


between 5 and -- and 7, for example.  And -- and I

understand how you can make the argument, but I don't see


the argument as being sort of a slam dunk in the case.


MR. INGRAM:  Your Honor, if I may address each


of those concerns.  The -- first of all, the -- the fact


that the increase under the brandish statute goes from a


mandatory minimum of 5 to a mandatory minimum of -- of 7


not being a steep increase, first of all, it does take the


defendant 40 percent higher for brandishing from 5 to 7,


and -- and it doubles the penalty 100 percent higher for


discharging the firearm, which cannot be divorced from the


brandishing element. 


There are cases from this Court in the context


of ex post facto challenges to application of sentences


that were enacted after the defendant committed the crime,


most particularly Miller v. Florida, the leading case


which we cite in our brief, where the Court held that an


increase in a sentence of anywhere from two to two and a


half years substantially disadvantaged the defendant and


foreclosed the defendant from asking for a lower sentence.


Likewise, in the case of Glover v. United


States, which we do not cite in our brief -- that is at


531 U.S. 198 -- the Court held, in the context of a


challenge of ineffective assistance of counsel, that an


additional guideline sentence under the Federal sentencing


guidelines of anywhere from 6 to 21 months meets the

substantial prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance


of counsel claim.  So, we contend that the increase from 5


to 7 years is in fact a -- a substantial difference. 


The elements in question, comparing serious


bodily injury and death to brandishing, are somewhat


different in that the serious bodily injury and death are


results, whereas brandish and discharge are conduct of the


defendant.  But we contend that the brandish and discharge


being treated more seriously are seeking to address the


same possible results; that is, if a defendant merely


carries a firearm or possesses a firearm, it is far less


likely that serious bodily injury or death will result


than if the defendant brandishes or discharge --


discharges --


QUESTION:  Can I -- can I go to Apprendi? 


Because the -- I want to just focus you a little bit,


assuming you lose on this argument.  I want to know -- and


this is hard for me because I dissented in Apprendi.  I


want to know how you, as a person living with the case,


understands it.


Imagine two statutes.  I just want to know if


you think Apprendi applies to the second of the two


statutes.  The first statute says the sentence is up to 10


years for robbery, but if a gun is discharged, up to 15. 


There's no question that Apprendi applies to that second.

Doesn't it? 


MR. INGRAM:  I agree with that. 


QUESTION:  That's what Apprendi is about. 


Now, suppose I take that same statute and I just


rewrite the words as follows.  The maximum for this crime


of robbery is 15, but unless a gun is discharged, you


shall not sentence to more than 10.  Now, is that second


statute treated identically to the first in your


understanding and the understanding of the bar?  That's


what I'm trying to get at. 


MR. INGRAM:  Yes.  My understanding is that


Apprendi would cover the --


QUESTION:  Both. 


MR. INGRAM:  -- latter statute that you have


described. 


QUESTION:  Both.  So, the wording of it doesn't


matter.


not.


MR. INGRAM:  No.  I contend that it -- it does


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, if that's the case,


I'd also like -- and this is my other -- only other


question.  I'd -- I'd like to get your understanding.  The


defense bar, I understand, of which you're an important


part, wants this extended, and my question is why. 


And this is my, why -- what I have trouble

seeing in this.  It seems to me as a practical matter


what's likely to happen is the prosecutor will come in,


and it's primarily about drug cases.  And they'll say,


fine, we'll go to the jury.  You want a trial?  Fine.  You


say you were in Chicago?  Fine.  We say that there were


two kilos of drugs, and then you have to get in front of


the jury and argue my client was in Chicago, but just in


case he happened to be around, there was only one kilo. 


Now, that's impossible for you to argue. 


Now, given that kind of problem, why does the


defense bar, why do you, and why does everyone else -- why


are they so anxious to extend this case?


MR. INGRAM:  Your Honor, that is not a problem


that the defense bar does not already face.  In -- in the


context that you described in a drug case, in Federal


court now the evidence presented at trial will involve


both possession with intent to distribute evidence, as


well as quantity evidence. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but still under the present law,


if you have a good claim as to whether it's one kilo or


two and the evidence is in dispute, you find the guilty


verdict come in.  At that point, you go to the judge and


you say, now, judge, we want -- we want to go into the


evidence here about how much drug there really was.  You


can't do that if you have to do it all at the same time in

front of the jury. 


MR. INGRAM:  As a practical matter, in Federal


court, the -- the Federal judges at sentencing rely on the


trial evidence.  So, a defense attorney knows during trial


that I am hearing evidence about quantity that I want to


dispute because I know it's going to come up later in a


sentencing hearing, but I don't dare do that here because


I am telling the jury that there was no possession at all. 


So, it is a dilemma that we face now and -- and faces


attorneys, for example, in cases where you admit my client


did kill someone, but not with malice aforethought.  Quite


often you do have to negate additional elements, and you


do have that dilemma already.  This would not create any


new dilemma for us. 


QUESTION:  Well, let me rephrase Justice


Breyer's question slightly or -- or make the point that I


think underlies part of his question. 


Apprendi is not a -- true or false?  Apprendi is


not an unmixed blessing for the defense bar.


MR. INGRAM:  I think it can create some


problems, as we just described, but they're not problems


that we don't face in other areas and on other --


QUESTION:  Well, given Apprendi, of course, you


face the problem.  But looking at Apprendi as an original


matter, which we cannot -- which I think we're unlikely to

do, it -- it has -- it imposes some real disadvantages on


defendants, does it not? 


MR. INGRAM:  I do not think they're real


disadvantages.  I think they're just -- they're just some


-- some difficulties that defense attorneys face all the


time. 


QUESTION:  Well, but the case Justice Breyer


puts to you shows a very real difficulty. 


MR. INGRAM:  And as I've described, that is a


difficulty that we face already.  And -- and the


important --


QUESTION:  Because of Apprendi.


MR. INGRAM:  No, Your Honor.  Before Apprendi. 


That problem faced defense attorneys in -- in a number of


contexts.  And -- and we're really more concerned here not


so much with the problems it creates, because they're not


new problems, but with -- with the fact that mandatory


minimums add additional deprivations of liberty that


should be addressed by the jury and found beyond a


reasonable doubt and not -- not left to the discretion of


trial judges, based on the case law of this Court,


including Apprendi itself.


We are relying on the constitutional rule


announced in Apprendi.  Prior to Apprendi, in -- in


McMillan and Patterson, the Court had acknowledged that


10

there were some limits, some constitutional limits to what


a legislature could do in defining the elements of a


crime.  But it -- the Court had never announced exactly


what those limits are.


Now, it is true that Apprendi was limited to an


increase in statutory maximums because that is what the


case was about.  Those were the facts of the case.  But


the constitutional rule that was the underpinning of the


Apprendi holding was that as -- as stated by the majority


in endorsing the concurring opinions in Jones as follows,


it is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from


the jury the assessment of facts that increase the


prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal


defendant is exposed, and equally clear that they must be


proved beyond a reasonable doubt.


So, the constitutional rule of Apprendi was any


fact that increases the range, either the floor or the


ceiling, of the prescribed penalties are constitutionally


elements that must be alleged by the defendant -- by the


prosecution in the charging document and must be proved.


QUESTION:  What about things like the Federal


Sentencing Guidelines which also have the effect of


increasing the range of the penalty within certain limits? 


There are lots of factors there that under the guidelines


the judge would still decide.  Under your argument,

Apprendi would throw all those out.  It has to go to the


jury. 


MR. INGRAM:  I disagree, Your Honor, and --


QUESTION:  Why? 


MR. INGRAM:  -- and I do agree with your


statement that there are lots of things that the


guidelines allow the judges to consider. 


First of all, mandatory minimums are just that. 


They are mandatory.  They do not allow a judge to consider


any mitigating factor, however strongly the judge may --


may believe in those mitigating factors, to go below.  The


sentencing guidelines, first of all, expressly allow the


judge to consider a number of aggravating and mitigating


factors. 


QUESTION:  But they may be unconstitutional


under your theory. 


MR. INGRAM:  They are not because we contend


that the guidelines, unlike mandatory minimums, still


leave the judge with lots of discretion.  In Koon v.


United States, this Court --


QUESTION:  The question is under your theory of


Apprendi, which imposes constitutional limits on


discretion for judges, that can be given to judges, how


many of the sentencing factors are going to fall by the


wayside?

 MR. INGRAM:  I -- I submit that none of them


will because none of those factors mandate a particular


penalty to the exclusion of any mitigating offense.  For


example, under the drug guideline, if the defendant


possessed a firearm, then in a sense a two-level increase


is mandated or called for, but that nevertheless still


allows the judge, without a Koon discretionary


departure --


QUESTION:  Well, that's exactly the kind of


thing that presumably under your argument would have to go


to the jury, whether he possessed a firearm, or the


quantity of drugs involved.


MR. INGRAM:  No, it is not, Your Honor, because


the judge in such a case would still have the ability to


depart, or first of all, to reduce the offense level for


other mitigating facts in the case. 


QUESTION:  You're -- you're saying that just the


level is kind of inchoate until the sentence comes out


because there are other factors that could be applied? 


MR. INGRAM:  The -- the sentencing guideline


range, once established, is mandatory unless and until the


judge determines that there is a legally permissible basis


to depart downward or upward.  And Koon recognized that


there are innumerable bases for allowing the judge to


exercise that discretion.

 QUESTION:  So long as -- so long as the upward

cover it. 


MR. INGRAM:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Or downward, anyway. 


QUESTION:  Oh, I see now. 


QUESTION:  Downward or upward?  Or upward? 


QUESTION:  I said upward or downward. 


QUESTION:  I know.  And he agreed. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  I'm surprised that he agrees.  I -- I


would think you would -- you would say that -- that it's


only the downward that -- that saves the guidelines. 


MR. INGRAM:  Well, I think it is in this case. 


The -- the fact that the judge can depart downward --


QUESTION:  I mean, suppose a judge could not


depart downward under the guidelines, could only -- only


depart upward, you'd have a mandatory minimum, wouldn't


you?


that --


MR. INGRAM:  You would have.  But that --


QUESTION:  Okay.  So -- so, what you agree with


is that so long as the judge, under the guidelines, has


the option of departing downward, you wouldn't -- this


case would not necessarily decide the guidelines.

 MR. INGRAM:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  Suppose --


QUESTION:  How -- how does a judge have the


opportunity to depart downward under the guideline if the


guideline says if he had a gun, you're supposed to go up? 


I just don't understand your argument at all.


MR. INGRAM:  Because that --


QUESTION:  -- purpose is if he has a gun, you


increase it.  Why isn't that an Apprendi thing under your


theory?


MR. INGRAM:  Because the judge still -- that --


that does not bind the judge at that level.  The judge


still --


QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose the judge says,


now, it's the policy in this court and in this


jurisdiction, counsel, that if you come in and your


defendant has a gun or has brandished a gun, I'm going to


go upward.  I want you to know that.  Then the case is


decided, and he said, you know, I would have given your


counsel -- your client six months if he hadn't brandished


the gun, but he brandished that gun: 5 years.  And you


contend he didn't brandish the gun.  Why shouldn't


Apprendi control that? 


MR. INGRAM:  Because the -- the constitutional


rule announced by the Court is that if a legislature

mandates an increase in the prescribed range of penalties. 


In the case you've described, Your Honor, the judge,


although he says I would still -- I will always go up, he


-- he still has the freedom to not go up. 


QUESTION:  So --


MR. INGRAM:  And -- and he is subject to an


abuse of discretion standard on appeal. 


QUESTION:  So -- so, in your view, Apprendi


stands for the proposition that legislatures cannot


control judges in the sentencing process.


MR. INGRAM:  No.  My -- my -- in a sense that is


true.  My position is constitutionally that legislatures


have the power to determine what conduct they're going to


criminalize and to define the elements and the prescribed


punishment for those elements as long as it is not cruel


and unusual. 


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I think Apprendi is


clearly binding here, and -- and we have to decide how --


how it should be applied. 


I -- I do have some problems in -- in this case


because of the fact that I think the statute is a little


bit different than Jones.  I -- I don't agree that it's


structurally the same.  And I really don't see why this


shouldn't apply where judges have discretion. 


MR. INGRAM:  Is your question why would this --

why would the Apprendi doctrine not apply where the judge


has discretion? 


QUESTION:  That's part of my concern, yes.


MR. INGRAM:  Well, I think the answer to that is


that constitutionally the -- the rule announced in


Apprendi is that where a legislature mandates a particular


mandatory minimum or maximum, then that is where the


constitutional demands that the -- those facts be tried by


beyond a reasonable doubt --


QUESTION:  Where -- where a judge has


discretion, I suppose no single fact requires a certain


sentence.  Isn't that right? 


MR. INGRAM:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  By definition, where the judge has


discretion, no single fact requires a certain sentence.


MR. INGRAM:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  But as a practical matter, even in --


in this, suppose this judge thought that the -- Harris


should not have gotten more than 5 years.  So, he says,


well, the evidence of brandishing could go either way, so


I want to give him 5 years.  I'll find -- I won't find


brandishing.  That kind of discretion you -- the


prosecutor I suppose couldn't say anything about. 


A judge -- a judge has that discretion no matter what


the legislature rules are.  He can say, it's a close

question whether brandishing exists.  Therefore, I will


not find brandishing.  That will bring him down to the 5-


year level.  Right? 


MR. INGRAM:  That is true.  If he -- if he --


QUESTION:  It's true?  A judge -- a judge has


discretion, when he's making factual findings, to say what


is false?  Even though he thinks one -- one fact is true,


he has discretion to say that it's not true? 


MR. INGRAM:  No.  Your Honor, I don't mean to


say that he has discretion to make fact finding.  That --


that is always --


QUESTION:  That was the question.  Does the


judge have discretion to say, even though I know there was


brandishing, I'm going to say there wasn't brandishing. 


He doesn't have the kind of discretion.


MR. INGRAM:  No, he does not, and I


misunderstood the question then. 


QUESTION:  No.  I didn't say that even if he


knew.  I said if the judge said, well, it's a -- it's a


tough question, so I'm not going to -- I'm not going to


make up my mind on it.


MR. INGRAM:  Our position is once the judge does


conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that


brandishing exists, he has no authority to give anything


less than the mandatory minimum, no matter what other

mitigating facts he may conclude may be present in the


case.


QUESTION:  What you're saying is he has to --


MR. INGRAM:  He is bound by that. 


QUESTION:  What you're saying is he has to be


honest when he decides the brandishing issue.


MR. INGRAM:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


QUESTION:  And I suppose he has to confront the


brandishing issue.  He can't say, it's a tough question,


so you know, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to face it. 


The law requires him to -- to decide whether there's been


brandishing or not, doesn't it? 


MR. INGRAM:  Yes, it does, by a preponderance of


the evidence standard.  And we contend where the -- under


the constitutional rule in Apprendi, that increasing the


mandatory minimum makes that fact an element that must be


found not by a preponderance of the evidence, but by the


fact finder at trial beyond a reasonable doubt.  All the


more important, because in this case, the judge noted that


it was a close case, and therefore the standard of review


becomes all the more important in -- as illustrated by


this case that --


QUESTION:  Close on brandishing. But he also


said, I would have given this guy 7 years no matter what;

Apprendi, without Apprendi, 7 years is what I think is


right for him.  Isn't --


MR. INGRAM:  That is what -- that is what he at


least implied strongly.  But he cannot do that -- if -- if


we prevail here and we go back for a resentencing, the


judge is not going to be able to give more than 5  years. 


That is the -- the guideline sentence.  There's no


guideline range for this.  The guideline is the mandatory


minimum sentence. 


The judge will not be allowed to give more than 5


years unless he identifies a legally permissible basis for


an upward departure.  And in that case, he can increase


above the 5-year mandatory minimum.


QUESTION:  Suppose on -- on remand, if you


prevail here, -- well, I guess there would have to be a


new -- a new trial on the sentencing point.  But suppose


the judge says, you know, the jury has found there's no


brandishing because he displayed it but they didn't think


that was brandishing under my instructions.  But he did


have a gun and he did show it, and even if that isn't


brandishing, I'm going to up it to 7 years.  He can do


that?


MR. INGRAM:  If I understand Your Honor's


question, then yes.  If a jury concluded that the


defendant --

 QUESTION:  No brandishing. 


MR. INGRAM:  -- did not brandish -- that is, if


it was considered to be an element and the jury determined


that he did not brandish -- then first of all, he would be


not guilty of the crime, because that would be an element


that must be proved, and any element that is not proved


beyond a reasonable doubt means that he would be not


guilty of the crime. 


But if there, for example, was some accompanying


charge that the defendant was found guilty of and not the


brandishing, then certainly the judge would have the


discretion to consider whether the firearm was brandished


or discharged.


QUESTION:  Are you saying that if he were


charged with this offense and charged specifically with


brandishing, and the jury found him not to have


brandished, he would have to be acquitted? 


MR. INGRAM:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  Wouldn't -- wouldn't there be a


lesser included offense of everything in the statute


except brandishing?


MR. INGRAM:  Well, that is true.  By saying he


would be acquitted and found not guilty, it would be of


the separate offense of brandishing the firearm.


QUESTION:  But -- but the prosecution would be

entitled to a charge on a lesser included offense.


MR. INGRAM:  That is correct.  That is correct.


QUESTION:  But -- but wait.  But you would allow


the judge to increase his sentence on the basis of the


judge's belief that he was brandishing? 


MR. INGRAM:  Yes.  That -- that is -- although I


do not agree with --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. INGRAM:  -- with that policy, nevertheless


that is -- that is the case under the status of the law


now.  Where a defendant is found not guilty, for example,


of substantive drug offenses, at sentencing, the judge is


allowed to conclude beyond -- by a preponderance of the


evidence that those quantities were possessed and, in


fact, should count against the defendant for sentencing


purposes.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm quite surprised at that.  I


-- I tried to phrase my -- my question to get around that. 


I said the judge accepts the jury finding that there was


no brandishing, but everybody agrees that he did at least


have a gun and so he's going to increase it for that. 


That was my hypothetical.  But in answer to Justice


Scalia, you said the judge could say I think there's


brandishing by a preponderance of the evidence.  I'm


surprised at that.

 MR. INGRAM:  We are suggesting that brandishing


must be proved --


QUESTION:  That's this Court's case I take it --


QUESTION:  That -- that -- I --


QUESTION:  -- which maybe we should reconsider.


QUESTION:  Why don't you let him answer?  Answer


Justice Kennedy's question. 


MR. INGRAM:  By -- by saying that the brandish


must be an element to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt,


we are not contending that if the jury finds the defendant


not guilty on that particular element, that the judge


might not be able to consider, by a preponderance of the


evidence, that fact, in -- in addition to any other number


of mitigating and aggravating facts, in -- in determining


the appropriate sentence.


QUESTION:  I'm surprised at that.


QUESTION:  But the appropriate sentence within


his discretion. 


MR. INGRAM:  That is correct.  That is correct. 


He could not --


QUESTION:  And -- and it is true that under the


guidelines a judge can find something that the jury didn't


find because the standards are different, beyond a


reasonable doubt in the one case, and the judge said,


well, I'm -- I would think, too, it wasn't proved beyond a

reasonable doubt, but there is a preponderance of the


evidence.  Therefore, I find it, for purposes of my


guideline calculation.  That's -- that's quite common,


isn't it? 


MR. INGRAM:  It is -- it is quite common that


the judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence both


conduct that was not even charged and conduct that was


charged and -- of which the defendant was found not


guilty, because of the difference in the standard of


proof. 


QUESTION:  So -- so --


MR. INGRAM:  That is -- that is -- I'm not happy


with that either, but that is the case law and that is the


law as -- as it stands. 


QUESTION:  So, what have you accomplished if --


if they just rewrite the guidelines to say you get 5 years


for brandishing? 


MR. INGRAM:  What we will have accomplished --


QUESTION:  The consequence will be that even if


the jury finds no brandishing as an element of the crime,


the -- the judge may -- and indeed, under the guidelines,


must -- add 5 years for brandishing if he thinks, by a


preponderance of the evidence, there was brandishing,


which is the situation you're in now. 


QUESTION:  And if I can pile onto Justice

Scalia's question, you now have the worst of both worlds


because you have the disadvantages we referred to at


first, and yet the judge can still go upward. 


MR. INGRAM:  No, Your Honor, it does not.  If


this is an element to be proved at trial, and the finder


of fact determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the --


the Government has failed to find beyond a reasonable


doubt that he brandished, then he can only be sentenced


for the carry and use phase or possession of the statute. 


And -- and that only mandates a 5-year mandatory minimum. 


Therefore, brandish cannot under those


circumstances increase the range.  It cannot increase the


mandatory minimum.  It cannot increase the maximum.  The


judge can still sentence within the mandatory 5 to life. 


He simply cannot and is not bound by a determination that


the defendant brandished and therefore he must give a


higher sentence.  He -- he can in considering that, along


with any other aggravating and mitigating factors.


QUESTION:  But the guidelines can require him to


give a higher sentence.  If the same higher sentence of 5


years were mandated in the guidelines, you say that's


okay.  Right? 


MR. INGRAM:  It would not be mandated in the


same sense.  A mandatory minimum is just that.  The judge


has no longer any discretion to go below.  The -- the

defendant has no right to ask the judge to go below.  The


prosecution is empowered to insist that the judge give the


higher mandatory minimum sentence.  The defendant is not


precluded under the guidelines from asking the Court to


depart downward on any number of legal bases for downward


departures that take his case outside the heartland of


cases under Koon v. United States. 


If there are no further questions, I will


reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Ingram. 


Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This Court's decision in McMillan v.


Pennsylvania forms the backdrop for both the statutory and


the constitutional questions in this case. 


As a matter of statutory interpretation, the


amended section 924(c) creates one crime with a minimum of


5 years and a maximum of life in prison and then gives the


sentencing court additional guidance as to where the


penalty shall be set within that 5-year-to-life range. 


The increase in the mandatory minimums does not run afoul


of the Apprendi rule and is, in fact, specifically

endorsed by this Court's decision in McMillan. 


And on the constitutional question, this Court's


decision in McMillan 16 years ago established that it does


not violate the Constitution for a legislature to choose


one fact that has historically borne on the appropriate


penalty to be assessed at sentencing and give the judge


guidance as to what that sentence shall be. 


QUESTION:  Well -- well, given the precedent of


Apprendi, suppose the judge says, now, you know, the jury


finds an enhancement because of harassment, and the judge


says, well, under -- let me begin again. 


Under your theory of the case, the jury doesn't


-- the judge said, you know, I would ordinarily give you 6


months, but I -- I find there's a harassment here -- or


pardon me -- brandishing here, and so I'm going to give


you 5 to 7 years.  True, it's a mandatory minimum.  True,


that's different than Apprendi.  But it certainly seems to


me that the concerns Apprendi -- of Apprendi are fully


applicable here. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Kennedy, there are several


significant differences between the issue in a case like


this and the issue in a case like Apprendi.  In Apprendi,


the judge could not go above the jury's verdict based on


the Court's constitutional analysis.  In other words, the


jury sets the outermost limit that the judge can do, and


27

in the sense of protecting the jury trial right, the


Apprendi rule tracks onto what the jury must find. 


Here, regardless of what the jury finds, the


judge has the discretion and the authority to sentence the


defendant between 5 years and life in prison.  What the


mandatory minimum takes away is not a jury trial right,


but a right to judicial discretion to give a lower


sentence than the mandatory minimum calls for. 


But Apprendi was not about protecting judicial


discretion.  Apprendi, in fact, limited judicial


discretion and said that the judge cannot go above the


maximum that the jury's facts have determined.  Here the


judge is not doing anything that he could not do based on


the jury's verdict anyway.  All that is happening is that


he is losing the discretionary power to give less, and


that judicial discretion interest is not the interest that


was at stake in Apprendi. 


That's reinforced by the fact that the history


that this Court relied on, as one of its key determinants


in the Apprendi decision, is not present in this case. 


The history in Apprendi, the Court concluded, showed that


it has been the rule down centuries into the common law


that the judge cannot give a higher sentence than based on


the facts that the jury has determined.  But there is no


comparable historical rule that would support a preclusion

of judicial discretion within the otherwise applicable


range. 


The history of sentencing in this country shows


that within the maximum sentence established by the jury


verdict, judges have been often given tremendous amounts


of discretion on what sentence they should impose.  But


the history of sentencing also reveals that legislatures


have frequently intervened in order to establish more


precise rules to govern that discretion.  And the --


therefore, there is no broad historical rule that is


contradicted by a statute like the one in this case and


the one that was at issue in McMillan.


QUESTION:  But if that's so, do you -- do you


accept what -- what your -- what the petitioner said in


respect to my second statute, if you remember it?  The


second statute is, Congress passes a law and it says the


maximum for robbery is 15 years, but if there is no


injury, then it's 7 or 5.  Now, does Apprendi apply to


that? 


MR. DREEBEN:  It --


QUESTION:  Or if there is -- if the gun isn't


discharged.  Does Apprendi apply to that? 


MR. DREEBEN:  It might, Justice Breyer.  The


crucial question is whether that statute has created an


affirmative defense.

 QUESTION:  No, no, no.  There is no doubt that


the statute I'm talking about intends the fact of


discharge to be a sentencing factor.  There is no doubt. 


I mean, I can write it in such a way that that's clear.


MR. DREEBEN:  If it's --


QUESTION:  Now, at that point, Apprendi is a


constitutional rule, and therefore does the discharger 


not have to be presented to the jury?


MR. DREEBEN:  As I understand Apprendi, it


would.


QUESTION:  All right.  If that's so, then what


did you say in your first answer?  You've had two parts. 


You had a -- a purposive part and you had a historical


part. 


All right.  Now, did you say anything, other


than saying eloquently and in several different ways, that


Apprendi concerned a maximum and this case concerns a


minimum, which I am sure that the petitioners would


concede? 


MR. DREEBEN:  The significance of it concerning


a minimum is that under this statute, once the jury


returns a verdict of guilty, using or carrying a firearm


during in relation to an underlying drug trafficking


offense, the judge has the authority by virtue of that


jury verdict to sentence from 5 years to life in prison.

That's what the statute means.


What the mandatory minimum provision does is


say, within that range, we want this defendant sentenced


to not less than 7.


QUESTION:  All right.  That's certainly true. 


But what's bothering me about it is every factor in


Apprendi -- and I was against Apprendi.  I dissented.  But


having that now being the law, it seems to me every


factor, other than the fact that this is a minimum and


that's a maximum, applies a fortiori in this case.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the two most significant


factors, as I've tried to say -- and I'll try one more


time -- is that in Apprendi, the defendant could not have


gotten a sentence above 10 years based on the jury's


verdict alone.  It took an additional finding by the judge


to send him into the realm where the maximum was now 20,


and then he -- Apprendi got 12. 


In this case, once the jury or, as it happens,


the judge -- the defendant waived a jury trial -- assigned


a finding of guilt to the defendant, the statute said,


your sentence, Mr. Harris, is between 5 years and life in


prison.  And the statute comes along and doesn't give the


judge the authority to do something that he could not have


done before.


QUESTION:  So, Apprendi is just a draftsmanship

problem, really.  So, I mean, it's bad if -- if the


legislature says, for this crime you get 20 years, but if


you brandish a weapon, you get another 5.  That's bad. 


So, the legislature, that's okay. 


I'm sorry.  For -- for this crime you get 1 to


20, but if you brandish, you get -- you get 25. 


So, I say, okay, we'll revise it in light of


Apprendi.  For this crime, you get -- you get 1 to 25, but


if you brandish a weapon, it shall be 25.  That's okay,


although the other one wasn't okay.  And -- and it's up to


the judge to find whether it's brandishing or not.


MR. DREEBEN:  The difference in that statute,


Justice Scalia -- and I agree that that would not trigger


the rule that this Court announced in Apprendi -- is that


as the Court's opinion in Apprendi notes, if Congress


writes the second kind of statute and says the range is 1


to 25, it is exposing all defendants who are sentenced


under that statute to a possible sentence of 25 years. 


And the Court said that structural democratic constraints


exist to deter legislatures from enacting statutes with


more draconian maximum penalties than they think are


appropriate for the worst of the worst who are going to be


sentenced under that statute. 


Now, here when Congress amended section 924(c),


it went from a statute that had determinate sentences.

Previously whatever you did under 924(c), the judge had no


sentencing discretion at all.  It was just 5 years or 20


years or 30 years.  Congress changed that and said this is


a more serious crime.  This is a crime which, if you're


convicted of it, you're going to get at least 5 years with


an implied maximum all the way up to life in prison.


By virtue of doing that, Congress envisioned


that there would a spectrum of offenders under section


924(c), some of whom are going to be at the bottom of the


tier and are just the least worst offenders under that


statute.  They'll get 5 years.  Others are going to be the


worst of the worst.  They are going to get a sentence that


will be closer to the top of the statute.  Within that


range, Congress gave to the sentencing judge additional


guide points of how to exercise that discretion.  For


someone who brandishes, that's a little worse than simply


using; he should get at least 7 years.  For someone who


discharges -- that's an increment worse yet -- it's 10


years. 


But there's still all of the head room up to


life in prison that Congress established for this offense. 


It doesn't violate the Eighth Amendment for Congress to


say that someone who brings a gun into a drug or a violent


crime has committed a serious offense.  We want the judge


to have up to life in prison.

 QUESTION:  So, if you tell the --


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question on -- on a


different topic?  Because I think we understand your


argument here and I -- Justice O'Connor asked your


opponent, in essence, to what extent he thought the


sentencing guidelines were implicated by this case.  Would


you comment on that subject?  Tell us what you think the


impact of this decision will have on the sentencing


guidelines.


MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Stevens, it's unclear what


impact this decision will have on the sentencing


guidelines, I assume on the assumption that the Court


extends Apprendi to mandatory minimums. 


The sentencing guidelines are like mandatory


minimums in certain respects.  They provide ranges, once


the judge has determined by a preponderance of the


evidence, the defendant's conduct and criminal history,


that by statute the judge is to give a sentence within. 


But they differ from mandatory minimums in that the


statute further says that the judge can depart from the


guidelines sentence based on an aggravating or a


mitigating fact that distinguishes the case from the kinds


that the guidelines' drafters had in mind.


Now, the guidelines are -- are different


primarily in that there is a broader range of discretion

available for the judge to depart than there is under a


mandatory minimum. 


I emphasize that this is a question of degree


rather than one of kind because even these mandatory


minimums under section 924(c) can be departed from.  If


the Government makes a motion that says the defendant has


rendered substantial assistance to the Government in the


prosecution of others, that authorizes the judge to depart


from what is otherwise a mandatory minimum.  That same


ground for departure also exists within the guidelines,


and it accounts for more than half of the departures that


exist in the guidelines. 


Now, the guidelines do, of course, provide a


further zone of less guided discretion to the judge in


when he can depart.  And if this Court rules against the


Government in this case, we will be back saying that that


zone of discretion distinguishes the guidelines.  Whether


the Court agrees with that or not will be an open


question. 


QUESTION:  Right.  I understand, but at least


the -- at least the argument that your opponent made would


be available to the Government.  There's a difference


because of the amount of discretion --


MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  -- under the guideline.

 I did not understand.  I want to be sure I don't


miss this point that you made in your answer.  Do you


argue that in this case it's really not a mandatory


minimum because there is the discretion in -- in the


prosecutor to ask for -- for a deviation from the statute?


MR. DREEBEN:  No, not in the sense that Your


Honor is asking the question. 


But I -- I do wish to underscore that there is


-- there is a range of ways that Congress can draft


statutes and the States can draft statutes.  Under the


drug statutes, for example, there's not only the


substantial assistance departure that I've mentioned, but


there's also a departure for first-time offenders called


the safety valve.  Now, that adds an additional amount of


discretion to the judge. 


And any constitutional rule that this Court


develops for mandatory minimums is going to have to be


very careful in articulating how much discretion is enough


in order to make the mandatory minimum no longer mandatory


and no longer minimum.  It could be that the availability


of the substantial assistance departure is enough to take


it out of a rule that says never means never, and if -- if


Congress says never, then the judge can't make the


finding. 


That is precisely why we urge the Court to

adhere to McMillan v. Pennsylvania which held 16 years ago


that it is permissible for -- for the legislature to


provide additional guidance.  And the Court left open the


possibility that particular statutes may fall under a


constitutional rule, but it didn't prescribe the sort of


rigid rule that petitioner is advocating in this case.


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, apart from one being


within the jury zone and the other not, is there a


rational distinction between saying, judge, you can't add


on 2 years at the top and saying you can't subtract 2


years at the bottom? 


MR. DREEBEN:  The rational distinction, Justice


Ginsburg, is that in the former case, the defendant has a


right to a jury trial that has to find him guilty on all


the facts that are going to determine the longest possible


time that he can spend in prison. 


Under this statute, even if he does have a jury


trial right to brandishing -- just suppose that he did;


suppose that Congress gave it to him so we eliminate the


constitutional question -- the jury could find him not


guilty.  And the judge could still say, well, I think by a


preponderance of the evidence, you did brandish, and


exercising my discretion, I'm going to give you exactly


the same 7 years that the statute called for. 


The fact that that can happen shows, I think,

that the right that's in play here is not a right to a


jury trial that will protect the defendant against the


possibility of this increased punishment.  It is the right


to have a judge with unlimited discretion not to impose


the mandatory minimum even if he finds brandishing,


because that is the distinction that I think both


petitioner and I draw between the sentencing guidelines


and this mandatory minimum.  And the right to judicial


discretion is simply not the Apprendi right.  It's not a


right that's been historically recognized. 


And if this Court were to accept respondent's --


or petitioner's analysis of the constitutional rules that


govern here as being drawn from the ex post facto cases,


which is essentially what he relied on in his reply brief


and in this Court, the Court would have to fashion a far


more sweeping constitutional rule than would address


merely mandatory minimums, because the ex post facto cases


are triggered by any substantial disadvantage to the


defendant.  It doesn't have to be a substantial


disadvantage that can only be proved as an element of the


crime.  The ex post facto cases apply to the withdrawal of


good-time credits.  They apply to the sentencing


guidelines, as the Court held in Miller v. Florida.  They


would presumably apply to the withdrawal of an affirmative


defense after the defendant committed his crime.

 And petitioner, by relying on that test,


essentially says, I want a rule that means that anytime I


am substantially disadvantaged by one aspect or another of


the criminal laws of a State, the jury must find those


facts.  All facts that are germane to my punishment --


QUESTION:  Is that the implication of Apprendi?


MR. DREEBEN:  That is the --


QUESTION:  Is that where we're headed, in your


view?


MR. DREEBEN:  I hope not, Justice O'Connor,


because I think that the Apprendi rule, as bounded by the


history that the Court relied on and the explicit


statements of its holding, coupled with the Court's


recognition that, yes, legislatures can write statutes


that will achieve similar results to Apprendi but will do


it in an acceptable form, all of those things suggest that


the Court did not have a broad ruling on it. 


QUESTION:  Do you have a sense of how the


application of Apprendi is working out in the system now? 


I mean, how is it being applied?  What's happening?  What


has changed as a result? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, retrospectively Apprendi has


caused a considerable amount of judicial chaos as courts


have attempted to sort out harmless error, plain error,


and retroactivity considerations, one of which is before

the Court next month in the Cotton case. 


Prospectively, the United States has responded


to Apprendi by having facts that raise the -- the maximum


be submitted to the jury.  And it does, as a matter of


practice, cause some complications in particularly


intricate conspiracy cases where the jury has to make


separate determinations as to each conspirator. 


It also creates the kinds of issues that Justice


Breyer was talking about for defendants who are hampered


to some extent in their ability to present dual


alternative defenses of the nature, I wasn't involved in


this conspiracy, but if I was, I'm only accountable for a


certain amount of drugs, because the jury is being asked


to make that determination.  Once the jury makes it


affirmatively, the judge is not going to be in a position


at sentencing to second guess that. 


So, Apprendi does -- does restrict the -- the


defendant's ability to make a defense --


QUESTION:  -- defense bar complained about that,


have they? 


MR. DREEBEN:  The defense bar has been --


QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm unaware that they are --


are keen on getting rid of Apprendi.


MR. DREEBEN:  Their primary desire to date so


far, Justice Scalia, has been to get all of the old

sentences in the pre-Apprendi regime overturned.  And when


they've finished with that agenda, maybe they'll turn to


trying to get different proceedings at trial.


QUESTION:  But as far as you're concerned --


QUESTION:  To get it expanded.


MR. DREEBEN:  As cases like this reveal, there's


been an effort to expand Apprendi to what could be viewed


as its widest logical implications, because although I've


presented a theory for why Apprendi should be read


narrowly to avoid disrupting the traditional ability of


legislatures to structure sentencing, there is obviously


within the opinion the seeds of a much more fundamental


change in the --


QUESTION:  Yes, but those are extensions --


extensions on the -- on the basis that you've said, which


I now understand, is you say, well, there has to be a jury


finding for anything that will lead to a longer maximum


term, the highest possible term.  And they say, yes, but


if that's so, you also have to have a jury finding for the


shortest mandatory term, because the shortest mandatory


term is far more important to any individual defendant


than the highest theoretical possible term.  And I think


that's what their argument rests upon, and that sounds


basically true.  And it doesn't lead you down the path


you're talking about.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that it would be


true for a defendant like the defendant in Jones who was


convicted by the jury of a crime that carried a 15-year


penalty.


QUESTION:  No, there are some -- there are some


exceptions, but they're saying in general.  And -- but


what's -- I want to be sure I -- I'm in a slight dilemma


because I think Apprendi was not right.  But still, there


it is. 


And the -- but the -- the question -- I want to


be sure you finished Justice O'Connor's question.  My


understanding is prospectively a ruling against you here


would not give the Government a lot of trouble. 


Prospectively what you would do is you would simply charge


in the indictment every factor related to mandatory


minimums and go and prove it.  And that's not herculean. 


That isn't some tremendously difficult thing to do, or


not?


MR. DREEBEN:  The Government could do that.


QUESTION:  They could do it. 


MR. DREEBEN:  The States have a much wider range


of mandatory minimum sentencing programs.  They've filed


an amicus brief in this case that itemizes the far greater


number and wider range of State mandatory minimum


programs.  I'm not in a position --

 QUESTION:  Well, having read those, do you have


any impression in respect to the practicalities of it?


MR. DREEBEN:  I think that the States will


suffer increased practical problems compared to the


Federal Government because in the Federal Government, the


mandatory minimums are in relatively specific areas and we


could, indeed, go forward and charge and prove them to a


jury. 


The more fundamental implication of an extension


of Apprendi within the maximum term is that it does raise


greater questions about the constitutionality of schemes


such as the sentencing guidelines.  Those are, of course,


not only on the Federal level but prevalent throughout the


States as well.  And -- and the process of drawing lines


between whether mandatory minimums are mandatory enough to


trigger any constitutional rule, versus sentencing


guidelines not being, is going to require a process of


adjudication, and there's no way to predict where that


will end up.  It will largely depend on how broadly this


Court interprets the rule that it announced in Apprendi


and then if it applies it here, how it applies it.


If there --


QUESTION:  May I ask you just a short -- so I


don't lose the point?  In our discussion a little earlier,


you mentioned a statute that makes the mandatory minimum

not 100 percent mandatory because the Government may ask


for a -- a departure.  What is the statutory authority for


the Government to make such a motion? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Under 18 U.S.C., section 3553(e).


QUESTION:  3553.


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  The Government can file a


motion for substantial assistance of the defendant in the


prosecution of others, and upon that motion, the judge can


go below.  This Court analyzed that statute in Melendez v.


United States several years ago, a case which I believe is


cited in our brief. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, are you going to say


anything before you get done about the statutory


construction question?  Because I'm -- if we said the


statute is like Jones, wouldn't that be the end of it?


MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.  And, Justice Ginsburg, I


-- I agree with the suggestion of Justice Souter earlier


that this statute is not identical to the Jones statute


and shouldn't be construed identically to it. 


First and most fundamentally, in Jones and again


unanimously in Castillo, the Court commented that a


statute that's written, as section 924(c) is written, has


the look of the creation of sentencing factors when you


start off looking at it.  In Jones, the Court then went on


to analyze a number of structural features that suggested


44

that the initial look was unreliable. 


Here the initial look is reliable.  Unlike in


Jones where the additional factors, serious bodily injury


and death, took the penalty from 15 years, first to 25


years, and then to life in prison, here the initial range


of the statute is 5 years to life, and the mandatory


minimums are fairly modest incremental increases in the


minimum sentence of 5 years and 7 years. 


But most importantly, what is different from the


statute in Jones, the carjacking statute and the statute


here, section 924(c), is in Jones the carjacking statute


was modeled on three Federal robbery statutes.  Two of


those Federal robbery statutes contained serious bodily


injury or putting somebody in jeopardy of serious bodily


injury that were clearly offense elements, and the Court


commented that it could see no reason -- and the


Government was unable to adduce a reason -- why Congress


would have departed from the explicit models on which it


relied in drafting the carjacking statute.  So you had a


firmer basis for concluding in the carjacking statute that


Congress probably intended an element. 


Here not only do you not have that feature,


because there was no Federal antecedent for section


924(c), but you have the very important consideration that


there's no constitutional doubt that should be applied to


45

the construction of section 924(c).  Unlike in Jones where


the Court held that a series of cases over 25 years had


raised constitutional questions about increasing the


maximum, here the relevant precedent, of which Congress is


presumed to be aware, is McMillan v. Pennsylvania which


gave the legislature fair warning that it could provide


for the kind of statute that it's provided here. 


And for those reasons, we think that the Fourth


Circuit and every other court of appeals that's analyzed


the question is correct in concluding that Congress's


approach in section 924(c) was a sentencing factor


approach.  The question then becomes whether that is a


constitutional approach.


QUESTION:  May I just ask another -- another


question about the history and the length of the history? 


I particularly have in mind Justice Thomas's concurring


opinion in Apprendi.  Other than the McMillan case itself,


are you aware of any long line of cases prior to McMillan


reaching the same result? 


MR. DREEBEN:  No, Justice Stevens.  And the


reason for that is that the history of sentencing in this


country moved from early statutes which were wholly


determinate.


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Then in the 19th century, the

legislatures and Congress and the State adopted a -- a


policy of having wide ranges and judicial discretion


within them.  Then later, legislatures moved to a system


of parole boards and -- and indeterminate sentencing in


many States.


And it was as a result of those processes that


in the mid-20th century and late 20th century, a variety


of commentators began to decide that this sentencing


scheme that gives so much discretion to various actors in


the system was not acceptable because it produced


unwarranted disparities against similarly situated


offenders.  And at that point, to promote transparency,


meaning we know what -- why the judge is doing what he's


doing, and uniformity, namely, similar offenders will get


the same sentence, schemes came along like mandatory


minimums and guideline sentencing.  But I believe that


they were understood to be directions to limit judicial


discretion, not to wholly supplant it or to be the type of


statute that the Court invalidated in Apprendi. 


And it's really the petitioner's burden in this


case to show that these sentencing innovations are


unconstitutional.  In Apprendi, the defendant was able to


carry that burden by pointing to a long line of consistent


judicial decisions.  Here neither party can point to a


long line of consistent decisions.  What each of us does

is argue from the background baseline tradition. 


Our submission is that judges have always had a


wide range of discretion.  Defendants have never been able


to rely on not getting a stiffer sentence within the


maximum authorized ranges.  Legislatures have relied on


this Court's decision in McMillan, saying that it's


constitutional for the legislature to structure that


discretion, and we believe that the Court should adhere to


that position today.


Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. 


Mr. Ingram, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. INGRAM


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. INGRAM:  Responding to the questions about


the effect that a ruling in our favor will have on the


lower courts, first of all, as noted, there will be no


prospective impact.  The Government in the Federal context


is already alleging drug amounts, is already alleging


brandish and discharge, and it's a very simple matter for


the Government and the prosecution, either the State or


the Federal courts, to allege and -- and prove these


additional facts.


Retroactively, there will be some cases that


will be sent back.  They will not be sent back to set

aside guilty verdicts or guilty pleas.  They will simply


be sent back for resentencing, consistent with the opinion


in this case, just like they were with Apprendi.  There's


not nearly the flood of remands on Apprendi, and Bailey


for that matter, as the Government contends, but in any


event, however many there are, if the Constitution demands


it, then so be it. 


The Government is concerned that a ruling in our


favor will undermine legislatures' concerns about limiting


judicial discretion in sentencing by enacting mandatory


minimums.  Those statutes, the statute in this case in


particular, and any statutes enacting mandatory minimums


in -- in the State courts will not go away with a ruling


in our favor.  The only difference is that the Government


will simply have to allege and prove the additional fact,


further limiting the judge's discretion, whereas currently


the judge has discretion to determine, by a preponderance


of the evidence, whether or not a fact exists or not. 


Once a jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that it does,


the judge has no more discretion and must impose the


mandatory minimum. 


And as has been pointed out and we point out in


our brief and reply brief, we contend that mandatory


minimums, as a practical matter, are far more important


increases at the bottom level than the possible increases

at the top of a sentencing scheme would be. 


And finally, we are not asking the Court to


extend the constitutional rule announced in Apprendi. 


Apprendi was limited by its facts, but the constitutional


rule announced was that it is unconstitutional for a


legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of


facts that increased the prescribed range of penalties.  A


mandatory minimum increases the prescribed range of


penalties.  We are simply asking the Court to apply the


constitutional rule announced in Apprendi to the facts of


our case and -- and ask the Court to rule in our favor.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Ingram.


The case is submitted.
