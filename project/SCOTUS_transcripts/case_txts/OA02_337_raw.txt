CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 02-337, Phillip T. Breuer versus Jim's


Concrete of Brevard.


Mr. Pinaud.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. PINAUD, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PINAUD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This case is about the vitality and scope of the


rule of construction from Shamrock Oil that says that the


removal jurisdiction to Federal courts should be narrowly


construed.


As we see it, the overarching question in this 

case is, as posed by respondent, whether or not the rule


from Shamrock Oil applies to cases brought in State court,


but based upon a Federal question.  We think it has to for


three reasons, and I'd like to, if I can, list them, and


then I'll go back and -- and cover each of them


individually.


First, respondent proposes an unworkable


distinction whereby the -- whereby Shamrock Oil is not to


be applied where a case is brought under the Fair Labor


Standards Act alone, but it should be applied if it's

brought together with some State law claims.


Secondly, Florida has a right to protect its


citizens.


And thirdly, the Fair Labor Standards Act is


just -- just as much a part of the law of Florida as any


act of the Florida legislature or any decision of the


Florida courts.


Let me cover that first point first, which is


the unworkable distinction.


Respondent concedes that Shamrock Oil would


certainly apply in a situation where a State law claim was


being brought together with a Fair Labor Standards Act


claim.  In this case we did not bring a State law claim. 


We only brought a Fair Labor Standards Act claim.  We


could have, but we didn't.


If you were to -- if you were to have that rule,


you would have a situation where whether or not Federal


jurisdiction was proper would be wholly dependent upon


whether a State claim was brought with Federal action.  We


don't think that --


QUESTION:  But there are unworkable aspects to


your position, Mr. Pinaud.  For example, a Title VII case


combined with an equal pay case, the equal pay case could


not be removed, but the Title VII case could, and then you


would split what is essentially one controversy into two

parts because one is -- is not removable.


MR. PINAUD:  Well --


QUESTION:  The equal pay would be governed by


the same thing as --


MR. PINAUD:  There is --


QUESTION:  -- the Fair Labor Standards Act.


MR. PINAUD:  There is, I think, no question that


the Equal Pay Act and the Age Discrimination Act -- Age


Discrimination Enforcement Act would be covered by the


Court's decision in this case because the enforcement


provisions of those statutes are tied to the Fair Labor


Standards Act.


QUESTION:  And if you're right -- if you're


right -- the equal pay case would have to stay in the


State court, although the Title VII case could go forward 

in the Federal court.


MR. PINAUD:  That would be correct.


The -- the second reason that I think Shamrock


Oil applies in this case is because Florida has a right to


protect its -- its citizens.  This is a dispute between


Phillip Breuer, Mr. Breuer, who is a resident of the State


of Florida who lives in Duval County, who works for Jim's


Concrete of Brevard, which is a company in Brevard County,


in an employment relationship that took place in Florida,


governed by Florida law.  They worked in many counties in

Florida.  Certainly then Florida has an interest in that


relationship and in this dispute.  This is not a case like


Asahi where you have a -- a California court looking at a


dispute between a -- you know, a Taiwanese company and a


Japanese company.  Florida has an interest.


The third point is that the Fair Labor Standards


Act is just as much a part of the law of Florida as any


decision of the Florida legislature or any -- or any


opinion of its court.  Under the Supremacy Clause, the


laws of the United States are the laws of Florida. 


Florida courts have an obligation, an absolute duty, to


enforce and uphold the Fair Labor Standards Act just like


they have to enforce and uphold the -- the Fourth


Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment. 


It -- it would be unrealistic to say that Florida has an 

obligation to uphold these laws, but then has no right or


no interest in having them upheld in -- in Florida courts.


So for -- for those reasons, we think that


Shamrock Oil certainly has to apply to this case.


If you then go ahead and -- and apply the


Shamrock -- the Shamrock analysis to either the expressly


provided language of 1441 or the maintain language of the


Fair Labor Standards Act, you have to reach a decision


that these cases are -- are not properly to be subject to


removal.

 QUESTION:  Well, one can certainly maintain an


action in the Florida courts, and unless it's removed, it


will continue there.  I -- I -- it doesn't seem to me that


using the word maintain means that the action must


necessarily remain there.


MR. PINAUD:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, obviously


it's our position that maintain in this case does mean


that it should remain in State court, and we think it's


for a couple of reasons.


The first reason we would say is that once you


apply the Shamrock analysis, maintain has to mean what we


say because in the very worst-case scenario, at least for


our position, maintain is ambiguous or -- or capable of


two different constructions.  Everybody here has argued --


the Government argues and respondent argues -- that it's 

ambiguous.  Well, if it's ambiguous, if it's capable of


meaning you can maintain to a conclusion in State court,


or if it is, rather, capable of meaning that you can only


really bring or commence it, then under Shamrock Oil, when


we apply that analysis, we should use the conclusion that


most limits removal, which would be to -- which would be


to say that maintain means you continue on to -- to final


judgment.


QUESTION:  Well, except -- except that you have


a later statute that says that it's removable unless --

unless it is expressly provided otherwise.


MR. PINAUD:  Justice --


QUESTION:  And I don't think something that is


ambiguous expressly provides otherwise.


MR. PINAUD:  Well, Justice Scalia, I think what


you have to do, though, is I think when looking at the


expressly -- expressly otherwise provided language, you


have to -- first, you have to apply Shamrock Oil to that


language.  Now, it's -- it's our position that when


Congress used the word expressly provided, otherwise


expressly provided, it meant it in a textual sense.


That is, the word expressly is capable of two


different meanings itself.  It can mean super clear or


absolutely unambiguous, or rather, it can mean grounded in


some text. 


Because it's capable of two different 

meanings, we think that when you apply Shamrock to


expressly, you choose the textual meaning because the


textual meaning shrinks removal considerably whereas the


other meaning expands it.  But I think --


QUESTION:  And your reading of the word


maintain -- and your whole case hangs on that word,


maintain -- suppose the case were brought initially in a


Federal court, and there were -- there was a motion, a


1404(a) transfer motion, to transfer the case from one


district court to another.  I take it on your reading,

1404(a) couldn't apply either because you would have to --


if the plaintiff chose to maintain it in one Federal


court, therefore it couldn't be switched to another?


MR. PINAUD:  Justice Ginsburg, I -- I don't


think that would be the case.  I -- I don't think that


that's really analogous to the situation of bringing it


from the State court to the Federal court.  It's --


it's -- the -- the forum choice I think is significantly


different.  When the employee brings his action in State


court, he's choosing that State -- that State forum, and


it's for a reason.  And -- and we think that -- that those


reasons are -- are actually well articulated in -- in the


Government's 1947 brief when they were actually supporting


our position.  So I -- I don't think it's --


QUESTION: 


But if you're relying on the language 

of the statute, maintain in any Federal or State court,


any State court, any Federal court.  So if you are


conceding that you could transfer from one Federal court


to another, then the plaintiff's choice doesn't inevitably


prevail.


MR. PINAUD:  Well, I think then my -- my answer


to that would have to be the rule from Shamrock Oil says


if there's two reasonable interpretations, we -- we make a


decision that limits removal.  I'm not sure it's


reasonable to say that if you bring it in one Federal

court, it can't be transferred to -- to another Federal


court on -- on the -- the concerns would -- that would


give rise to it.


If I could go back, just a moment, to what I was


talking about, the -- the expressly provided language,


addressing your question, Justice Scalia.  We also think


that the expressly provided language has to be the textual


basis based upon this -- this Court's construction of


28 U.S.C. 2283.  That's the anti-injunction statute.  In


that statute, Congress has provided that no -- that no


Federal court shall issue an injunction to enjoin a State


court proceeding unless expressly authorized by Congress. 


We're dealing with expressly provided language in 1441. 


We see the language as completely indistinguishable.


In Mitchum v. Foster, this Court construed that 

language in 2283 as saying, look, that language does not


mean that you have to have a -- a statute that says you


can issue an injunction.  Rather, what the Court said was,


we look at the scope -- we look at the purpose and intent


of the statute and say is the purpose of -- and intent of


the statute to allow an injunction.  So really, what the


Court is saying in -- in Mitchum --


QUESTION:  That was just a magic language case. 


I mean, I think all it was saying is you don't have to use


the -- the very words so long as you have clearly made

that disposition, but I don't know that I would go so far


as to say that it -- it stands for the proposition that


something has been expressly provided for when there is


simply an ambiguous provision that might be interpreted


that way, but then, on the other hand, might not be


interpreted that way, which is -- which is what I think


you have to fairly say about maintain.


I -- I don't think your maintain argument goes


anywhere unless you apply to it the -- the rule of


preference that you're urging upon us, that -- that you


have to interpret it so as to prevent removal rather than


permit it.  But that -- that preference is eliminated by


the later statute unless you -- unless you interpret that


expressly to mean that an ambiguous provision expressly


provides, and I just find it hard -- hard to swallow that. 

And I just don't see any of our cases that -- do you have


a case that deals with what was truly an ambiguous


provision and -- and nonetheless said that it expressly


provided for something?


MR. PINAUD:  I -- I don't have -- there -- there


is no case that I know of that would be on point in -- in


this situation, Justice Scalia.  But I would also add that


we do not -- though we think that the first analysis


should start with Shamrock because -- the first analysis


of maintain should start with Shamrock because at best

everyone -- everyone agrees that the statute is ambiguous


and that is -- that is, that the respondent and the


Government would say, well, it could mean this but maybe


it doesn't.  I don't think we say that it's -- that


everything hangs or falls on Shamrock necessarily.


If you look at the way maintain was used in the


Fair Labor Standards Act, we think that the word maintain


is an express prohibition -- prohibition on its own.  This


is not just our opinion.  This was the opinion of the --


of the majority of judges, the majority of courts that


construed the statute prior to the 1948 amendment.  It was


also the opinion of the United States back in 1947.


QUESTION:  What's the reason?  I mean, leaving


the word out of it, I mean, normally the background rule


is -- this is an -- case arising under Federal law, and 

the background rule through removal is if either party


wants to go into Federal court, you can.  Now, you say


there's an exception for this statute.  Why?


MR. PINAUD:  We believe that the word


maintain --


QUESTION:  I understand the linguistic point. 


I'm saying leave the linguistic point out.  Why?


MR. PINAUD:  Justice Breyer, I'm not exactly


sure why we --

that people would want to make an exception for this


statute, the normal -- I'm not saying there is none.  I


just want to know what the reason is.  The -- the

MR. PINAUD:  I -- I think I understand what


you're saying now --


QUESTION:  Yes, all right.


MR. PINAUD:  -- Your Honor.


The -- the reason why Congress wanted an


exception in the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow


employees to bring these cases in -- in State court --


QUESTION:  Or Federal, yes.  Give them a choice.


MR. PINAUD:  Well --


QUESTION:  Is because? 


They can bring it either 

place.  Right?


MR. PINAUD:  Well, they can -- they can bring it


in -- in either place.  I mean, there would be no reason


why Congress --


QUESTION:  The reason why Congress would want


employees to have a choice, but would not want the


defendant to have the choice or bring it to State court,


unlike other Federal statutes is?


MR. PINAUD:  Because in 1938, when this statute


was passed, it was difficult for many employees around the

country to -- to effectively vindicate their rights for


unpaid overtime if they had to go to Federal court.  This


is --


QUESTION:  Mr. Pinaud, that's the same thing


with respect to the FELA, and -- and Congress therefore


expressly provided that if a railroad worker brings a case


in State court, it cannot be removed.  And Congress was


responding to the problem of the person who would find it


difficult to go to the big city to litigate in the Federal


court rather than stay in the State court close to home. 


And so doesn't the -- the fact that Congress expressly


provided that FELA cases are not removable cut against


you?


MR. PINAUD:  Justice Ginsburg, I -- there are


certainly cases -- certainly statutes where Congress has 

said this is not removable.  We don't think that Congress


is to be held to a standard where they have to use magic


language in order to prohibit removal.  We think that


the -- the real analysis should be what was Congress


intending by the statute at issue or else you --


QUESTION:  But -- but before the -- the 19 --


what was it -- what?  1445 -- before 1948, were FELA cases


removable?


MR. PINAUD:  I'm not sure.  I -- I will say


this.  Before 1948, you know, Congress had used language

in other statutes that said you can't remove it, and --


and we recognize that.  But if you -- if you hold Congress


to this magic language statute, then -- then nothing they


could do or nothing they could intend would matter unless


they use this specific language, and we're not sure that


that's what the standard should be.


QUESTION:  But we have a string of specific


statutes, and then we have 1445 that lists in a row


non-removable actions, a catalog of actions that are not


removable.  And this one is left out.  Wouldn't one infer


from that, well, they --


MR. PINAUD:  Well -- I'm sorry.


The -- the Reviser's Notes to the -- the 1948


revisions are rather meticulous.  They talk about


everything they're accomplishing and what they're trying 

to do.  I -- I think it's noteworthy that with all the


changes that were made to the other sections, like


section (c), the other subsections, that in order to


accept the proposition proposed by respondent, you would


have to conclude that Congress throughout, with these


other sections of 1441, certainly intended to contract


removal, but yet with 1441(a), it grossly expanded


removal.  I mean, this is a time now where Fair Labor


Standards Act cases were generally considered to be not


removable.  That was the prevailing opinion.

 There's no mention in the -- in the Reviser's


Note or any of the history to the statute that -- that


Congress even thought about the Fair Labor Standards Act,


so I think the more realistic assumption in the enaction


of -- of that legislation was that Congress accepted


the -- the prevailing opinion which was that maintain was


good enough, that maintain was an express prohibition


against removal.


The -- when you're looking at the word maintain,


also I think it's to see obviously the -- the public


policy concerns that I was just addressing with Justice


Breyer, but we do think it's important, as did the


Government back in 1947, that in enacting this


legislation, as it was -- originally appeared back when it


was passed, Congress used the word maintain within 38 

words in the same sentence.  Congress said an action may


be maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction, and


then 38 words later, it said it may be maintained by an


agent or representative of the employee.  If you were


to -- if you were to assume that maintained does not mean


what this Court essentially has said it meant in the


George Moore and Smallwood cases -- and that is that


maintain means to -- to continue on -- to continue or


uphold, continue on foot a suit already commenced --


QUESTION:  When -- when you say that the -- the

provision said it could be maintained by an employee, that


sounds more like a synonym for brought by the agent of the


employee, that the action could be brought an agent of the


employee, which of course does not help you.


MR. PINAUD:  Well, the way I think we look at


it, Mr. Chief Justice, is certainly Congress could not


have meant by saying it could be maintained by an agent of


an employee that he can file it, bring it, and then


somehow have the case ripped from his control.  That is


why we think that if you --


QUESTION:  Well, but that -- that's the case in


any case of a Federal statute covered by the removal


statute unless -- unless Congress says otherwise.  I mean,


to say it's ripped from his control by being removed, that


happens all the time.


MR. PINAUD:  Oh, no.  I'm sorry, Mr. Chief


Justice.  That -- that's not what I mean.  I don't -- I'm


talking about when -- when the Fair Labor Standards Act


was originally enacted -- it -- it no longer appears with


this language.


When it was originally enacted, it said, an


action under this section may be maintained in any court


of competent jurisdiction, which we all agree is --


includes a State court.  And it also said in the same


sentence that that action can be maintained by an agent or

representative of the employee so that he didn't have to


do it himself.  Somebody else could do it for him.


And the point that we're making is certainly


when Congress said that that other person can maintain it,


they didn't mean that that person could start the case and


then have the case ripped from him and have somebody else


take it over.  So if you -- if you --


QUESTION:  Well, ripped from him in what manner?


MR. PINAUD:  Well, that's exactly it, Mr. Chief


Justice.  If -- if you were to accept the argument


proposed by respondent, you would have to accept that


the -- the agent or representative of the employee in 1938


could file the case, but then after he filed it, somebody


else or someone would have the authority to divest him of


his right to prosecute it.


QUESTION:  Are -- are you talking about removal?


MR. PINAUD:  No.


QUESTION:  So you -- you -- when --


MR. PINAUD:  I'm --


QUESTION:  -- you say ripped from him, you're


not talking about the effect of removal.


MR. PINAUD:  No.


QUESTION:  What are you talking about?


MR. PINAUD:  I am talking about what could the


word -- I -- I was responding to a -- a question by

Justice Ginsburg about the definition and -- and so forth


of maintain.  And the point I was making is that maintain


has to mean more than simply start or bring or something


like that just because, if for no other reason -- if you


put aside Shamrock and you put aside the policy arguments,


for no other reason that Congress in this statute, in the


Fair Labor Standards Act, when it enacted it, used the


maintain twice, one to mean you can maintain the suit and


one to mean that a person can maintain it for you on your


behalf.  And obviously, if Congress is going to give the


employee the right to have an agent maintain the suit for


him or her, certainly they didn't mean you can just bring


it and then somehow, not for removal purposes, but you


won't have the authority any more to prosecute it.


QUESTION: 


But you won't if the employee that 

you're representing says, I don't want you, I want another


representative.  Then you can no longer maintain it.


MR. PINAUD:  Well, I -- that's -- I suppose that


would probably be the -- be the case, but I -- I think


that's -- I think that's more -- that's more akin to


dismissal.  I mean, if an employee brings a case in State


court and brings a case in Federal court, I mean, they can


always -- they wouldn't be maintaining it if they


themselves choose to -- to abandon it.


QUESTION:  No.  He said, I -- I want -- the

employee says, I don't want you as my agent.  I want


somebody else.


MR. PINAUD:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but that


would be the employee's decision.  That would be no


different than saying an employee can maintain the case in


State court when --


QUESTION:  I'm just questioning your -- your


saying no one could -- you couldn't wrench the case from


the agent because the word maintain is used.  Well, of


course, the employee could wrench it from him and give it


to somebody else.


MR. PINAUD:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  The


employee could wrench it from him just as the employee who


was maintaining his suit could choose to dismiss it.  I


mean, the employee controls the suit. 


I think it's more 

analogous to the -- to the employee's power --


QUESTION:  But nobody else could appoint an


agent.  So I can't see the other wrencher in the picture.


MR. PINAUD:  Well, if the -- the point I -- I am


trying to make is that if this representative is


maintaining the suit for the employee, if it only means


bring, then one could conceivably fashion reasons why that


person wouldn't have a -- would not be able to continue on


foot that suit aside from the employee.


I -- I know we're kind of dealing with -- with

the semantics of the word, but I think it's important to


show that the word means more than just bring or commence. 


At this same time also -- and we've cited the statutes in


our brief -- the -- the Government passed a whole host of


laws where they used words like bring and commence.  Why


choose the word maintain if it doesn't mean something --


something more in -- in this case?


Also -- and I know I've mentioned this a couple


times -- the word maintain itself -- it was the prevailing


opinion back then, before 1948, that maintain was express. 


That is the exact language that the Government used in its


brief filed in the Johnson case, that this was an express


prohibition against removal.  So these are the people that


lived contemporaneous at the time, that understood the --


the public policy arguments of it, that understood the --

the semantics of it, that understood presumably the intent


of it.  And we think that that -- those are entitled to


some weight.


There's -- you know, there is another argument


that is addressed by respondent that, you know, State


court judges are -- are not competent to handle these --


these kind of things.  Or I shouldn't say competent, but


they're not experienced enough to handle it and so forth


and so on.  We don't think that that's realistic.  State


courts handle matters of Federal jurisdiction all the

time.  We depend upon State courts to interpret the


Constitution and properly apply the Fourth, Fifth, other


amendments.  There's no reason why they -- they can't


handle Fair Labor Standards Act cases, and they handle


them all the time.  We filed many -- we have brought many


Fair Labor Standards Act cases.  Most are removed to


Federal court because removing to Federal court makes the


case take a lot longer.


QUESTION:  No one would suggest that a State


court isn't competent to hear an ordinary tort case, an


ordinary contract case, but if there's a diversity of


citizenship, it can be removed to the Federal court. 


Removal doesn't mean that the State court is in -- in any


respect incompetent.


MR. PINAUD:  I agree. 


I don't think removal 

means that the State court is incompetent.  I -- I was


addressing an argument made that essentially that, well,


State court judges don't have enough experience, they're


not -- Federal courts are better at handling these things. 


I don't think that that's fair nor realistic.  State


courts handle these matters all the time.


Fair Labor Standards Act cases are not overly


complex.  They're certainly not as complicated as


Title VII cases which States handle all the time and


handle their own similar anti-discrimination cases all the

import.

QUESTION:  Fine, Mr. Pinaud.


MR. PINAUD:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hament.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. HAMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. HAMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Since 1875, a defendant in a civil action has


had a right to remove a case arising under Federal law to


a U.S. district court. 


This right is currently codified 

in 28 U.S.C. 1441(a), which authorizes a civil action --


the removal of a civil action of which the Federal


district court has original jurisdiction except as


otherwise expressly -- otherwise expressly prohibited by


an act of Congress.  The except as otherwise expressly


provided language was added in 1948.


The court below correctly ruled that respondent


had a right to remove this case for three reasons.


First, the plain language of 1441(a) which


allows removal of a case arising under Federal law, such


23

as a Fair Labor Standards Act case, unless Congress has


expressly prohibited removal.  There is nothing in the


text of the Fair Labor Standards Act or its legislative


history which even mentions the word removal much less


expressly prohibits it.


Second, Congress has explicitly prohibited


removal in a series of enactments, and when it has done


so, it has used very explicit language directly referring


to removal.


Third, the words, may be maintained, in any


court -- or any Federal or State court of competent


jurisdiction in the Fair Labor Standards Act is identical


to language that Congress has used in other statutes,


including the Family Medical Leave Act and the Employee


Polygraph Protection Act. 


If this Court were to rule that 

removal is barred under the Fair Labor Standards Act, then


this would affect those statutes.  And again, there is


nothing in the text of those statutes which suggests that


Congress was attempting to prohibit removal.  The word is


not mentioned in the text or the legislative history.


When Congress has prohibited removal in a series


of statutes, starting in 1910, it has very directly used


the word removal, and this has happened both before and


after it enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938.


In fact, in 1948, Congress created a section of


24

the 28 -- Title 28 under section 1445 and entitled it


Non-Removable Actions.


In 1910, Congress stated that certain


railroad -- cases against railroads under the Federal


Employer Liability Act, FELA, that actions arising under


those laws may not be removed -- used the words, may not


be removed.


In 1914, Congress passed an enactment stating


that certain actions against common carriers may not be


removed.


In 1933, they passed the Securities Act and used


the words, shall not be removed.


So these laws were in place using very direct


language when the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in


1938.


Since the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted,


we have examples of four different laws that were passed


by Congress, some in 1441(a), some stand alone, that use


the words, may not be removed or shall not be removed. 


The last one was the actions under the Violence Against


Women's Act of 1994.  So we know from example after


example what Congress had in mind in 1948 when it used the


words, except as other expressly provided.


QUESTION:  But the Wage and Hour Division


didn't.  In 1947, it expressed the opinion that Fair Labor

Standards Act cases were not removable.


MR. HAMENT:  Number one, Justice Ginsburg, at


this point the Department of Labor has changed their


position, and I think that's because of the addition in


1948 of the very express standard that except as otherwise


expressly provided by an act of Congress, this type of


case would be removable.


QUESTION:  Well, what do we care what their


position is?  This is not a matter that's within their


administration, is it?  Do they administer the -- the


removability of matters in -- in Federal courts?


MR. HAMENT:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So, you know, their -- their view on


that matter is -- is no more persuasive than -- than


yours, if I may say so.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  And yours might be very persuasive. 


They have the --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  They have the power to persuade, and


they're knowledgeable.


MR. HAMENT:  Respondent's relying on the view of


Congress which set forth a very clear standard in 1441(a)


that these types of actions are removable unless expressly


prohibited, and we're relying on Congress.

 QUESTION:  Is your position they were never


removable or that the law changed in 1948?


MR. HAMENT:  Our position is that they were


never removable.


QUESTION:  And the -- the Department was just


wrong on its opinion.


MR. HAMENT:  Correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Though what he I guess was driving at


is what the -- in 1938, the year I was born, I'm in San


Francisco, but there are a lot of workers down in Salinas


putting artichokes in cans.  And their employer perhaps


was violating the law, so they go into the State court in


Salinas and the employer runs up to San Francisco.  And


once he can remove that case to San Francisco, it's too


expensive for the employee to run up there.  And that was


why your opponent says they -- they wrote this statute. 


They used the word maintained, and the administrator who


was present at the creation, so to speak, had followed


that for quite a long period of time.


Now, you're -- you're saying look at the


language.  The language just isn't good enough.  Is there


anything else you want to add on that?


MR. HAMENT:  Well, Justice Breyer --


QUESTION:  You know, on the purposive part.


MR. HAMENT:  Yes.  Yes.  Justice Breyer,

there -- there is no legislative history to support that


Congress was intending to prohibit removal for that or


for -- or for any other reason.  And -- and yes, in --


there are small claims that are possible under the Fair


Labor Standards Act, but there are also very large claims,


including very large collective actions.  If Congress


wanted to put a limit on the amount of claim that could be


brought in a Federal court, then Congress could certainly


do that, as it has done in other statutes, and as -- as it


has also done in limiting removal of certain cases based


on amount.  But Congress hasn't chosen to do that.


Turning to the point of the effect of a ruling


that these words, may be maintained, could bar removal


under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as mentioned and as


counsel for the petitioner concedes, this would also 

prohibit removal under the Family Medical Leave Act, the


Employee Polygraph Protection Act --


QUESTION:  Well, it might if you -- it might not


if you, in fact, did put considerable weight on the


knowledgeable views of the -- of the administrators who


were present at that time and the presence of a good


reason for wanting to have achieved that result.  I -- I


grant you, I see problems with the approach I'm


enunciating, but -- but it wouldn't necessarily change


those other acts.

 MR. HAMENT:  I -- I think the problem would be


that the Court would have to -- to eliminate from 1441(a)


the expressly provided otherwise language to -- to achieve


that result.


QUESTION:  Is it meant to apply retroactively in


1948 to those statutes passed preceding 1948?


MR. HAMENT:  I believe -- I believe it was.  If


you look at the timing of the addition of that language in


1948, at that time, the right to remove didn't have the


expressly provided otherwise exception.  It just was a


right to remove, and it was at that time codified in


28 U.S.C., section 71, which had the right to remove.


But coupled in that same paragraph were two


examples of cases where Congress said there was no right


to remove, the FELA action and the action under the 

Interstate Commerce Act dealing with loss of -- or injury


under certain actions against common carriers.  So right


in the same paragraph was this language, may not remove


these two types of cases.


When they reorganized, they moved that language


to 1440 -- 1441 -- 1445 and I think they were just making


clear, when they left the right to remove, that they may


from time to time, as they have, expressly prohibit


removal of certain actions.  So I -- I think the -- the


addition of that language changed nothing.  It is just

simply adopting what the Congress had already applied as a


standard.


QUESTION:  Are you saying then what it did was


to clarify what was ambiguous before, and the


clarification made it apparent that the Wage and Hour


Division had been wrong?  Is that -- is that your


argument?


MR. HAMENT:  I would be a little disingenuous if


I said I think that Congress had looked to the Wage and


Hour brief or the Johnson decision in doing that.  I'm not


sure that they did and my guess is --


QUESTION:  But in any -- in any event, they


clarified --


MR. HAMENT:  Right.


QUESTION: 


-- what they did in 1948 so the error 

of the Wage and Hour Division --


MR. HAMENT:  To the extent they --


QUESTION:  -- meaning --


MR. HAMENT:  -- considered it, they overruled it


because Johnson in that case, although it reached the rule


that -- that there was no removal by implication, said


repeatedly in the decision that Congress was not clear in


expressing its intent.  So to the extent that Congress was


paying attention to Johnson, it overruled it with the


expressly provided other language in 1948.

 If removal were barred in this case, just to


finish on the point of the effect on these other laws, you


could have a very problematic situation, which I'm sure


Congress never intended, of having, for example, an age


discrimination case which would not be removable under the


ADEA, but a race discrimination case under Title VII that


is removable, or a handicap or disability discrimination


case under the American with Disabilities Act which would


be removable.  You'd have ERISA claims which would be


removable, but not claims for leave benefits under the


Family Medical Leave Act.  You'd have a Title VII sex


discrimination claim due to unequal pay that would be


removable, but not an Equal Pay Act case under the Fair


Labor Standards Act.  And again, there's no indication


that Congress, in using the words, may be maintained -- it 

simply confers right of action -- would have ever intended


this effect.


Finally, I'd like to just briefly address


petitioner's argument in the reply brief dealing with


Mitchum v. Foster.  They're arguing that there's similar


language in the anti-injunction statute which says that


except as expressly authorized, a State court


injunction -- a -- a Federal court may not enjoin a State


court, and relies on Mitchum.  This reliance is misplaced.


First, the underlying law in Mitchum was the

Civil Rights Act, the 42 U.S.C. 1983 action.  And the


Court determined that the power to enjoin a State court


under that statute was inherent in the necessary and


indispensable power to remedy civil rights violations. 


And the -- the right to enjoin State court actions was


absolutely essential to the purpose of 1983.


Second, the Court observed that it had a long


history of making exceptions to the anti-removal statute


without directly referring to the anti-removal statute or


State court injunctions.


And third, in --


QUESTION:  Are you talking about the


Anti-Injunction Act or the anti-removal statute?


MR. HAMENT:  Anti-injunction statute, I'm sorry.


And third, in Vendo Company versus Lektro, this 

Court said that the fact that in Mitchum there was no


direct reference to the anti-injunction statute or staying


State court injunctions was cured by the fact that there


was relevant legislative history.


None of those factors are present here. 


Obviously, the Fair Labor Standards Act does not rise and


fall on this removal issue.  Second, Congress has


repeatedly made exceptions very expressly and directly


referring to removal when it made an exception.  And


third, there is no legislative history.

 For these reasons, the respondent respectfully


requests that this Court affirm the Eleventh Circuit's


decision that this case was removable.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Hament.


Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


MS. BLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The general policy of the removal statute is to


give the defendant the same right as the plaintiff to have


his case heard in Federal court.  The removal statute


achieves that objective by permitting the defendant to


remove an action to -- to Federal court if the plaintiff 

could have originally filed his suit there.


There is no dispute in this case that the


plaintiff could have filed this action in Federal court


even had the -- even had the defendant preferred that


the -- that a State court adjudicate the dispute.  The


policies underlying the removal statute are therefore


served by giving the defendant the same right to insist


upon a Federal forum.


Now, the removal statute creates a narrow


exception to this policy when another statute expressly

bars removal.  And Congress has foreclosed removal in a


number of statutes in direct and explicit terms by


providing most notably in section 1445 of Title 28 that,


quote, a civil action in any State court may not be


removed, or in other statutes that no case brought in any


State court shall be removed.  There is no similar


prohibition in the Fair Labor Standards Act, which does


not address the issue of removal at all.


The language in the Fair Labor Standards Act


providing that an action may be maintained in any Federal


or State court of competent jurisdiction does not


expressly foreclose removal.  Rather, it grants an


employee a cause of action over which State and Federal


courts have concurrent jurisdiction.


The language does not purport to trump or 

override generally applicable rules that affect the


disposition of the proceeding such as whether the action


may be stayed or transferred under other express statutory


provisions.


QUESTION:  What you're saying sounds so


sensible.  Why was it that a number of Federal courts


didn't get it, Ms. Blatt?  There was quite a division of


authority on this question and the Wage and Hour Division


originally took the other view.


QUESTION:  You want to be very careful about

answering how Federal courts don't get things.


(Laughter.)


MS. BLATT:  There was division and there still


is division today, but we think that the 1948 revision


makes amply clear that what's required is an express bar. 


And when compared to the established template of the other


statutes where Congress has foreclosed jurisdiction in


direct, unambiguous terms, it makes clear that the -- the


correct answer is that the actions are subject to removal.


And the example I wanted to give was about why


the word maintain doesn't speak to how the action may be


disposed of under other provisions was a bankruptcy


petition.  Under Federal law that would operate to stay


the continuation of any judicial proceeding, and a similar


result would hold true under State and Federal venue 

provisions.  And we think the same result is true under a


Federal removal legislation.


There's nothing in the Fair Labor Standards Act


that suggests that the plaintiff's initial choice of a


State law -- State court forum must prevail over the


defendant's express statutory right to remove an action


under section 1441(a), and we think the employee's right


to sue accordingly is subject to removal.


And the only thing I -- I'd like to address in


response to the petitioner's argument is this principle of

narrow construction.  We don't think that principle


applies for basically two reasons.


And the first is that because there was no


dispute about the Federal court's jurisdiction to hear


this case, again notwithstanding Florida's interest in the


case or even if the -- had the defendant preferred the


State court forum, the plaintiff could have insisted that


the Federal court hear the dispute.  And thus the only


relevant inquiry is not one of narrow interpretation, but


it's a standard that's set forth on the -- under the plain


terms of the statute itself, and that is whether another


statute expressly bars removal.  And we think for the


reasons that have been given, even if one were to apply a


principle of narrow construction, it would not be


plausible to construe the word maintain as an express bar 

to removal.


And for those reasons, we would urge that this


Court affirm the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Blatt.


Mr. Pinaud, you have 5 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. PINAUD, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PINAUD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


Justice Ginsburg, you had asked respondent a


question about whether or not the -- the 1948 amendments

could have in any way been intended to -- to clarify the


removability of Fair Labor Standards Act cases.  And as --


as I think I mentioned earlier, I -- I just wanted to add,


I think respondent agreed with that.  I don't agree


because, as I stated, if you look through the Reviser's


Notes, they -- they are extraordinarily meticulous.  They


list what they are doing and why --


QUESTION:  I didn't ask whether they intended


to.  I asked whether they did.  I don't know that -- that


Congress paid any attention to this particular Johnson


against Butler Brothers case.


MR. PINAUD:  Oh, no.  No, it did not.  It


certainly did not.  And I -- I think that is important.


I -- I think also that these public policy


concerns that -- that Justice Breyer was -- was 

discussing, these are really very important concerns that


we don't think should be overlooked.  This is a time where


you don't have an interstate highway system.  You don't


have a whole lot of time -- a whole lot of lawyers who


want to practice in Federal court or who can practice in


Federal court.  There were claims at the time for as low


as -- as low as $11.  Even the cases today, when they're


individually brought, they're not typically enormous


cases.  These are -- these are employees suing for their


wages, trying to have an opportunity to -- to collect them

without it being inordinately long or inordinately


impractical.  Nobody is going to take a case for $11 or


$250.


QUESTION:  Was there ever a proposal made in


Congress to give workers who have FLSA claims the same


express provision that is there for railroad workers?


MR. PINAUD:  Not that we know of, but it's our


position that that would be because Congress, at the time


it passed this law, believed it was express, that that was


the prevailing opinion, and that even now that was still


the opinion of about half of -- about half of the courts,


half of -- half of the district courts.  You know, this


is -- district courts every day -- in fact, after this --


I think just before this Court granted certiorari, there


was a district court in -- in Texas that said, absolutely 

these cases need to be staying in State court.


So I think Congress didn't get -- I don't know


why Congress didn't get involved in it, but I would think


it would be because they thought maintained was express


enough, that maintain was good enough.


Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no further


questions, I have nothing further.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Pinaud.


MR. PINAUD:  Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.
