CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now on No. 01-147, Securities and Exchange Commission 


versus Charles Zandford.  Mr. Roberts. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. ROBERTS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court.  Stockbrokers like the respondent are


the critical link between the National Securities Markets


and individual investors who trust brokers to buy and sell


securities for their benefit. 


Respondent betrayed that trust by selling his


customers' securities not for their benefit, but for a


secret purpose of misappropriating the proceeds and by


embezzling the proceeds as he had planned. 


In so doing, Respondent violated Section 10(b)


of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  Those


provisions prohibit the use of fraud in connection with


the purchase or sale of any security.  Respondent --


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, could you clarify for me


what the government's position is in this case? 


Suppose -- suppose that the broker had not, when


he sold the stock, intended to embezzle but then he made


the sale and the sale enabled his embezzling.  After

selling it, he conceived the scheme to embezzle. 


Is it the government's position that in that


situation a 10(b) would still cover it? 


MR. ROBERTS:  That embezzlement would not be in


connection with the prior sale under the theory that we


are asking the Court to adopt here.  But the SEC believes


that it would be a violation of 10(b) under a different


theory which isn't a necessary consequence of the one --


QUESTION:  We don't have to agree with that to


rule for you --


MR. ROBERTS:  You don't have to agree with that


to find a violation here. 


QUESTION:  Now, the SEC adjudications that you


rely upon, what kind of a situation do they involve?  Do


they all involve --


MR. ROBERTS:  They involve both situations, Your


Honor. 


QUESTION:  Both situations. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Both situations. 


QUESTION:  Does the SEC routinely audit brokers'


accounts or do spot audits to ensure compliance with the


theory you are suggesting here or are they just reactive


when they find out about a firm? 


MR. ROBERTS:  I am not aware that they routinely


audit the brokers.  The NASD does do that and then refers

matters to the SEC and consults with the SEC.  The SEC


also would respond to complaints that they got or take


investigations if they had reason to believe it was called


to their attention. 


QUESTION:  And I take it that if the NASD tells


the SEC of the existence of a fraud, the SEC can then


request the United States Government to prosecute if there


is a wire fraud or --


MR. ROBERTS:  They could request a prosecution,


Your Honor, but it's important that the SEC is the federal


agency that's charged with maintaining the integrity of


the markets and investor confidence in the markets, have


direct authority to prevent and to pursue the kind of


fraud that's involved here which is very -- potentially


very unsettling to the markets. 


Because since most transactions are made through


brokers, if customers and investors can't trust their


brokers to be executing their transactions for the


customer's benefit rather than for the broker's benefits,


the markets can't function effectively. 


QUESTION:  Well, do you say then that any fraud


by a broker in connection with a customer is actionable by


the SEC. 


MR. ROBERTS:  That goes back to the question


that Justice Scalia asked me, Your Honor.  And under the

theory that we are advocating here, and for the Court to


rule for us here, you don't need to conclude that.  The


SEC does take that position. 


QUESTION:  Does take what position? 


MR. ROBERTS:  That any fraudulent conversion by


a broker from a brokerage account is a violation of 10(b)


because it's fraud and it's in connection with the


purchase or sale of securities; because the very purpose


of the brokerage account is to buy and sell securities. 


And the broker has access to the customer's assets --


QUESTION:  That's quite a leap --


MR. ROBERTS:  -- for the purpose of --


QUESTION:  That's a leap from any case we've


ever decided. 


MR. ROBERTS:  That is beyond any case that I'm


aware that you have decided.  But here the broker actually


converted the securities by means of fraudulent sales. 


And his deception not only caused the sales, it was


material to the sales.  And the sales themselves, because


they were fraudulent, coincided with and completed the


fraud. 


And that's very much in tune -- that's really


controlled by past cases of the Court.  For instance in


the Bankers Life case, the Court held that corporate


fiduciaries violated Section 10(b) when they deceived the

corporation into believing that it would receive the


proceeds of the securities that the corporation sold. 


QUESTION:  But there were misrepresentations


about a particular security.  That didn't happen here. 


MR. ROBERTS:  There wasn't a misrepresentation


in Bankers Life about a particular security, there was a


misrepresentation that the corporation would receive the


proceeds.  And there was that same misrepresentation here,


Your Honor, only it was by way of an omission or a course


of conduct rather than an affirmative statement. 


Because the customers had entrusted Respondent


with the authority to trade on their behalf, with the


understanding and the implicit representation that he


would trade on their behalf and that they would receive


the proceeds of the sales, that they would be used for


their benefit in other trades when --


QUESTION:  So in this case the fraud could have


been avoided under your theory if the broker had gotten in


touch with the clients and said I'm going to sell this but


I'm going to use the money for myself.  That would have


turned it from fraud under 10(b) into theft. 


MR. ROBERTS:  That would have turned it from


fraud into theft.  It would have also been a breach of his


fiduciary duty if he went ahead and they didn't authorize


him.  But just like in O'Hagan --

 QUESTION:  But it wouldn't have been fraud. 


MR. ROBERTS:  It wouldn't have been fraud if


there was no deception.  It's critical to a 10(b)e


violation that there be deception of some kind. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, there's one point in


your reply brief that I didn't quite grasp.  This action


is brought by the SEC. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And it hinges on the wrong that was


done to the customer.  Could the customer bring this very


lawsuit, could the customer have sued the broker for a


10(b) violation? 


MR. ROBERTS:  In this circumstance, yes, the


customer could have brought a private action against the


broker, Your Honor.  That wouldn't be true in every


circumstance because the customer, a private plaintiff


seeking damages has to prove elements of a violation in


addition to what the SEC must prove. 


A customer has to show causation of the


transaction and loss or damages to the customer.  The


customer also has to be an actual purchaser seller.  In


the situation where there's a sale by the broker of the


customer's securities, the purchaser-seller requirement


will be met. 


But there might not be the damages that are

necessary unless the broker follows through with his


scheme to misappropriate the proceeds of the sale. 


QUESTION:  But this time he did. 


MR. ROBERTS:  But he did. 


QUESTION:  There's another curiosity in this


case.  There was a prosecution for wire fraud, the


restitution sought was $10,800.  And now the SEC is going


after the broker for a much larger sum.  Why wasn't a


greater sum asked in the wire fraud case? 


MR. ROBERTS:  I don't know, Your Honor, why the


restitution award in the criminal action was limited to


$10,000.  But it's clear that Respondent, it's clear from


the allegations in the complaint and also from the


criminal trial that Respondent did embezzle far more than


that amount of the Woods' assets. 


And that's one of the reasons that it's


important for the SEC to be able to pursue this action. 


Because if it had to rely on the criminal action, then


there wouldn't be a full disgorgement of the improper


gains by the broker.  And there would be far less


deterrent to this kind of activity.  Of course a criminal


prosecution is significant deterrent, but --


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, did the allegations of


your complaint in this case accord with the narrower


theory that you now say is enough to decide this case?

That is to say, as I read your description of the


complaint, it did not say that the sales of the security


were made with the intention at the time the sales were


made of absconding with the proceeds.  All it said is that


he sold the securities and stole the funds. 


MR. ROBERTS:  It does -- it does comport with


our theory, Your Honor.  It doesn't in so many words


allege the intent at the time.  But the factual


allegations in the complaint necessarily give rise to that


inference.  Because, first, one of the allegations is that


Respondent issued checks to himself on the mutual fund


account and that the cashing of those checks caused the


sales. 


And so when he took the money, he necessarily by


writing the checks to himself, he necessarily had the


intent at the time.  And then there are additional


allegations --


QUESTION:  Wait.  Excuse me.  He wrote the


checks before the sales were made? 


MR. ROBERTS:  In the -- in the mutual fund


checks, if you look at Page 28A, of the petition, in


paragraph 16 of the complaint, it describes the beginning


of the fraudulent scheme in May of 1988, shortly after Mr.


Wood was hospitalized as a result of his stroke, and notes


that between May and June 1988, Zandford, without the

prior knowledge or consent of Wood and Okstulski, issued


three checks to himself totaling $41,000. 


The checks were drawn on a joint mutual fund


account held by Wood and Okstulski outside of their


Dominick account, and the funds represented therein were


obtained through the sale of mutual fund shares --


QUESTION:  It doesn't say they were later


obtained.  It just says they were obtained.  I don't see


that that says that the funds weren't there until the --


until the checks were written. 


MR. ROBERTS:  I think the way that that kind of


account works is that it's like a checking account with


your mutual funds.  You write the check, you write the


checks on the account and the redeeming of the check


causes the sales of the mutual funds.  But regardless of


whether it precisely states that, that's certainly a


reasonable inference or facts that can be proved based on


these allegations which is all that's necessary to get


past the dismissal of the complaint, Your Honor. 


And in addition on the other allegations on the


next page and the paragraphs on the next page, there are


description of repeated sales and repeated conversions


over a long period of time.  And, you know, one time maybe


he formed the intent after the sales, although that's


unlikely given that this happened after the allegations in

the previous paragraph.  But 13 more times, Your Honor, I


think that it's hard to believe. 


QUESTION:  Who gets the recovery, Mr. Roberts? 


MR. ROBERTS:  The recovery goes to the -- to the


government, but the SEC has a policy of if there are


identifiable victims to endeavor to give the victims those


-- those funds and to make them whole if they are


available.  So here where there are identifiable victims,


they would do that. 


QUESTION:  Well, isn't it a little odd, you have


two different branches of the government, perhaps not


branches, but two different proceedings, one a criminal


proceeding which authorizes restitution.  And in that


proceeding the decision was made that $10,000 would be


allowed, awarded in restitution. 


Then the SEC comes along and says, no, that


wasn't enough.  We want to get, you know, several hundred


thousand more. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the restitution, first of


all, the purposes of restitution and disgorgement are


different in that one is aimed on the -- is focused on the


making whole the loss to the -- to the people that are


injured, whereas the other is aimed at requiring the


wrongdoer to disgorge any benefit that he got from the


scheme.

 But in addition, Your Honor, the statute


provides for a civil action and gives the SEC the power to


do that in order to further its role in ensuring the


integrity of the markets and ensuring investor confidence


in the markets.  And it empowers the SEC rather than the


individual U.S. attorneys to determine when it's necessary


to ask for that kind of a remedy in order to further those


purposes.  And the SEC properly made that determination,


made that determination here. 


QUESTION:  Well, just to explore the point, is


there anything in the record to show that these victims


lost only $10,000 and that the broker just made all the


rest by churning --


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  Their record I think


establishes that they lost everything that they had


entrusted to him which was 420 roughly, thousands of


dollars' worth. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, isn't it the case


sometimes in criminal proceedings where restitution is


ordered that full restitution is not ordered for a variety


of reasons, the victim's family -- the defendant's family


may have certain needs and the Court may decide, well, I'm


just going to order a limited amount of restitution.  Does


that happen sometimes? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, that certainly happens, Your

Honor.  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  And if the family has needs, the SEC


doesn't have to worry about it, I take it? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the SEC does its own


balancing of what's appropriate to further the interests


and it asks for a disgorgement which is an equitable


remedy.  And the Court takes into account those concerns


in deciding whether to award it.  And here the District


Court did determine that it was appropriate to award


disgorgement in the amount of $343,000. 


QUESTION:  It is odd that there was no kind of,


apparently no cooperation here, that the criminal case


goes on for that limited amount and then the SEC comes in


after.  Don't the relevant prosecutors talk to each other


in advance about a case like this? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, they do talk to each other. 


But the decision, Your Honor, whether to bring the


prosecution and what to charge and what to ask for is the


decision of the prosecutors, whereas the decision of what


is appropriate to pursue as a civil action in order to


further the purposes of the securities laws is the


responsibility of the SEC. 


And if the two arms don't necessarily agree that


that can all be done in a criminal proceeding, then


sometimes a civil proceeding is necessary to accomplish

the goals and --


QUESTION:  The SEC is an independent regulatory


agency, isn't it? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, it is. 


QUESTION:  So it's not within the control of the


President? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Um --


QUESTION:  So if the Justice Department


disagrees with the SEC, the SEC can still go off on its


own.  Is that the way the scheme works in theory? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, in theory, Your Honor, yes. 


Although here in the Supreme Court the Solicitor General


represents the SEC.  And in order for the SEC to come


here, the Solicitor General has to authorize the action. 


QUESTION:  Is there any limit, if we have a


broker, a licensed broker, is there any limit at all or


just any fraud by a licensed broker falls within 10(b)? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, again, I'd like to reiterate


that to decide this case and under the theory that we are


advancing here, you don't need to reach that.  But even


under the other theory that I alluded to, there are limits


to what would be covered. 


For instance a broker could defraud customers by


convincing them to pursue an investment advisory


relationship.  And that would not be -- that would not

necessarily be covered. 


In addition, the broker might defraud the


customers of assets that are outside of the brokerage


account and that aren't securities because the broker has


developed a relationship of trust with the customer.  That


wouldn't be covered under the other theory. 


In addition, the broker, I guess it's a similar


thing, the broker could defraud the customer into making


some other kind of investments, real estate investments,


because of the relationship of trust that had developed. 


But the SEC has consistently taken the position


that with regard to brokerage accounts and the brokerage


relationship that involves the purchase or sale of


securities and that exists for the purpose of the purchase


or sale of securities, that it is a violation when the


broker defrauds its customer. 


QUESTION:  Suppose the -- suppose Zandford were


not a licensed broker, he just was pretending to be a


broker but he wasn't at all.  He went to these people and


said, I'm a broker, give me your money; and the same thing


happened? 


MR. ROBERTS:  That would still be -- and then he


-- they gave him the money and he purchased securities and


then sold the securities? 


QUESTION:  Yes, but he's not licensed to sell

any. 


MR. ROBERTS:  That would still be a violation,


Your Honor, because he would have the same fiduciary


relationship with them by virtue of them making him their


agent for securities transactions and entrusting their


assets to him to engage in securities transactions.  And


when he sold for the secret purpose of misappropriating


the proceeds rather than for their benefit, and he did not


disclose that he was doing that, he would be deceiving


them in connection with the sale of securities, just as


Mr. Zandford did here.  And that would be a violation


under these circumstances. 


If there are no further questions, I would like


to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Roberts.  Mr.


Goldblatt, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN H. GOLDBLATT 


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court: 


We do not dispute, I don't think it can be


disputed, that this conduct obviously is covered by any


number of laws, civil, criminal, state, federal, the rules


of this self-regulatory organization, and the Court below


recognized that as well.  But it treated the question of

whether or not Mr. Zandford was also liable under Section


10(b) as a different question requiring a specific proof. 


And it is that proof that the Court found wanting. 


In that regard, I think it's also important that


one of the pivotal factors in our theory of the case was


that this was a discretionary account.  And the SEC was


relying on the bare facts alleged in the wire fraud


indictment to prove its case.  And under those


circumstances, there was no investment decision being made


by the victims in this case. 


And we argued to the Court below and we submit


to this Court that that's a pivotal distinction in 10(b)


context.  Because 10(b) deals with investment decisions. 


And if no one is being defrauded in the decision they are


making as to the purchase or sale, all that leaves the SEC


with in this case is the conversion of the proceeds. 


QUESTION:  Well, the District Court granted


summary judgment in favor of the SEC as I understand it. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  And the Court of Appeals reversed and


in effect granted summary judgment for Mr. Zandford. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's also correct. 


QUESTION:  So you have to take the allegations


in the complaint as true at that point I think, don't you?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Mr. Chief Justice, we don't

think so, because those allegations were not being


considered by the Court of Appeals.  I think the SEC at


various points has indicated in its pleadings that the


facts alleged in the indictment were the same as the


complaint, and that may have caused part of the problem. 


But the only facts alluded to by the Court of Appeals as


you indicated is in effect granting summary judgment to


the non-moving party. 


In that regard, there's no reference at all in


the opinion of the Court of Appeals referring to any of


the facts in the complaint.  They refer to the indictment.


QUESTION:  Well, should there have been some


reference to the facts in the complaints since they were


about to render summary judgment against the SEC? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  That may well be the case.  The


problem we have with that is the question of issue


preservation.  When the SEC petitioned for rehearing,


ordinarily -- in the ordinary case, if you reverse an


order granting summary judgment, you obviously don't grant


summary judgment to the non-moving party; you remand for


further proceedings. 


But when the SEC moved for rehearing and


rehearing en banc, it did not raise the issue with the


Court as to why it had remanded with instructions to


dismiss.  So on this record you really don't know what the

reasoning of the Court of Appeals was. 


QUESTION:  But wouldn't they have to, Mr.


Goldblatt?  This -- a complaint to be thrown out when


there's been nothing beyond the complaint doesn't --


mustn't you listen to the facts as pled in the complaint?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Ginsburg, my point is,


is that the question that I think that is presented in


this case is whether the SEC by its own actions limited


itself to the facts asserted for purposes of summary


judgment which were the facts in the indictment. 


Now, if the Court of Appeals is operating under


the assumption that that was their case, it could, if that


was their case and it was clear that was what it had to


consider, if it concluded those facts were insufficient as


a matter of law, that would be the only rationale in light


of its opinion which only considered the facts in the


indictment. 


QUESTION:  But the government's petition here


sets forth some facts.  The stockbroker sells his


customers for his own benefit.  And so it -- and in your


brief in opposition you didn't challenge that question,


did you? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Yes, I did. 


QUESTION:  You did?  What did you say? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  I challenged the -- in our brief

in opposition, we challenged any consideration of any


facts beyond the indictment, that any issue with regard to


facts in the complaint were not before the Court of


Appeals and were not relied on by the SEC. 


QUESTION:  But that just seems weird in a way. 


I mean, this is a civil action.  And to insist that it be


tried on the facts and an indictment in the criminal case


as opposed to as alleged in a complaint in this very case


seems odd. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  I absolutely agree.  But the


question is not so much whether that was of the making of


the Court of Appeals or whether that was of the making of


the SEC.  And I think it was the Court's understanding


that that was the SEC's position, that they were narrowing


themselves to the indictment, and that's what the Court


considered. 


But regardless, even with the facts, I mean, if


I'm wrong on that, regardless of the facts even with the


facts that the SEC relies on from the complaint, you


essentially have the same problem. 


And again, it's not a question of whether this


conduct is covered.  It's covered under the broker rules. 


But for purposes of 10(b) as the SEC now concedes, this


would also affect private actions. 


And in that regard, these facts simply do not

meet the paradigm for a 10(b) violation which is either


that somebody is duped into buying or selling a security,


a particular security, because that's the paradigm for the


statute, or in limited circumstances such as a case like


O'Hagan, where it affects market integrity, the Court has


also found liability.  But that's in a situation --


QUESTION:  Suppose that the customer comes to


the broker and says, here's 100 shares of the ABC Company,


sell these shares for me and put the money in your broker


account.  And the broker, before he sells, has the intent


to take the money for the broker's own account.  Is there


a fraud under your theory? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Under that theory, I would


submit there is a fraud.  That is unauthorized to take the


money in that situation and he's duped into turning over


the securities to the broker, and there is an investment


decision being made.  But you have a particular --


QUESTION:  No.  No.  He's made the investment


decision in my hypothetical.  He said, I don't want your


advice about selling.  You sell these things.  I'm


directing you to do that. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  In that circumstance, if he then


sells the security and places it in the account, then he


has completed the instructions.  But if he sells the


security and converts it to his own use, then I believe

you don't have in that situation, in other words, if those


are the instructions from the client to the broker -- I


correct myself.  That would not be a 10(b)e violation. 


It will be a violation of the broker rules.  It


will be a conversion.  It will be a criminal act.  But


there will be no fraud.  He will have carried out the


instructions to sell the stock.  There's no inducement


there to sell --


QUESTION:  Well, only in really a Pickwickian


sense of the term.  He carried out the instructions to


sell the stock but he keeps the money.  Nobody would


construe the instructions that way. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Understood.  But nor were -- the


instructions were to sell the stock.  He is not being


duped into selling the stock.  That is exactly what he


wanted done.  What he's being duped into is the proceeds


are being converted.  But the difference with Bankers Life


is that the 10(b) violator in that case actually goes to


the person and says we should sell this, with the intent


of diverting the proceeds. 


That person is duped into believing by the actor


that they are making the sale with the understanding that


they will get the proceeds.  Again it -- for purposes 


of --


QUESTION:  How does that differ from here?  I

thought here that what our facts that we are assuming are


that the stockbroker says to the client, I have control of


your account and I'll sell for your benefit.  That's the


implicit instruction. 


The client says sell for my benefit.  And here


the stockbroker sells for his own benefit.  What's the


difference between that case which is this one, and the


one Justice Kennedy is submitting? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  I think the difference is for


purposes of the 10(b) paradigm it requires that the sale


be induced by the broker for fraudulent reasons.  If all


he's doing is converting the proceeds --


QUESTION:  But here we also have, as they have


emphasized about 50 times, not simply stealing.  What we


have is a sale of stock where the stockbroker has the


intent when he sells the stock to keep the money, contrary


to what the implicit assumption is about what the client


wants. 


Now, that seems to be a little extra thing here


so we don't have to reach all these broad issues.  Now,


what do we -- that's what I find indistinguishable. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Breyer, here is the


distinction that I would draw.  In the Bankers Life


situation where you have the sale induced, the 10(b)


violation is complete when the sale is made.

 In the situation you describe, until and unless


the broker, having followed the instructions and sold the


stock, until and unless he actually converts the proceeds


to his own use, you don't have a 10(b) violation.


QUESTION:  Why don't you?  I mean, if we could


ever prove it?  Suppose in fact the broker, because we had


a mind-reading machine, sold the stock in order to convert


the proceeds, puts the money in the account and then dies. 


I mean, you know, it's a little weird, but nonetheless if


we could ever prove such a thing, why wouldn't that be a


violation of 10b-5? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Because until and unless he


actually converts the proceeds, he hasn't violated 10(b). 


He has not done anything against his client's


instructions. 


QUESTION:  He hasn't?  He has converted -- he


has sold the shares, contrary to the instruction, sell


them for my benefit, for his own benefit. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  My point is that until he


actually converts, while that money is still in the


account, while the stock has been sold consistent with the


directions, until and unless he actually converts the


proceeds to his own use, he has not violated 10(b). 


QUESTION:  But what about, never mind the taking


of the proceeds.  Suppose you have a broker who for some

reason because he has an interest in a company or


something else sells stock in a customer's account where


it didn't really make sense to sell it. 


The only benefit from selling it is a benefit


for the broker himself.  His brother-in-law is with a


company that would profit from this sale of the stock. 


Would that be covered by 10(b)? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  I think that would be covered by


10(b). 


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't that the same


situation here?  Because this sale was not a sale -- never


mind the later theft -- the sale was not a sale for the


benefit of the customer which is what he's promised to do.


He's promised, I'll manage these stocks for your


benefit.  And here he sells them when the customer's


interest did not call for a sale.  The only reason the


sale happened is that the broker had his own interest in


mind. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Scalia, the reason why


that doesn't work here is because as the Court of Appeals


found, there's no evidence in this record to establish


that the sales themselves were inconsistent with the


client's interests.  Regardless of what Zandford may have


been thinking, the evidence simply showed that they were


sold.  He has discretionary power to do it --

 QUESTION:  Well, does it have to be


inconsistent?  Do you have to prove that they were


inconsistent with the interest or is it enough to prove


that the broker did not act in the customer's interest? 


Isn't that enough for the breach of the fiduciary duty? 


Even if it turns out that, what do you know, it was a good


idea to sell, the market crashes, nonetheless he was


guilty of a fiduciary breach if he didn't sell it because


he thought it would help the customer but he thought it


would help him.  Wouldn't that be a breach right then and


there? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  It might be a breach of


fiduciary duty in the trust sense.  It does not affect the


sale unless you can establish that the sale is


unauthorized, it is inconsistent with the client's


interest. 


QUESTION:  It is unauthorized.  I didn't


authorize him to sell stock for his benefit.  The whole


idea was he was supposed to sell it for mine. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  But the sale itself was


authorized.  The only point I'm bringing out is in a


situation like Bankers Life where the broker induces the


sale with fraudulent intent, you have a complete violation


when the stock is sold.  It makes no difference after that


whether the broker is successful or unsuccessful in

diverting the proceeds.  You have established a fraudulent


sale in which an investor's decision has been induced by


fraudulent intent. 


In the situation where the sale is authorized,


either because the client calls the broker and says I want


you to sell XYZ Corporation today, and the broker does


that --


QUESTION:  That one I agree with. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  In that situation, regardless of


what the broker is thinking, he may be thinking I'm going


to take the money and run. 


QUESTION:  But that isn't what happened here. 


The customer didn't call up and say sell. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  No, but --


QUESTION:  The broker has authority to sell but


he has authority to sell in the interest of the client. 


And no interest of the client called for the sale of these


securities.  The only thing that called for the sale of


the securities was without selling them, I can't get the


money to steal. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Scalia, in that regard


we point to two decisions from the 7th Circuit in O'Brien


and Congregation that deal with discretionary accounts. 


And when a client turns money over to an investment


counselor or broker and says, you make the decisions, I'm

giving you blanket authority, and that's what we have in


this record; in that situation, that takes you out of the


10(b) paradigm. 


QUESTION:  Well, it's true in effect that not


every breach of fiduciary duty is a fraud. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's correct.  Not every


breach of fiduciary duty is a fraud, and not every breach


of fiduciary duty will violate 10(b). 


QUESTION:  But in your paradigm, you are saying


the authorization is induced by fraud and that's crucial. 


But in -- why don't you have the equivalent of it here? 


Because what you have here is a continuing


authorization.  There is an authorization generally given


at the beginning and the theory is that that authorization


continues so that at every moment subsequent to that the


client is saying yes, you may sell these things or buy as


you see fit for my benefit, so that at any moment at which


the client remains silent and allows that authorization to


continue, if at that moment the broker has formed the


intent, which you would take to be sufficient, why doesn't


that function in the same way as the authorization


specifically induced? 


The client is being quiet and he's continuing


the authorization because the broker is implicitly lying.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Souter, my answer to

that is this:  If it is shown, in other words, assuming


you have a discretionary account to invest conservatively,


if a broker then goes and buys a penny stock, that is


outside the scope of the discretionary authorization and


it would be a violation of 10(b).  What the --


QUESTION:  Well, it's outside of the


authorization at the beginning because the authorization


under no circumstances covered that kind of a sale. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Yes, it was outside the scope of


the authority. 


QUESTION:  But the term of the authorization


that I'm saying is crucial, and what I thought you were


saying is crucial in the case that you succeed is the term


of the authorization that in effect says, you may sell


this stock for my benefit.  And you are saying if a


specific decision to that effect is induced by fraud,


that's enough.  It gets you within the rule. 


And I'm saying if a continuing decision, a


decision evidenced by the client's silence is induced,


that should be sufficient too. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  And one of the things that the


Court of Appeals found here was that that was not


established.  With regard to the various sales, when these


checks were written, the Court concluded there was nothing


in the record to conclude that those sales --

 QUESTION:  Okay.  Then maybe this case should


come out your way.  But as a matter of theory, isn't it


the same case whether it's a continuing authorization or


an authorization which is specifically induced? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  In either situation if you can


show that the sale itself is a violation of that


authorization or a breach of it, yes.  But in this case


the Court was very careful on that in saying not only that


this was a discretionary account, but in light of the


allegations in the indictment there was just no proof in


the record that any of these sales were in violation --


QUESTION:  Yes, but you are going back to the


indictment and ignoring the complaint. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Even with the complaint there's


really nothing in the complaint that they are relying on


other than the mutual fund account, and again --


QUESTION:  Well, the course of conduct, one


transaction after another is relevant; isn't it? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Not given the time factor.  And


we are not talking -- the time factor is actually from


March of '88 to September of '90.  And in that regard


there's just nothing in the record -- we don't even know


what the securities were that were bought or sold.  And


that's the problem with their theory of this case.  It's


overarching in where it goes.

 There's no proof that any of these sales were


not consistent with the authorization, were not in the


client's interests.  And they didn't attempt to prove it.


QUESTION:  In the case of churning --


QUESTION:  Well, is there any proof that any of


the proceeds were ever given to the owner of the


principal? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  The proof is that the proceeds


go to three contracts that were determined by the jury in


the wire fraud case to be fraudulent that are agreements


that were between Zandford and the clients.  One was a


personal loan, one was an investment that the Court


determined to be fraudulent.  That's where the fraud takes


place.  That's where the conversion takes place, not


sooner, under our theory and under what the Court found. 


QUESTION:  You say that there's no evidence that


the sale was made for the fraud.  But if as the government


says, some of these sales were made to cover a check


written on the account, the sale would not have occurred


had the check not been written.  And that check he wrote


to himself or to one of these contract accounts.  Doesn't


that make it automatic that the sale occurred in order to


get the money to pay him? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  I don't believe so, Justice


Scalia.  And I don't believe that was their theory in the

indictment.  The checks were written on the account but he


had authority to do that.  There's no --


QUESTION:  Fine. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  -- indication that was wrong --


QUESTION:  And is the writing of the check what


caused the sale? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Positions were liquidated in


order to pay the checks. 


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  But there's no indication that


those sales were not a deliberate decision to sell those


securities at that point to take the money and put it into


something else.  There's nothing to indicate that that was


unauthorized to do that.  Because we don't know what the


thoughts were. 


QUESTION:  It was authorized? 


QUESTION:  I'm missing something.  Why do you


write the check first if all you intend to do is to take


the proceeds and buy another stock for the client's


benefit?  It's the sequence of the check, I think, that's


bothering me. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well, the sequence of the check


is to take the money out of the account and invest it


otherwise, which is why you would do it that way or could


do it that way.  But we know very little about it.  But

QUESTION:  Doesn't it matter who the check is


written to?  I mean, I presume these checks that the


government was referring to were not checks sort of


payable to the mutual fund to buy more stock or payable


for the purchase of other stock.  It was simply payable to


the broker; wasn't it? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well, it was payable to the


broker or accounts controlled by the broker.  But as the


evidence establishes in the record on affirming the appeal


on the sufficiency of the evidence claim, the money went


into other investments.  And that's what Zandford's


defense was.  These were other legitimate investments and


that's what I was doing with the money, and they knew


about it and that's what that was.


QUESTION:  So they can't -- you are saying they


can't trace any proceeds necessarily from the checks drawn


into Zandford's personal accounts or --


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well, they -- the way they


describe it, it goes to accounts controlled by Zandford. 


So they do indicate that the conversion of the proceeds


into other investments was fraudulent. 


QUESTION:  Well, let me just see what your


theory is here.  Suppose the way it works is that there's


a mutual fund account and the broker decides, I want to

take this money for my own purposes to spend on a pleasure


cruise.  I write the check that causes the sale of the


security.  Under your theory, is there a 10b-5 violation?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  If the writing of the check is


unauthorized, it's going to be a 10b-5 violation. 


QUESTION:  Everybody knows he didn't -- the


client didn't authorize the broker to take a pleasure


cruise.  That's my hypothetical. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Then it would be a 10b-5e


violation.  What the Court found lacking here was any


evidence that the sale itself of the securities by the


writing of the check established a 10b-5 --


QUESTION:  But it's alleged properly.  I mean, I


read on Page 29A, in July -- there's a misprint in the


paragraph, but in July 1998 Zandford without the prior


knowledge or consent of -- must be of Wood -- sold three


securities in the Wood account for a total of $145,000. 


What their claim is, is that without the client's consent,


the broker sold the securities and then after that he used


the proceeds for himself.  All right.  Now, on your


theory, that alleges a violation of the securities law. 


Is that right? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Under my theory, that would


allege it. 


QUESTION:  All right.

 MR. GOLDBLATT:  But the Court of Appeals 


found --


QUESTION:  Fine.  Then the correct thing of


disposition in your view of this case, since the


allegation is there, and since the Court of Appeals said


that the criminal case didn't investigate this matter


about whether it was or without the client's consent, your


view is we should have a remand so that they can have a


trial on the question of whether Mr. Wood did consent to


the sale.  Is that right? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  No, Justice Breyer, that's not


right. 


QUESTION:  Because? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Because two things.  One, the


Court of Appeals found that there was no evidence because


it was a discretionary account, that there was anything


unauthorized about it.  There wasn't any consent needed. 


QUESTION:  Of course there was no evidence. 


That's because the government relied upon the criminal


case.  So the Court of Appeals says they are wrong to rely


on that.  Then as you pointed out at the beginning, the


correct result is to send it back so now the government


has a chance to put in other evidence, if you are right


about what the evidence shows. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  In the ordinary course I would

agree with that.  All other things being equal, that would


be the result.  But if in fact the SEC by its litigation


posture chose to rest exclusively on the criminal


indictment, this other case --


QUESTION:  You mean there is something in this


record where the SEC says, by the way, if this criminal


case does not provide sufficient evidence, we do not


intend to put in any other evidence.  Where does it say


that? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  It doesn't say that.  There are


representations that the criminal case is the same as the


civil case.  At the time of our argument in this case, we


argued to the Court that if this is all they have, if the


criminal indictment is -- yes, in the Court of Appeals. 


If this is all they have, then there's nothing to send it


back for.  Because this evidence in the criminal case --


QUESTION:  You mean it's going to be agreed that


there is no doubt that this retarded individual of a very


advanced age agreed that his securities would be sold for


the purpose of the broker running off with the money? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Breyer, I think that --


QUESTION:  I say that with some sarcasm in my


voice, because it sounds to me incredible. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Obviously these are very hard


facts to argue.  But my point is, he went to jail for

almost five years.  It violates all sorts of rules,


provisions, statutes, there's no question about this. 


This conduct is controlled.  The Court of Appeals had no


doubt about that.  But a 10(b) violation is different. 


And also the SEC's litigation posture is different.  If


they are going to give up the facts in the complaint and


argue the case on the indictment, in a strategical attempt


to get the Court to rule the way they want, which is the


broadest possible 10(b), then they have got to live with


it.  And when the fact --


QUESTION:  That's for purposes of their


affirmative motion for summary judgment.  They could then


say these facts are established.  That's not a sufficient


reason for granting summary judgment the other way around.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  I absolutely agree, Justice


Stevens, and our only point there is --


QUESTION:  Therefore, we should not ignore the


allegations of the complaint that go beyond the


indictment. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  The only objection I have to


that is the fact that they sought rehearing and they


sought rehearing and bond, and not one word was mentioned


about a remand for dismissal.  They were still arguing


collateral estoppel and on the facts of the indictment we


win outright.  They did not even bring it to the attention

of the Court. 


QUESTION:  That's because they were trying to


win outright. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's right. 


QUESTION:  But that doesn't justify your winning


outright. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  When they file -- of course. 


There's no question that both sides agree that Bankers


Life and O'Hagan control and we say it's clear we win. 


That's the normal case.  But when they don't seek


rehearing on that basis so this Court doesn't even know


why the Court of Appeals did what it did, and when they


file for certiori and don't raise that as a claim for


reversing or --


QUESTION:  Well, when you say we don't know the


reason why the Court of Appeals did what it did, I mean,


it wrote an opinion, which usually gives the reason why


the Court of Appeals did what it did.  Are you complaining


that they didn't say anything on rehearing?


MR. GOLDBLATT:  What I'm saying is when this


comes up for the first time in the opinion of the Court of


Appeals and they file for rehearing, and they don't even


bring it to the attention of the Court so that the Court


can determine whether there is something to be corrected


or whether this is the Court's understanding from oral

argument that is what their case is. 


QUESTION:  You are saying that the government


didn't raise this issue in their petition for rehearing to


the Court of Appeals. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  They did not even mention it. 


QUESTION:  Well, but I don't know that they have


to.  I mean, so long as they properly petition here, I


don't know that you need have a petition for rehearing in


the Court of Appeals. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Ordinarily I would absolutely


agree, Mr. Chief Justice.  But I think when it's something


that comes up in the opinion from the Court of Appeals


that on its face doesn't have any explanation that


basically says instead of going back so you can prove your


case, we're throwing it out completely, and they don't say


a word to the Court of Appeals, that's the wrong remedy. 


I mean, that's the first thing --


QUESTION:  But Mr. Goldblatt, the Court of


Appeals decision didn't turn on issue preclusion, it


turned on a notion that in order to have a violation of


10(b) you had to have some kind of misleading about the


merits of a certain security, something tied to the


security, and not that they regarded this as a common law


crime as theft. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  The Court concluded --

 QUESTION:  I mean, the point they made was it's


the same as if what was entrusted to the broker were a car


and he sold the car for himself instead of the customer. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  The point was that the


securities were incidental to this fraud.  They were not


an integral part of it, and --


QUESTION:  May I just interrupt with one.  The


question presented is whether when the stockbroker sells


his customer's certain securities for his own benefit. 


Now, do we have to assume he sold them for his own benefit


at the time the sale was made or are you saying in fact he


sold them for his principal's benefit and later decided to


appropriate the proceeds? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Stevens, what I am


saying is there is no proof in this record that at the


time of the sales --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe there's no proof but the


question we are asked to decide is when he does it for his


own benefit is it a violation of 10(b)4?  That's what the


question is. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  I understand that, Justice


Stevens, and --


QUESTION:  And what's your answer to the


question?  Your answer to the question is he didn't do it. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  My answer to the question is it

is authorized sale, either on the instructions of the --


QUESTION:  Well, if it's a sale for his own


benefit. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  And at the same time it is also


consistent with the client's instructions, until he


converts, he has not violated 10(b). 


QUESTION:  Even though the sale was for his own


benefit at the time he made the sale.


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Even though he -- if it is for


his own benefit -- in other words, it could be both at the


same time.  At the time of the sale, if the client calls


you and says sell my XYZ stock, I want it sold today, and


you sell it with the intent to convert the proceeds, that


sale is not simply for the broker's benefit.  It is


consistent with the instructions.  It is an authorized


sale.  Until and unless he actually converts the proceeds,


he has violated nothing. 


QUESTION:  But when you say it is consistent


with the instruction, you are assuming the instruction


simply means you can buy or you cancel, whereas the


argument is that the instruction is you can buy for my


benefit or you cancel for my benefit.  And if we accept


the latter characterization as true, then even under your


own theory, he was not making a sale that he was


authorized to make.

 MR. GOLDBLATT:  I would disagree, Justice


Souter.  On this record it may well be that it was for his


benefit, but I don't think you can conclude it was not for


his client's benefit as well. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Goldblatt, before you sit down,


would you say something about the fact that you have


adjudications by the SEC that adopt the theory that they


are arguing before us, why shouldn't we defer if the


question is a close one? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  As I understand it --


QUESTION:  These are formal adjudications under


the Administrative Procedures Act and they have ruled in


accordance with the theory that the government is now


arguing.  Why isn't that entitled to deference? 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Scalia, assuming -- and


because my time has run out -- assuming that Congress in


fact delegated the discretion to the Agency, I don't think


you can find in any of the various things that they rely


on, any rule dealing with 10(b) or Section 10b-5 that


speaks to the precise issues that are raised in this case


or even close to them.  What they do is they have rules


that in 16 or so cases, or whatever the number, they have


prosecuted for 10(b) violations brokers who convert.  But


they are not necessarily, as a matter of fact I don't


recall any of them being discretionary accounts or

presenting the type of 10(b) analysis, fraud in connection


with a purchase or sale of securities. 


QUESTION:  So you are saying we can defer it,


but there's nothing to defer it to. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  That is correct.  Assuming there


is deference, there's nothing to defer it to, and if there


was, it would be a rule that they are ultimately asking


for that a broker any time they convert from the account


violates 10(b) and that would be arbitrary.  That is not


the way this rule is applied.  It is applied on a careful


case-by-case basis.  So whichever way you go on that, I


don't think it gets them the deference they seek.  I would


add, however, with the little time that I have left, that


I do not believe they would get that deference. 


On churning, Justice Ginsburg, just to get to


that point, in a churning case, I think that is more the


O'Hagan paradigm.  You consummate the fraud through the


sale itself.  It is the sale that completes the violation. 


It is the sale that consummates the violation of fiduciary


duty.  That's the difference between here and a churning


case. 


Until and unless Zandford converts those


proceeds, which is done through agreements that are


outside the scope of the securities laws, he has not


violated 10(b).

 In a churning case, the sale itself consummates


it and it meets the other conditions that are required in


O'Hagan.  That is a different situation and it is also


established, of course, in that situation through the


pattern of sales you have the proof that you don't have


here, which is that those sales were not in the client's


interests.  If you cannot establish that they --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Goldblatt. 


MR. GOLDBLATT:  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts.  Mr. Roberts, the


government wants the Court of Appeals reversed here, I'm


sure.  But does it want the summary judgment granted by


the District Court for the SEC affirmed? 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. ROBERTS:  No, Your Honor, we didn't seek


review of the reversal of the summary judgment.  We sought


review of a different part of the Court of Appeals


opinion.  After it reversed the summary judgment, it


explained why it didn't think summary judgment could be


granted, it went on to say that the allegations in the


complaint didn't state a claim under 10(b).  And that's


what we want reversed. 


And the Court of Appeals relied on the facts in


Page 8A of the petition.  The Court of Appeals states in

the part of the opinion that's relevant here that the SEC,


I'm in the middle paragraph of that page under the B, and


I think it's the third sentence, says it, meaning the SEC,


alleges that Zandford defrauded the Woods by failing to


inform them that he intended to sell their securities in


order to obtain the proceeds for himself. 


So the facts that the Court of Appeals were


considering are precisely the same facts that we are


relying on here, Your Honor.  And the --


QUESTION:  Go ahead.  I have a different


subject.  Finish this one. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Okay.  I was just going say that


the indictment is no different in any event, and on Page


41A in paragraph 5 of the indictment it alleged that


Charles Zandford caused checks to be issued against the


security positions of William R. Wood and Diane Okstulski


and made payable to Charles Zandford, thereby causing


their securities to be liquidated. 


QUESTION:  But it doesn't say it was without


their consent.  Nowhere in the --


MR. ROBERTS:  It says it was part of a scheme


and artifice to defraud. 


QUESTION:  That's true.  That's true. 


MR. ROBERTS:  So I think that pretty well


encompasses that.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, we have apparently some,


I would call it a factual disagreement, as to whether any


adjudications by the SEC adopt the theory that you are


arguing before us today.  What are your best cases? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Okay.  I would point to, on page


36 of our brief we discuss the Southeastern Securities


Corporation adjudication, Your Honor, from 1949, seven


years after the SEC promulgated Rule 10(b). 


In that case the facts were that the president


and director of the brokerage firm sold the customer's


securities without her knowledge or consent and converted


the proceeds of the sale to his own use.  And after


explaining that there was a relationship of trust and


confidence and that he had a fiduciary duty, the SEC


addressed the argument that this conduct was authorized


because he had discretion over the customer's affairs by


virtue of a general power of attorney, and rejected that


argument, noting that even assuming the power of


attorney's validity, it didn't authorize this conduct


absent a showing of full and specific disclosure to and


understanding consent by the customer. 


And then the Commission concluded that the


stockbroker's taking and sale of the customer's securities


and his use of the proceeds constituted a willful abuse of


his trust and a violation of --

 QUESTION:  When do you say Rule -- or Section


10(b) is violated?  Let's assume that this scheme is


discovered before he actually runs off with the money.  He


sold the stocks in order to run off with the proceeds, but


you get him before he runs off with the proceeds.  Has


there been a violation --


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- at the time of the sale? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  There's a violation at the


time of the sale. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. ROBERTS:  The discretionary authority


doesn't make the sale authorized because he's authorized


only to sell for the benefit of the customers. 


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, it seems to me that's


logical and that sort of makes me worry about -- about the


great scope of litigation that we are inviting if you say


civil actions not by the Commission but by individuals are


also available under this theory. 


Whenever a broker sells stock, he's always open


to the charge that he wasn't doing it in my interest, he


was doing it in his own, and you have a lawsuit.


MR. ROBERTS:  Two -- two points to address that


concern, Your Honor.  First of all, as I was discussing


with Justice Ginsburg earlier, when there is -- a private


48

action requires proof of damages.  And if the broker


doesn't follow through with his plan to convert the


proceeds, there will be -- it will be frequently the case


that the customer can't show damages and needs to be able


to allege those as a required part of the action, couldn't


bring it at all, end, case over. 


QUESTION:  Well, the stock's gone up.  I mean,


the stock that has been sold has gone up enormously. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Right. 


QUESTION:  And all the plaintiff has to allege


is you really didn't sell it in my interest, you sold it


because you were going to run off with the proceeds, and


look what happened, the stock went way up. 


MR. ROBERTS:  No, Your Honor.  Under the Private


Securities Litigation Reform Act, the plaintiff has to


state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong


inference that the defendant acted with the requisite


fraudulent state of mind. 


QUESTION:  Well, are you saying that every


breach of fiduciary duty is a fraud under 10(b)? 


MR. ROBERTS:  No, Your Honor.  Only secret or


deceptive breaches of fiduciary duty are frauds. 


QUESTION:  What about a standard churning case? 


Aren't most breaches of fiduciary duty secret?  I mean,


you don't announce that you are breaching a fiduciary

MR. ROBERTS:  Many of them, particularly


breaches of the duty of loyalty will be secret, Your


Honor.  But not every breach of fiduciary duty is going to


be -- is going to be secret or knowing.  A breach of the


duty of care wouldn't even be knowing necessarily.  A


breach of the duty of fairness as in the Santa Fe case


where all the factors disclosed would not be deceptive,


there would be no violation.  But in O'Hagan, the Court


explained that when the -- when a fiduciary pretends


loyalty to the principal and instead embezzles the


principal's property, that's a fraud.  And that's a 


fraud --


cases?


QUESTION:  What happens with standard churning


MR. ROBERTS:  This is -- this is just like a


standard churning case, Your Honor.  A churning case is


one --


QUESTION:  Well, is there authority that this is


a 10b-5 violation --


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- and it's a given or are we holding


that in this case. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, you are not addressing


churning because obviously that's not here.  But I think

that the courts of appeal have unanimously concluded that


churning is a violation.  And that's because the broker


who has control over the account and who's been entrusted


with trading authority by the customer is making the


trades, not in furtherance of the customer's investment


objectives but in furtherance of the broker's aim of


gaining commission. 


QUESTION:  So if you prevail in this case, this


case will be authority which validates all of the circuit


opinions holding that churning is a violation. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, again, Your Honor, churning


is -- it's a different -- it's a different factual


scenario because there are repeated sales and because the


proceeds aren't taken.  And I suppose that a distinction


could be drawn between when the proceeds are taken and if


the proceeds -- if it isn't a question of taking the


proceeds but just making a commission, which the customer


knows that the broker is doing.  But I do think this would


be strong precedent in support of those cases. 


QUESTION:  Would you want to argue that


distinction, Mr. Roberts? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Not particularly.  I was


acknowledging that I think this would be strong precedent. 


But I -- Respondent concedes that churning is covered, the


courts of appeals unanimously have held that churning is

covered.  I have no doubt that churning is covered.  The


SEC has no doubt that churning is covered.  So you


wouldn't be breaking -- wouldn't be breaking new ground in


holding that.  I mean, it would be in the sense that it


would be your decision, but you can make the distinctions


in future cases that you feel are appropriate and


necessary, Your Honor. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Too true.  Too true. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. ROBERTS:  If there are no further questions,


the Government would ask that the decision of the Court of


Appeals be reversed. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Roberts.  The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
