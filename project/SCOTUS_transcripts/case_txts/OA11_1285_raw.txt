 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the 
plan. 

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
3
4  this morning in Case 11-1285, US Airways v. McCutchen. 
5
6
7
8
9  and may it please the Court: 
10
11 
12 
13
 Six years ago, this Court, in Sereboff, 
14  concluded that reimbursement actions by ERISA plans, 
15
16  agreement.  And because the plan's claim here is one for 
17  an equitable lien by agreement, that means one parcel of 
18  equitable defenses, those derived from unjustment 
19  enrichment, offer no help to Respondents. 
20
21 
22
23  Sotomayor, bound by equity.  Our contention is not that, 
24  once you say the magic words "equitable lien by 
25

such as the one at issue here, seek equitable liens by 

agreement," that somehow transforms into a "we win" as 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Katyal, if you go to 

equity, why aren't you bound by equity? 

 MR. KATYAL:  We certainly are, Justice 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why does your lien 
have priority to the attorney's lien that is normally 
created at the commencement of the litigation?  Why is 
the attorney bound by the agreement you signed with the 
beneficiary? 

1  plaintiffs at all. 
2
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but that's exactly 
3  what your bottom line is, which is you have someone else 
4  do the work for you and you don't pay them. 
MR. KATYAL:  Quite to the contrary, Justice 
5
6  Sotomayor, our position is that the rules of equity bind 
7  equitable liens by agreement, just as they bind anything 
8  else.  We're not trying to say that the equity 
9  doesn't apply --

MR. KATYAL:  So our position is that the 
attorney doesn't -- there is no lien created with the 
attorney; that, once Mr. Sereboff signed -- entered into 
an agreement with US Air, that agreement said --
provided for 100 percent reimbursement rights. 

And there is no -- essentially, what 

happened is Mr. Sereboff -- excuse me -- Mr. -- Mr. 
McCutchen double-promised his money.  He promised it 
first to -- first to the US Airways plan, and then he 
promised it to -- to his attorneys. 

And that's a problem that he might have with 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  With Sereboff, that 

1  his attorneys, although, as I understand the facts here, 
2  maybe that debt has been forgiven, but it is not 
3  something that creates an independent lien on the money 
4  that's at issue here. 
That is, the rules in equity say that it is 
5
6  the agreement that controls -- when we're talking about 
7  an -- when we're talking about an equitable lien by 
8  agreement --
9
you -- you referred to, that -- that certainly describes 
10
11  the lien you rely on, but there's a footnote toward the 
12  end that leaves open the make-whole doctrine and, I 
13  assume, also the common fund doctrine, so -- so it's --
14  it's an open question. 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22
23  is, quote, "Mid Atlantic's claim is not considered 
24  equitable because it is a subrogation claim. 
25

MR. KATYAL:  Right.  So our position is not 
that Sereboff's letter controls this case.  We do think 
the reasoning of Sereboff essentially does decide the 
question because what Sereboff said, Justice Ginsburg --
and this is at page 368 of the opinion in the text -- it 
said -- the Sereboffs had argued the make-whole 
doctrine. 

 And the -- in response, what this Court said 

Mid Atlantic's action qualifies as an equitable remedy 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And our position is, once the Court has 

freestanding action for equitable subrogation. 

1  because it is indistinguishable from an action to 
2  enforce an equitable lien established by agreement of 
3  the sort epitomized by our decision in Barnes. 
4  Mid Atlantic need not characterize its action as a 
5
6  Accordingly, the parcel of equitable defenses the 
7  Sereboffs claim accompany any such action are beside the 
8  point."  Beside the point. 
9
decided that the type of action that is at issue here is 
10
11  an equitable lien by agreement, the relevant doctrine --
12  and this is a further answer to you, Justice Sotomayor --
13  that the Court is to look to is how are equitable liens 
14  by agreement evaluated in equity? 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21  about the law of most of the States? 
22
23  and an insured, that says the insured gets 100 percent 
24  of the proceeds.  I would think that the law of most 
States gives a superior lien to the attorney for the 
25

And those rules in equity say that, again, 
the general rules of equity apply and govern that; but 
the one place -- the one set of defenses that aren't 
governed, are those that sound an unjust enrichment. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I recognize that 

we're talking about a matter of Federal law here.  What 

 Suppose there's an agreement with an insurer 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company

even there, Justice Kennedy, the -- the agreement is 

 MR. KATYAL:  That -- that is true, in some 

subrogation States.  However, even with respect to that, 

1  contingent fee, notwithstanding the agreement. 
2
 I'm not sure of that.  It's just an 
3  assumption. 
4
5
6  when you have -- as long as it's not abrogated by 
7  statute or something like that.  But if you simply have 
8  an agreement by an insured and it provides for 100 
9  percent reimbursement and abrogation of the common fund, 
10
11  enforced. 
12
 So State Farm v. Clinton, which is a case 
13  cited in our brief, as long as -- as well as the Dobbs 
14  case and other decisions -- the Arkansas Supreme Court 
15
16  that, if you have an insurance agreement that abrogates 
17  the common fund doctrine, that that agreement is 
18  enforced.

abrogation -- where is that abrogation in this -- not 
the plan description, but the plan itself -- what clear 
language in the plan bars the -- the --

 And, here, of course, we're dealing --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where is that 

in 1969, the Arkansas court in 1931 -- have all said 

 MR. KATYAL:  Justice Ginsburg, the -- the 

district court at pages 30A to 32A of the petition

That finding by the district court was never

 MR. KATYAL:  Yes.  The summary plan 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That -- that's the summary 

1  appendix had two pages that found the agreement clear 
2  and unambiguous with respect to abrogation of the common 
3  fund doctrine.  And the plan itself is found at Joint 
4  Appendix page 20.

6  appealed to the Third Circuit.  It was not appealed to 
7  this Court.  And, indeed, the brief in opposition 
8  conceded this issue.

don't -- you -- you make a distinction between 
reimbursement clause and the subrogation clause.  And 
this -- as far as I can tell from the plan, is no 
reimbursement clause. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm asking about the plan 

itself because the plan controls if there's a

that they could have made this an issue when they 

believe Justice Ginsburg is looking at, and I think 
she's quite correct, that the word "abrogation," of 
course, is not used, but neither is the concept. 

1  "subrogation."  And I looked at what's in the plan, and 
2  I don't see language that clearly abrogates the common

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, "simply because the

the plan language to see what the -- you're -- you're 
5
6  relying on the plan language.  And you cite the summary, 
7  but you don't cite the main plan. 
8
9  First, that brief in opposition goes on to say that that 
plan was clear with respect to the common fund doctrine

you are concerned about any discrepancy, point -- 4.2 of 
the actual plan itself -- and this is page 22 of the PDF 
that was submitted by -- lodged by my friends on the 
other side a few days ago -- has essentially an 
anti-Amara clause in it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sorry.  Maybe --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the plan doesn't say 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, please.  The 

MR. KATYAL:  The second point is, even if

very well was a discrepancy. 

 So here --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, the phrase 

language are the same. 

 So go back to Justice Ginsburg's question 

 It says that the benefits that are provided 
1
2  under the plan are those put forth in the summary plan 
3  description.  So there is no discrepancy between the SPD 
4  in the plan in this case, unlike in Amara where there 
5
6
7
8  that you just read says that the benefits are the same. 
9  It doesn't say that the reimbursement and subrogation

13  upon, not the summary, but the plan.

22 
23

participants are -- quote, "are obligated to avoid doing 
anything that would prejudice the plan's right of 
recovery." 

 MR. KATYAL:  So the plan has, in 4.7, two 
things.  It has, "The plan" -- quote, "The plan shall

discrepancy, Justice Sotomayor.  And to the extent that

1  this Court were concerned about it, there were 4 years 
2  for them to have made this an issue, but this is just 
3  about as procedurally barred as -- as anything --
4
5
6  medical expenses of $100,000.  And, actually, the –-
7  the -- there was a driver who caused this problem.  And 
8  later, I collect 100,000, but I have to pay 50,000 to 
9  get the 100,000. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  third-party.  I recovered 50,000 from the third-party 
19  because it cost me 50 to get the 100. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

So I am left with 50,000 net because I had 
to pay my lawyers, I had to pay expert witnesses, there 
were a lot of different things I had to pay.  I'm left 
with 50,000 now.  So in comes the plan and says, we 
want 100,000.  I say, what?  Then I look at the 
language.  The language allows them to get back expenses 
which were recovered from the third-party. 

Justice Breyer, if you were the district court judge in 

 I didn't recover 100,000 from the 

Now, if I were a judge and listening to 

that, I'd say, assuming they wanted a reasonable 
interpretation of this language, it sounds pretty 
reasonable to me. 

 MR. KATYAL:  All right.  And, 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But, I mean, 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It's a little tough, since 

wouldn't the normal result of such a case, like any 

1  this case, I suppose you could have reached that result. 
2  The district court here --
3
4  nobody had the plan. 
MR. KATYAL:  Well, they -- they had the 
5
6  summary plan description, and they did not make an 
7  issue of it.  They had all sorts of discovery 
8  requests, but never made a request for that --

11  contract case, where you have language, even if it was 
12  the word "any," it doesn't mean wheat grown on Mars, 
13  okay?

15
16  can recover that which was paid, but not money that you

7  the assumption that there is an issue of law involved --
8
9
10
11
12  The issue of law is what happens if we have a plan which 
13  says, Joe Smith, my employee, if you have to spend 
14  $90,000 to get back 92,000, you have to give us back all 
92, even though you only have 2 in pocket.  And we are 
15
16  supposed to assume that's what the contract said.  Is 
17  that right? 
18
19  override that with the principle of equity?  Is that the 
20
21
22  with the principle of equity.  We're saying that the 
23  rules of equity, if they have in the plan an abrogation 
24  of the common fund, as that is here, in the way this 
25

case comes to the Court, then that is what settles the 

issue you see before us? 

 MR. KATYAL:  So, again, we're not overriding 

assumption that --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the issue of law? 

 And then -- and then we say, now, can you

 Now, you could have a Sereboff plan, which

2
3  says the reverse, which says, we're going to have a 
4  common fund doctrine and avoid that problem at the 
outset.  The parties evaluate the valuation of the 
5
6  transfer of assets at the outset, and that's what 
7  controls.  And if they want to buy into the common fund, 
8  as this Court said in Sereboff, that's absolutely

you about the legal argument that you are making, the 
distinction you are making between reimbursement 
agreements and subrogation agreements, which you 
think -- seem to think is critical here.  And -- you 
know, once you put it in one box, rather than another, 

 MR. KATYAL:  That's correct. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The lawyer, you say, did 

not ask for the plan. 

 MR. KATYAL:  And -- and I should say, the 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Katyal, could I ask

subrogation agreement?  And what follows from that 

 MR. KATYAL:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So -- so how do you know 


the plan says, we are going to inherit all of the 
benefits and burdens of the insured in bringing an 
action.  It's a vicarious -- it's a kind of vicarious 
notion. 

1  some result follows -- different results follow. 

2
3
4  whether you have a reimbursement agreement or a 

5
6  categorization? 
7
 MR. KATYAL:  So, Justice Kagan, there are 
8  two very distinct rights.  Subrogation is the right to 
9  stand in someone else's shoes.  And so the insured --
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  to give you this money because we're not at fault in 
17  this accident, but we're going to essentially advance it 
18  to you, but you've got to reimburse us for it.  And 
19  so --
20
21 
 MR. KATYAL:  So if it were a subrogation 
22
23  agreement, I think my friend's case on the other side

15
16  you had essentially the same thing, a plan that had both 
17  a reimbursement provision and a subrogation provision.

14 
15
16 
17
18  with Mr. Katyal's view of this distinction between 
19  subjugation -- subrogation agreements and reimbursement 
20
21
22  there is certainly a distinction, and the Couch 
23  Insurance treatise talks about the -- the distinction. 
24  But the Couch Insurance treatise also explains that the 
terms are often used interchangeably in a confusing way. 
25

lien by agreement, that agreement was generally 
enforceable according to its terms.  It was like a 
mortgage, is the classic case, and the mortgage gave a 
security interest in land; and, if the debt was not paid 
off, then the lienholder could -- could foreclose on 
that land. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Palmore, do you agree 

agreements and which this agreement is? 

 MR. PALMORE:  I think that's a -- the --

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

that the courts do use these terms interchangeably. 

 So I don't think that the bright line that 
1
2  Mr. Katyal seeks to establish between subrogation and 
3  reimbursement is necessarily reflected in all the cases 
4  and all the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I think you can say 
5
6  that about any legal rule, that some courts bollox them 
7  up.  I mean, that means the rule doesn't exist because 
8  it's sometimes used in a confusing way? 
9
10
11
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the rule?  What's 
12  the rule?  Do you acknowledge that that is the rule? 
13
 MR. PALMORE:  We acknowledge that, when 
14  there is a -- when there is a contractual plan-based 
reimbursement provision like this, it is enforceable as 
15
16  an equitable lien by agreement, in the same way that an 
17  equitable lien by agreement would have been --
18
19  said that, if this were a subrogation agreement, 
Mr. McCutchen would have a much better argument because 
20
21  a different set of rules would apply.  And so that makes 
22  this categorization question quite meaningful. 
 Now, you could say, well, we don't see it as 
23
24  all that meaningful.  We think, no matter what you call 
this agreement, the same rules apply.  Or you could say, 
25

 MR. PALMORE:  No, I think it's just the fact 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but I think Mr. Katyal 

26
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. PALMORE:  Right.  We think -- as the --

as the case comes to the Court, this is a case for 

decisions, they're bringing in all kinds of concepts 
from State law, from insurance law, from public policy 
of the State.  They don't necessarily reflect what would 
have happened in a court in equity at the time of the 
divided bench, and that's the import --

1  yes, different rules apply with respect to these two 
2  different kinds of agreements, and your job is to figure 
3  out which kind of agreement this is. 
4
5
6  reimbursement.  This is just like Sereboff, and this is 
7  a reimbursement agreement. 
 What -- what adds to the confusion is

 I take it the common fund doctrine says, if 
19
this victim here got some money back from the person who 
20
21  caused the accident, that that money goes into a common 
22  fund, in the sense that those who share in the fund must 
23  share as well in the cost of producing the fund. 
24

question.  I think, now, what we're being asked to 
decide is, from your point of view, does the common fund 
doctrine apply? 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's my exact 

 So if it costs 50,000 to produce 100,000, 
which is in the fund, that we have to have US Air, as

 But I hear the argument, fair though it is, 

 And so what is your response to that?  In 

particular, why do you say the common fund doctrine 

1  well, pay part of the cost of producing the fund.  That 
2  sounds very fair. 
3
4  we have here an agreement, and in this agreement, it 
says, it's as if it said, and you shall not apply the 
5
6  common fund doctrine or any other equitable doctrine, 
7  such as he who seeks equity must do equity, etc.  And I 
8  think that's the question that's being asked.

12  but all these other equitable doctrines don't apply?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Good.  So now, we have 18th 
17  century authority which says that, in the 18th century, 
18  Lord Cooke or someone said that the common fund doctrine 
19  applies, but the other doctrines don't.  And the -- and 
20
21
 MR. PALMORE:  Well, there is not one 
22  authority that is going to give you both -- both 
23  answers.  But the equitable lien by agreement cases from 
24  the time of equity, as I mentioned before, were 
25

typically mortgage cases or a promise to provide future 

equitable doctrines that would have applied at equity. 

 MR. PALMORE:  Because we think the 

the name and citation to that authority is?

Now, there is a separate line of authority 

in a -- really a different silo involving equitable 

1  acquired funds to discharge a debt. 
2
3  could be executed, according to its terms.  The unjust 
4  enrichment principles that Respondent is invoking were 
5
6  restitution.  And this Court in Sereboff said, we are 
7  not going to look at equitable restitution principles, 
8  we are going to look at equitable lien by agreement 
9  cases. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 If you look back to the principal case that 
17  established this, the Greenough case that we talk about 
18  in our brief, the Court said that the -- Mr. Vose, 
19  who -- the bondholder who had secured a benefit for all 
the bondholders, had -- while not a trustee, had acted 
20
21  the part of a trustee.  And it was a well-settled 
22  principle of trust law, both then and now, that a 
23  trustee is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable 
24  expenses from the trust itself. 
25

involving the common fund that we talk about in our 
brief.  And, as Mr. Katyal said, it has at times been 
characterized as an unjust enrichment doctrine, but its 
roots are different.  Its roots are actually in an 
analogy to trust law.

17  claimant's ability to get an injunction --

trust law, and remember, Greenough based the common fund 
doctrine on trust law that if, for instance, a trust 
document had said, the trustee shall take his expenses 
from the trust corpus, not from the income -- or 
vice-versa, says the trustee shall take his expenses 
from the income, but not from the trust corpus -- if 
that proved unworkable or unfair and the trustee 
couldn't discharge his obligations to maintain the 
trust, the court of equity had broad reformation powers

In equity, these claims were governed, 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your opponent says this is 

nowhere.  He would concede that point.  You have to tell 
us why this is a subrogation agreement, even though you 
conceded below that it isn't. 

1  please the Court: 
2
 Reimbursement claims that are based on an 
3  express subrogation agreement are subject to equitable 
4  principles of subrogation. 
5
6  according to the same principles that governed every 
7  other type of subrogation. 
8
9  not a subrogation agreement, so that argument goes

13
14  subrogation agreement.  The claim, however, that 
Petitioners have pursued here, is a reimbursement claim. 
15
16  And -- but it's based on an express subrogation clause. 
17
 And in equity, reimbursement claims, which, 
18  to be clear, are distinct from subrogation claims 
19  because they involve a suit directly against the 
insured, as opposed to against the tortfeasor, are 
20
21  governed by the same principles of subrogation that 
22  equity treated -- equity used that -- to apply to all 
23  claims that involved an insurer who is seeking to 
24  recover money from either an insured or a tortfeasor.

6  opponent denies that the common fund doctrine applies. 
7  And it says this is an equitable lien by agreement, so 
8  that the common fund doctrine doesn't apply. 
9
10
11
 MR. WESSLER:  No, Your Honor.  We -- it --
12  to be clear, it is an equitable lien by agreement, but 
13  it arises within the doctrine of subrogation, which is, 
14  as Couch and Palmer and other treatises explain, is an 
umbrella term that is used to describe all of the rights 
15
16  and rules that govern claims by insurers for money back 
17  after they've paid it out under a policy. 
 Now, the form of the action in this case is 
18
19  a -- is a claim for reimbursement out of a fund, but the 
mere fact that that's the form of the action, which, in 
20
21  Sereboff, this Court called an equitable lien by 
22  agreement, does not alter the underlying rule that 
23  equity courts in the days of the divided bench would 
24  have applied to the claim.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But doesn't Sereboff suggest

they not the beside the point? 

free-standing claim or free-standing action for 
equitable subrogation are beside the point.  A 
free-standing action for equitable subrogation is not 
one based on an agreement.  It's an implied claim, a 
claim for subrogation or reimbursement based on the mere 
fact that the insurer has paid the money. 

1  not?  I mean, I realize that Sereboff has this footnote, 
2  but if you read the text in Sereboff, it says, these 
3  affirmative defenses that would arise in a normal 
4  subrogation context are beside the point.  So how are 
5
6
 MR. WESSLER:  They are not beside the point 
7  for -- for one reason, and let me -- let me explain why. 
8  What the Court actually said in Sereboff was that the 
9  parcel of equitable defenses accompanying a

11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  Sereboff, there was no agreement? 
 MR. WESSLER:  There was, but what this 
18
19  Court -- there was absolutely an agreement, just as 
there is an agreement in this case.  What the -- the 
20
21  distinction the Court drew in Sereboff was it said that 
22  whatever principles apply to free-standing claims are 
23  beside the point, because -- precisely because the claim 
24  was based on an agreement.  That is absolutely correct. 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So is that true that, in

in fact, governed by the same principles of unjust 

that the insured party was making, that the insured 
party was saying, hey, look, we have these great 
defenses. 

1  position because we believe that the principles in 
2  equity that governed exactly the kinds of claims that 
3  were at issue in Sereboff and are at issue here, 
4  reimbursement claims based on an express agreement, are, 
5
6  enrichment. 
7
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I don't understand 
8  that because it seems to me that, when Sereboff said it

 And the Court said, absolutely correctly, in 

freestanding subrogation claims have one set of remedies 
or rights, and subrogation, by agreement, have another. 
So what do you see as the differences between the two? 

1  all these great rules that apply to that -- to that kind 
2  of claim. 
3
4  Sereboff, whatever those principles are doesn't matter 
because this is a claim based on an agreement.  And --
5
6  but what our view in this case is --
7
8  difference between the two?  Meaning -- I take your 
9  argument to be that the Court was right before, that 
10
11 
12 
13
 MR. WESSLER:  When it comes to the rules 
14  that govern relief, there is no difference.  The same 
principle of unjust enrichment controls, and it limits 
15
16  an insurer to recovering out of the fund 
17  only --
18
19  exercise of futility, in writing what it did in 
20
21
 MR. WESSLER:  Not so, Your Honor.  It did 
22  not reach the question in Sereboff of what rules apply 
23  to -- to reimbursement claims based on express 
24  agreement.  That was footnote 2.

4  kinds of rights, one implied and one express, and 
5
6  got to give them a little bit more body to have a 
7  persuasive argument. 
8
9  was the rule.  And I'll point this Court's attention to 
the leading treatise on equity.  It's Palmer's treatise 
10
11 
cited by this Court in Sereboff and in Great West. 
12
13  discusses, precisely, this claim on pages 473 and 474 of 
14  his -- of his treatise, and it's cited on page 21 of our 
brief.  And he says that, "The same principle of unjust 
15
16  enrichment controls claims for reimbursement arising out 
17  of an express agreement." 
18
19
20
 MR. WESSLER:  Yes, I'm about to quote that. 
21
 And he says that that principle, quote, 
22
23  "should serve to limit the effectiveness of contract 
24  provisions which in terms provide for reimbursement out

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is this the part --

4  I might be mixing this up with something else, but is 
this the part where he says, unfortunately, the courts 
5
6  don't agree with that? 
7
 (Laughter.) 
 MR. WESSLER:  He -- he -- he identifies two 
8
9  decisions -- that -- you're correct, Your Honor -- he 
identifies two decisions, which did something contrary 
10
11 
to that rule.  But, in his view, that is the rule that 
12 
governs these claims. 
13
14  the -- the simple argument.  We have an agreement here, 
and the plan is asking for what the agreement gives it. 
15
16  Why is the plan unjustly enriched by receiving exactly 
17  what the plan entitles it to receive? 
18
19  these insurance reimbursement cases arose in a very 
different context from most other equitable lien by 
20
21  agreement cases. 
22
23  cases and all 22 or -- or more of the cases that the 
24  Petitioner cites, is that they involve a third party,

 And so, in two-party equitable lien by

4  agreement cases, which are -- all of the cases that 
Petitioner cites involve two-party cases in which the 
5
6  defendant is also the wrongdoer, is the person who is

9  could have sought legal relief for breach for this exact 
kind of claim, but there was also a remedy that a party 
10
11 
could seek in equity. 
12
 But in order to do that, in order to -- to 
13  enter equity's doors on this reimbursement theory, it --
14  it had to agree to allow other parties their correlative 
rights in equity, and it also had to agree not to

17  typically would --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, couldn't that party

You just made a distinction between the remedy at law

5
6  the right to enforce the terms of the plan.  But -- but

 The contract says, give Smith all the wheat.

7  to follow the contract.  We are going to modify the 
8  contract according to equitable principles, which, as

12  In our view -- and -- and I think I need to be clear 
13  about this.  I mean, the -- the fact that the plan 
14  contains a different set of rights than -- than the SPD, 
to us, is meaningful in -- in its -- in its effect that 
15
16  it will have on this case when this -- if and when this 
17  Court remands because -- because, in our view, the 
18  rights are different. 
19
20
21  the strong form argument that Petitioners have made 
22  here, which is that, on the SPD, it can defeat the --
23  the rules that typically would have applied, that equity 
24  would not have allowed that.  And so --
25

 However, I -- it doesn't change the 

underlying nature of our argument, which is that, even

document. 

MR. WESSLER:  That --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And what the 

1  the district court interpreted the plan as precluding 
2  the claim you're making here.  And your argument that 
3  that's not true is based not on the summary of the plan, 
4  but on the plan itself. 
5
6
7  district court does is it defers to the administrator's 
8  interpretation of the plan.  So the district court found 
9  that the administrator's interpretation was not 
10
11
 So what your friend is arguing is that, 
12  well, you are kind of stuck with the district court 
13  interpretation, and you can't, at the last minute, argue 
14  that it shouldn't control because of some other 
15
16
17  have the right to argue that on remand, Your Honor. 
18  And -- and this Court's decision in Cigna only -- only 
19  arose in this case after the -- the briefs were complete 
20
21
22  changed the law to the extent that all parties are now 
23  on notice and know that the plan document will trump any 
24  contrary language --
25

 MR. WESSLER:  Well -- well, we think we do 

to the Third Circuit. 

 And so it's -- I -- I think Cigna has

Cigna to tell you that. 

 MR. WESSLER:  Well -- well, Your -- Your 

even -- even as it relates to the actual language in the 
SPD and that -- and that whatever differences between 
the SPD and the plan actually are don't necessarily 
change the rules that govern when a -- when a party in 
equity sought this kind of reimbursement relief directly 
from -- from an insured. 

1  didn't tell you that.  The plan -- the summary told you 
2  that.  It says, "Complete plan details are in the legal 
3  plan.  If there is any difference between the summary 
4  and the plan, the plan controls."  So you didn't need 
5
6
7  Honor, I mean, I -- I think that the -- the -- you know, 
8  that -- for us, that's an issue on remand.  We're 
9  comfortable that our arguments in this case control, 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  or so, to discuss the common fund rule because I do 
18  think it applies as a separate and distinct rule, 
19  regardless of how this Court interprets the agreement as 
20
21  beneficiary, and the plan. 
22
23  Court, in Pettus, made clear that the common fund 
24  doctrine confers a separate lien on the attorney.  And 
25

governing the rights between Mr. McCutchen, the 

 I'd like, just -- just for the last minute 

 And I'd just like to point out that this 

so whatever the agreements control between the

And -- and I -- and I'd just like to point 

1  beneficiary and the plan has, it cannot defeat the 
2  rights that the attorney has, as a separate matter, to 
3  come into court and invoke its own lien on the fund as a 
4  first priority lien over the money. 
5
6  out that Petitioners have not responded to that 
7  argument.  Nowhere in their reply brief did they explain 
8  why their theory would allow them to defeat the rights 
9  of a third-party defendant in this case, Mr. McCutchen's 
lawyers, who have their own separate right to the lien. 
10
11
 And -- and none of their equitable lien 
12  cases, Your Honor, involve any kind of common fund 
13  whatsoever.  So they say precisely nothing about the 
14  rules that would have applied in equity to an attorney's 
15
16  before it was distributed to any of the parties. 
17
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought you were 
18  discussing the common fund would be the allocation 
19  between McCutchen and the plan.  But now, you seem to be 
20
21  first.

is not only in -- in all equity, lawyers are entitled,

something.

 Sure, the Court has an equity power when to 
remedy unjust enrichment.  That is an inherent power of 

1  three. 
2
 Now, the Solicitor General says, well, this 
3  is rooted in -- in equitable doctrine.  There is no case 
4  that they have that says that there's some equitable 
doctrine that trumps the preexisting agreement.  And, 
5
6  indeed, the case that they cite, the Greenough case, is 
7  one that essentially relies on unjust enrichment 
8  principles.

12  are saying is that, when you have an agreement in 
13  advance, that means, per se, there is no unjust 
14  enrichment, that they are, to use this Court's language 
15
16
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm assuming, 
17  because ERISA's in place now, that the many State laws 
18  that prohibit this kind of agreement, where insurance 
19  plans are seeking full reimbursement, despite an

 MR. KATYAL:  Congress, in 1974, set it up

Justice Sotomayor.  For 38 years, this Court has never
