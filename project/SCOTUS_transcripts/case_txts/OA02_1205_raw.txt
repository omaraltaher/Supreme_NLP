 CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:  We'll hear  argument


now in No. 02-1205, Edith Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons.


 Ms. Gorman.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. CANDACE GORMAN 


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


 MS.  GORMAN: 

Mr. Chief  Justice,  and  may it


please the Court:


 Congress answered the  call of the judiciary  by


enacting section  1658, a bright line rule that provides a


default statute of  limitations of 4  years for any  civil


action arising  under an  act of  Congress after  December 

1st, 1990. 

Section  1658  applies  to  plaintiff's  claims 

because this Court  said in  Patterson that plaintiff  did


not  have  claims  of  racial  harassment  and  --

and


termination and discharge claims. 


Plaintiff's  claims arise  under the  1991 Civil


Rights Act  because that is the act that created the cause


of action that plaintiff has filed under.


 In Rivers, this Court held that the 1991 act, as


amended by the 1991 Civil  Rights Act, was a new  cause of


action that created new liabilities and a new standard  of


conduct.  Therefore,  under section 1658, under  the plain

meaning  of  that  statute,  the  1991  Civil  Rights  Act


applies.


 The  simple  one-sentence  statute  has  been


interpreted in  such a way as to give  it no meaning.  The


terms,  arising  under, and  the  term, civil  action, are


simple terms used by this Court repeatedly to describe the


statute's reach and that reach  includes all civil actions


arising under an act of Congress after December 1st, 1990,


whether it has roots in or references preexisting law.


 QUESTION:  Ms. Gorman, one of the anomalies that


if -- if you are  complaining about a refusal  to hire, a


discriminatory refusal to hire, the  limitation would be 2


years,  but if  you're complaining about  a discriminatory


firing, it would be 4 years. 


Does that make sense to 

--

to have  those two claims both stemming  from the original


1981, but one having extended it?


MS. GORMAN:  Yes.  I -- I believe it does,  Your


Honor, and  the reason is that the purpose of section 1658


is to cut down on borrowing and  State limitations periods


that  have  been  used  for  the borrowing  purposes,  and


anything that cuts down on those  purposes of borrowing is


going to be going to the effect of that statute. 


Now, the  fact that  there are  two statutes  of


limitations is  not unusual  in -- in the  discrimination


cases that  I  file.  There are  often  many statutes  of

limitations that  someone has to look at.  For example, in


the  Age  Discrimination Act,  there  are two  statutes of


limitations for willful and not willful.  Often claims are


filed under section -- under  title VII, as well as  under


section 1981, and we have  various statutes of limitations


that we deal with in those claims as well.


 QUESTION:  But one can  see some rhyme or reason


to those  differences.  Here it  seems that  -- that  one


claim is -- is no more deserving of a longer time than the


other.


 MS. GORMAN:  Well, we have to look at the plain


meaning of the statute, Your  Honor.  And it is  a default


statute  of limitations, so Congress has the option at any


time of  creating a -- a statute of limitations going back


to 1981 if it thinks that this is not the way it wanted it


to work out.  But it -- the statute is clear that it's for


all new causes of action or for all causes of action  that


arise under acts of Congress after December 1st, 1990, and


I  think it's very  clear that plaintiffs'  claims did not


arise until the 1991  Civil Rights Act.  Plaintiffs  could


not file  a cause of action  until that 1991  Civil Rights 

Act.

 QUESTION: 

Do you  want  us to  interpret this 

section (b) as a new cause of action, in other words? 


MS. GORMAN:  The 1991 act.  The claims  -- I'm

only addressing the narrow issue -足


QUESTION:  Yes.


 MS. GORMAN:  -- of the  claims that  plaintiff


could not file prior to -足


QUESTION:  Section (b).  You -- you want us  to


interpret section (b) as a new cause of action?


 MS.  GORMAN: 

Correct. 

And I  believe  that


follows from the  Court's decisions both in  Patterson and


in Rivers.


 QUESTION:  If -- if you completely untie section


(b) from  section (a),  number one,  it  doesn't make  any


sense, and  number two, the -- the implied cause of action


that  we have found  might disappear because  we have told


Congress, when you enact a new cause of action -- or a new


statute,  you have  to  say  explicitly  if it  creates  a


private cause of action.


 MS. GORMAN:  I believe Congress addressed  that


in the 1991 Civil Rights Act, codifying that this was a -足


that there  was a private right  of action involved.  But


this Court had already -足


QUESTION:  Where -- does it say that in 1981?


 MS. GORMAN:  In 1981(c).


 QUESTION:  Well, I  -- I'm  not sure I  read it


that way.


 MS.  GORMAN:

section are protected  against impairment by nongovernment


discrimination and impairment under color of law.


 QUESTION:  That  doesn't sound like an  explicit


creation of a cause of action to me.


 MS. GORMAN:  Well, Your  Honor, this Court  had


also said  in Patterson  that  1981 did  create a  private


right of action. 


QUESTION:  Well, that's  what -- but that  was


under 1981.  You're saying it's a new cause of action, and


I'm  saying  that if  it's  a new  cause  of action,  then


Congress has to be  explicit that there's a private  cause


of action.


 MS. GORMAN:  I believe the language  in section


(c) was  put in there just to 


confirm that what the Court 

said  in Patterson,  that  this  was  a private  right  of


action, was going forward with the new statute.


And  to  the point  that  this  is definitional,


which  I think  was what  you were  also  raising, Justice


Kennedy, the fact that Congress adds definitions to create


causes of action was recognized by this Court in Rivers as


a way that Congress often creates  causes of action.  So I


believe that that's  very consistent with how this  -- how


Congress enacts causes of action.


 QUESTION:  Your -- your argument really rests on


the  proposition that  arising under  has a  -- a  uniform

meaning,  that it  doesn't acquire  different meanings  in


different contexts, doesn't it?


 MS.  GORMAN: 

I  believe  it  rests  on  the


proposition that the  most common way of meaning  -- using


arising under is  the way Justice Holmes  described it and


that's that a suit arises  under the law that creates  the


cause of  action.  And that's what we're saying here, that


this  suit relies on  the 1991  law.  That's  what created


plaintiff's cause of action.


 QUESTION:  Well,  we've -- we've also  held that


-- that arising under  embraces not  just a -- a Federal


cause  of  action but  even  State causes  of  action that


require determination of a Federal  question for which the


Federal  question is -- is sort 
 of essential.  Now, how


could you possibly apply that meaning to this statute?  It


would  mean  that  the  Federal  Government  would  be


establishing statutes of  limitation for  State causes  of


action.


 MS.  GORMAN:  I  don't  believe that's  how the


statute was  -- was  drafted, Your  Honor.  The  Eleventh


Amendment  does not  place  any  limitation  on  Congress'


ability to establish a Federal  statute of limitations for


a Federal  claim, and  I believe  section 1658  is clearly


directed  to  Federal  causes  of  action,  Federal  civil


actions, not to State civil actions.

 QUESTION:  Not if you use arising  under the way


we use it in other contexts  where -- where it -- a  claim


can -- can be thought to arise  under, for purposes of -足


of Federal court  jurisdiction, even  though the cause  of


action is -- is a State cause of action.


 MS. GORMAN:  Your Honor, I believe arising under


in this sense  should be  used in the  way that it's  most


used by this  Court and in the way that it's used in title


28,  which is where this  statute was -- is codified.  As


Justice Frankfurter said, you -- you take the soil  along


with it, that goes along with the other statutes.  So the


fact that this Court has  repeatedly and consistently said


in title  28 that a cause  of action arises under  the law


that creates  the  cause of  action or  if  it depends  -足


depends on that  cause of action.  I believe that's the -足


the way arising under should be used in this case as well.


 QUESTION:  All right.  So you're picking  one of


various -- various meanings, but that's all that the other


side is doing too.


 MS. GORMAN:  But  I believe  this  is the  more


consistent  approach  with how  this  Court has  looked at


arising  under  in the  -- in the  jurisdictional context


because that is where this Court -- that is where Congress


has placed this definition in the statute.


 QUESTION:  I don't think  so.  I think in  cases

such as  Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Company, we've


-- we've said  that arising  under jurisdiction  includes


where the  cause  of action  is based  on  State law,  but


relief necessarily depends on resolution of  a substantial


question of Federal law.  We say that Federal courts  can


take jurisdiction in that situation.


 And as I say, if you apply that meaning here, it


-- it  means  that  you're  -- you're  setting  a  Federal


statute of limitations  for State causes of  action unless


you want to  disown Smith v. Kansas City and  that line of


cases. 


MS. GORMAN:  Your Honor,  what I'm suggesting is


that  the  -- the  reasoning  of  this  Court  has  been


consistently that under  title 28, arising under  has been


used as  Justice Holmes has suggested it,  and that's what


I'm suggesting is the -- is the bright line rule that this


Court should follow in this case. 


QUESTION:  I'm suggesting that's wrong.


 MS. GORMAN:  I understand, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  What do you  do with the hypothetical


that was raised in -- in the briefs on the other side that


suppose Congress shrinks  the people  who are exempt  from


title VII,  say, and makes it 15 or more employees instead


of 25 or  more employees?  Then what do  you do with  the


people who  are  newly included?  Do  they  get a  longer

statute than the ones who were there before?


 MS. GORMAN:  Yes, Your Honor, I believe they do.


And  again, I  want to point  out that  this is  a default


statute of limitations, so Congress  would always have the


ability to affix a statute of limitations. 


QUESTION:  But -- but in -- in determining  what


Congress meant, is it -- wouldn't it be relevant that that


seems something no legislature would  want to have happen,


that people who are newly covered by the same prescription


get more  time to  sue than  people who  have always  been


covered?


 MS.  GORMAN:  Your  Honor, first  that  example


comes from title VII which does have its own -足


QUESTION:  I know.  I  know. 
 So we had to  pick


one that comes under 1981 or 1982.


 MS. GORMAN:  I still  think we have to give  the


plain  meaning of the  -- of  the statute its  effect, and


Congress  -- we have to  understand that Congress set this


as  a default and  if Congress does not  want to have this


anomaly where people who  are between 15 and 25  employees


in a  -- in an employment relationship where it's under 25


employees and now a cause  of action has been created  for


them -- if Congress does not want to have that situation,


then Congress  is  going to  have to  draft  a statute  of


limitations which that  -- with  that law, which  Congress

has  shown under the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act  that it  is more 

than willing and able to do. 

When Congress adopted  -- when Congress  amended 

the Telecommunications Act  of 1936  to add the  Sarbanes-


Oxley amendment, it put in the statute of limitations that


it knew it  wanted to have so it  would be consistent with


other statute of limitations within  that statute.  And it


is  clear  from  the  reading  of  that  statute, that  if


Congress -- that Congress thought  if they had not put  in


that  amendment,  that  the  4-year  statute  of  -- of


limitations would apply even though  that was an amendment


to a preexisting statute.


 QUESTION:  Another  problem that was  raised in


the brief on the other side  was what would you do with  a


circuit that had  a law -- that it had interpreted the law


as allowing  no claim  and there's  a circuit  where other


circuits  have -- have  allowed a claim  in the -- and we


haven't  spoken.  In  the circuit  that said there  was no


claim and  then -- so that  people are  newly covered  -足


suppose  Congress  eliminates that  circuit  split and  it


makes  it  clear that  everybody  is covered. 

Then what


happens in the circuit where people were not covered until


Congress clarified the law?  Do they get the 4 years?


 MS.  GORMAN:  I believe in  most cases  I think


everyone will get  4 years, and  the reason I say  that is

because  section  1658  does not  address  the  circuit -足


circuit split.  It addresses the statute that's enacted by


Congress.  So if Congress enacts the statute setting forth


a  cause of action  that was  not codified before,  then I 

believe  that that  4-year  statute of  limitations  would 

apply.

 QUESTION:  Well,  but that -- that's  the issue, 

whether it  was codified before.  Some circuits say it was


already there.  Other circuits  say it wasn't there.  For


the  latter circuits, this  would be  a new creation  of a


cause of action.  For the former,  it would not.  Now, I


agree there's only one  right answer; either -- either it


existed under the old law or it didn't exist under the old


law.


 But frankly, I  don't want to  have to sit  here


and  resolve -- resolve  questions  of whether  something


existed under an old law  for no purpose except to  decide


whether  -- whether this  statute of limitations provision


cuts in  or not.  I mean, it's  a weird thing  to have us


doing,  deciding  whether  a  statute  was  really  merely


reaffirming an  old law or whether  it was enacting  a new


cause of action.  I -足


MS. GORMAN:  I  -- I  think one  thing that  we


would always be  able to do is to look  at these statutes.


Since we're  looking at this in the abstract, it's hard to

say.  But  -- but  taking the  -- the 1991  statute, for


example,  where  Congress  defines it  in  the  purpose as


expanding the rights, then I think it's clear that this is


something new that did not exist before.  So I think -足


QUESTION:  But in -- in -足

MS. GORMAN:  I'm sorry.

 QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you

off.

 I  was -- in  the case  of the circuit  split, I 

thought  the statute that  broke -- that  -- that resolved 

the circuit  split and confirmed that there was a cause of


action would -- would qualify on  your theory of  arising


under because your -- your cause of action would, in part,


be based upon the amending statute.  Am I wrong?


 MS. GORMAN:  No.  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MS. GORMAN:  That is what I'm suggesting. 


QUESTION:  Well -- well, it has to -足


QUESTION: 

But  what  about  the  circuit that


already recognized the cause of  action?  May I repeat  my


question? 


Say that  -- prior  to the  statutory amendment,


the Seventh Circuit  had already  recognized the cause  of


action that the amendment confirmed.  Now, would it be  a


new cause of action in the Seventh Circuit?

QUESTION:  But the  Seventh Circuit  thought it


arose under an act of Congress even before the amendment. 


MS. GORMAN:  I  understand, Your  Honor, but  I


think if you look at the purpose of the statute and  if we


use  Patterson as an example, in  Patterson the Court said


there was no  claim under  1981 for post-contract  claims.


And then when  Congress enacted the 1991 act, if  -- if --


I'm sorry.  Patterson had not been decided by this Court,


but we had circuits in  a disarray on this issue  and then


Congress  enacted the 1991  act and  said in there  we are


expanding -足

 MR. GARRE:  Thank you,  Mr. Chief Justice,  and


may it please the Court:


 Petitioners' claims for racial discrimination in


the terms and  condition of employment are subject  to the


uniform statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1658


because those claims  were created by and  therefore arise


under  the Civil Rights  Act of  1991, an act  of Congress


enacted after December 1 -足


QUESTION: 

Mr.  Garre,  as  has  already  been


pointed out,  the interpretation  does give  rise to  some


anomalies and interpreting it the other way might as well.


What could Congress  have provided  in section 1658(a)  to 

avoid some of these questions? 

MR. GARRE:  Well -足

QUESTION:  How could it have been written -足

MR. GARRE:  Justice --

QUESTION:  -- so we wouldn't be in this mess?

 MR. GARRE:  Justice O'Connor,  I think some  of 

the -- the issues that  have been identified to the  Court


are  a  direct  product of  the  compromise  that Congress


struck in  1990.  Originally the  act, as proposed  by the


Federal  Courts  Study  Committee, would  have  applied  a


uniform statute of  limitations to all existing  causes of


action.  And some Members of Congress and groups  believed


that that would create retroactivity  concerns.  So the --

the  compromise  that  was adopted  was  that  the uniform


statute  of limitations  would  apply  on a  going-forward


basis with respect to causes of  actions that were created


by acts of Congress enacted after December 1990. 


This  case involves  precisely  such a  cause of


action.  Petitioners'  claims we  know from the  Patterson


case were not  actionable under statute 1981  prior to the


1991 Civil Rights Act.  The only reason petitioners are in


Court today  and have viable claims is because of the 1991


Civil Rights Act.  Therefore, we think  that respondent's


position which results in the conclusion that petitioners'


claims  arise under the  -- the  same statute at  issue in


Patterson,  the statute that we know does not create those


claims, is  an absurd  conclusion that 
 we think  counsels


against their position.


 QUESTION:  What if the  statute did create those


claims?  I mean,  I'm getting  back to the  circuit split


question. 


MR. GARRE:  We --


QUESTION:  It  seems to  me you don't  give the


same answer that -- that the petitioner does.


 MR. GARRE:  Justice Scalia,  we think that  the


circuit split problem  would be  resolved for purposes  of


section  1658  the  same  way  it  would  be  resolved for


retroactivity  purposes.  Anytime  Congress creates  a new

cause of actions, there -- there are going to be questions


that arise from the creation of that cause of action.


 The Court considered the same question in Hughes


Aircraft v. United  States ex rel. Schumer  where Congress


amended the False Claims Act to eliminate a jurisdictional


defense, and this Court said, on pages 949 and 950 of  its


opinion, created  a new cause  of action.  And therefore,


the  Court  held  that  cause  of  action  cannot  be


retroactively applied.


 QUESTION:  So you're saying  we -- we will  have


to resolve  these -- these  circuit splits for  no purpose


whatever  except  to  decide  whether  the  statute  of


limitations applies.  Right?  We'll have to -足


MR. GARRE:  No, Justice  Scalia. 
 In  the sense


that the same issue would -- would arise for retroactivity


purpose, whether or  not Congress has created  a new cause


of action which would apply retroactivity -- retroactively


or not.  And  even if  the retroactivity question  didn't


arise, that's a product of  the statute that Congress  has


drawn. 


Another  -- another  problem  with respondent's


construction -足


QUESTION:  As you interpret it.


 MR.  GARRE:  As we interpret  it, and  we think


that that  is the plain meaning  of Congress' use  of both

the -- the all-inclusive term, the traditionally inclusive


term, arising  under, as well as Congress' reference to an


act of Congress. 


QUESTION:  What  -- what is your position  as to


whether the statute of limitations applies to State causes


of action?


 MR. GARRE:  We don't think it  applies to State


causes of action at all. 


QUESTION: 

Then  you're  not  using  the  all-


inclusive term, arising under.


 MR.  GARRE:  Well,  that's  not a  product that


Congress has  used of arising under.  It's a  question of


whether Congress intended  to supply a Federal  statute of


limitations for State claims.


 QUESTION:  Well, and -- and you say they  didn't


because -- so your -- since it's  absurd to think they did


that, you're  -- you're  giving arising  under a  narrower


interpretation than -- than we give it for -足


MR. GARRE:  Well -足


QUESTION: 

-- for  purposes  of -- of Federal


jurisdiction. 


MR.  GARRE:  In  the first place,  we think that


plaintiffs' claims arise  under the 1991 Civil  Rights Act


under  any  definition  of  arising  under,  dictionary


definition,  the  statutory  definition,  and  28  U.S.C.

QUESTION:  But  -- but  that contradicts  your


other position that -- that we're going to have to resolve


this question  in order  to determine  the circuit  splits


because if  you believe that, your -- your answer would be


the same  as -- as the petitioners.  You  don't have  to


resolve those  circuit splits so  long as there's  a later


statute.  It arises  under the  State -- under  the later 

statute.  Whether it arises under both, who cares?

 MR. GARRE:  No. 

QUESTION:  That's not your position.

 MR.  GARRE: 

The question  would  be  the same 

question that  this Court  considered in  the Rivers  case


which was  whether or not  Congress created new  causes of


action  in  the  1991  Civil  Rights  Act,  and  the Court


analyzed  that question  by  looking  to Congress'  intent


enacting that act.  Some parties argued that  Congress had


simply clarified  and  continued into  effect old  rights.


Other parties argued that Congress had created new rights,


and this  Court agreed with  that interpretation.  And we


think that  that interpretation requires the conclusion in


this case  that petitioners'  claims are  governed by  the


statute of limitations in section 1658. 


If  I  could  refer  to  another  problem  with


respondent's construction and that is it -- it essentially

renders  inoperative  the  default  rule  established  by


Congress in  section 1658 in  the vast majority  of cases,


and that's  because Congress  rarely creates  the kind  of


wholly  new and self-contained cause of action that has no


reference to or roots in Federal law.  And that's the only


time that  the default rule, which Congress  thought was a


significant improvement to the prior  practice of State -足

interpretation.

 QUESTION:  Well,  it  did so  in  the Truth  in 

Lending  Act and  -- and the  Clean Air Act  and the Clean 

Water Act.  Those are all new enactments.

 MR.  GARRE: 

But  -- but,  Justice  Kennedy,


Congress  often  chooses  to  -- to build  upon  existing


Federal law in creating causes of action.


 QUESTION:  Well,  in this  case, what about  the


problem with  the implied cause of  action?  I  don't read


section (c) as explicitly granting a -- a private cause of


action.


 MR. GARRE:  We think -- from  our understanding


of  section (c), it  was intended to  clarify that section


1981 does create a private right of action, which -- which


this Court had held in Runyan and reaffirmed in Patterson.


 But we don't  think it's a problem  if the Court

concludes  that  petitioners'  claims  depend  on  both


subsection (a)  of 1981 and subsection (b) of 1981 because


petitioners' claims only  exist today because of  the 1991


act,  in that  respect, arise  under  that act,  under the


dictionary  definition  of  arising  under  and  under the


settled definition of arising under  that Congress uses in


title 28 of the United States Code. 


Petitioner seems to read the statute's reference


to an act of Congress to refer  only to an act of Congress


that creates the  kind of wholly new  self-contained cause


of action I mentioned. 


QUESTION:  You mean respondent, yes.


 MR. GARRE:  Respondent.  You're right, Mr. Chief


Justice. 


But we think, as -- as Judge Alito concluded  in


his dissenting  opinion in the Zubi  case, that an  act of


Congress is just  as naturally read and has  to be read to


include an  act of Congress that creates a cause of action


by amending an existing cause of action. 


And  all of  respondent's  objections about  the


practicality of  our position, which we think is -- is the


plain-meaning  position of  what Congress  -- the  statute


that  Congress  wrote,  have  to  be weighed  against  the


intractable  problems  that  this  Court and  the  Federal


Courts Study Committee identified with respect to the past

practice of borrowing State statutes of limitations.


 Our inquiry focuses the analysis exclusively  on


Congress'  actions  and  Federal law,  and  we  think that


that's where  Congress wanted  the courts to  focus.  The


prior  practice focused  the  inquiry on  State  law.  It


required Federal courts  to canvas State law,  to identify


an  analogous State cause  of action,  and then to  try to


identify the statute  of limitations  that would apply  in


the  State to  that cause  of action, and  then to  make a


separate  determination  whether  that  State  statute  of


limitations could appropriately be applied to Federal law.


And that had created great uncertainty and great disparity


in the  application of Federal law.  Indeed, under the old


practice, a single Federal claim  could be subjected to 50


different State statutes of limitations. 


And  that  was  the problem  that  Congress  was


addressing at  the -- the recommendation  of the  Federal


Courts  Study Committee in enacting  section 1658.  And it


decided, as a result of  the compromise, to apply it  only


on a going-forward basis  with respect to new claims  that


were created by Congress after 1990. 


Petitioners' claims only exist today as a result


of Congress'  action in the 1991 act, and we think they're


clearly  governed  by the  default statute  of limitations


established by section 1658.

 As petitioners' counsel made clear, section 1658


is  only a default  rule.  Congress can always  specify a


different  rule  and it  has done  so several  times since


1990.  It did so in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of -- of 2002,


and that's  significant because that  act, Sarbanes-Oxley,


amending an existing cause of  action under the Securities


and Exchange  Act -- so if -- if  Congress had in mind the


interpretation of  section 1658 that  respondent proposes,


it's certainly  odd that  Congress felt  obliged to  amend


1658 to  put  in the  special statute  of limitations  for


securities laws claims.


 QUESTION:  What was the period prescribed in the


Sarbanes-Oxley statute?


 MR. GARRE:  It's 2  years after the discovery of


facts and 5 years after the violation, which is  different


than the 4-year  rule established  by Congress in  section


1658(a).


 We think the court of appeals in this case erred


in subjecting petitioners' section 1981 claims, which only


exist  because of the  1991 Civil  Rights Act, to  the old


borrowing practice that Congress  sought to put an  end to


in  1990, and we  think that  this Court should  hold that


those  claims  are  governed  by  the uniform  statute  of


limitations established by section 1658.


 QUESTION: 

Will  there be  some  retroactivity

problems if some States have 6-year statute of limitations


and this reduces that period?


 MR. GARRE:  No.  As -- as Judge Alito explained


in his -- may I answer that question? 


QUESTION:  Yes.


 MR. GARRE:  As Judge Alito explained in the Zubi


dissent,  there's no  retroactivity  problems because  the


only  expectation  that  a  plaintiff  could  have  after


Congress created  the new causes of  action in 1991  is if


those  causes of actions  would be subject  to the default


statute of limitations specified.

MR. GARRE:  Thank you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


 MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


 It seems to  me that there are  two propositions


that arise out of the conversation of the past 25 minutes.


 First of all, there is no single uniform meaning


of the  -- of the expression, arising under.  It is not a


term of art.  It is a term of  chaos.  It is a -- it is  a


phrase  that  is used  repeatedly  in  different contexts,


routinely  used  with  a  very  pragmatic  -- in  a  very

pragmatic fashion and does not answer the question whether


or not Congress, when  it adopted 1658, or Congress,  when


it amended section  1981, really  envisioned this kind  of


expansive  interpretation that would  allow an argument to


be made that  State laws are suddenly  subject to statutes


of limitations.  As Justice Scalia  asked, when you  make


other kinds of adjustments in these schemes, are you going


to have to resolve every -- every one of these issues?


 I mean, the  question with respect to  the split


in  the circuits.  There is currently  pending a proposed


change to the  Air Carriers  Access Act that  specifically


resolves the conflict in the circuits between the Eleventh


Circuit which says there is  no cause of action and  other


circuits that says there is a cause of action.


 These  aren't  hypotheticals. 

These are  real


issues and if this Court is not careful in how it tries to


confine the interpretation of section  1658, it's going to


be interpreting  the statute  for the  better part of  the


next  10  years,  which  may be  good  news  for  me  as a


practitioner before the Court.  But I'm quite certain that


it's not  good news either for  my clients, for  the lower


courts that are going to have to adjudicate these problems


or for -足


QUESTION:  The solution to  the last problem you


raised offered  by the  petitioner is  simply you  use the

newer  statute,  and  you  don't  have  to look  into  the


question of -- of which  side of the circuit conflict  was


correct.  If the right is created  by the new statute, it


didn't matter  whether it -- if  it's affirmed by  the new 

statute, you're suing  under the  new statute, it  doesn't 

matter whether it existed before  or not.  Why isn't  that 

an adequate solution?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well,  it might  be an  adequate 

solution,  Justice  Scalia,  except that  it's  not  self-


evident from the language, arising under.  The question is


what -- what is the use of arising under that you're going


to try to apply in a more or less uniform fashion.


 QUESTION:  But  I think isn't her answer  to the


-- to  the  fact  that it  isn't  self-evident  from  the


language alone an answer she gave to a separate  question,


and that is that it's the policy  of Congress to apply the


-- the 4-year rule  when it can so that if  in doubt -- if


the language allows  but doesn't  compel, then the  answer


would be  apply the new statute  because that is  going to


get to the  congressional objective of getting  the 4-year


statute as broad -足


MR.  PHILLIPS:  And  there -- and  I don't think


there's  support  for  that  objective  in  --

in  this


particular statute because if Congress really meant -足

that they started out by  intending to -- to apply  the 4足

only  fell back out  of fear  of -- of  violating reliance


interests which would say the -- the objective is still to


get the broadest possible application?


 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, no.  It's a question of -足


I mean, they -- they obviously made a -- a compromise, but


the question is why isn't it as reasonable a compromise to


say, look,  we're going  to deal  with this  in the  truly


classic  sense of the  word prospective.  Every new self-


contained statute  that goes into effect is now subject to


this  rule.  And  -- and literally,  as  Justice Kennedy


said -足


QUESTION:  They could -足


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- they do that every day. 


QUESTION:  -- they could have said that, but the


-- the  counter-argument to -- to what you've just said is


-- and -- and maybe this is  -- I hope you'll  comment on


this, that  on your reading, the  4-year statute is  -- is


rarely going to be  applied simply because there -- there


aren't  very  many  sort  of  absolutely  brand-new,


freestanding, self-contained  causes of  action.  Most of


them are -- are subjects of tinkering from time to time.


 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, Justice  Souter, the -- the


reality is  that this is far  more common than  you think.

The anti-terrorism statute  has specific standalone causes


of action.  The Muhammad  Ali Reform -- Boxing Reform  Act


has a  standalone cause of action.  I mean, there are, in


fact a host  of statutes in which Congress  does precisely


what the other side  claims it rarely does.  I  mean, this


-- if -- if the Court  would like us  to provide a  list, 

we'd be happy to do it. 

QUESTION:  Yes,  but the  argument is the  other 

way. 

I  mean,  it's that  very  often  major  pieces of


legislation are  enacted in the form of what looks like an


amendment of  a current statute.  I think of  the Celler-


Kefauver Act.  I mean,  on your theory, all of  merger law


would really  be viewed as not  a new statute when  it was


totally new.  There were no merger cases to speak of prior


to Celler-Kefauver.  And then  they come in and section  7


applies to assets and all of a sudden you have merger law.


Well, on your view that would  be just viewed as -- as  if


it were  some kind  of trivial  amendment when it  created


half of anti-trust law.  I mean, you  see, that's the kind


of problem I think -足


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, no,  I understand that, but


the problem you still have, Justice Breyer, is that you've


got to figure out how do you try to reconcile -足


QUESTION:  Well,  we reconcile  it by saying  if


it's a  new -- you look at the act of Congress.  An act of

Congress is  called Public Law 3278 or whatever it is, and

cause of action, and if  after you did, well, that's  what 

they mean.  It arises under a new  act of Congress.  That 

seems pretty simple. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  That's -- that's  pretty simple,


Justice Breyer,  but it  doesn't answer Justice  Kennedy's


question which  is if you look  at this particular  act of


Congress, which is codified in  subsection (b), it doesn't


give  you  any  basis  for  a  right  of  action.

QUESTION:  -- that -- that -- if you're asking


me the  question, I'd answer  that question by  saying, of


course, they intended  a private right of action to apply.


I mean,  now  let's go  into  the history  of it  and  see


whether they did or not. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  But, Justice Breyer, that's -足


QUESTION:  And I think -- I think that by the -足

 But  in  my way  of  thinking, that  doesn't  raise a


serious question because I don't  believe that they didn't

intend to  raise -- to have  this as a  private right  of


action.


 MR. PHILLIPS:  But I  still -- but that  still


doesn't  answer what -- what strikes me as the fundamental


question which  is when Congress  approached section 1981,


did it think that  it was, in  fact, creating a whole  new


infrastructure cause of action or  was it basically simply


engrafting  it back onto what section  1981 has been since


1866.


 QUESTION:  It  was engrafting  it on and  before


they  passed the act  of Congress,  you did not  have this


kind of cause of action, and after they wrote the new act,


you did have it.  Therefore -足


MR. PHILLIPS:  But -- but you -- but, Justice


Breyer, you only have this cause of action because four -足


three of the  four elements arise and  existed long before


1991, and those -- and that -- and it clearly has to arise


under that portion of it as well.  So the question is, if


it arises under both, what's  the right resolution of  the 

question? 

And the point  that, it  seems to  me, that  the 

petitioner and the  United States have never  responded to


is why is it you would  adopt a rule that carries with  it


as much complication and complexity as the rule that  they


propose when you don't have to come out that --

 QUESTION: 

I  think  their  answer  is,  as  I


understand it,  that is  the approach  that gives  maximum


effect  to  the new  statutes of  limitation that  -- that


Congress has enacted.  Now, what -- what evidence is there


that Congress wanted it to have maximum effect? 


MR.  PHILLIPS: 

There  is  no  evidence  that


Congress wanted it to have maximum effect. 


QUESTION:  Well, except  the fact  they enacted


the statute.


 MR. PHILLIPS:  The statute  applies on a regular


basis  to  almost everyday  acts  that Congress  adopts in


which they  provide a cause of action and do not provide a


statute  of limitations.  And that spares  this Court and


every  other court  the burden  of having  to borrow  from


State law,  trying to figure out what  analogous State law


claims  would  be  used  as the  basis  for  a  statute of 

limitations. 

QUESTION:  One of the  problems that troubles me 

about borrowing  State law -- I've had a lot of experience


in these cases -- that if you look at  this statute under


State law,  I think the old cause of action that Patterson


recognized would  be  a contract  cause  of action. 

And


arguably, the  one before us today  is a tort  action.  So


you'd probably  have to follow the State  tort law statute


of limitations for half the  case and the contract statute

of limitations for the other  half of the case, after  you


figure out  which State  law applies.  So  you have  this


problem, even if  you're referring back  to State law,  of


maybe coming out with two different results.


 MR. PHILLIPS:  Except that I think, for the most


part, the courts have pretty well resolved what they  were 

going to do with  respect to section 1981.  I would  have 

thought the problem -足

QUESTION:  Well, the section 1981  as construed


in Patterson is clearly a contract claim.


 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.


 QUESTION:  But as -- but this cause of action I


don't think is clearly a contract claim.


 MR.  PHILLIPS: 

Well, it's  difficult  to know


whether Congress  meant  to change  that.  I  -- I  don't


disagree with that.


 But I  -- but it  still seems  to  me the  more


fundamental problem in  trying to  sort out what  Congress


did with respect to section 1981 is that it never intended


to make this into a brand new infrastructure.  It took the


existing four elements.  It didn't change a single word in


section 1981 when it implemented this cause of action.  So


the notion that this is a cause of action that arises only


under the  1990 act is  clearly -- under the 1991  act is


clearly --

 QUESTION:  How much -- how much trouble are  we


going to have  in the future if  -- if we adopted  your -足


your theory?  How -- you  know, how am I to decide  in the


future whether  a new cause of action arises all by itself


or whether it -- it attaches to a greater or lesser degree


to a preexisting statute?  What's -- is it an easy test?


 MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- I think every court that has


adopted that test -- certainly the Seventh Circuit in this


case  and other courts of  appeals have recognized that it 

is  an infinitely simpler  test than trying  to figure out 

what  arising under  will  mean  in  all  of  its  various 

permutations and new statutes.  All you have to look at is


to see whether or not the cause -- the elements -- all the


elements of the cause of  action are newly created.  That


may be  embodied in  a -- in  an amendment to  an existing


statute.  It may be  on a stand alone basis.  But I -- I


submit to  you that is  a significantly simpler  course to


follow.


 And, indeed, I don't -足


QUESTION: 

But one  thing  that isn't  simpler


about  it,  Mr.  Phillips, is  the  problem  that Congress


sought to  cure with 1658, that  is, you can  have amazing


diversity across  the country if you're  borrowing States'


limits.  For  the same claim, it  could be 2 years  in one


State, 3  years in another, 6 in another.  Congress surely

wanted  to  cut  out  that  disparity  so  that  similarly


situated people would have the same right to sue.


 MR. PHILLIPS:  On a prospective basis,  there's


no question about  that, that the Congress had  passed the


Anti-terrorism Act that created a new cause of action, did


not  want  the kind  of  inherent inequalities  that arise


under borrowing to go forward. 


QUESTION:  And that's suggesting that -足


MR. PHILLIPS:  It says  nothing about what  the


Congress did retroactively.


 QUESTION:  -- that  the old  way is  inherently


complex because  you have to figure out which would be the


closest State limitation.  And Congress just wanted to get


away from  that complexity.  I 
 don't know that  that's -足


that that what was introduced is  -- is more complex.  It


seems to me less so.


 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I -- Justice Ginsburg, your


own hypotheticals  suppose exactly  how many  complexities


are going to  arise, and I -- I can assure  you that as -足


as much imagination  as we've  put into this,  plaintiffs'


counsels and defense  counsel going forward will  try even


harder to end up fighting these issues in terms  of the -足


in terms of how complex this is. 


All  you  have  to  do  is  look  at  the second


certified class  in this case.  The district judge in this

case  thought this was  an easy  statute to  interpret and


applied it to  classes 1 and 3.  When he got to  class 2,


what did he  say?  He  said, with respect to  those claims


with regard to part-time employment, the parties are going


to have to sort  that out themselves.  He made  no attempt


to  sort

don't  know.  I'm  just thinking  about it.  But Congress


passes a new statute.  It's called New, New, New. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  And it's in a special code, title 78,


just to be new.  And it says this -- and this is total new


and here is what it is.  We have a Federal cause of action


and  a claim for  double damages  for anyone who  has been


injured by a robbery  committed with a gun.  And then  it


says, robbery shall be defined  as it is defined in  title


18, section 391.  And now,  a gun -- that's new here,  but


we define that -- you see what I'm doing?


 MR. PHILLIPS:  Of course. 


QUESTION:  I'm just reproducing. 


Now, how  are you going to  take that?  Is that


new, new, new?

you see.

QUESTION:  We  get three of the elements from -足


 MR. PHILLIPS:  But that doesn't change anything,


Justice Breyer.  Of course, you can refer back to it.  The


question is are all of the elements of the cause of action


independently provided for  in the New, New,  New statute,


and the answer is yes.


 QUESTION: 

But  you  can  do  it  by  a  cross


reference.  In other words, in your view, if it's done  to


-- through  a cross  reference, they  are still new,  new,


new, but it's done by a physical placement, it's old, old,


old.


 MR.  PHILLIPS: 

No, I  don't  think  it's that


simple, Justice Breyer.  If it's done where Congress means


to create  a new infrastructure and a new cause of action,


it's new,  new, new.  When Congress does nothing more than


engraft and  doesn't  even remotely  modify  the  existing

infrastructure,  it  doesn't even  so  much as  change the


words of  a statute that's been here from 1866, to suggest


that this is a -- a suit that arises solely under -- under


a 1991 amendment seems to me wrong. 


The -- the other point I think it's important to


make  in this connection  -- and -- and it's the  rule of


construction that seems to  get lost sight of -- is -- and


-- and it's the one this Court adopted in Wilson v. Garcia


-- is  that there  is no  reason to  assume that  Congress


would mean for  the -- to have two causes  -- two statutes


of limitation  apply to the same  cause of action  when it


was interpreting section 1983. 


And here we have a situation where you will have


two -- two statutes  of limitation  applying to  the same


words in the  same subsection of a statute.  And we raised


the  issue  in our  -- in our  brief  for the  respondent


saying, find us a statute where Congress has  ever allowed


that  kind of morass to exist, and  -- and the reply brief


is utterly  silent on that.  And for good  cause, because


there is  no reason  to assume  that  Congress would  have


adopted that interpretation.  And therefore, if you follow


the rule  of construction from Wilson v. Garcia and if you


accept what I think you  cannot help but except, which  is


that arising under is not an unambiguous line -足

protection problem there?


 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well -足


QUESTION:  When a person says, you know, I -- I


can sue within 4 years.  Somebody else can only sue within


2 because I am -- I am  an employee above 25 and -- and  I


only got my  cause of action  later.  And  -- and the  one 

reason for the difference is  my statute was enacted later

than yours.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Is it irrational?  Yes.  Is it


unconstitutional?  Probably  not under the standards  that


loosely govern these  kinds of issues unless  somebody can


attach it to some kind of -足


QUESTION: 

Mr.  Phillips,  would  this  be  a


different case if  instead of enacting the  statute it did


in 1991, they -- they simply had an amendment that said in


addition to the coverage of  the preexisting 1981, we will


add the  additional brand new  cause of action  which will


allow recovery for what happens after you get on the job?


 MR. PHILLIPS:  I think  if there were a  1981(d)


that  was  -- that  was  separately  contained  and  that


expressed a clear indication from  Congress that it really


meant to create a new cause of action, that  it would make


sense under those circumstances for  1658 to apply to that


particular situation. 


But I  think what  we're talking  about here  is

simply trying to  ascertain Congress' intent, and  I think


whether you look at it under section 1981's lens or if you


look  at  it under  section  1658's lens,  you  end up  at


exactly the same point.


 QUESTION:  But -- but your answer seems to me to


suggest  that  if  the statute  has  the  same substantive


effect,  you get  one result  in one  form of  -- type of


drafting  and a different result with  a different type of


drafting.


 MR.  PHILLIPS:  That's  -- to  be sure.  And it


goes back, I suppose, to the argument that was made by the


other  side  which  is that  there's  a  default rule  and


Congress  can  always change  it.  The  core  of this  is


Congress can always make its intent more explicit in terms


of how it deals with the problem.  The question is, do you


want to create  a regime in which  this Court is going  to


have to be  resolving questions  involving the meaning  of


section 1658 for the foreseeable future?


 Or doesn't it make sense to recognize that there


is, in fact,  a -- a complete  set of causes of  action to


which 1658 will routinely apply and that it will be spared


-- the courts will  be spared  and the litigants  will be


spared  the burden of  having to  sort out these  kinds of


issues on a  going-forward basis and recognize  that we're


not going to pick up everything in the interim?

 But as Congress  wants to go forward  and create


new causes of action,  the opportunity will arise, and  it


can do so.  But if it chooses to engraft it on an existing


infrastructure,  then  it  seems  to  me  under  those


circumstances, what the Court should do is say these cause


of action arises at this point in time.  It doesn't  arise


because  of the new  statute.  It's a much  simpler, much


cleaner way of dealing with the issue. 


And -- and that's the one  point I did  want to


make.  I don't -- I have not heard the other side remotely


complain  that our  approach  has  any  of  the  kinds  of 

complications.  I'm  not saying  it's without issues,  but 

it's nowhere near the complications -足

QUESTION:  No, but  it has  the -- it has  the 

complications that -- that preexisted  in trying to figure


out which State  law applies and so  forth and so on.  It


says that regime still survives in a lot of areas that  it


would not survive if you take their side.


 MR.  PHILLIPS: 

But  -- but  Congress clearly


recognized  that  it was  not  prepared to  eliminate that


regime because -- because it would --


QUESTION:  It seems to me that -足


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- would have created  all kinds


of problems on a retroactive basis.  It didn't want to -足


it didn't want to unsettle expectations.

least  the -- it's  the clarity  you know rather  than the


clarity you  don't know -- or the confusion that you don't

 MR. PHILLIPS:  There's  no retroactivity  issue


you need to worry about in that -足


QUESTION:  No, but since it's the same language,


you  see we discover that  small industry would be subject


to  the  4-year  statute,  but the  larger  firm  would be


subject  to  the  old statute,  just  exactly  what you're


complaining about under their interpretation.


 MR. PHILLIPS:  But -- but if --


QUESTION:  Am I wrong about that?


 MR. PHILLIPS:  I think you are wrong about that.


I think all -- if Congress has created a new  statute, it

to the 4-year  statute of limitations  period on a  going-


forward basis,  and  I think  it's eliminated  any of  the


confusion.


 And certainly Congress knows  -- would know  how


to do  that if the  Court were very  clear in  saying what


we're going  to apply 1658 to  is to new  causes of action


that are specifically stated with an entire infrastructure


created to  provide for them.  I  don't think they have to

do it in a new title 79 or whatever, but they clearly have


to do it by doing more than simply changing the definition

If there  are no other  questions, Your  Honors,


I'd urge you to affirm.


 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Phillips. 


Mr. Newsom, we'll hear from you.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. NEWSOM


 ON BEHALF OF THE FOR ALABAMA, ET AL.,


 AS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


 MR.  NEWSOM: 

Mr. Chief  Justice,  and  may it


please the Court:


 As perhaps  the most frequent litigants in suits


alleging violations of  Federal law, the States  and their


officers  have  an  overriding interest  in  this  case in


ensuring that  section 1658  is construed  to establish  a


clear and easily discernible rule. 


That in my mind leaves  two options.  There  are


effectively  two clear options  on the  table.  One  is to


apply  section  1658 to  all section  1981 claims  and the


other  is to -- is to  continue the practice  of applying


State borrowed  statutes of  limitations to  all of  those


claims. 


Both of  those rules  create the  same level  of

certainty, but  one of those rules, namely the -- the rule


that would  apply section 1658 to all section 1981 claims,


is plainly inconsistent  with Congress' intent and  indeed


with the  language of section 1658 itself in that it would


apply  to  claims that  on  any understanding  arose under


preexisting law.  Accordingly, the  State submits that the


respondent's position here is the best among the available


alternatives.


 QUESTION:  But,  Mr.  Newsom,  the reason  that


Congress grandfathered the claims that already existed, as


Mr. Phillips said,  was because  of expectations that  I'm


off  the hook  after 2 years,  say.  That  -- that doesn't


exist  when a right  is created,  a right to  relief, that 

didn't exist before.

 MR.  NEWSOM: 

Well,  I  think  the 

--  

the 

expectations  that  Congress sought  to  protect in  -- in


section  1658  were expectations  with respect  to certain


categories of claims.  In enacting section  1658 Congress


recognized that  there were certain  categories of  claims


that had  developed established  limitations  rules.  For


instance,  under  this  Court's  then-recent decisions  in


Wilson v. Garcia and Goodman v. Lukens Steel, section 1983


claims as a  -- as a category and section 1981 claims as a


category  were  both  subject  to  single  borrowed  State


statutes of limitations.  So  I think the expectation that

Congress  sought  to  protect  was  the expectation  of  a


litigant that I  have a 1981 claim and it  will be subject


to the following statute of limitations. 


So I think the -- that  -- I mean, it sounds  to


me that there is agreement  this morning that -- that  the


appropriate  test  to apply  is  the test  whether  or not


Congress  has created a new cause of  action.  I think the


clearest  evidence  that  Congress  has  done  that,  that


Congress  has  created a  new  cause of  action,  is where


Congress  creates  and enacts  an  entirely  new, separate


statutory  section.  And  again, contrary  to petitioners'


suggestions -- and Justice Kennedy is quite right -- there


are  numerous times that Congress has, since December 1 of


1990, created an  entirely new and freestanding  causes of


action to which section 1658 would certainly apply.


 Now, Congress'  choice in the 1991  Civil Rights


Act not to create a  new statutory section and instead  to


-- to work within  the four corners of section 1981 and to


-- to  fine tune the existing cause of action that already


existed in section 1981 is a strong indication -足


QUESTION:  How can  you say it's fine  tuning an


existing cause of  action if  the plaintiff couldn't  have


recovered before the 1991 amendment? 


MR.  NEWSOM:  Well,  I  think  the -- the  key


consideration here  is that Congress  had a choice  in the

1991 act  how it would respond to this Court's decision in


Patterson. 

It  was  acting  against  a  very  specific


backdrop.


 QUESTION:  Would you agree  with Mr. Phillips if


they'd  written  a different  statute  that came  out with


exactly the  same result, but they  just said -- it would


not -- not redefine words but simply said, in addition to


what you can already do you, you may also recover for what


happens on the job?


 MR.  NEWSOM:  I  agree  with Mr.  Phillips, and


having -- having  just said that the  strongest indication


of Congress'  intent to create a new cause of action would


be its  creation of an entirely new statutory scheme, I do


agree  that  as  -- as  Congress  moves  away  from  that


paradigm, that  it may,  for instance,  in a  freestanding


section 1981(d), if it enacts all of the elements of a new


-- of a  new claim, that yes, indeed,  that would create a


new cause  of  action  within -- within  the  meaning  of


section 1658.


 QUESTION:  But if it  had done that,  then we'd


still have  the same problems of deciding whether the -- a


particular -- like class 2 in this case, whether they come


under one  section rather than the other.  You'd have that


problem then. 


MR. NEWSOM:  I'm not -- I'm not sure that that's

exactly right.  The problem with class 2 -- and tell me if


I'm misunderstanding.  The problem  with class 2  is that


class 2 rises or falls on a given set of -- on a given set


of facts.  The  district court did  not conclude  whether


this class of  -- this class of  plaintiffs' promotion and


assignment  claims  would  succeed on  a  specific  set of


facts.  The problem  -- and that  we think is  the -- the


problem inherent  in petitioners'  position that  ties the


question of whether a new cause of action has been created


to the  viability of a given claim rather than looking, as


section -- as section 1658  directs the Court to do,  what


-- to -- to whether  or not a civil action is  created.  A


civil action  in my mind speaks to your ticket into court,


not so  much with respect to what  happens to you once you


get there.  So -足


QUESTION:  I -- I suppose any suggestion that we


would be creating a -- a problem for Congress in giving it


-- in posing a  dilemma for it is  that they can  provide,


number  one,  a  new  statute  and  have  the  statute  of


limitations set forth specifically. 


MR. NEWSOM:  Well, that's certainly true.  Any


-- I -- I certainly agree that any rule  this Court adopts


could be  superseded by a subsequent amendment of -- of an


enactment by Congress.  But in the meantime, this Court we


think ought to  adopt a rule that  minimizes confusion and

-- and  maximizes certainty.  That,  in essence, is  -- is


the  -- is the  -- the proposition  coming  out of  this


Court's  decision  in Wilson  v.  Garcia, as  Mr. Phillips


said,  which is that  in that case,  Justice O'Connor, for


instance, made a very good point in her dissent that -- in


that  1983  claims  run the  gamut  from  police brutality


claims on the one hand to -- to school desegregation cases


on the other and thought that it just didn't make sense to


apply  a  single statute  of  limitations to  such  a wide


variety of claims. 


And this Court held -- and I submit correctly -足


that  the  practical considerations,  those  of maximizing


certainty  and  minimizing  litigation,  required  the


enactment  -- or  the  -- the  imposition 
 of  a  single


categorical, some would surely say formalistic, statute of


limitations. 

And  the  same  practical  considerations


obtained here at least -足


QUESTION:  It's  also true, is it not, that this


is  one of those  unique cases in which  the -- the 4-year


rule  will  help some  plaintiffs  and help  defendants in


other cases because some of the State statutes for certain


causes are  actually longer  than 4 years?  So  sometimes


it's cutting it down and sometimes it's expanding it.


 MR. NEWSOM:  That's certainly right.


 And the State's principal interest here is in --

is in a -- a clear statute of limitations, not necessarily


the shortest statute of limitations.  Our interest here is


-- is principally in clarity.


 So again, if  I can just emphasize,  Congress -足


Congress  acted in section  -- or  rather in the  1991 act


against  a  very specific  backdrop,  namely this  Court's


then-recent  decision in  Goodman v.  Lukens  Steel, which


held  that a -- that a  single borrowed State  statute of


limitations would apply  to all section 1981 claims.  Now,


if Congress  wanted to walk away from Goodman and create a


new  cause of action  so as  to trigger section  1658's 4足


year  statute, then our  submission is  then it had  to be


clear  about what  it was  doing.  It  had to  -- in the


paradigmatic example, it  had to 
 create a new  standalone


section.  At the very least, it had to create a -- a self-


contained  and  freestanding  civil  action  within  the


confines of section 1681.  But where it merely defined the


term in a preexisting cause of action, we submit that that


is simply not  clear enough to -- to apply the -- the 4足


year statute.


 If there are no further questions. 


QUESTION:  One other  question, if I  may.  Are


there  other  statutes  like  -- that  have  just  made  a


substantive  amendment  merely by  redefining  a term?  I


think this  is kind  of a -- this is  kind of  an unusual

 Ms. Gorman, you have 4 minutes remaining.


 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. CANDACE GORMAN


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


 MS. GORMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


Justice  Stevens,  if  I can  answer  your  last


question.  Yes, there was another statute that I can think


of  and that's the  Pregnancy Discrimination  Act although


this is  before 1990.  So  the 1658 question  doesn't come


into play.  But title  VII was  amended just to  add that


cause of action for pregnancy discrimination -足


QUESTION:  And  did  they  do  it -- did  that


statute do it just by redefining a term, redefining -足


MS. GORMAN:  Correct, Your  Honor, by redefining


discrimination based on sex to also include discrimination


in pregnancy. 


QUESTION:  Yes.  That  was in response  to our


Gilbert case.


 MS. GORMAN:  Correct.


 Your Honor,  defendant raised two  statutes that


they -- that they could now  point to that they said would


benefit from section  1658.  They pointed  to the Muhammad

Ali  Boxing Act and  the anti-discrimination  law.  And I


submit to this Court, as Justice Breyer said, those aren't


going to  be new acts either because  if you look at those


acts,  they're actually amending  previous acts,  and they


pull definitional terms  out of previous acts  from before


1990.


 If  defendant's  interpretation  is  accepted by


this Court, then we are basically saying section 1658 is a


nullity because we  have scoured  the statutes enacted  by


Congress  after December 1st,  1990 and we  could not find


one statute that would benefit  from section 1658, because


Congress often  takes terms  or definitions  or causes  of


action from  previous statutes  and amends,  even when  it


thinks  it's  creating  or  it  looks like 
 it's  creating


something brand new.


 QUESTION:  I -- I  don't know what you're saying


when you say it  takes it from them.  Do  you mean it just


copies them in the new  act?  Are you counting  situations


in which they recite it in the new legislation? 


MS. GORMAN:  Correct,  Your  Honor, where  they


take -足


QUESTION:  Well, I don't think -足


MS. GORMAN:  -- terms  out of the new -- out of


old legislation. 


QUESTION:  I don't think  your opponent would --

would count them.  I -- I  think only if  -- if you  rely


upon the  earlier statute for  the definition, not  if you


simply copy that  definition in the  new statute, I  don't


think he would consider that to be covered. 


MS. GORMAN:  Well,  Your Honor,  if that's  the


case, then I think what respondent must be suggesting then


is that section 1658  would only come into play if the new


statute was the only statute  you were relying on.  And  I


don't think  that's what section 1658 is stating.  I think


if  -- even if  this  Court says,  we're  relying on  old


section 1981,  as well  as 1981  as amended  by the  Civil


Rights -- Civil  Rights Act,  clearly our  claim is  still


dependent on the 1991 act and therefore section 1658 would


still come into play. 


And  as  far as  confusion,  defendant suggested


that there  was even  confusion in  this case  because the


judge in  our case  did not know  if class  2 claims  were


covered by  this section 1658.  There is no confusion with


the court. 

It just  wasn't  briefed before  the  court.


There was  no record before the court because we had asked


for  a  slightly  different  definition  in  our  class


certification, and  the judge went beyond  that definition


and established a different class for the class 2.  So the


judge just  didn't have the record and he thought we could


figure that, which I think we probably could.  And I think


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


55 

the  answer is  going to be  that the class  2 claims also


fall under the 1658 statute.


 The question before this Court  is a narrow one:


does section 1658 apply to plaintiffs' cause of action for


racial discrimination and termination?  Those claims  were


not created  until the 1991 Civil Rights Act, and I submit


to  the Court  that  section 1658  should  apply to  those 

claims.

 Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms. Gorman.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon,  at  11:23  a.m.,  the  case  in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
