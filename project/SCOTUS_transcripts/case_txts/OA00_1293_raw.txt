CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 00-1293, John Ashcroft v. The American Civil


Liberties Union.


Mr. Olson.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


GENERAL OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


All three branches of our National Government


have repeatedly determined that pornography causes


substantial, incalculable damage to our children, that


assisting parents in protecting children from that damage


is a compelling national interest, and that pornography is


widely available and readily accessible to our children on


the Internet.


The Child Online Protection Act is Congress'


response to that urgent national problem.  It was drafted


after testimony, hearings, and findings in direct response


to explicit and detailed guidance in this Court's 1993


Reno v. ACLU decision explaining how to solve the problem


of Internet pornography in a constitutional manner.


COPA directly responds to several of the Court's


explicit suggestions in its 1997 Reno v. ACLU decision.

In the first place, Congress gave explicit, substantive


meaning to the terms, harmful to minor, utilizing


standards developed over several decades by this Court


describing what would be prohibited in the terms used by


this Court in the context of minors.  I will not get into


the specifics of that, because those are before the Court,


and the Court is quite familiar with them.


The Court also added, however, in response to


this Court's explicit suggestion, the third prong of the


so-called Ginsberg-Miller test, that the material taken as


a whole would have to lack serious literary, artistic,


political, or scientific value for minors, an objective


standard developed by this Court to protect the producers


of communications.  Congress limited the statute to


commercial pornographers at this Court's suggestion, those


whose trade or business, in an effort to produce profits,


are engaged regularly in the production of explicit sexual


material for profit.


QUESTION:  In your view, is the provision that


it has to be objectionable to minors, is that a national


standard?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, as -- the reference to


community standards in the statute is in the first and


second and prongs of a three-part test.  This Court has


introduced that community standard provision to protect

the communicator from individualized determinations by


jurors, and from particularly sensitive, or particularly


insensitive communities.


The Court has explained again and again that it


is an average standard.  It is an adult approach to what


might be prohibited from the standpoint of damage to


minors.  The Court has repeatedly said that it might be --


it doesn't refer to any specific geographic limitation. 


In fact, in the Hamling case and in the Jenkins case


decided by this Court several years ago, the Court made it


clear that the community standards prong does not have to


apply to any specific community.


QUESTION:  But Mr. Olson, isn't the problem with


that argument that the definition also refers to the


average person, so it's working average in by a separate


provision.  If that is where the average comes in, then


doesn't the reference to community have to mean something


geographical if it's going to mean anything at all?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, this Court has repeatedly


said -- for example, in the Hamling case the Court was


looking at a geographic standard that covered the entire


State of California.  The Court said in Hamling and


Jenkins that the standard doesn't have to have any


specific geographic limitation.


QUESTION:  But did it -- did that -- and I just

don't remember this.  Were we dealing there with a statute


that separately referred to kind of an average person


standard?  Because the problem that I have here is, if you


say, well, it's -- what it's trying to get at is a norm,


it's already built the norm in on a different textual


basis, and therefore if it's already built that into the


definition, and it then additionally speaks of community


standard, then that's where I have the problem, so in the


case that you refer to, was the definition the same?  Did


it have the two prongs?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, yes, because the Court was


in that case applying the two -- the other two prongs that


this Court --


QUESTION:  No, no, but I mean, did it have the


average person provision in the definition?


GENERAL OLSON:  It wasn't in the definition in


the statute itself.  It was what this Court read into --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Well, now we've got it in the


statute itself, so in effect I guess you're saying the


reference to community standard, or the reference to


average, one or the other, is essentially redundant in the


definition.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, it may be, but what the


Congress was attempting to do was to develop and put into


the statute the protections which this Court over the

years have said are very important to protect the


communicator.


QUESTION:  You're saying it's a belt and


suspenders definition.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, what this Court has


decided is that something to prevent jurors from


deciding -- imposing their own individual standards, or


imposing the least sensitive standards of the community,


or the most sensitive standards of the community.


QUESTION:  General Olson, there's one thing that


you -- some new thing comes up in your brief.  We go from


Miller, where there was a geographical base, and I know


you said that the Internet is not geographical base, but


you use a term that, what is harmful to minors is


reasonably constant across the United States.  Now, is


that reasonably constant something looser than, say, the


serious value as a limitation on what would qualify as


harmful to minors?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, there is two parts to


that.  The serious value standard is an objective standard


that this Court and other courts are entitled to examine


closely, and have examined closely to make sure that there


aren't any aberrational prosecutions or limits imposed.


With respect to the community standards, what


the Congress was attempting to do was to make sure that

people didn't impose individual limitations with respect


to how they were judging the material with respect to the


other two prongs of the statute.  I hope I have answered


your question, but --


QUESTION:  Well, the words that I used, they


invoke Miller, so it sounds like Congress didn't write any


word formula that was any different, but you say


something -- it's not --


GENERAL OLSON:  That was a finding, so to speak,


by the House committee that there is not with respect --


years have changed since the Miller and the Hamling case. 


We're now in an era of national television, national


media -- some of those standards were articulated at a


time when the community of the United States was much more


isolated and insular in various different parts.  We are


now talking about a national media, national television,


national communication, the Internet reaching millions and


millions of households.


What Congress felt, that there would not be


substantial variation between what the average adult would


feel would be harmful to minors under the very specific,


itemized, detailed standards, prong 1, prong 2, and then


with the value-added prong 3 --


QUESTION:  What was the basis for thinking that


the harmful to minors would be reasonably constant to a

greater extent than what is obscene?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, the House report that


specifically talked about that did not explain. I should


hasten to -- did not explain what the individual elected


Members of Congress were thinking when they came to those


conclusions.  I think it's a reasonable thing to conclude,


is that Members of Congress are reflecting the judgments


that they develop as a result of running for office and


being in a national legislature.


That's exactly what we expect Congress to do,


and what Congress did in this case was apply those


standards, and those instincts, and those judgments in a


way in which it was in every conscientious way attempting


to comply with the instruction that came from this Court


in Reno v. ACLU as to how to do it.


QUESTION:  Well, I think it's a difficult


question.  I don't know what the rule ought to be, but if


you have a trial in State A, say a western State,


California, can you bring in an expert from New York and


from five other States, experts to tell the jury what the


community standard is there, or does the trial judge rule


that irrelevant?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, the courts have permitted


expert testimony with respect to that, but there's a great


deal of supervision that the trial courts and the

appellate courts impose with respect to that to make sure


that these definitions are being applied in a


nonaberrational --


QUESTION:  In your view, how does it work?  I


have a California jury.  Is it proper, or is it necessary


for that jury to consider what the standards are in other


parts of the country before it returns its verdict?


GENERAL OLSON:  I would submit, Justice Kennedy,


that yes, that would be possible.  The Hamling instruction


I think is instructive.  The Hamling instruction was the


standards generally held throughout this country


concerning sex, and matters pertaining to sex, the average


conscience of the time, the present critical point in the


compromise between candor and shame at which the community


may have arrived at here and now.


In other words, that standard -- and the


defendant in that case argued to this Court that that is a


national standard which this Court in Miller said was not


required as a matter of the First Amendment.


Interestingly, in Hamling, the defendants in


that case argued just as the plaintiffs in this case do,


that a national standard is both required and would be


prohibited.  In other words, they want to have it both


ways.


QUESTION:  They want to have it neither way.

 GENERAL OLSON:  They want to have it neither


way.  Either way, it would be unconstitutional, and this


Court has specifically addressed that by saying that it --


that jurors are allowed to draw from their experience,


which necessarily comes from the community in which they


reside, but that Congress felt in this case that there


would be relatively constant standards throughout the


country.  This is a facial challenge.


QUESTION:  Well, when you say relative --


GENERAL OLSON:  There's no evidence --


QUESTION:  You say relatively.  I'd like you to


be specific.  That is, would it satisfy you if this Court


said, when it says the words, average person applying


contemporary community standards, we instruct the jury


that the word community means the United States taken as a


whole?


GENERAL OLSON:  I think that this Court has said


that that is not a requirement of the First Amendment, but


from the --


QUESTION:  I know.  I'm not saying it's a


requirement --


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  -- of the First Amendment.  Suppose,


having read the legislative history, I came to the


conclusion that that, in light of all the constitutional

difficulties, is just what Congress had in mind, and


therefore I wrote in the opinion, community means the


entire audience at which this is aimed, likely the entire


United States.


GENERAL OLSON:  I --


QUESTION:  Now, if those words were in the


opinion, would you consider that you had won this case?


GENERAL OLSON:  I think I would, Justice Breyer,


and I think --


QUESTION:  So that satisfies you.


GENERAL OLSON:  And I think that would be a --


the statute is readily -- to use the words of this Court,


the statute is readily susceptible to the narrowing


construction, if that's how you would regard that, or a


leveling construction.  I --


QUESTION:  Now, would you tell me what the


difference is between the construction that Justice Breyer


has suggested and the result of your argument that the


third prong, the value prong, is in fact an objective


prong and hence a national -- I assume it's a national


standard.  It's an objective prong, and therefore that in


effect eliminates -- as I understand your argument, the


application of that prong eliminates a lot of the


idiosyncracy that might conceivably come in under a strict


geographic standard.

 Is there a difference between the construction


Justice Breyer is suggesting and the result that we would


get if we accepted your argument about the effect of the


third prong?


GENERAL OLSON:  I don't think so.  I think that


what Justice Breyer is suggesting is a jury instruction or


a judicial construction which would apply to prongs 1 and


2, and that what you're saying is absolutely correct also,


we submit, that that is precisely what this Court has said


that third prong is there for.  I should --


QUESTION:  Oh, I wasn't necessarily saying it. 


I was saying that I think you're saying it.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well then, I agree with your


construction of what I'm saying.


QUESTION:  Of you, okay.


(Laughter.)


GENERAL OLSON:  I think it's a very important


point to make, that the Court has said that that is


another way in which we protect the speaker from


aberrational, highly --


QUESTION:  Well, but aren't you then saying to


us that Congress, when it used the word community, really


meant to say national?


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Yes.

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I suspect, Justice


Stevens, that the people who assisted the Members of


Congress in drafting the statute read this Court's


decisions, as there's every indication in the two


committee reports and in the hearings that were taken,


that the Court was attempting in every way to live up to


the standards of this Court.  This Court was saying that


the First Amendment does not require a national standard


with respect to community standards, but this Court has


not been entirely --


QUESTION:  I think you're answering my question


by saying yes.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, what I think -- no, I


don't necessarily think that the Court -- that the


Congress was intending to impose a national standard,


because this Court had said that it wasn't required under


the First Amendment, and that the community standards did


not have to be judged by any particular geographical area.


QUESTION:  I'm not trying to find out what the


Constitution requires or what our cases might have


required.  I'm just asking you what you think the word


community means, as used in this section of the statute.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I think what Congress was


attempting to do was come as close as possible to adopting


what this Court had said in the context of obscenity.

 Now, I should hasten to say that to the extent


that the Third Circuit felt that the community standards


makes it unconstitutional in the context of the Internet,


that -- those community standards are -- this statute


prohibits obscene material on the Internet, too, and


community standards don't work for material which is


harmful to minors.  They don't work probably for


obscenity, either.


QUESTION:  I don't know where we are here --


QUESTION:  Do you think it's possible for a


North Carolina jury to sit in judgment of a particular


pornographic transmission and decide whether this would


offend the standards of Las Vegas and New York City?  I


mean, doesn't any jury necessarily apply the standards of


its own community?  Aren't we really talking about an


imaginary distinction here?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, yes, Justice --


QUESTION:  Let's assume that you instruct the


jury, jury, you must apply a national standard.  What does


someone who's been raised his whole life in North Carolina


know about Las Vegas?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I would submit that the


judge would instruct the jury, and the judge examining the


decision of the jury afterwards in appellate courts would


do exactly what this Court has said.

 As long as the juror is attempting to apply his


judgment or her judgment with respect to adult


perceptions, based upon all the input that the juror may


have with respect to what is generally harmful to


minors -- the dilemma that this has caused, causes here,


both for Congress and here in this Court, is that we want


on the one hand to make sure that idiosyncratic judgments


are not being imposed on the transmitter of information. 


On the other hand, we don't want such wide variations that


there would be difference in community --


QUESTION:  I suppose a defendant could call an


expert witness in the case in North Carolina and say that


in New York this is fine.  I don't know how much attention


a North Carolina jury would pay to that.


GENERAL OLSON:  I think the defendants can put


on expert testimony with respect to what general standards


are, to use the phrase in Hamling, country-wide.  Now, I


should say --


QUESTION:  But then the trial judge must


instruct the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this


is a national standard, and that's consistent with what


Justice Breyer suggested to you, that we might consider in


putting in the opinion, so it's a national standard.


GENERAL OLSON:  I'm not objecting to that.  If


that is the readily accessible --

 QUESTION:  I think we're asking what the


Court -- which the Congress wanted.  Now, I can sympathize


with the Congress when they're not exactly clear on what


this Court's decisions mean, but we need to know how it


ought to apply to this case in the context of the


Internet.  The Internet would be very different than a


local bookstore.


GENERAL OLSON:  I think that is a reasonable


solution to the problem, and is consistent with what


Congress was saying.


Congress was also aware that this Court has said


over and over again that the same material may be judged


differently by different juries from place to place, and


that that is not a constitutional impediment.  This Court


has also said --


QUESTION:  General Olson, in this context, if


you could -- I didn't get a clear answer to my question. 


Maybe I'll put it this way.  Is there greater judicial


control, either by the trial judge or the appellate judge,


with respect to the serious value standard than there is


with respect to the national standard for community --


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes.  That's what this Court has


said again and again, and we of course accept that, and


that is -- Congress accepted that as well.


QUESTION:  And is your point, then, we first

take out that category.  If it's serious value, it's out.


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And it's only when it doesn't have


serious value, then you get into the question of


national --


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, that's right, but remember


that -- it seems important to emphasize that these


definitions are highly specific with respect to the


material which is prohibited.  It's not just saying to


jurors -- the obscenity statute doesn't have any of these


limitations in it.


18 U.S.C. 466 just talks in very, very general


terms, so what Congress was trying to do here is be much


more specific than the obscenity statute, which this Court


has accepted for 30 or 40 years by importing these kinds


of definitions into it.  What Congress felt it was doing


responsively was not only defining what was prohibited


very specifically, but then incorporating those specific


standards, just as you suggest, Justice Ginsburg.


The other thing that this Court has said is that


those who are choosing a medium to make available to


children material which is harmful to children, over which


the person who is disseminating that information, those


who wantonly decide to pollute the stream from which we


all drink have a responsibility to take the minimal steps

necessary to reduce the harm that's being caused by


putting that material into the stream.


What we have as a result of this are substantive


standards that Congress developed based upon the teachings


of this Court with respect to obscenity, applying those


standards to minors, as this Court suggested is


appropriate and a part of a compelling national interest


in the Ginsberg case, the Ferber case, and Sable case, and


other cases where the Court has suggested that something


has to be done, and is entirely appropriate to be done


with respect to minors.


And then the third thing that Congress did was


adopt a solution to the problem which is consistent with


what 48 or so States have in these blinder laws, magazine


racks displays, the books, materials that this Court


considered in the American Booksellers case with respect


to what would be permissible to prevent children from


seeing damaging materials in bookstores.


Now, that is -- so what we have as a result of


COPA, Congress listening to this Court, lowering the age


to 16 and under, making it apply to commercial speech and


noncommercial speech, returning parental control, adopting


a device that this Court has considered in the Sable case


and considered in this case.  The language of this Court's


decision in Reno v. ACLU said that the age verification

system is technologically and economically feasible, is


already in use, and would provide a defense to those


commercial purveyors of pornography, so Congress listened


to that, adopted that system, put into place for the


Internet the same standard that already exists in the 48-


State blinder laws with respect to access of minors to


these materials, so --


QUESTION:  Did Congress take account in any of


this -- I mean, one objection that's raised is, it's all


futile, because you're just giving competitors from


abroad -- they will come in and fill the gap if U.S.


providers are not available.  You're not going to be


saving children.  You'll just be getting it from outside


the U.S.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, the Congress did


explicitly consider that.  COPA applied to material in


interstate or foreign commerce.  The Government will


prosecute where it can material that comes in from abroad


where it's capable of doing it, but Congress also


recognized that it would not -- was not going to allow the


perfect to be the enemy of the good.  It was going to deal


with those problems, or those portions of the problem that


it could address.


Now, we understand and we have acknowledged that


it may well be that there are circumstances under which

these limitations can be avoided.  There may be certain


foreign purveyors that Government are not able to track


down or obtain jurisdiction over, but what Congress was


trying to do is deal with as much of the problem as it


could in as constitutional a manner as possible.


QUESTION:  And maybe Congress wouldn't mind even


if the child pornography industry flourished, at least


drive it overseas.  That wouldn't exactly be a bad result,


would it --


GENERAL OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION: 

-- in Congress' mind?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I think -- and the Court


considered a case earlier this year of the damage that


that industry does, earlier this term.  Yes, there's two


parts to that, Justice Scalia, the damage of the industry,


the domestic industry itself is incalculable, but the


damage to the recipient, to the children, are also


incalculable, so that might address part of the problem,


but Congress in this --


QUESTION:  But here, at least from the exhibits


that you gave us, it doesn't seem that this material --


there are no virtual children, no real children.  This is


adult stuff, at least.


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes. We're not talking about


that aspect of the issue that you're considering in that

other case, but what I was simply trying to address is


Justice Scalia's question, that this is a major problem. 


We understand from the legislative history that explicit,


adult material, not just on the Internet, is an $8 billion


industry.  According to what Congress decided in this


case, there are 28,000 sexually explicit commercial


pornography sites on the Internet.


This is readily accessible to children.  It is


almost -- anyone with any experience with the Internet


will tell you that children can find it readily, and find


it as long as they can type and read they will find it,


and will find it by accident, and once they find it by


accident -- the House committee points out that if you


type in the words, White House, www.whitehouse.com, you


will find offensive, explicit pornography, and it's very


hard to get rid of.


QUESTION:  And much of it you say -- if I


understand you correctly, you -- this law doesn't touch --


I mean, I was impressed at that set of exhibits.  You


singled out three that you said would not be excluded as a


matter of law.


GENERAL OLSON:  Possibly.


QUESTION:  Oh.  So you're saying maybe the


others --


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, one of the ones that we

were concerned about is a series of very explicit


pictures, and I think the Court knows which ones I'm


talking about.  We -- I went and did some additional


research on that.  That is -- that are photographs of an


art exhibit, and one art gallery that was several years


ago that is a small portion of a large compilation. 


Justice Ginsburg, I think that -- I don't know how that


would come out when all of the evidence came in with


respect to that.


Those photographs were pulled out of context and


put in the exhibits.  That's why this material has to be


looked at as a whole, under these specific standards.


I'd like to reserve the remaining part of my


time for rebuttal, except to say that this is a facial


challenge, and we are dealing with the possibility of


striking down or not allowing the enforcement of a statute


which we -- this Court and Congress and the executive


branch is a necessary, narrowly tailored, carefully


crafted solution to a desperate problem.

 COPA, just like the Communications Decency Act,


makes it a crime to communicate protected speech to adults


on the World Wide Web.  The Government, as Justice


Ginsburg just noted, has now conceded that COPA applies to


much more than commercial pornographers.  They say in


their reply brief that under COPA they can prosecute a


popular online magazine, Salon Magazine, one of our


clients, and the leading fine art vendor on the web for


providing a few items that are deemed harmful to minors on


their web site.


The affirmative defenses in COPA --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  If they're providing


those items, and if those items are pornographic, then


they are commercially in the pornography business.  What


difference does it make that they do other business as


well?


MS. BEESON:  Justice --


QUESTION:  I don't see why Salon or any other


commercial operator should be immune by saying, well, you


know, all of my business isn't pornography, just a little


bit.


MS. BEESON:  Justice Scalia, whether or not we


talk about them as commercial pornographers, the fact is,


the speech they communicate, which even the Government I


don't think would label them commercial pornographers in

the sense that we imagine, first of all, two of the three


exhibits are not pictures at all.  They're written text. 


They're stories, and the point is that all of this speech,


by definition, all of the speech targeted by this law is


by definition protected for adults.


This statute would make it a crime for speakers


to make that information available, and the defenses


simply do not solve the problems.  They're the same two


defenses that were in the first statute.  There's no


change at all, credit cards or adult access codes.


QUESTION:  Can you think of an example of


something that would have serious literary, artistic,


political, or scientific value for an adult, but it would


not have it for a 17-year-old?


MS. BEESON:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think that --


QUESTION:  You can?


MS. BEESON:  I think that all --


QUESTION:  I've had trouble.


QUESTION:  16-year-old.


MS. BEESON:  I think that all of our client's


exhibits are precisely that sort of material, and that, of


course --


QUESTION:  You think -- I looked at some of the


exhibits, and I think 17-year-olds are pretty


sophisticated, and I don't understand why they wouldn't

have, Salon Magazine, the same kind of value for a 17-

MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, the --


QUESTION:  It's 16, actually, isn't it?  We're


talking about 16 years old.


MS. BEESON:  Yes, I think it is 16, in fact.


QUESTION:  All right, 16 -- 16.


MS. BEESON:  There are --


QUESTION:  There are even quite mature 16-year-


olds who know about --


(Laughter.)


MS. BEESON:  There are many communities in this


country --


QUESTION:  That's, I think, the question in the


case, correct.  You're saying in some communities --


sorry, I didn't --


MS. BEESON:  I'm saying -- perhaps in even most


communities that believe that providing any information


about experiencing sexual pleasure, about sex toys, to


teenagers, is sinful and is definitely harmful, and --


QUESTION:  That's probably so, but I mean, what


Justice Breyer is addressing and what I was concerned with


with Mr. Olson was his argument that the third prong, the


value prong, in effect, sort of sands off the rough edges,


and it gets the -- in practical terms it gets the

community peculiarity out of it, and is that -- obviously


you don't agree with it.  Why is he wrong in that?


MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, first of all, I think


because all of the millions of speakers, including our


clients on the web, they are the ones that have to


understand this law, and as Mitch Pepper, who runs a


Sexual Health Network which provides specific information


about how to experience sexual pleasure to disabled


persons, testified, I think very strongly, based on my


interpretation of the words in this statute, even with the


serious value prong, that value prong is value for minors,


and he has to believe, as he testified, that discussion of


masturbation, oral sex, anal sex, descriptive positioning,


all of that can be construed as pandering to the prurient


interest of minors.


Those are the -- these are the speakers who are


going to be subjected to criminal prosecution under this


law, and let me clear, our clients don't ever want to come


before a jury.  That's the problem, of course.  They --


QUESTION:  Oh, but the particular issue is


really not the third prong.  That's not before us, I take


it.  The issue before us is the question of community


standards, and so does it satisfy you if the Court were to


say -- or, say I wrote an opinion.  I'm just thinking of


myself -- write an opinion that says, the word community

standards does not mean individual localities.  It does


mean the Nation.


MS. BEESON:  Absolutely not, Your Honor, for two


reasons which I want to explain.  First of all, under


either standard this statute is unconstitutional, and that


is clear, and that is because of the very strong deterrent


effect it has on adult speech.  Through all of these


speakers who are targeted under this law, they really have


only two choices, and just to give one example --


QUESTION:  That was true in Hamling, too.  There


was considerable deterrence, just because you didn't


know -- if you sent stuff Nation-wide, you didn't know


where you might be prosecuted.


MS. BEESON:  Mr. Chief Justice, there's a very


real distinction here, and that is that Hamling was about


the obscenity standard and this is about the harmful-to-


minors standard, and my point is that --


QUESTION:  Just a minute.  Will you explain why


you think that's a distinction?


MS. BEESON:  Because by definition all of the


material targeted by the statute is protected speech for


adults.  Adults have the right to access it, even though


children don't.  In the obscenity context, obviously, even


adults don't have the right to access the material.


QUESTION:  No, that's true, but you run --

people in Hamling ran the same risk.  They may have


thought their stuff would not be found to be subject to


the community standard, but a jury might find otherwise,


so that's just what you're complaining about.


MS. BEESON:  Well, the range of speech, however,


of course, protected speech that is limited by the -- by


any harmful-to-minors display statute.  It's just by


definition greater, again because the entire category of


speech is protected for adults.  It's not like you're just


arguing about the margin of what is obscene for everyone.


QUESTION:  Well, in obscenity cases, whether it


was obscenity or not depended upon the community


standards, so you were really taking your chance when you


published something nationally you were subject to the


least -- highest common denominator of obscenity.  Why


should it be any different for pornography than it is with


obscenity?  It seems to me that Hamling and the other


cases establish that it is no violation of the First


Amendment to subject a publisher to differing standards


throughout the country.  If we did it for obscenity, I


don't know why we cannot do it for pornography.


MS. BEESON:  Again, most importantly, Your


Honor, under any standard -- under any standard, COPA is


unconstitutional --


QUESTION:  Okay --

 MS. BEESON:  -- because it would deter such a

QUESTION:  But going back to Justice Breyer's


question, if we construed the statute the way he has


suggested, isn't it clear that we would have to vacate the


judgment in this case and send it back?  We're not here to


make a final judgment on the statute.  We're reviewing the


injunction, and if we construed it his way, we would have


to vacate, wouldn't we?


MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, I don't believe so,


because we have a very strong record here, which again the


Third Circuit explicitly affirmed the findings of fact by


the district court that show that adults are going to be


deterred by this law, and that is because what the law


requires is that you put screens in front of all of the


material that again is protected to adults, and by


definition, if you're Different Light Bookstore, which is


one of our clients --


QUESTION:  But that's not a community standards


problem.


MS. BEESON:  It's a -- Your Honor, it's a


burden-on-speech problem.


QUESTION:  Yes, but I --


QUESTION:  It may be a burden on speech, but


look at the question we took.

 QUESTION:  I'm trying to get you to ask --


answer one specific question, and I'll try once more, all


right.


The question in front of us, presented is


whether the court of appeals properly barred enforcement


on First Amendment grounds because the statute relies on


community standards to identify material that is harmful


to minors.  That's the question before us.  You have 17


reasons why this statute is unconstitutional.  I'd like


you, for the purpose of this question, to forget about


those 17 reasons.  I want to know if, in respect to this


one reason, that the community standards -- that's what's


in the question -- if we were to say the word community


means national, then would you concede -- would you say


you've won, or you've lost, or --


MS. BEESON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That -- how does that affect the


case, to answer that question nationally?


MS. BEESON:  Yes, and our answer is that even


under a national standard this law clearly violates the


First Amendment.


QUESTION:  I know that, but is the right thing


to do, then, for us to say, court of appeals, you were


wrong about the meaning of the word, community standards. 


It is a national standard.  There may be other things

wrong with this statute, in which case, go and consider


them, but this isn't one of them.


MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, we -- again, if that


were the course that you decided to take, we do not think


that the appropriate thing would be to vacate the


injunction, but whether to leave the injunction in place,


and then --


QUESTION:  Not vacating the injunction, vacate


the order of the court of appeals and say, you consider


these other points.


MS. BEESON:  Again, Your Honor, I don't think


that that would be a helpful or useful exercise in this


case, because of both the strong facts we're working on


and also just to talk about the problem of the national


standard which, of course, was referred to when Mr. Olson


was speaking.


You know, as the Court said in Miller, a


national standard would be an exercise in futility.  Will


jurors have to decide base on their own sense of community


standards whether or not something is patently offensive


and prurient?


QUESTION:  But why is it okay for obscenity but


not okay here for -- not for -- I'm putting it too


favorably.  It isn't okay for obscenity.  It is okay for


taking your chance on whether what you publish is obscene.

 MS. BEESON:  And the --


QUESTION:  But it's not okay for taking your


chance on whether what you publish is pornographic and


harmful to minors.  Why should there be any difference


between the two?


MS. BEESON:  Well, for one reason of course, one


of the crucial distinctions here is the nature of the


Internet, and that is one of the arguments that the Third


Circuit discussed.  It is very distinct from handling in


Sable in the sense that this is not a situation where


people who put their speech up on the web have any way of


limiting their speech to only certain communities.


QUESTION:  But you're only talking about


commercial speech, something that people are going to have


to pay to see.


MS. BEESON:  Justice O'Connor, the Congress very


explicitly wrote the definition of commercial speech in


this statute so broadly that it applies to much more than


people who primarily communicate what is termed commercial


pornography.


That was the point before.  They explicitly said


that anyone who includes any material that is harmful to


minors is covered by the law, and again, according to the


concession in the Government's reply brief, if you're


artnet.com, one of the leading fine art vendors, and you

have a series of Andre Serano photographs on your site,


you can be prosecuted, and also, of course, this is not


material that is for sale.


There is no requirement that you're actually


selling the material.  It's only that you intend to make a


profit.  As the district court found, the vast majority of


content on the web is available for free to users.


QUESTION:  Well, Hamling didn't rely at all, the


opinion in Hamling, on the fact that the people could


choose where to circulate.  I mean, they in effect said,


you do it at your own risk.


MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, I think that's a very


different conclusion to reach when you're talking about an


environment in which you can control where you send the


material.  If you're a regular magazine distributor, you


know where you're sending your magazines.  On the web --


QUESTION:  Do you mean --


MS. BEESON:  -- if you want to communicate


locally, you can't.


QUESTION:  You mean, we would have to make this


exception even for obscenity, even for out-and-out stuff


that's so far beyond that it's not even just pornography. 


You would say we could not allow community standards to be


applied --

 QUESTION:  -- on the web, for obscenity.


MS. BEESON:  We think that that is a very


different question, and that is not a necessary conclusion


for the reason that I said before and that is because, by


definition, a national standard for what is displayed as


harmful to minors on the web would impact far more


protected speech than a national standard for obscenity,


which is by definition unprotected for adults as well as


minors, and to put it another way, no adult has the right


to materials that are obscene in even the most tolerant


community.


QUESTION:  It seems --


MS. BEESON:  All adults have the right to


materials.


QUESTION:  -- the issue is how


unconstitutionally unfair it is to the publisher,


regardless of how many publishers are covered.  You're


saying it's okay to do this for obscenity but somehow not


for pornography.  It seems to me if subjecting you to a


risk Nation-wide is an unconstitutional thing, you're


going to go to jail just the same, whether you're going to


jail for pornography or obscenity.


MS. BEESON:  We are saying --


QUESTION:  If we cannot use community standards


for this, I don't see why we can use it for obscenity.

 MS. BEESON:  We, of course, don't think you need


to even reach that question, but to the extent that you


do, again, I think that it is quite a different question


because of the amount of protected speech that is


impacted.  It's just not -- it is not so clear that


under -- with obscenity a national standard would be


nearly as problematic as it would when you're talking


about making available materials which are clearly, by


definition, protected for adults to receive.


What COPA does is to prevent speakers from doing


that, and requires them to make this unwelcome choice,


which is, you either set up costly screens that the record


shows are going to drive away your users, or you self-


sensor, and if you're a Different Light Bookstore, or you


are the Sexual Health Network, or you're the artnet, a


fine art vendor, it's only rational, and of course they


testified to this, you are going to self-censure, because


that was the only option that will ensure that you're not


prosecuted.


QUESTION:  But what about the Government's


position that of all the exhibits that are at least in the


record presented to us, there's only three that they say,


even as a matter of law, might be subject to prosecution,


so they're giving you a clean bill of health on all these


others, and they say it's really a very narrow category,

not the broad category that you're describing.


MS. BEESON:  Justice Ginsburg, in fact that


concession in the reply brief makes us more nervous than


ever, and that is because the Government has changed their


mind.  They very clearly argued at the district court that


our clients, none of our clients even had standing to


raise the constitutionality of this action because they


were so clearly protected.


Now, suddenly, here we are before the Supreme


Court, and they say, oh, no, we changed our minds, some of


them can be prosecuted.  That very much implies that they


could change their mind again in the future --


QUESTION:  Ms. Beeson --


MS. BEESON:  -- and in fact the speech is


indistinguishable from many other exhibits that are in the


joint appendix before you.


QUESTION:  Ms. Beeson, let's talk about artnet. 


Do you really think that when artnet puts out the Andre


Serano photographs, do you think it expects to avoid being


held under this statute because of 6(a), that it would


hope that the average person applying contemporary


community standards would find this material as a whole


not designed to appeal to or pander to the prurient


interest, or do you rather think that artnet's protection


would surely be sought under (c), namely, that the

material taken as a whole possesses serious literary,


artistic, political, or scientific value?  Isn't that


their real protection?


MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, they really do not


believe it is their protection, and that again is because


it says, serious value for minors, and that, of course, is


one of the primary distinctions between this category and


obscenity.  There are many people who would think that the


fine art --


QUESTION:  The national standard -- I guess I


have to go back to that, but I didn't get an answer. 


Right now, your clients could worry that they would be


prosecuted under the Miller standard, and the only


difference is minors, and so I find it very hard to think


of an artistic work that one would say has serious value


to a 21-year-old but not to a 16-year-old.  That, to me,


seems impossible.


Now, you give me an example of such a thing.


MS. BEESON:  Well, Your Honor, the Government


itself is saying that art --


QUESTION:  That's their opinion.  I'm asking for


your opinion.


MS. BEESON:  I'm sorry, Your Honor, but they're


the ones that are going to prosecute my clients.


QUESTION:  That may be, but the very fact that

your clients could be prosecuted does not mean they win


this case, because after all, they might be prosecuted


under Miller, too, and everyone agrees that that's the


law, so I'm asking you for your opinion, if you can find


an example of a work of art that would have serious value


for a 21-year-old but not for a minor, and I'm telling you


I can't think of one, and the reason that I ask you is,


I'd like you to try to think of one.


MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, with respect, we


believe that all of the exhibits that we have put in, the


artistic ones and the literary works, the column, the nude


artworks by several clients, all of these could be


targeted under the statute, and again, what the effect,


the First Amendment effect of the statute is whether or


not our clients legitimately feel like they have to self-


censure under this law as compared to the obscenity law.


They don't believe that their works are obscene. 


They know that some communities will find them harmful to


minors, and for that reason what they are going to do is,


they're going to self-censure, and what it's going to


effectively do is have COPA driving a certain category of


speech protected for adults from the marketplace of ideas


that is the web.


QUESTION:  Are you saying that you have to give


some effect to Congress' words?  It didn't say serious

value, period.  It said, to minors, and that's different


from serious value that we're accustomed to dealing with


in the obscenity area, so for the Court to say, well,


Congress just used those words, they didn't mean anything. 


That's I suppose what you're saying is of concern.


MS. BEESON:  Yes, Your Honor, and the history of


the harmful-to-minors definition, that is one of the


primary points.  The point is that even though people


might think that artistic words that are explicit, and you


know, references to homosexuality that are explicit, have


value for adults, many, if not most communities find that


that same material does not have value for minors.


And again, to address your question, too,


Justice Breyer, about the 16-year-old or the 17-year-old,


there is nothing in this statute that defines minor as the


16-year-old.  The Government has been, again, pushing an


interpretation of that statute.


QUESTION:  But I thought you might -- I mean, I


thought that the word, for example, for minors comes out


of cases that permit the Government to require certain


magazines to be placed in certain places in the


bookstores, or in the retail shops, with brown covers, so


perhaps there's some experience, since we have worked with


the words, for minors, of something that has to be done


under that law, but doesn't fall within Miller.

 I mean, I just wanted to get your views on it.


MS. BEESON:  Yes, absolutely. I think there


haven't been that many cases on the books because, again,


those statutes are much easier to comply with, and that's


what the courts have found, but even in those cases the


court has looked very carefully at whether or not there


was a significant deterrence effect on adults, and in the


blinder rack cases, none of which dealt with the unique


nature of the online medium, in which, as our records


showed, up to 75 percent of users would be deterred from


accessing speech that had a screen in front of it.  Now,


that is the finding of the district court.


The blinder rack cases didn't deal with that


kind of situation.  None of them would require adults to


disclose their identity, or to register before obtaining


the access to protected speech, and there is certainly no


record of the strong deterrence, and importantly, in those


cases there was no record of an equally effective


alternative, and that is something that I really think we


need to get to, because here the district court


specifically found that there was an alternative that was


equally effective, and that is the use of blocking


software, user-based blocking programs, and in fact --


QUESTION:  But you're saying that it -- you're


saying, which was an issue last time around, it's up to

the parent, Government can do nothing.  The blocking, I


take it, is something that the parent would buy and


install.  The question is whether Government can do


anything, and I think your answer is no.


MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, we believe that


Congress did two things already that we're not challenging


here.  First of all, it established a study commission to


look into other options for protecting children, and after


the statute was enacted, that same study commission,


Congress -- and so I don't think, with respect to Mr.


Olson, that he's correct that all three branches of


Government are on the same wavelength here.  I think that


we have some difference, and that is, Congress' own


commission has now concluded also, which is equal to the


district court's findings, that user-based blocking


software is actually more effective than credit card and


adult access code screening.


Just to remind the Court also that the Court


specifically found that the Government didn't prove the


last time around, in Reno v. ACLU, that those screening


techniques, credit card and adult access codes, will


actually prevent minors from accessing the content.  The


same is true here.  There's no evidence that those are


actually effective, whereas the district court


specifically found user-based alternatives are effective,

and then Congress' own commission concluded the same


thing.


QUESTION:  Well, of course, all this goes to


these other aspects of the statute.  As I understand where


we are in the argument, the court of appeals decided for


reasons that I think we cannot criticize on this record


that it's going to sustain this injunction based on the


community standards problem, and we're asking you, if the


community standard is national, doesn't that solve that


problem, and I'm coming away from this argument with the


impression that you're saying, well, I'm not going to


bother to help you on that, because there are so many


other things in the statute I want to talk about.


MS. BEESON:  Yes, I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  But that doesn't help me answer this


question.


MS. BEESON:  Right, and I don't mean to leave


that impression.  I -- what I'm saying clearly is that we


believe that even if you were to read a national standard,


it would be unconstitutional, because the real effect


would be precisely the same as the local community


standards interpretation is, and that is, the least


tolerant community would get to set the standards for


everyone on the web, since web speakers have no way to


determine where their audience is.

 QUESTION:  But is it not true that --


QUESTION:  Then you're saying that a national


standard can't be enforced with any jury.


MS. BEESON:  I don't think that it can, because


again jurors are going to have to enforce that.  You're


going to have to have still a jury decide what is patently


offensive and prurient, and I think they're going to do


that naturally based on where they're physically located,


in their own community.


QUESTION:  Then you're -- and I don't mean this


dismissively, but I think we have to accept this.  You're


saying there in fact is no way to regulate this.


MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, I'm saying that there


isn't any way to make it a crime to display material


harmful to minors on the web.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. BEESON:  That is our position, and again,


that we believe is very consistent with many other


statutes that have recently been struck down by the Court. 


Just last term in the Playboy case, in, you know,


obviously the Reno v. ACLU case, the Denver Area case, I


mean, in the last 20 years I count at least six statutes,


some of which weren't even criminal statutes like this


one, which I think has an even stronger potential for


chilling speech, that were struck down because of the

burden on adult speech.


QUESTION:  No, but I'm not -- again, I'm not


asking you the global question.


MS. BEESON:  I understand.


QUESTION:  I'm just asking you the question that


goes to the specific issue that we took for review, and


that is the legitimacy of basing an injunction, or


sustaining the district court's injunction on the


community standards portion of the statute, and my


question to you is simply, I take it you're saying that


there is no way to write a standard into the statute, call


it community, call it national, call it some third thing


that you dream up, that will ever suffice


constitutionally.


Forgetting the rest of the statute, forgetting


the rest of the problem, just on the touchstone of the


standard, there's no way to do it, and I think your answer


is no, there is no way to do it.


MS. BEESON:  There is no way to do it, and


again, I do want to be clear that I think that we can


divorce the rest of the language of the statute, even


aside from the deterrence issues, and what I mean by that


is, because the statute was written so broadly as to cover


anybody who had even just one image, for example, because


the statute was written to include not just images but

text, I think, you know, I think those problems still


remain even just looking at the textual language, even if


you're focusing just on the community standard versus the


national standard, and that's another reason why we don't


think that fixing that problem is enough to save the


statute.


QUESTION:  May I ask another sort of general


question?  Do you think there's any way in which Congress


can deal with the problem of what they call teasers, which


everyone would agree would violate the standard here, and


would also not have serious artistic value?


MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, one way they could do


that, of course, is through more vigorous prosecution of


obscenity and child pornography, which again --


QUESTION:  No, no, I'm assuming nonobscene --


MS. BEESON:  Nonobscene.


QUESTION:  -- but clearly pornographic teasers.


MS. BEESON:  Well, I mean, I of course don't


want to be the one to rewrite the statute, but I do think,


as I suggested before, that if they --


QUESTION:  But I'm asking if it's your position


that that's beyond the power of Congress to control.


MS. BEESON:  I think that a statute that did


just apply, for example, to web sites who were actually


selling things already -- this one isn't limited to

that -- and secondly, web sites who the predominant


portion of their site was actually harmful to minors. 


That would certainly be closer to just addressing teasers


than this statute is.


QUESTION:  You still haven't answered my


question.  My question is whether it's beyond the power of


Congress to control the teaser problem.


MS. BEESON:  Justice Stevens, my answer is that


I think if they wrote a statute -- are you asking me


whether I think that statute would be unconstitutional


also, because of course, I have to argue yes, it would be,


but it would certainly be -- you don't have to believe me


on that.

(Laughter.)


MS. BEESON:  Obviously, and you know, just to be


QUESTION:  Just on this one, right?


MS. BEESON:  -- that would be -- that's what I


mean.  That's a very different statute than this one.  It


would be one narrowly tailored to the --


QUESTION:  No, but one of the things we have to


be concerned with is, there is a genuine problem that


Congress is trying to address, and if your position is you


just forget about it, that you've got to live with the


problem, that's quite a different position than if you

think, well, there's a less restrictive alternative that


would accomplish what the Congress is trying to do, and


you're suggesting to me there isn't a less restrictive


alternative.


MS. BEESON:  Well, the less restrictive


alternative for actually protecting children is the user-


based mechanisms, and that again, the -- Congress itself


found to be actually more effective at protecting


children.


Just to refer to the exhibits that were put in


by the Government, every single one of those sites that


address the teaser problem, all of those were blocked by


all of the major --


QUESTION:  What would Congress do, pass a law


requiring parents at their own expense to impose user-


based screening?


MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, we certainly believe


that the Federal Government could --


QUESTION:  I mean, that's not a solution.  That


is not a solution within the power of Congress.


MS. BEESON:  No, and we don't think it needs to


be, because we think, of course, the ultimate decision


ought to be resting on parents, where it always has, to


make a decision as to whether they --

Stevens, in your capacity as a lawyer, that whatever


statute Congress came up with, you would believe in that


capacity was unconstitutional.  You're not prepared to say


that there's any statute that is constitutional.  I'm


asking about what you think, not what I think.


MS. BEESON:  We are not prepared to say that any


statute which significantly burdens adult speech is


constitutional, and I think that is very consistent with


the opinions of this Court, as in the Playboy case and the


Denver Area case.


In sum, I just want to say that the web provides


access, as we all know, to more speech by more speakers


than any other communications medium in history.  COPA


threatens to transform this dynamic medium into one that


is fit only for children.  We believe the preliminary


injunction should be affirmed.


QUESTION:  Let me ask you a modification to my


question.  Do you think it would be within the power of


Congress to require everyone who is in this area of


speech, which is protected as to adults but maybe not as


to minors, to put a XX on their material that goes onto


the web site so that the software could pick up that XX


more effectively?


MS. BEESON:  Your Honor, the problem with that


would be, of course, without some kind of mechanism that

then allowed parents to --


QUESTION:  No, that's right, but then that would


simplify the problem of buying -- of setting up software


that could screen out this stuff.


MS. BEESON:  I think that it might have some


compelled speech concerns, especially, again, where you're


talking about a medium where you have these individuals --


just because it's commercial businesses doesn't mean


there's a big -- you know, a lot of employees to make


these determinations.  We have clients who are single


individuals who are working out of their home.  I think


they're just not going to be able to do that.  What


they're much more likely to do instead is to self-censor,


so I'm not sure that that would be a solution.


We believe that a much better solution -- and


Congress agreed with us.  The Justice Department itself


wrote a letter to Congress before this law was passed


saying that they think that upholding this statute would


divert valuable resources away from the more important


issues of prosecuting the child pornographers.


QUESTION:  Ms. Beeson, last time we had a


colloquy with the Government on this subject, and they


were candid to say, we're not trying simply to maximize


parents' choices.  We think Government, qua Government has


a concern for the children, so even if you have parents

who don't care at all what their kids see, the Government


has an interest in seeing that children -- and your point


about the effectiveness of a blocking device doesn't go to


that at all.  The Government's saying, we have an


independent interest, and we can do something.


MS. BEESON:  Yes, I do believe that that issue


came up in the Playboy case last term, and the Court, you


know, did rule that again voluntary -- we can't assume,


especially without a record to the contrary, that parents


are going to fail to act.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Beeson.


MS. BEESON:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes


remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


GENERAL OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


Justice Ginsburg, this Court has specifically


said and held in the Ginsberg case that the Government


does have a responsibility, and this Court has repeatedly


said there's a compelling national interest in addressing


that responsibility.  It is not just helping the parents. 


It's an independent, as this Court put it in the Ginsberg


case, independent responsibility to do something to


prevent damage, which everybody agrees is damage to

children.


What we're hearing from the plaintiffs in this


case is the same sky is falling defense that everything


possible is going to be precluded and taken away from


adults, and that some of the same parties were making in


the American Booksellers case, and this Court sent that


back to Virginia and asked the Virginia court to examine


whether all of these publications and materials were going


to be covered by the statute, and it turned out that none


of them were, and then the case wended its way back to the


Fourth Circuit, and it resolved itself in these statutes


that were used, that Congress uses as an analogy, the


blinder statute.


Now, what our opponents say now is that this


blinder statute applied to the Internet is somehow


intrusive, expensive, intolerable, burdensome.  But when


you go into a bookstore to look behind the rack, you have


to do that in person.  Sometimes, if it's a 7-11 or one of


these convenience stores, it may be on a camera.


In the Internet, you have to identify yourself


with a credit card, which many people do anyway.  These


screens already exist, as Justice Stevens' questions focus


on.  It is the teasers that are in front of the screen


that Congress was attempting to get at, so in many cases


these screens already exist.  There's a privacy provision

built into the statute that prevents the adult


identification services from sharing the information as to


the identity of the person using it.


I would submit, or the Government would submit


it's quite obvious that this is less intrusive.  As this


Court said in Reno v. ACLU, the system already exists, and


it's already in use, so what -- and the definitions -- oh,


and the other point that several of the questions have


focused on is if community standards are not permissible


on the Internet, which is what I understand our opponent's


position to be, those go out the window with respect to


obscenity, because those are the same standards that this


Court developed.


Now, what will happen then, as a result of


affirming the Third Circuit's decision, is that all of the


obscene material which is now behind the screen will be in


front of the screen, and all these children will now not


just be seeing the teasers, but the effect of the Third


Circuit decision is that they will be seeing everything


that anybody, any of the commercial pornographers want to


put on the Internet.


Now, the definition of commercial, that is the


same definition. Congress understands what those words


mean.  It made it clear that it was talking about people


that are in the business of making a profit as a regular

trade or business in dealing with the provision of


material which is sexually explicit, and damaging to


minors.


It's a definition that already exists, that this


Court is quite familiar with.  It's in 18 U.S.C. 1466, the


obscenity statute.  The same definition of commercial is


in that statute that Congress adopted for this statute.


Finally, with respect to the national standards


point, I don't think Congress intended to adopt a national


standard.  I think what they were trying to do is develop


a standard based upon what this Court said in Hamling, and


specifically in Jenkins, which was decided the same day as


Hamling.  The jury instructions need not specify what


community, and so forth.  I won't repeat the whole


definition there, that the definition of community


standards does not have to be geographically limited.


Congress suggested that there wasn't going to be


much variation.  They didn't -- Congress didn't feel that


there would be much variation anyway, and this Court has


said there can be some variations from place to place and


time to time --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, General


Olson.


GENERAL OLSON:  -- and if you're in that


business you're taking your chances.
