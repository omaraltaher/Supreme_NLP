The Arizona          Independent Redistricting Commission.               Mr. Hearne.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK F. HEARNE, II                      ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS                 MR. HEARNE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,        and may it please the Court:                  The one­person, one­vote principle of the      Equal Protection Clause requires an apportionment      authority to make a good­faith effort to equally         apportion the population as ­­ as practically as        possible, and while deviations are tolerated, they are        only minor deviations made for legitimate purposes of a         rational State policy intended not to be discriminatory        or arbitrary.              Here, the Arizona Redistricting Commission     malapportioned Arizona State legislature by almost       percent, . percent, and the district court below         found it did so for two reasons.                   The first reason was to obtain a partisan         advantage for the Democrat party.                 The second reason was a perceived belief        Alderson Reporting Company Official that malapportioned districts were necessary to obtain       Justice Department preclearance approval.                Neither of these reasons justifies a      deviation from the constitutional principle of one       person, one vote.                           JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hearne ­­     JUSTICE KENNEDY: The second part, do ­­ do         you want us ­­ do you want us to overturn the factual            finding that compliance with the Voting Rights Act,        the ­­ the preclearance procedures, was the reason ­­        real reason for the deviation? Do you want us to           overturn that as a factual finding?                   MR. HEARNE: No, I don't, as a factual           finding. But when you say, Justice Kennedy, the         preclearance obtaining Voting Rights Act compliance, we       have said, as we've noted in the briefing, it was not           necessary to under­populate districts to obtain      compliance with the Voting Rights Act.                  JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a ­­ a            question? It's ­­ it's odd that you're making this          charge that there was an impermissible effort to        increase the Democratic authority, power, in the       legislature, but the end result was that the Arizona         plan gave Republicans more than their proportionate       share of seats in the State legislature. And I think            Alderson Reporting Company Official the numbers are, in total, Republicans won . percent         of the State Senate seats, percent of the State House           seats. And that exceeded the Republican party's        Statewide registration share of . percent.                  So if there was an attempt to stack this in          favor of Democrats, it certainly failed.                  MR. HEARNE: Well, we would say, Your Honor,         that a ­­ an incompetent gerrymander is no less a           gerrymander when it unequally apportions the population       than a competent gerrymander that obtained the partisan         objective.               I think the objective that we are trying to        achieve here is the one­person, one­vote standard. And         that's why, whatever the ultimate political outcome, I        don't think that vindicates the fact that these are         unequally apportioned.              JUSTICE KENNEDY: It ­­ it ­­ it's still not          clear to me what ­­ what you want us to say about the ­­             the Commission's rationale for compliance and Voting       Rights Act compliance that was wrong as a matter of law,            because if you don't overturn the factual finding that         they had a ­­ a good­faith belief that what they were             doing is correct, then ­­ then you have ­­ then you have            a problem, it seems to me.                  Or do you have a problem?       Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. HEARNE: I don't believe I do, because I            think it's not ­­ the good­faith ­­ what the district          court found was that their advisor told them, you can          depopulate districts up to percent, and in fact, you          should do that because you need to create these         under­populated minority districts to obtain     preclearance.             That is wrong. The Voting Rights Act does         not command, does not compel or require, under­populated        districts to obtain preclearance. The Solicitor       Generals noted that as well in their briefing and the          Justice Department guidelines. And that's ­­                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I ­­ how         confident are you of that? I mean, the ­­ the            preclearance process at the Department of Justice is        famously opaque, and usually the States and       municipalities have to go through, or had to go through,          several layers of back and forth, here's a proposal ­­          it's sort of a bargaining process. I don't know how             confident you can be that ­­ that it wasn't necessary.                      MR. HEARNE: We certainly agree that the        preclearance process was very opaque, as you said,        Mr. Chief Justice. I mean, we said it was like reading             chicken entrails, because no one really knows what you         do or don't need to do to ­­ to obtain preclearance.           Alderson Reporting Company Official             But just fundamentally, the Voting Rights      Act, even prior to Shelby County, could not compel a          redistricting authority to under­populate districts. So       the advice they had been given, you must under­populate         these ten districts in order to obtain preclearance was         flawed as a matter of legal advice that doesn't justify           malapportionment.             So they could have achieved as, in fact,        their own expert, Dr. King, said. In the first map ­­           they had two maps. They had a draft map and a final               map. The draft map had a percent, roughly, deviation,             and their own expert said this map satisfies the Voting          Rights Act.              Then they went and depopulated further to       get an . percent deviation.                 JUSTICE SCALIA: So they were mistaken. I         mean, you're ­­ you say they ­­ they could have done it            without ­­ without disproportioning, but they ­­ they        thought that that was okay. They thought that they were           doing this in order to comply with the Justice         Department.             What's the test? Is the test what they         intended, or is it an objective test?                   MR. HEARNE: Well, I think you have to look           at, actually, both. I think you look at the objective            Alderson Reporting Company Official test is: Does the Voting Rights Act require you to           depopulate districts? That's bad ­­                 JUSTICE SCALIA: So let's assume the answer        to that is no.                            MR. HEARNE: Right.    JUSTICE SCALIA: But the people who ­­ who         made this apportionment were mistaken, and they thought        that it allowed, and indeed may require, you to do that.           So? That doesn't show a bad motive on their part, does             it?             MR. HEARNE: No, but I don't think this          Court's ever held that bad legal advice justifies a         constitutional violation, which in this case that's what        they're saying is the ­­                JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, bad legal advice is        different from an impermissible motive.                             MR. HEARNE: Well, we have a ­­        JUSTICE KENNEDY: Justice Scalia is asking       what ­­ what ­­ what the test ­­ what is the test here?                         MR. HEARNE: Well, I would say this case, as           the district court noted, and all three judges split on          what the burden of proof was, is a mixed­motive case           where you have one assumed illegitimate motive, partisan        advantage, and you have another motive which is, oh,         it's okay because we needed to do this because our          Alderson Reporting Company Official advisor said that was necessary for preclearance.                   Then I think it ­­ the task falls to the           Commission to justify, under this Court's decisions in        Mt. Healthy and Arlington Heights standard of a        mixed­motive case to justify, oh, this was necessary in         fact to comply with that.                             And that was not done.     JUSTICE GINSBURG: And ­­ and it was more         than mixed motive. It was a finding of dominance, that            the dominant purpose of this was to attempt to meet          Section .              MR. HEARNE: Two of the judges, Judge        Clifton and Judge Silver, did find that that was a          predominant motive or primary motive.                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's a ­­ that's a          fact­finding which you ­­ you have a burden if you're           seeking to overturn it.                MR. HEARNE: But they also found that there         was another illegitimate motive that they assumed ­­       Judge Silver didn't necessarily agree, but she assumed,        for purposes of decision, that this partisan advantage        was a illegitimate motive.                 So you have a case where this body is          unconstitutionally departing from one­person, one­vote.     They come forward with two explanations, one       Alderson Reporting Company Official illegitimate, one supposedly legitimate: This      preclearance based on erroneous legal advice. And on         the basis of that, the court split on what the burden of            proof was. We would ­­                 JUSTICE KAGAN: Just to pin this down a ­­ a            little bit, Mr. Hearne: You ­­ you are not contesting           the factual finding that the predominant motive was to         comply with the Voting Rights Act; is that right?                     MR. HEARNE: We ­­ we take the ­­ the          factual findings from the district court. We don't         protest those. But what we do believe is that the court            applied the wrong burden­shifting standard in that, in        their analysis of those facts.                 When they have a mixed motive, the proper         response would have been to say, okay, you've shown, we          found one illegitimate motive.                JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you keep on saying        mixed motive, and I guess people keep on coming back to            you and just trying to figure out whether you are, in           fact, or are not, in fact, contesting that ­­ that the           predominant motive was the Voting Rights Act.                   MR. HEARNE: The ­­ when ­­ when we say the           Voting Rights Act ­­ again, I want to make my position            clear ­­             JUSTICE KAGAN: Was the attempt to comply        Alderson Reporting Company Official with the Voting Rights Act?                             MR. HEARNE: Correct.    JUSTICE KAGAN: And this ­­ and the ­­ and          the court found, and it is a factual finding, that           that's the predominant motive?                And I don't mean to harangue you on this. I            just want to understand what your argument is.                    MR. HEARNE: No. We ­­ we ­­ we ­­ to be             very clear, yes, we accept the factual finding of the          two judges, that that was ­­ what they said was the           primary motive. But they erred when they did not shift           the burden in a mixed­motive case, under Arlington         Heights, I think footnote , or Mt. Healthy, kind of           standard.             Secondly, they erred when they gave a       justification and found it legitimate when there really        was not a legal need to do what they did. There was              no ­­ the Voting Rights Act can't compel vote dilution.          And that justification, even if it was had in good          faith, does not excuse a constitutional violation of         one­person, one­vote.              So at minimum, it would need to be remanded         for an opportunity for them to somehow ­­ the         Commission ­­ explain why they can justify these        population deviations. And that's ­­ that is our         Alderson Reporting Company Official position, Justice Kagan.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You ­­ I'm ­­ I'm even         further confused. I ­­ I understand that you gave up             any racial or ­­ or political gerrymandering case. This          is just a voter­dilution case.                  MR. HEARNE: That's absolutely correct,      Justice Sotomayor.              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I understand       there's one case you're relying on that was summarily         affirmed, but is there any other case from this Court          that has ever said that a ­­ a deviation of this amount              is significant?                I think we've always called it anything      below percent de minimis, correct?                   MR. HEARNE: What the Court has said, as I          read the jurisprudence, is that a deviation of over           percent is prima facie constitutional, and the        statements justify it.               If it's a deviation of less than percent,          the obligation is on the party challenging it to come          forward and present some evidence showing that it is         done for an arbitrary or discriminatory purpose.                   That's what we understand that standard to       be out of Brown v. Thomson. And again, that was a            plurality opinion.  Alderson Reporting Company Official But under that standard ­­    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­ I don't actually                                  understand. I don't know of any case where we've           required an explanation under percent.                  MR. HEARNE: Well, I think two ­­ I have two             responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First in Cox v.          Larios, certainly this Court had a summary affirmance,         and the concurring opinion in that case by Justice         Stevens and Breyer does say that there is not this magic           bright line, and then other decisions of this Court have          always disavowed creating some simple bright­line test       where deviations from the constitutional standard below       that are tolerated.               So, for example in Karcher, that decision       said we specifically don't want to set some line,         because the minute we do that, legislators or        redistricting authorities will immediately use that as       the new standard.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in fact, they       have. They've pretty much used percent. We've not           discouraged them from doing that.                 MR. HEARNE: It is certainly ­­ it certainly         appeared in some of the district court decisions ­­                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­                 MR. HEARNE: ­­ that ­­ that's ­­ that they          Alderson Reporting Company Official have looked at that. And again, we see that as the            burden shift ­­              JUSTICE BREYER: What it says, actually, in        Brown v. Thomson, it says our decisions have        established, as a general matter, that an apportionate         plan with a maximum population deviation under         percent falls within this category of minor        deviations. And what we held previously was that minor          deviations from mathematical equality among State      legislatures are insufficient to make out a prima facie          case of invidious discrimination.                All right. So that's the holding of the         Court. And this seems to be within the category of           minor deviations where you have to make out ­­ you have           to do something more than you would have to do if it            were a ­­ larger than percent.                                have to do?               MR. HEARNE: Right.    JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what do you think you         MR. HEARNE: Well, I think we have to do,           Justice Breyer, what we did, which is to come to the           court ­­ to come to a district court and to present to             them evidence which the district court found of you have          a deviation that, though minor, is done for an         illegitimate purpose.  Alderson Reporting Company Official             And yes, there was this other pretext of the         preclearance issue. That satisfied the burden of        requiring judicial scrutiny of that redistricting, and       so we have satisfied that burden.                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why bother having a       minor? Don't you think this will lead every single plan           to be challenged as voter dilution?                  MR. HEARNE: Well, no. I think that you           would have to still have a showing of an illegitimate           purpose behind the deviation.                JUSTICE SCALIA: You didn't show that. You         didn't just establish it by the fact of the deviation.                      What kind of evidence did you present to the         district court?              MR. HEARNE: Well, I think in this case,          this ­­ this case is a very unique case because, as            Judge Wake found in his dissent, the chart shows         statistically that there was systematic, partisan      malapportionment done for that partisan reason. Just        looking at the numbers ­­                JUSTICE KENNEDY: Looking at the chart at        a of the appendix?                MR. HEARNE: Yes. I think that if it is ­­            it is the chart that is in color, I think we've also             provided ­­ Alderson Reporting Company Official JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's got the color chart.                                 MR. HEARNE: Yes. And it shows that the         districts were systemically, statistically    malapportioned for that purpose.                So that would be the kind of showing,        Justice Scalia, that you would be ­­                  JUSTICE KAGAN: But I ­­ I thought ­­ I ­­ I               thought, Mr. Hearne, that you were saying that the ­­         that the thing that you had presented had to do with an            impermissible motive, and the impermissible motive was       that they didn't have to do all this for Voting Rights           Act compliance; is that right?                 MR. HEARNE: I'd say there's two ­­ the ­­         the first impermissible motive or illegitimate      justification is partisanship, to gain an advantage ­­                   JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But that's the very         thing that you said, you weren't challenging the factual         finding, that that was a subsidiary part of the          redistricting.                         MR. HEARNE: That was ­­     JUSTICE KAGAN: The dominant part was the        voting rights compliance, and I take it you want to           undermine the voting rights compliance rationale.                  But then I'm stuck on the same question that         Justice Scalia is stuck on, is what evidence did you          Alderson Reporting Company Official present that ­­ that there was an impermissible motive         with respect to that, as opposed to different views as          to what the Voting Rights Act compelled.                   MR. HEARNE: Two quick answers to that,        Justice Kagan.              First is, legally the justice ­­ the Voting        Rights Act couldn't compel them to do what they did, so           that justification legally is invalid.                 Secondly, we bring up that point about the        burden shift with Arlington Heights and Mt. Healthy,        where when we show an illegitimate motive partisanship,        then the burden ­­ task falls to the Commission to          justify that.                          And I would reserve the balance of my time.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   General Brnovich.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MARK BRNOVICH        ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE ARIZONA SECRETARY OF STATE                MICHELE REAGAN IN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLANTS                   GENERAL BRNOVICH: Thank you, Mr. Chief       Justice. May it please the Court:                   Fortunately or unfortunately, in this case      there are many facts that are not in dispute, addressing          Justice Kennedy's questions. The State does not dispute         that the Independent Redistricting Commission did indeed       Alderson Reporting Company Official draw districts of unequal population. All sides agree         that these deviations were not random, or that they were          not incidental.              We also know, and the record shows and no         one disagrees, that this pattern to under­populate       minority districts was done to help create or further         ability to elect districts. And we also know that the           direct evidence is they did it intentionally.                   So why are we here today? In the background          versus Reynolds v. Sims, this Court has always held that          equal protection is not a criteria ­­ another factor          when it comes to redistricting, but it is essentially         the background in which all redistricting ledges take        place.             The State of Arizona and the Secretary do        not dispute the compliance with the Voting Rights Act         was a legitimate or is a legitimate State interest. And             we don't dispute that maybe there was an ­­ a good            motive on the part of drawing these districts. The          problem is those motives don't matter when what you have          is an undermining of the fundamental principle of        one­person, one­vote.              So in this case, what we have is a violation           of the Equal Protection Clause, because by intentionally        and systemically under­populating those minority     Alderson Reporting Company Official ability­to­elect districts, the IRC violated Equal      Protection Clause in that principle of one­person,       one­vote.             So essentially what happened was by      overpopulating the other districts, the voters in the        overpopulated districts had their votes diluted. And        by ­­ by diluting those votes, it violated the         Constitution.             JUSTICE KENNEDY: It sounds fundamental that       a statute can't authorize a constitutional violation, so         that even an attempt to comply with the Voting Rights          Act is not sufficient if it violates the Equal         Protection Clause.              Have we ever said that ­­ I mean it's          obvious, but have we ever said that in the context of           what the voting rights requires?                 MR. BRNOVICH: Your Honor, this ­­ this        Court has consistently, from Reynolds v. Sims, has        always held that the concept and the principle of         one­person, one­vote, any attempts to undermine that       outside ­­             JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we have said that        even ­­ you read our cases saying even minor deviations          are not permitted if they are statutorily required?                    GENERAL BRNOVICH: No statute can trump the        Alderson Reporting Company Official Constitution, and so if ­­ the Voting Rights Act,         whichever way it's read, can't be read in a way that            would violate the one­person, one­vote.                 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's what Judge Wake        said in his dissent.                MR. BRNOVICH: And that's exactly what Judge        Wake said in his dissent.                 And that is the State's position, is that we         don't dispute ­­ or we're not saying that complying with          the Voting Rights Act may indeed be a legitimate State           interest. What we are saying is, is that when it's done            in the systematic way where you have a one­way ratchet,           where you have consistently minority ability­to­elect      districts, essentially using votes based on racial or        ethnic classifications, and under­populating those     districts and then overpopulating other districts, what       you have done is essentially undervalued or violated the         one­person, one­vote ­­              JUSTICE ALITO: Would you say it's correct        that compliance with the Voting Rights Act, the desire         to obtain preclearance, is at least like other        traditional districting considerations, like respecting     county lines, respecting municipal lines, having      contiguous districts? Would you agree with that?                    GENERAL BRNOVICH: Yes, Justice Alito.      Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE ALITO: So if ­­ if that is the          case, then is this what you were asking us to say with            respect to the Voting Rights Act, that the things that          were really necessary to obtain preclearance are       legitimate, but you can't go ­­ but they went further.          They ­­ they went beyond what was really necessary to          obtain preclearance, so we would have to determine        whether that was true or not, or some court would have           to determine whether that was true or not.                    MR. BRNOVICH: In this instance, because of        the systematic way the deviations, the under­population       occurred, as well as the intention ­­ we know from the           Independent Redistricting Commission that they     intentionally under­populated those districts. So we       have all that evidence.                However, we do believe that the Voting       Rights Act is like any other criteria. So if you get            these population deviations and they're incidental, not       intentional ­­ and that is the key, I believe, is when            you intentionally under­populate and systemically     under­populate these districts ­­ that's what causes the        constitutional harm.              JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the only way         that you ­­ that a State could obtain preclearance when           Section was still in force was to under­populate some           Alderson Reporting Company Official districts? Would that be permissible?                              GENERAL BRNOVICH: Well ­­    JUSTICE ALITO: Just as you might have a         situation where the only way in which you could respect          municipal lines or county lines was to under­populate        some districts to some degree.                 MR. BRNOVICH: Justice Alito, the irony is        in the draft maps; seven of the ten minority         ability­to­elect districts were under­populated.    However, when the Independent Redistricting Commission      went from the draft maps to the final maps, there was a            one­way ratchet. They intentionally and systemically       under­populated those districts.               JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Alito can       protect his own question, but he's asking you whether or          not a deviation is permissible for protecting        communities of interest, protecting municipal lines,      whether some slight deviation is permissible.                  MR. BRNOVICH: Yes. Yes, Justice Kennedy,        if it's incidental and not intentional.                  that means.              JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I'm not sure what          JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I'm not sure. I had           thought you ­­ I had thought you were saying that it            doesn't matter whether you were doing it to obtain         Alderson Reporting Company Official Justice Department clearance. You cannot do something        that is unconstitutional.                           MR. BRNOVICH: That is ­­     JUSTICE SCALIA: If in fact you're ­­ you         don't have equally apportioned districts, it goes beyond        what is tolerable. It's a violation, regardless of          whether you're ­­ you're actually trying to comply with         the Justice Department. Isn't that what you were         saying?             MR. BRNOVICH: Yes, Justice Scalia, but I        think that it's important to note that we look at this           as a qualitative not a quantitative analysis. So there            isn't like some magic number where you say at this point           this becomes unconstitutional or it doesn't.                  The State's position is, is that compliance       with the Voting Rights Act was like other neutral or          traditional criteria, like protecting, as Justice Alito       alluded to, communities of interest, geographical      boundaries. And so in that ­­ in considering that, you           may have incidences where you get somebody ­­ some         districts above or below the line.                  So the fact that a district may be below the           line in and of itself is not a constitutional violation.           The harm occurs when the Independent Redistricting       Commission systemically under­populates those    Alderson Reporting Company Official districts ­­ those ability­to­elect districts, and      overpopulates other districts thereby ­­                            JUSTICE KAGAN: Can you explain ­­      MR. BRNOVICH: ­­ diluting the votes of        those people.              JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I'm just not really          sure. Let's ­­ let's say that there's a policy that            says we want to respect county lines. And we also know            that we want to do one­person, one­vote, but we think we           have, basically, some leeway up to percent. And ­­          and there's a policy. We want to respect county lines,            even though that's going to cause a little bit more           deviation on the one­person, one­vote metric. Are you         saying that that's impermissible?                saying ­­             MR. BRNOVICH: Justice Kagan, we are       JUSTICE KAGAN: It's a policy. I mean, it's            an intentional policy.               MR. BRNOVICH: I guess, you know, the road          to hell is paved with good intentions. And so our           position is, regardless of their intention, if they are         doing it in a systematic way or intending to          overpopulate certain districts, under­populate other     districts, that is unconstitutional.                The Voting Rights Act then would ­­      Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE KAGAN: Even though it just, say,        takes you from to percent, or from to percent.                 You're not crossing the percent threshold. But as          long as you're going up, and you're doing it         purposefully ­­                         MR. BRNOVICH: Yes.    JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ in the sense of we have a           policy to maintain county lines, that's impermissible?                   MR. BRNOVICH: Yes, Justice Kagan. The        position of the State is that when it's done in a           systematic and intentional manner, when you create,       essentially, barrios of ­­ boroughs, excuse me ­­ of         certain folks, and then you overpopulate other       districts, that violates this Court's one­person,      one­vote principle.              JUSTICE SCALIA: General Brnovich, just as a        matter of curiosity, how do you end up being on this           side of the case? You ­­ you were defended in the            district court, weren't you?                MR. BRNOVICH: The ­­ the Secretary in the         State thought the principle of one­person, one­vote and        upholding that principle was very, very important, and        that's why we felt compelled to be involved in this ­­          this case.              JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but only on appeal.        Alderson Reporting Company Official You didn't argue this side in the district court, did          you?             MR. BRNOVICH: That ­­ that's is correct,        Your ­­ Justice Scalia.                JUSTICE SCALIA: What happened? Was there        an election in between or something?                  (Laughter.)             MR. BRNOVICH: Yes, and I won        overwhelmingly.                         JUSTICE SCALIA: I knew it.       MR. BRNOVICH: Thanks. Thank you very much.         I will be up for reelection in three more years, so           the ... anyway.               JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you ­­ do you agree         with your colleague that it doesn't make any difference;         that in the end result, the ­­ the legislature ­­ that           the Republicans were disproportionately advantaged, had      a disproportionate share of the seats?                  MR. BRNOVICH: Yes, Justice. Our ­­ our         position is, is that that really is irrelevant as far as           the numbers ultimately, whether the percentage ­­                  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Whether it would have       ended up, if you're right, an even greater        disproportion ­­ a greater disproportion of Republican        representatives. Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. BRNOVICH: And so ultimately the       number ­­ this is not a line drawing case; this is an             overpopulation/under­population case. So how the lines       are drawn, and what the Republican or Democratic        representation is in the State House or the State Senate          is not important or not key to our argument.                     Our ­­ the key to the State's argument is         that this intentional and systematic one­way ratcheting       of under­populating minority ability­to­elect districts     is what undermines the one­person, one­vote principle,       and what makes the actions of the IRC unconstitutional.                                             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       MR. BRNOVICH: Thank you.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Smith.                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH                      ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE           ARIZONA INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION                MR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               There is no basis for concluding that the        minor, modest population variances among the districts       in the Arizona map violate the Equal Protection Clause.         That's because ­­              JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you ­­ do you accept         the ­­ the fact ­­ speaking of accepting fact­finding,         Alderson Reporting Company Official do you accept the fact­finding that at least part of the           motive was partisan?               MR. SMITH: I don't think that's a fair           characterization of what the district court found, Your        Honor.                         JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, really? Why?       MR. SMITH: The district court found that        the predominant motive for the under ­­ for the         population ­­             right.             JUSTICE SCALIA: Predominant motive. That's       MR. SMITH: It said that ­­ that there may          have been two of the five commissioners who, as to one           district, District , had some mixed motives in ­­ in          urging that that district be made more competitive, but         did not find that the Commission as a whole acted, even            in that one instance, with partisan motivations, and        it ­­ that district is not one of the ones that's           significantly under­populated.              The decision to move population around and       make that district somewhat more competitive, even if it         was motivated by partisanship, has nothing to do with         what we're really talking about here, which is the .          deviation.             JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, I would be          Alderson Reporting Company Official very upset if ­­ if it ­­ there was any motivation of            partisanship because ­­ I wish this case had come up           before the case we had last term, which ­­ which          approved your commission, despite the ­­ the text of the          Constitution ­­             (Laughter.)             JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ because this commission       was going to end partisanship, get politics out of         redistricting. And here the very next term we have this           case which ­­ which asserts that there has been a lot of             partisanship on the part of this ­­                              commission.             MR. SMITH: With respect ­­     JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ supposedly divine      MR. SMITH: Not a fair characterization of         what happened, and not a fair characterization of what          the district court found after a full trial. What it            found, after giving them a full opportunity to try to           prove their claim that there was some invidious        discrimination here, is that's simply not what happened.                    Instead what happened is that they had ­­       these population deviations emerged in the final part of         the process as they worked to make sure that their map           would pass preclearance on the first try, something that         the State of Arizona had failed to achieve in each of           Alderson Reporting Company Official the three previous decades.                JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the district court       found ­­ and this is on a of the Appendix to the            Jurisdictional Statement ­­ "partisanship played some      role." So do you want us to interpret that to mean that             if there was no partisanship, everything would have come         out exactly the same way? It had no affect whatsoever           on the districting?               MR. SMITH: What the court said was with         respect to the changes to District , which by the way,           remained a largely Republican­leaning competitive      district, that two of the commissioners may have had         mixed motives, both thinking about aiding the       preclearance arguments and also thinking about bringing       the Democratic party up closer to parity, it still         didn't get to parity.                            And I think that to say ­­       JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's a ­­ that's a          red herring. We don't need to discuss the issue of           parity. If you have a system of proportional          representation and you get percent of the vote,         you'll get percent of the ­­ of the representatives.                      But in the kind of electoral system we have         in the United States, with single­member districts and        winner­take­all, a neutral ­­ a neutral districting plan          Alderson Reporting Company Official will never produce exactly the same breakdown of        legislators as the breakdown of the votes in the         election. But that's ­­ I mean, that's a side issue.             What do we do with this statement: Partisanship played          some role?              MR. SMITH: Your Honor, partisanship by       itself cannot violate the Constitution. You have a ­­          you have ­­ even if it ­­ even if you inflate that far             beyond what was intended by the judges who wrote that          opinion, the case of Gaffney v. Cummings was a case           where you had partisanship being the dominant,       controlling factor in every single line that was drawn.                     JUSTICE ALITO: This is what ­­ this is what          interests me about the case. If we assume, as the           district court did, that partisanship is not a        legitimate consideration, and it's not, like, respecting       county lines, and if we interpret the district court's         opinion as finding that partisanship was part of the         reason for the plan that was adopted, then is the test,           the Mt. Healthy test ­­ which in my understanding is          what we normally apply in a constitutional mixed motive          situation.             So that if an illegitimate, unconstitutional      consideration is one of the reasons, the burden shifts         to the defendant to show that things would have come out           Alderson Reporting Company Official the same way, even if that factor had not been in the            case, or is it what the court said in Bush v. Vera and a              few other cases, that in this particular context, that's         not the test? The test is whether the illegitimate          factor there, race, was the predominant consideration.                               MR. SMITH: Well, that's ­­     JUSTICE ALITO: It seems to me it ­­ it          turns on the choice between the two.                                           MR. SMITH: Well, this accepting a lot of ­­          JUSTICE ALITO: Is that a wrong?        MR. SMITH: Accepting a lot of the premises          of the question, which I think are counterfactual, about          the opinion and ­­ and what was found here and all of            that, it does seem to me that even if you're going to            make partisanship something illegitimate and     redistricting, which seems kind of like a fool's errand,          frankly, it ought to at least have to be predominate. I            mean, in a situation where ­­ you wouldn't ­­ you           wouldn't want to say that the ­­ that the ­­ the ­­ the             line drawers have to have complete purity of heart.                     JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, aren't you saying       that it's permissible to use, as one factor, an illegal          standard if there are some other factors that are also          in play? That it's permissible to use an illegal          standard, in part?   Alderson Reporting Company Official MR. SMITH: If there were ­­      JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that what you want us                                 to write in this opinion?                 MR. SMITH: No, your Honor. Nobody thinks         that it's illegal to consider ­­                 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's one of the        issues in the case. We'll talk about that later, about           partisanship. If you ­­ if you want to say it doesn't            make any difference because partisanship is ­­ is a         valid consideration, fine. That's your point. But my          question is, it sounds to me, in response to your answer           to Justice Alito, that you're saying that it is all          right to use an illegal standard, in part, to reduce          equal ­­ equal representation.                MR. SMITH: For all the same reasons that         the Court has many times said we're not going to say any            racial consciousness is enough to invalidate it unless        it predominates, I would think you would want to follow           the same approach, even if you're going to adopt the          parity between racial considerations and partisan      considerations, which makes no sense. You're entire        Shaw v. Reno line of cases is about trying to decide           whether it's race or party, and when you come to the           conclusion easily that it's party, then it's okay.                    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can I put in my notes that           Alderson Reporting Company Official you're arguing that partisanship is a valid        consideration in redistricting? Is that what you want         me to say?               MR. SMITH: You ­­ you ­­ you certainly can,          Your Honor. You said it last year in the Alabama case.            You said political affiliation is one of the legitimate         traditional redistricting criteria that line drawers      always can consider. That it's ­­                  JUSTICE BREYER: That's the problem.      There ­­ there is ­­ I'm suddenly waking up here and           following ­­             MR. SMITH: That's your opinion, Your Honor.                    (Laughter.)             JUSTICE BREYER: Well ­­ well, how ­­ how do          you ­­ it's a ­­ how ­­ how do we write this? There are                two areas that are difficult to write.                   One is, I know there is this percent          rule, but it doesn't say we don't look at it at all. We              institutionally can't review thousands of pages of       record in every redistricting case. So what are the          words there that describe the standard we should bring         to this?              And the second, which is a direct        application of the first, is you're quite right. How          can we say that partisanship can't be used at all when           Alderson Reporting Company Official you're doing one­person, one­vote but the sky is the         limit. Vieth.                           MR. SMITH: Vieth.    JUSTICE BREYER: When in fact ­­ of course,         I dissented there. I ­­ but the sky is the limit when              you're drawing boundaries.               Now, how do we reconcile ­­ how do we         reconcile our institutional ability with the need to        have some policing here? And how do we reconcile what           we say in this case with what we've held in the           line­drawing area?              MR. SMITH: Okay.                JUSTICE BREYER: Now, those ­­ those are two         questions in the back of my mind, and I'd like to have            your position.              MR. SMITH: Can I answer the second question          first, Your Honor?               JUSTICE SCALIA: Fifty words or less.                   (Laughter.)             MR. SMITH: It ­­ it seems to me like it           would be ­­ like it would be not ­­ not defensible to            adopt a rule that says partisanship in creating minor          population deviations is actionable absent some effect       in terms of biasing the map, whereas in the ­­ in the            line­drawing area, the Vieth situation, you have always        Alderson Reporting Company Official insisted that there not only be a bias effect, but it be             very large.              JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I didn't ask you what          we shouldn't say. I asked you what we should say.                        MR. SMITH: What you should say is ­­ what          you should apply is the rule that ­­ that applied in all            of these cases about minor population deviations: Is         there a rational, legitimate policy that the State can          articulate which is the reason why they arrived at this          difference? And here we have, the Voting Rights Act is           the rational and legitimate State policy.                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's not ­­       let's talk about that for a second. If action in            redistricting or overpopulation would constitute     illegitimate racial discrimination, can the answer that       we're doing that to comply to get preclearance from the          Justice Department legitimize that?                MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. This Court has          said a number of times that complying with the Voting           Rights Act is a compelling State interest. It ­­ it            assumed that just last year.                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my ­­ my        question is if the action that is taken would otherwise          constitute illegitimate racial discrimination. I'm      trying to find out if the Justice Department's        Alderson Reporting Company Official procedures can trump the requirements of the       Constitution. In other words, it's ­­ it's an issue          of ­­ you know, we ­­ we said in Ricci v. DeStefano that             it's not an excuse ­­ not a complete excuse for           intentional discrimination, that you're trying to avoid       liability under Title VII ­­                            MR. SMITH: Right.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: ­­ for      discrimination on the basis of effects.                              MR. SMITH: Right.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I'm wondering if        it's somehow different. If the Justice Department is         insisting on conduct that would constitute a violation,         if they're insisting on more than they should be, is          that a defense for the ­­ for the redistricting?                      MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the one thing         that is clear, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the Voting          Rights Act does require people drawing lines to consider         race. And Section required it to avoid retrogression.           Section requires it right now.                                           CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that.        MR. SMITH: So ­­    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it doesn't say        that all bets are off.                 MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The ­­ what ­­          Alderson Reporting Company Official the line this Court has drawn is between maps which go           too far and maps which don't, maps in which the racial           considerations predominate and subordinate all other      traditional districting principles here. And what you        have in this case is the quintessential map where that's          not true, where ­­               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems to me         you're avoiding my question.                            MR. SMITH: Sorry.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the       requirements that the Justice Department asks for, for        preclearance go too far?                MR. SMITH: Well, I think if the ­­ the           Justice Department reads the Voting Rights Act in a         manner that requires them to do something that would go          too far in the predominant sense, there might be a          constitutional problem. There's no indication here that        that's what happens. Nobody ­­                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So ­­ so         whether or not preclearance is a defense depends upon          whether the Justice Department is insisting on too much.                     MR. SMITH: It ­­ it could be, Your Honor.          There's ­­ but there's no indication of anything of ­­         like that here. This is a case where they simply said             no retrogression. This is not like the 's, where they           Alderson Reporting Company Official were saying you have to create new districts, no matter          how ugly, to comply with ­­                 JUSTICE BREYER: Look at the finding to        support what the ­­ the Chief Justice is drawing there.          While partisanship played a role in the increased         population deviation associated with changing     District , so, too, did the preclearance goal play a          role in motivating the change. It's the first half of           the sentence which is raising the issue that I think           people are trying to ­­ to get you to say how we write             that. You see? Because it says it played a role.                         And so we're going to be asked here by the          other side to expand on what that means, "play a role,"            and we have to write an opinion. And if you win this             case, there will have to be words that support you.                      And so how do we take this thing? What          would you say about the words "play a role"?                      MR. SMITH: I would say two things, Your          Honor.             First of all, it's a tiny role in this case.                       But second of all, even if it were the only          reason why you had a ­­ population deviations under           percent, I think it would be not defensible for this            Court to say that, by itself, is unconstitutional.                    There is so ­­ de minimis effect on any         Alderson Reporting Company Official interest in terms of representation from this difference        of population, absent some bias in the way that the          districts elect candidates, that it's simply not a        constitutional problem that you ought to recognize where        the ­­ even if the pure motive was ­­ was partisanship,           it's simply not something that ought to be taken         seriously as a constitutional problem.                  But here, where the predominant motive is to        try to make sure these districts will pass preclearance,         and less than ­­ percent of the commissioners may           have had, for one district, where they increased the         deviation slightly, like . percent, may have had some         partisanship as well as the Voting Rights Act in mind          for District . Not one of the ten that were offered to             the Justice Department as ability­to­elect districts.      That's a tiny, tiny, tiny sliver of partisanship for          less than the full commission. It was never ­­                     JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if there were?        What if there were a case where the ­­ the commissioner            or whoever was responsible for producing the plan        produced ­­ chose between two plans. Plan A has a            deviation of . percent; Plan B has a deviation of            . percent. And they write a report, and they say,            well, we ­­ it came down to these two plans, and we            chose B, because we want to maximize the representation         Alderson Reporting Company Official in the legislature of Republicans or Democrats.                   And you would say that that would be        constitutional?             MR. SMITH: I think if ­­ if that's the only            thing that they ­­ that ­­ that was problematic about          the map, you might well say that's constitutional. But          that's ­­ that's not this case, obviously.                   it ­­             JUSTICE ALITO: No, it's not this case, but         MR. SMITH: And it ­­ it ­­ you know, you've           gone as far as Larios. You've said a map that's an ­­             an egregious gerrymander, massive disparate pairing of       incumbents, plus the not ­­ intentional abuse of the          percent rule at . percent, all of that together,          you summarily affirmed a finding of unconstitutionality.                    But by itself, I don't know that I would           even say that ­­               JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's because      there's no constitutional criterion for where you draw        the district lines. There is a constitutional criterion          for ­­ for how you ­­ how you weigh voters, district by            district. There is.                            MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.      JUSTICE SCALIA: One­person, one­vote.     There's ­­ there's no ­­ no such criterion for where the           Alderson Reporting Company Official location of a district line has to be.                     MR. SMITH: But this Court has said, over         and over again, we want to give States leeway in this           area, because representation is often better if you give         them some chance to make districts within the percent          band. And if you allow them to do what's ­­ what's            being suggested here, to accuse ­­ to bring partisanship         in and they can get to Federal court and they can get to             trial just by that, then exactly what you said is going           to happen in ­­ in your dissent in Larios. Every ­­           everybody with a ­­ with a political motivation to try            to do something to undercut a map is going to come in.             It's easy enough to ­­ to allege partisanship. Here          the ­­ all ­­ the only evidence they have of          partisanship, leaving aside the little story of       District , is simply the pattern, that the Hispanic         districts they under­populated and the Native American       district happened to vote Democratic. So you have this          pattern. The chart on ­­ they point to on page a,            but that's not evidence. It's equally consistent with         what the court found happened, which is they wanted to          make these districts more persuasive as ability­to­elect       districts so they could get preclearance. And voila,         they got preclearance.               This is a ­­ this is a case where you            Alderson Reporting Company Official wonder: Where's the beef? What exactly are we here           for? There's no problem with this map. It's not a            partisan gerrymander. It's not a racial gerrymander.         It's within the percent boundary. They ­­ they did           everything in open.               Everything that ­­ that's being complained      about here, all of this under­population of these        districts that was done at the ­­ was done unanimously          by all five commissioners who adopted the goal of         getting preclearance, who adopted the ­­ the ­­ the idea          that they had to get districts, not eight districts,          that every single change to those districts that         increased their under­population was unanimously voted      by all five commissioners. This is a case where there            is simply nothing seriously being argued here that could         possibly amount to a constitutional violation.                   And it seems to me that we can talk about          whether a pure partisan case ought to, by itself, if the            only ­­ if the only problem is deviation, to be          unconstitutional, I would recommend that you not do that          for the reasons you said in your dissent in Larios.          But, boy, this ­­ this case is so far from that. I             mean, the Republican commissioner ­­ appointed      commissioners are voting for everything that they're       complaining about because they, too, want to get        Alderson Reporting Company Official preclearance.             The State of Arizona wants very much to have         its map go into effect for the first time since the           s when it became covered by the Voting Rights Act,          rather than having a Federal court have to put the map            into effect because preclearance was denied.                  And they ­­ they hire lawyers who worked in         the Justice Department, told them how many districts        they needed, told them that if necessary in rejiggering         these lines, they could go down ­­ up to the percent            limit. They then tried very hard to minimize that.                      And one of the things that's important to        recognize here is you could have probably equalized the         population here and still gotten districts to the same         level of Hispanic population, but you would have had to          draw tentacles of the kind that the Court has many times           criticized. There's lots and lots of other Hispanic         people in the State of Arizona who are not in these           districts, but that's because they're spread out all        over the place.               And so if you're going to draw compact        districts, if you're going to draw districts that        respect county boundaries, if you're going ­­ and census         tracts and communities of interests, something has to        give. And what gave here was this modest, tiny, small           Alderson Reporting Company Official amount of population variation that seems to me just not          a serious candidate for any kind of constitutional        invalidation on the facts of this case, which aren't         even challenged here, is clearly erroneous.                  If the Court has no further questions, thank        you.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                 Ms. Harrington.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON          FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING        APPELLEE ARIZONA INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION                 MS. HARRINGTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief       Justice, and may it please the Court:                   The question in this case is not whether        Section can compel deviations from a perfect          population standard. The question is whether de minimis         deviations are permitted by the Constitution. This        Court has made very clear that when State districting         plans are within the percent deviation, total        deviation from a perfect population equality standard,        those plans are presumed to be constitutional.                   Now, that presumption is a substantive rule        that serves three important principles.                 Just if I can briefly tick them off, the          first is that such de minimis deviations do not by          Alderson Reporting Company Official themselves violate equal protection. The second is that         giving States a percent leeway actually enhances         citizens' fair and equal representation by allowing       States to pursue other important districting principles.       And the third is that limiting Federal court        intervention in de minimis deviation cases protects       State's sovereign right to draw districts for their own         legislature.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is ­­ is percent         really de minimis? I mean, I think you can say it's              minor, but de minimis strikes me as misleading when         you're talking about percent.                 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I certainly don't        mean to be misleading about this term that this Court          has used ­­              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know it has, yes.                      (Laughter.)             MS. HARRINGTON: I would never accuse the         Court of being misleading. I mean, I think the point             that the Court has made is that these sort of, you know,             percent deviations from perfect population equality       don't have enough of a dilutive effect to really affect           any citizen's right to fair and equal ­­                   JUSTICE SCALIA: Does anybody contest that?       I don't think that's contested here. I think the other            Alderson Reporting Company Official side is willing to ­­ to concede that it's presumptively          okay, which means they have to come forward to show that           there were invalid reasons why there is this        discrepancy. Right?               MS. HARRINGTON: That's true. And our view,         Justice Scalia, is that the case should begin and end at           the prima facie case requirement. Our view is that the           plaintiffs did not make a prima facie case of invidious           discrimination in this case, and so the district court's         factual findings about the Commission's actual motives       actually aren't relevant at this point.                  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. I          thought a prima facie case means if ­­ if you haven't            made a prima facie case, it means you have to bring in             other evidence. It doesn't mean you're out of court.                      MS. HARRINGTON: Well, if you haven't made        the prima facie case, it means that the State doesn't          have to justify its reasons for the deviations. And so           in this context, in order to make ­­ in really any           context, to make a prima facie case, what you have to do             is put in enough evidence from which an inference of          invidious discrimination can be made.                 What that generally requires is that the       challenger has to put in enough in evidence to rebut the           presumed reasons for the challenged action. In this         Alderson Reporting Company Official case the Arizona ­­ Arizona constitution sets forth the         redistricting criteria that the Commission is to use in         drawing district lines, and so at a minimum the          plaintiffs should have come in and demonstrated that        the ­­ that the deviations that they observed were not          explainable as in service of the ­­                  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let ­­ let's assume        that the ­­ the opinion of the district court found that           partisanship was a consideration.                 So are you saying that that finding can't be         sustained because it wasn't based on sufficient evidence        brought forward by the plaintiffs?                 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, first, just a point         of clarification. Part of the opinion that you read was           just talking about District , and so it wasn't defining          that partisanship played any role with respect to the         rest of the map. And if you read on in the paragraph             from which you were quoting, the district court said         that the amount of deviation that was attributable to         the attempts to make the district more competitive was         less than percent. I think it was . percent.                                     And so it's really a small, very small ­­         JUSTICE ALITO: Well, was it a factor or          not? Was partisanship just irrelevant, that it played         no role, everything would have come out the same way ­­          Alderson Reporting Company Official                         MS. HARRINGTON: The district court found ­­       JUSTICE ALITO: ­­ without partisanship      according the district court's finding?                 MS. HARRINGTON: The district court found       that with respect to one district, two of the five          commissioners were motivated in part by ­­ by        partisanship motives.              But, again, our ­­ our first position is        that this Court doesn't need to get to what the actual           findings were as to the motives because what the         plaintiffs needed to do was come in and demonstrate at          the front end that the lines on the map couldn't be           explained as an effort to comply with legitimate        districting criteria.                                      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the ­­      JUSTICE ALITO: The district of ­­      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the position        of the United States on the question of whether it's          permissible to intentionally take partisanship ­­ to use        partisanship as a guiding principle in redistricting?        Is that permissible or not?                 MS. HARRINGTON: We haven't taken a position         on that that ­­               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know you haven't.         It seems very unfortunate. It's a little difficult for           Alderson Reporting Company Official us to address it since that's one of the main questions           in the case.               MS. HARRINGTON: Well, the United States has        never participated in the political gerrymandering      cases. It certainly ­­ you know, there are lessons that           can be drawn from this Court's cases. In Gaffney, the           Court indicated that certainly consideration of politics       and partisanship does not necessarily make a plan         unconstitutional.             But, again, in this case, I think in         order ­­ before you even get to the question of what the            State's actual motives were, there has to be some         demonstration that the motives were not the announced        motives that are in the Arizona Constitution.                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're ­­ you're        unwilling to tell me whether intentional use of        partisanship in redistricting is acceptable or not?                   MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I think this Court's         decision in Gaffney indicates that it can be        permissible. The districting body in Gaffney was driven         by a desire to equalize partisanship ­­                   JUSTICE BREYER: I took it that the position          of the United States is at least, since many commissions          are nonpartisan because they have two people who are         more partisan on one side, two people on the other side           Alderson Reporting Company Official and one neutral. So at the least, where the          commissions ­­ commissioners don't account for a       majority, the partisan motive is not held by a majority           of the commission, then it is constitutional ­­                               MS. HARRINGTON: That ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ for some members of the         commission to take partisan considerations into account       where they're not a majority and where the result is           under percent.               MS. HARRINGTON: I think that was the         district court's conclusion. Our position ­­                  JUSTICE BREYER: Is your conclusion as       representing the United States.                MS. HARRINGTON: Well, again, we haven't       taken a position on how one would analyze a          partisanship ­­ if there was a finding that you get           there, about a partisanship ­­ partisanship motive.                                JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: I read the finding as         saying, well, two members of the commission out of five          did have a partisan motive, in part.                                MS. HARRINGTON: Yes.    JUSTICE BREYER: So I have to ­­ you have           to ­­ I think have to say whether you think that is ­­             that situation, is constitutional or not.      Alderson Reporting Company Official             MS. HARRINGTON: Well, no. Let me make the          pitch one more time for the ­­ for having a robust prima             facie case.              So the ­­ what the Plaintiff needed to do         was come into this ­­ come into court and say, here is a             map; it can't be explained by the criteria that are          identified in the Constitution that the Commission is        supposed to go by. The very first criterion listed in           the Constitution is complying ­­ includes compliance       with the Voting Rights Act.                 If you look at the map and you look at          which ­­ which districts were under­populated and which        are the ability­to­elect districts, there's almost a       perfect correlation. And I think ­­ I think that was a              perfectly legitimate explanation for why there are       deviations in the case.                JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand this two         out of five. Do you ­­ do you think if four of the              justices of this Court voted a certain way in a case             because they were racists, the opinion would still be         valid because, after all, five of us weren't? Would you           even consider that? And why is it any different for a            ­­ for a commission like this? The mere fact that two             of them are ­­ if ­­ if partisanship is indeed bad ­­                       MS. HARRINGTON: Well, again, I think, you         Alderson Reporting Company Official know, we don't have a position on how one would analyze            that ­­             JUSTICE BREYER: Well, not ­­ what I        think ­­ one, this isn't racist.                              that.             Number two, it's not this Court.      Number three, I don't know any court like         And number four, if you're ­­                 (Laughter.)             JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ if you're going to        say ­­ if you're going to say. If you're going to say             that no members of a redistricting commission can ever          have ­­ can ever have partisan views, I don't know where            you're going to get your membership from.                   (Laughter.)             JUSTICE BREYER: I mean that ­­ that is ­­          that many of these commissions, I would think, would          balance people who know about districting and who are         also Republicans with people who know about it and are          also Democrats, and then you have someone of undoubted         neutral ­­             JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is not the case here.         That places a lot of weight on selecting the fifth           person who is lily ­­ lily­white pure, right? And if           that person, deep down, is partisanship one side or the          Alderson Reporting Company Official other, the whole ­­ the whole thing goes.                                MS. HARRINGTON: Well, this Court ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA: And that is the allegation        here, by the way.                            MS. HARRINGTON: I'm sorry to interrupt.       This Court has repeatedly said that politics       is always going to be a part of redistricting. And so I              think it's ­­                          ­­            JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.    MS. HARRINGTON: ­­ you can't ­­ you can't         JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with that. And          that's a different point.                             MS. HARRINGTON: Okay. But ­­      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, you don't         have a position on whether that's acceptable or not.                                  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I can ­­       CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's a difference        between something's a necessary evil and saying it's         evil.             (Laughter.)             MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I think this Court's         decisions have told us that it's ­­ that it's fine to           have partisanship play some role in redistricting.       That's the ­­ that's the lesson of Gaffney.        Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm really surprised       with the way you ­­ the way you read the district           court's opinion. In footnote of the district court's          opinion, they set out the standard that they apply.                     please?             MS. HARRINGTON: Can you give me the page,         JUSTICE ALITO: It's on ­­ I'm sorry ­­         a, running over into a. And in the ­­ the final            paragraph that begins at the bottom of the page, "For          decision purposes, a majority of the panel made up of           Judge Clifton and Judge Silver have concluded that        Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that partisanship      predominated over legitimate redistricting    considerations."             Doesn't that mean that they found that there        were some illegitimate considerations, or at least       they ­­ and they assumed that partisanship was an         illegitimate consideration?              MS. HARRINGTON: They say that on a, which         is where you were reading from earlier ­­                               JUSTICE ALITO: No, no.     MS. HARRINGTON: ­­ I think it's clear that          what they're talking about, that partisan ­­ that        partisanship played a role only with respect to         District .  Alderson Reporting Company Official             But let me just say, if ­­ if this Court          allows the plaintiffs to come in and just point to ­­ to            deviations in districts ­­               JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. Just to clarify         your answer.              So you think that what they said in        footnote only applies to one district.                   MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. That's my reading of         the opinion. I think ­­ I haven't heard the other side              disagree with that, but you can ask them.                    You know, if this Court makes it too easy         for plaintiffs to come in and point to deviations and          partisan correlations, then it's going to totally wipe        away the ­percent leeway, which itself serves       important districting principles.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,      Ms. Harrington.              remaining. General Hearne, you have four minutes               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK F. HEARNE, II                      ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS                             MR. HEARNE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.        JUSTICE SCALIA: What about footnote ? Do         you agree with ­­ with the characterization that the         other side has made?    Alderson Reporting Company Official MR. HEARNE: Well, footnote , no, I do          And the portion I would quote was not                     not.             limited just to District . Partisanship was rank in          this redistricting process, and is demonstrated      objectively, not just with Judge Wake's chart. But it's          also demonstrated by the fact of District , which was          not submitted for preclearance.                JUSTICE SCALIA: I want a finding. I want a              finding. I don't ­­ I don't want to look at a chart ­­                                        MR. HEARNE: Well ­­    JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ to make my own factual         determination.             is there?              What factual finding other than footnote       MR. HEARNE: Then I would quote from the          Appendix at a, which is where the statement's made,         "Judge Clifton correctly finds that the IRC was actually         motivated by both partisan advantage and hope for voting         rights preclearance."              fact.             So we have a majority for that finding of          So that is two members of the court        specifically found that partisanship was one of the two         motives to explain these deviations from one­person,       Alderson Reporting Company Official one­vote. So clearly, it was a motive at that point, as             even Judge Silver noted, this is a mixed­motive case.                      JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but to what extent? I          mean, the other side's going to say, yes, that's true,          but it's only true as to that one district discussed in           footnote .              MR. HEARNE: Well, if that's so, then they         would have stopped and adopted the initial map and not          continued to deviate from percent to percent for the             final map. The initial map, the draft map, was a           ­percent deviation.              Dr. King, their own expert, said that this        map complied with the Voting Rights Act. And yet, they           went after that and continued deviating and       under­populating districts to get to the . percent.        That included the machinations with District .                   So if the only legitimate reason was to        obtain preclearance, then they would have accepted the        draft map, and it would have been game over. But they            didn't. They went ahead and conducted these        deviations ­­             JUSTICE KAGAN: I thought it was because         they wanted to make super sure that they complied with          the Voting Act. I think ­­ I think that that's why they               said they kept going.    Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. HEARNE: The explanation that was made        is that they were, quote, "strengthening" these       districts by continuing to under­populate districts      because their consultant said, oh, that does help us get          Voting Rights Act preclearance approval. That was the         explanation made.              But if their own expert said the original        map, the draft map satisfied the Voting Rights Act, and          the only reason to additionally depopulate these       districts was to achieve a further partisan skew, which          Judge Wake's chart demonstrates, then that shows that        partisanship was a very ­­ I understand two of the            members said that it was not the primary motive, but it           certainly was a pervasive motive in the process by which           these districts were drawn.                And our position is a very narrow one that          we ask the Court to hold, is that partisanship does not           justify deviating from one­person, one­vote, and that a        mistaken belief that preclearance was necessary to       under­populate certain districts also does not justify       deviating from one­person, one­vote.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But where ­­ where        is the district in which ­­ or the State in which           partisanship does not play a role in redistricting?                     MR. HEARNE: Well, we think partisanship is        Alderson Reporting Company Official always going to play a role. We ­­ we would say, but              there's an outer limit, as certainly ­­ as ­­ as          Justice Scalia noted, a articulateable, justiciable       standard of one­person, one­vote. That's a rule that we           can cabin the partisanship.                You can be partisan. And we don't fault the          Commission for having partisan interests, Republican      members, Democrat members. Even if this fifth member         ended up being partisan interest for the Democrats,        that's fine. The problem here isn't that they had          partisan motives. It's that they deviated from the         one­person, one­vote principle to further those partisan       motives. And that's what we ­­                  JUSTICE KAGAN: If I could ask the ­­ the           question that Ms. Harrington left with, was that ­­ I'm          sorry.                         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, please. Finish.        JUSTICE KAGAN: Even ­­ if ­­ if you're         saying that even within the percent, you know, to go           from percent to percent, or from percent to               percent, and then somebody can come in and say that's           partisanship, it means that every single plan will be up          for grabs in every single place, doesn't it?                    MR. HEARNE: I don't think it does. And the            answer would be it doesn't, because in this case, there          Alderson Reporting Company Official were no other legitimate reasons to explain it. If that           is the reason, and the only reason to deviate ­­ only           other legitimate reason to deviate from ­­ from        one­person, one­vote, then it is not a constitutional         plan. But that's not present in all the other cases.                       CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       The case is submitted.                (Whereupon, at : a.m., the      case in the
