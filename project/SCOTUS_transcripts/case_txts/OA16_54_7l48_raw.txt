ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The key statutory term of the INA in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case is the word "abuse."  And the Federal statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminalizing sexual abuse of a minor, as well as the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State statutes dealing with the same subject, dictate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that sexual relations become abuse only -- on account of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

age, only when the younger partner in the activity is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

younger than 16. 

 

 

            

At the very least, the Federal and State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws that I just mentioned dictate that California 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute is well outside of that which Congress would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm --

  

 

 

MR. FISHER:  -- have expected. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

just said something that I think you did not say in your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs, so let me ask you about that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You just gave us your definition of what the

generic offense is.  It's understand 16. Because I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

understood in your briefs you just said whatever the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generic offense is, it doesn't include this activity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But do you have a definition of what the generic offense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is?  And if so, did you just say it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Justice Kagan, what we think is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if you want to give a definition for sexual abuse 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a minor, at least in the context of the allegation of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse being due to age, that 16 would be the appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cutoff.  And we do say that in our reply brief in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response to the government's point that, at least its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments, that you need to go further than we argued in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our blue brief. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you have any further 

  

 

 

 

 

 

views of what the generic offense is?  Are there other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements of the generic offense that you're willing to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell us you think?  I mean usually, in these cases, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first we define the generic offense, and then we see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the State statute in question fits within that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or doesn't. 

 

            

And so what is the generic offense?  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under 16.  Anything else? 

  

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  There are four elements, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan.  There -- it has to be sexual in nature, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it has to be abuse, has to involve a minor, and then

presumably there's some mens rea involved.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

5 

those are four elements. 

 

 

 

            

And so what we think is enough to decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case -- in fact, it's more than is necessary to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide this case -- is to say, when dealing with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements of abuse, and the allegation is solely because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the ages of the partners engaging in sexual relations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have abuse, then 16 should be the age of consent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, we didn't go that far in parts of our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing because we don't think the Court has to go that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

far.  In Duenas-Alvarez and other cases are examples 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the Court has said, we'll just look at a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular element and say that as long as the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute falls outside of that element, that's enough. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So you could decide this case by saying that the seven 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

states that have laws like California's, at issue here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but draw the age of consent at 18, automatically fall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside of sexual abuse of a minor.  And, remember, even 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the seven states that have those laws, most of them are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misdemeanors, and only one of those seven states calls 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that conduct abuse. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose that there were 

  

 

 

 

 

no -- that the definition here -- the phrase here had no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal application.  So it applies purely in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

immigration; okay?

MR. FISHER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

6 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And you're not asking us to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

overrule Chevron. 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  No, no, no. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So why wouldn't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

this phrase, "sexual abuse of a minor," be a phrase that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is sufficiently ambiguous to justify Chevron?  Now, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

order to get around that, do you have to invoke 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like the rule of lenity? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  No.  We have other arguments, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So that -- that is not an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous phrase by itself, "sexual abuse of a minor"? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Not in the way you've defined 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"ambiguity," both in the categorical approach cases and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for purposes of Chevron.  So let me turn to those one by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one. 

            

In the categorical approach cases, starting 

 

 

 

 

 

with Taylor, when the Court had confronted a generic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime without a specific cross-reference definition, 

   

 

 

 

what the Court has done is look across the sweep of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State laws and Federal laws criminalizing that conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In a case like Perrin, where there were 42 states that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had a common core definition, the Court explicitly said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a footnote in that case there's no ambiguity involved

in that situation, because we assume it's sufficiently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

clear that that's what Congress would have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intending to cover. 

 

 

            

            

Even if I didn't win that argument --

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But you think that if we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at this incredible array of State laws, it becomes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear what Congress intended by "sexual abuse of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor"? 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, we think "yes" for two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  One is because, remember, Justice Alito, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the very legislation this provision in the INA was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted, Congress amended Section 2243 of the criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

code that uses precisely the same language, "sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse of a minor."  So it is a precise definition in 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal criminal law when Congress was criminalizing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this conduct.  So I think the Court could actually hold 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is enough right there to find no ambiguity and to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find a common --

   

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well -- well, before --

  

 

 

 

 

 

before you continue your answer and get into Chevron, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why -- suppose that there were -- the Federal statute is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only one on the books.  All the other State statutes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are -- are different.  Would the Federal statute then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control, still? 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  I think that would be a harder 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

case, Justice Kennedy.  What you'd have to ask in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation is, did you have an explicit or implicit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

cross-reference?  Is there strong-enough reason to 

  

 

 

 

 

believe in that hypothetical that Congress was thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of only the Federal version of the crime?  I think there 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are strong reasons here to think that, for the reasons I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was just describing.  But this is the easy case, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy.  So --

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why would you think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that, Mr. Fisher?  I mean, there -- in this statute, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are loads of cross-references.  And this one is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a cross-reference.  So doesn't that tell us 

   

  

 

 

 

 

something? 

            

MR. FISHER:  It's -- it's -- it's a canon, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan.  I -- I will concede that.  But the --

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the immigration defense brief at page 13 posits a theory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to why Congress may not have included a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross-reference here where it did other places, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to do with the jurisdictional nature of the element 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Federal crime. 

 

 

 

            

But even if you set that aside, what you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have is one canon, and you have other canons and another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

canon that's very strong through the Court's cases.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when Congress uses the identical phrase multiple places 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the same legislation, we assume it meant the same

thing. 

            

And so that would be my argument, primarily, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

as to why Congress here may well have been thinking of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2243.  But as I was just describing to Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy, this is the easy case.  This is the case where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2243 and the State multi-jurisdictional survey 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plus the Model Penal Code leads you to the exact same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place.  So it's enough in this case to say, at least 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where those two things line up, it is certainly the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress would not have been intending to sweep in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a State statute like the one involved here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You can leave for another day what might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen in a hypothetical statute like Justice Kennedy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

described, or even on this statute if you had a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation where states covered certain conduct and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated it as abuse that falls outside of Section 2243. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do we do with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chevron if we think it's ambiguous? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  So --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And it's not clear? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  If you think -- I want to make 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure I understand the question.  If you think that the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

text is not clear for the reasons I've described so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

far --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.

the traditional Chevron reasonableness questions.  And

ambiguity. 

            

The Solicitor General acknowledges at 

 

 

 

 

page 42 of its brief that other clear statement rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, of course, juris prudence, like the presumption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against preemption, the presumption against 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity, come before you get to agency deference. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Likewise here, there are two such canons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One is the rule of lenity, which Justice Alito 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned.  And we think for the reasons in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thompson-Center Arms Company and more recently in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Abramski case, you have the separation of powers problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by deferring on Chevron grounds to a statute like this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one that applies both in the civil and criminal realm. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And, secondly, even if you set that aside --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I think that was Justice Alito's hypothetical --

then you'd have the -- the long-standing rule on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration law, which predates Chevron by decades, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says deportation statutes, if they're ambiguous, should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be construed in the favor of the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but we've 

  

 

 

 

 

always said, though, that the rule of lenity, or at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least most often said that the rule of lenity is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something you apply when you've already exhausted the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normal tools of statutory interpretation.  So why is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order of a battle the other way around?  Why do you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply the rule of lenity before you get to Chevron? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think you've said more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

or less the same thing in the Chevron context, Mr. Chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice.  And the two things that I would cite to you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are, first, the Thompson-Center Arms Company case where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court said, we have an ambiguous statute, and now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're going to turn to lenity, not to Chevron.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why is because in Chevron itself, the Court said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you exhaust all traditional canons because you assume 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress legislated against those canons.  There is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

more traditional canon of construction than the criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule of lenity. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I --

   

  

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  I --

    

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- I don't know how 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the two of them can coexist.  I mean, on the one hand, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

you have in Chevron, you give the agency the broadest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible deference to interpret an ambiguous provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And in the rule of lenity, you say, well, if it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous, you don't apply it as strictly as -- as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government may be arguing.  They each point in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite direction based on the same predicate, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a degree of ambiguity in the statutory provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  I think that premise is 

    

 

 

 

 

correct.  And I think the Abramski case, from just a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of terms ago, answers that problem by saying it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be a separation of powers violation to let the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executive define -- define criminal statutes.  Remember, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are you suggesting, 

  

 

 

 

Mr. Fisher, that if we turn Chevron off, we have to turn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lenity on?  Couldn't there be a middle ground between 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the two; in other words, some space where you say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of this -- the -- the criminal application of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this statute, we don't apply ordinary Chevron deference, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but at the same time, we don't go straight into the kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of grievous ambiguity that -- that triggers lenity? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's some middle area where the Court gets to decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just what is -- it thinks is the best construction of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute?

MR. FISHER:  It's hard for me to imagine 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly how that works, but I'm happy with the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It works -- it works, if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that ambiguity doesn't necessarily mean the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing for Chevron purposes and for lenity purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  I would --

    

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The lenity purposes really 

  

 

 

 

 

demands grievous ambiguity, and but there's some sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in which there's -- there's a of lack clarity, a lack of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear meaning that allows the Court to decide what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best interpretation of the language is. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  So if that were the situation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, what I would tell the Court is when you do that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

job as a court, you should take into account for any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity the rule against construing deportation 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes against noncitizens.  And, more generally, what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you should --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't really understand 

    

 

 

 

that -- that canon, because that canon would suggest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we never give the BIA deference as to its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of this statute.  And, in fact, when it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes to noncriminal things, we give the BIA very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial deference. 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  You have in other parts of the

INA in terms of construing what an aggravated felony is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for purposes of deportation.  And in the same sphere, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court said that that canon applied in -- with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to, quote, deportation statutes.  But even if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you set that aside and just -- I'd be more than happy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the Court simply to ask what the best reading of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this statute is on its own terms. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I take you back to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the -- the argument that Chevron isn't appropriate here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the definition applies in both the criminal and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the civil context?  And that was the point that Judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sutton made in his dissent, and it has kind of a -- it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an appealing argument when you say it fast.  But the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more I think of it, the less sense --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- the less sense it makes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now suppose that a -- there's an ambiguous 

   

 

 

 

 

 

phrase in an immigration statute, and it applies only in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the civil -- it applies only in immigration and has no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal -- has no criminal applications.  And suppose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in that situation it would be appropriate to use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chevron, okay, and then later Congress uses the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase in a criminal statute. 

   

 

 

                         

Does that mean that the Chevron 

 

 

 

 

 

deference that was applied in the civil -- previously in

MR. FISHER:  I think it --

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I don't see anything 

    

   

 

 

 

odd about having the same phrase interpreted using a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different methodology in a civil case and in a criminal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

MR. FISHER:  I think it would go away and, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito, I just cite this Court's case law to you. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clark against Martinez is the foremost example, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's Thompson Center Arms Company.  There are decades 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ago, FCC against ABC, and the Court has said over and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over again that statutes are not chameleons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well -- but I would like to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

know why it makes sense, so something other than a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citation of cases, why would Chevron deference be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate up to the point where Congress decides to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use the same phrase in a criminal statute and then it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disappears. 

            

MR. FISHER:  Because it would violate the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

separation of powers.  Congress creates --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How does -- I -- I --

MR. FISHER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- car repairs, that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the dispute. 

 

            

In that Act, a willful violation can be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

criminally prosecuted.  And yet we gave -- we talked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about Chevron as applying to that act and the board's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation and sent it back for the board to give us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a proper reading of the statute or explain its reading. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

How many statutes, administrative statutes 

 

 

 

 

today, don't include a criminal sanction? 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  It's --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- in part or in whole? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Almost all of them do.  So where would Chevron be then? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  I'm not sure empirically that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

correct.  I think it's more of an unusual situation, but 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's what I would say about the kinds of cases I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're thinking of, Justice Sotomayor, where the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't even thought about this issue, and the reason why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is because in those cases Congress has made it a crime 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to violate a regulation issued by whatever agency has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

control over that statute.  So there Congress has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined the crime, which is violating a regulation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But --

  

 

 

MR. FISHER:  Here --

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- most of the 

  

 

 

 

 

regulations are interpretations of the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  That's right, but Congress has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

created the crime of violating the regulation.  Just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like if Congress says it's a crime to violate a court 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

order and the court issues an order, the court isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creating criminal law.  Congress did. 

  

 

 

 

              

I don't want to hang my whole case on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chevron question. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but it is -- but it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why I think people are discussing it and I may have --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't have to accept my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

view.  My -- I may be the only one with this view, but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- and I'm curious to know what you actually think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it.  You have cases here a lot. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

Chevron is not the tax code.  We are not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is not a rule of tax law.  It is a general kind of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard which has judges asking what Congress would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have thought about a question they never thought about, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is what kind of deference should a court give to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an agency interpretation, and the answer will vary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depending upon statute. 

 

 

              

I would not even give you this lecture were

view into its opinion in Mead, which I think is pretty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good law.  And so if you're asking the question what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would a reasonable legislature think about that 

   

 

 

 

 

question, which he never thought of, it's surprising to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me that he would think prosecutors should have deference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to what the statute that they are prosecuting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody under means.  I would find that surprising. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

              

I would find surprising some aspects of 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration law where the result is just about as bad. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The result is they leave without any discretion to keep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them here.  And then I'd proceed case by case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But I'm not asking what I think.  I already 

    

   

 

 

 

 

know.  I want to know what you think. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  What -- what I think and what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're asking for today, if the Court reached the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, is for a very small exception to Chevron.  A 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

carveout to the extent it doesn't already exist in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's law.  I think it already does exist, but if it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't, it should, and that is where a statute has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal applications and Congress has not delegated to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the agency the authority to create crimes through its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own regulatory process, Chevron is off limits.  It would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be very, very hard --

still having a problem as to why that distinction is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

meaningful. 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  The reason --

  

 

 

 

19 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I -- most of the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

crimes that are -- are set out in regulation almost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

largely parrot the statutory language.  And then explain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the agency means and it makes it a crime to violate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the regulation which is really the statute.  So it's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction without meaning for me. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  So two -- so two things about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that situation, Justice Sotomayor.  The first is, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're just parroting the statutory language you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need Chevron at all, and the second answer is, if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get to -- the only thing that matters is where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency is reading a statute under Chevron in a way that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not the better reading.  And in that situation almost 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all the --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's if its 

  

 

 

 

 

reading unreasonable. 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Almost all -- that's right. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Almost all the examples you're thinking of are ones 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where Congress has delegated the authority to create 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes through the regulatory process. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, you don't have to reach that question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case.  For all the reasons I started with, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute is unambiguously clear as the question presented

in this case.  The California statute falls far outside 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

of what Federal law, the sweep of State laws, the amount 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of penal code define sexual abuse of a minor. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Even if you were going to ask the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the traditional lens of Chevron, was the BIA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis reasonable, here I think it's helpful to point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

out a few things.  First is, the BIA in its definition 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of sexual abuse of a minor looked to a different Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, Section 3509, which is a State -- which is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section about witness testimony.  This goes back to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rodriguez-Rodriguez case in 1999. 

 

 

 

            

The Solicitor General no longer defends that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis, so the core of the BIA's reasoning that led it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to where we are today is something that is not being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defended anymore in this Court.  So that's the first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing. 

            

The second thing is the BIA totally ignored 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State by State sweep, just saying that the lack of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition isn't enough in the statute itself, but that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

runs directly into the Taylor case, into Duenas-Alvarez, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into all the other categorical approach cases where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has said to -- to define a -- a generic crime, you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start and see if there's an express definition, but if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there isn't that's when you do multi-jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surveys.

The other reason --

 

 

 

21 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Multi-jurisdictional 

 

 

survey would yield age 16? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Justice Ginsburg, there are 

  

 

 

 

 

two -- there would be two possible answers to your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multi-jurisdictional survey.  The first and the easiest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer is that any State statute like California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creating a -- a -- an 18 age of consent with a minor age 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differential, a very small age differential, would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

well outside of the mainstream and 43 states do not even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminalize the conduct at issue here, let alone make it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a serious crime. 

 

 

            

Remember, we're asking at the end of the day 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether something's an aggravated felony, not just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's criminal.  You have an extraordinary case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here where the -- where the government is trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deport somebody for committing something that isn't even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a crime under Federal and the vast majority of states. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And, Justice Ginsburg, the second answer 

 

 

 

 

 

about a multi-jurisdiction -- jurisdictional survey, if 

   

 

 

 

 

you wanted to give more guidance or felt like the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor General's argument did a more comprehensive 

   

 

 

 

 

definition is necessary was correct, would be the one I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

started with and I talked to Justice Kagan about, which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be, when you're dealing with an allegation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

abuse based on the ages alone, that 16 is the age of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

consent and that is found in Federal law, it's found in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the modal Penal Code, it's found in the sweep of State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws. 

            

And, Justice, this is what Judge Wilkinson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did for the Fourth Circuit in Rangel-Castenada which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited in our briefs and we think that decision is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct. 

            

Even if what you did what the Solicitor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General asked you to do, which is ignore all of that and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply pick up Black's Law Dictionary, as we've shown in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our reply brief you end up in the same place, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Black's Law Dictionary, when it defines sexual abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says that it -- we're talking about illegal sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity.  And to define what is illegal you have to ask 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the age of consent is, and when you look in Black's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Law Dictionary, for the age of consent in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation, you find the number 16. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So this is, again, the very easy case where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all roads are going to lead you to the same place.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have any of the interpretative difficulties of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical approach that you normally have. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In fact, there's one other way where this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an easier case than almost all categorical approaches 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases that you see.  And that's because the consequences

here are so benign. 

 

 

 

23 

            

The ordinary categorical approach situation 

 

 

 

 

involves a scenario, I think, where what a court is 

   

   

   

 

 

 

sometimes worried about is that by virtue of the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

methodology there would be some State statutes that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a little bit overbroad and that people have done some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very bad things that the Federal law would consider to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be aggravated felonies are going to get the benefit of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way the categorical approach works and not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to automatic removal. 

 

 

 

            

And here that problem is taken care of in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State laws like -- in the states like California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that have laws that reach up to 18, because as we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shown in Footnote 1 of our reply brief, all of those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

states have other statutory provisions that are in line 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the Federal law or very close to it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So really, all you are dealing with this in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case is a few outlier -- there's actually seven 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outlier statutes that go further than the Federal aw, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that have backup provisions that are going to still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow the Federal government to seek automatic removal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or some other immigration remedy against people that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commit sexual offenses against minors. 

 

 

 

 

            

Remember, the core -- the core of sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse of a minor, I think, are things like child 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

molestation and other really horrible things that nobody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

is even talking about here.  The only issue in this case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is how it applies to offenses like statutory rape.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we think, working your way up to the Federal definition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of statutory rape, when age alone is the only thing that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justifies an allegation of abuse is the right way to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve that case and not go any further. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Federal government's definition, as I 

 

 

 

 

 

point out one more thing about it, it doesn't even track 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the BIA.  It's the Federal government's position, at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

least as I understand it, is that any sexual activity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's illegal is sexual abuse of a minor, as long as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the younger participant is under 18. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So under the Federal government's view, as I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand it, the two States that criminalize sex 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between two 17-year-olds would constitute an aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony.  Even though only two States do it, even though 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is not commonly thought of in this country as abuse, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and even though it's a misdemeanor in both of those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations.  That's an extraordinary request out of this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court, and we think goes far, far, far beyond what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress might have imagined when it was creating sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse of a minor subcategory. 

   

 

 

            

If there are any other questions about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presentation I've made thus far, I'm happy to answer

them.  Otherwise, I'd like to reserve the remainder of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

my time. 

 

            

Mr. Kedem. 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

              

              

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM 

 

 

 

 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

Congress has charged the Attorney General 

 

 

 

 

 

with responsibility to administer the INA to conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal proceedings and to render controlling 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretations of the statute within those proceedings. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In this case, the Board of Immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appeals exercised that authority in a manner both 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable and consistent with the statute, and for that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason, should be afforded deference.  I think perhaps a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

good place to begin is where Petitioner's counsel began, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the idea of multi-jurisdictional surveys. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First of all, by my count, there are roughly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 cases in which this Court, under the categorical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach, was called upon to define or give meaning to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal provision so that the categorical approach could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be applied to it. 

 

 

 

            

In only two of those cases, Taylor and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Duenas-Alverez, has the Court relied on something that

could be compared to a multi-jurisdictional survey.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

26 

all of the other cases, the Court either didn't look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multi-jurisdictional surveys at all or, as in Johnson, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically specifically rejected the relevance of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multi-jurisdictional surveys, saying that they would 

 

 

 

 

 

shed no light on the central inquiry. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Kedem, you don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

disagree, do you, with the premise that the first thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we should do is to define the generic crime; is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that right? 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's correct.  That's what we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

consider to be step one of the categorical approach. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So you say that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

step one.  And then you say, well, you define 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the generic -- in this case you say the generic crime is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever is illegal under State law.  That's one of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your --

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's the first argument that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we make in our brief. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  So that seems to be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

like just not what generic crimes are. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  In other words, you're just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying, well, it's whatever the States consider illegal, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the whole idea of a generic crime is that it's not

just anything that's illegal, it's the prototypical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

case, even though that differs from what some States do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  Sure.  A -- a couple responses. 

    

   

  

 

 

First of all, it's certainly not whatever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States make illegal.  It still has to have sexual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

content that's directed at a minor; namely, someone 

   

 

 

 

 

 

under the age of 18. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  But you're carving out 

  

  

 

 

 

 

one element, which is the age element --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- and saying whatever a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State does goes.  So I thought that that was sort of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

antithesis of the generic offense approach. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I think not, because what we're 

    

 

 

 

 

 

dealing here is not one crime.  What we're dealing here

applies to several different categories of crime. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think it's maybe most analogous to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's Kawashima case in which the Court was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting a provision of the INA's aggravated felony 

   

 

 

 

 

 

definition, which didn't have a cross reference, 

   

 

 

 

 

offenses involving fraud or deceit, which are sort of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broad category of different types of crimes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And to figure out what that means, the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not look to a multi-jurisdictional survey.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

looked to the dictionary, to the context of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision, to what it understood to be the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of the provision and came up with a definition. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now -- now, it looked to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal law itself 2243(a).  We're told that, in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final form, it's the same here as -- as this provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The same term, sexual 

  

 

 

 

 

abuse of a minor. 

   

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  A couple -- couple of thoughts 

    

 

 

 

 

 

about that provision. 

 

 

            

First of all, it was adopted more than a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decade before the term "sexual abuse of a minor" was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

added to the INA's definition of aggravated felony.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been amended a number of times, both before and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after the amendment that added the aggravated felony of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual abuse of a minor. 

   

 

 

            

And the courts did not do what it did in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number of other provisions, which is to include a cross 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference.  So if anything, I think the inference is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that it did not want to tie the definition of sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse of a minor to that provision. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And Petitioner --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you think of a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

definition from -- from an evidentiary statute, a

statute designed to protect children who testify in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  That seems a lot less close than 2243. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

29 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So I -- I don't think it's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

accurate to characterize the board's decision as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treating that as the definition. 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think if you look at the board's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion, what it said is that is a pretty common-sense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition for the type of activity that might be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered.  But it didn't otherwise rely on it.  And the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board's decision below relied instead on a practical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

construction of the word "abuse," the sort of intuition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there are certain types of activity that, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though they are ostensibly consensual, nevertheless, 

 

 

 

 

 

they contain the potential for harm or risk because of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something about the relationship between the parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved, either the ages of the parties involved, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there's a familial relationship; for instance, 

   

 

 

 

 

parent/child, or there's a relationship of authority or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

trust, something like a student/teacher. 

   

 

 

            

And what it said is when there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaningful age difference, such that the perpetrator and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victim are not in the same age group, as a result of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, the victim may not be able to advocate for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves, they may not be able to protect themselves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against certain risks, things like pregnancy or

sexually-transmitted diseases.  And that was the basis. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why isn't an 18-year-old 

  

 

 

 

 

30 

in the same age group as a 21-year-old? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I don't think we're dealing with 

    

 

 

 

 

 

18-year-olds.  I think in all instances we're talking 

    

 

 

 

 

 

about people under the age of 18. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

What the -- the board said --

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's really like a freshman 

   

  

 

 

 

in college going out with a junior in college. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  It is true that sometimes there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are 17-year-olds who are in college.  That's certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not the typical instance. 

 

 

 

              

I think, to a certain extent, we're dealing 

   

 

 

 

 

with a little bit of arbitrariness, no matter where you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draw the line.  But if you draw the line, as the Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense does, you essentially rule out statutes in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost all of the 50 States because, first of all, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are 19 States that set the age of consent either at 18 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or at 17.  So you'd be ruling them -- them out.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most of the remaining ones set the age differential at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something less than four years. 

 

 

 

 

            

And that's before you get into questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about things like what about the mens rea?  Do you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to know that the victim was of a certain age.

which I agree.  But do I understand the situation 

   

   

  

 

 

 

31 

correctly?  In mid 1990s, Congress passed a law in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

immigration statute, which is this 1101(a)(43), which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lists about 30 or 40 crimes.  And it says if the person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has committed one of those, goodbye, and the Attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General can't stop it; is that right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  It's right with this one caveat, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is that the definition of aggravated felony 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually came much earlier and has been amended a number 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of times. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But what happened at that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

time is they stuck in the words "sexual abuse of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor." 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  When they stuck in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

those words in this long list of crimes, some of which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have cross references and some of which, like in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very section, murder, rape, deceit, et cetera, do not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At the time they did that, in 1996 -- I think it was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

'96, or maybe '95 -- there was on the books a Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute which had been passed in 1986.  And that Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, by some amazing coincidence, which was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal law, is entitled sexual abuse of a minor.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then it has a definition. 

   

 

 

            

So why not?  And think when they use the

same word to do about the same thing, list a crime, they

meant to pick up the same definition, QED.  End of case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All right?  Now, why not? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  First of all, if they intended 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do so, it would have been very easy to do what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've done in other provisions, which is to include a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross reference. 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oddly enough --

  

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  At least --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- I can list 10 or 15, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

including deceit, rape, murder, a whole bunch in this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute --

 

            

            

references. 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Even Petitioner --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- which don't use cross 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  Even Petitioner does not claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that sexual abuse of a minor is defined entirely by the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bounds of the Federal provision.  And they couldn't, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it would lead to some absurd results. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

For instance, almost all States now, as they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did in 1996, have statutes dealing with sexual offenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are offenses because of a familial relationship, or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a relationship of trust or authority, such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

student/teacher.  None of those offenses are picked up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the Federal provision.  And so you'd be disqualifying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

those as well. 

 

 

33 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kedem, you have here --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have a federal statute.  You have the Model Penal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Code, which goes the same way.  You have 30-plus State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws.  So at the least, am I right that -- that you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concede that you can't win unless Chevron applies; is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that correct? 

 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  No, certainly not. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You think it's unambiguous, 

  

 

 

 

 

this kind of pragmatic construction about -- what did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you say -- like power differentials --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  No, no.  I'm sorry.  I didn't 

    

  

  

 

 

 

mean to suggest that we would win because it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unambiguous that it means only the government's first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  The point is simply that if you're going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret the words that Congress wrote, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation that we put forward, we think, is a much 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more meaningful one than the one that Petitioners put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward, to the extent that they even offer any.

the clearly better reading to go -- to -- to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding the Federal statute, notwithstanding

three-year differential? 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So I think I would just step 

   

   

  

 

 

 

back to say that when this Court is giving content to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal provision of the first step of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical approach, it is engaging in a normal case of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory interpretation which brings to bear --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I'm asking --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  -- all of the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- about normal statutory 

  

 

 

 

 

interpretation. 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  The normal --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The normal statutory 

  

 

 

 

interpretation get you to think that out of, like -- out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of our heads pops 18 plus a three-year differential --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I see.  So now you're asking 

    

  

 

 

 

 

about the board's interpretation. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- looking at -- as opposed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to looking at 30-plus States, the Model Penal Code, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal statute, which all define it differently. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Sure.  So, first with respect to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

all the different State laws, even in the two cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the categorical approach where this Court has

Missouri law would have been criminal under the penal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

codes of 50 different States.  And I think State surveys 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be relevant only insofar as you think that they will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell you something about the words that Congress used. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And this quest for the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor seems to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me to be a -- a meaningless quest.  There's no "there" 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

there.  It's not like burglary where there's a common 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

law definition.  You've got some core.  This is a phrase 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that doesn't have a common law counterpart.  And if you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at all these State statutes and throw in all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal statutes that you can find that have some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relation to this, what you have is a -- a big array of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very disparate statutes. 

 

 

            

So this seems to me like a classic example 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Congress saying, we have this category sexual abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a minor, and we know that there's all this array of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State laws.  And so you, Attorney General, define what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be within this for immigration purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  We agree with that, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alito.  Before we turn to issues of Chevron and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference in general, I'd like to just identify --

be done is to define a generic offense. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So Justice Alito was 

  

 

 

 

 

suggesting that, in this case, we shouldn't do that at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all.  So you disagree there.  And then Justice Alito 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, in this case you just have to think like, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does the BIA think about this? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you said to me, even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

without deference, you win.  So -- so you're taking a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very different view than Justice Alito is.  You're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that what the BIA interpretation was is the best 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding of the generic offense. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So maybe the best way to answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that question is to describe what the government thinks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the relationship between the two arguments that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make in the brief. 

 

 

 

            

The term "sexual abuse of a minor" would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

naturally support the interpretation that we offer in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first section of our brief to cover all sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity directed at a minor under the age of 18 years 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

old.  However, the board has chosen a more modest

interpretation based on a practical construction of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

37 

word "abuse."  And because the board exercises the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Attorney General's authority to interpret and give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning to the statute, because it chose a definition 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is both reasonable and consistent with the statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court should defer because that is what Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted.  And so you are giving effect to what Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has intended when you defer to the board. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about an 

  

 

 

 

 

application --

 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  But because --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about 

  

 

 

 

application of the rule of lenity? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So I think application of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

rule of lenity does coexist with Chevron in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following sense:  I think, first of all, before the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

board, the board has recognized that lenity can come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into play, but it has conceived of it in the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited way that this Court has; namely, that you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply lenity simply because the statute can be read in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than one way.  You apply it only when, after trying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything else, you simply have to throw up your hands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because you cannot figure out what Congress wanted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is a grievous ambiguity that simply cannot be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you necessarily 

  

 

 

 

 

38 

apply Chevron before you apply the rule of lenity? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I think -- I think that you do, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

but I think there's still work for lenity to do even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after applying Chevron.  Certainly, if the board has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

spoken to the precise question at issue, then I think it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be hard for you to be left at the end of the day 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after giving that deference where it's a grievous 

   

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity.  But often agencies speak only to a related 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

question or fill only part of a statutory gap, in which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case after giving appropriate deference to that answer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you would still possibly be left with a different aspect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the problem that you simply cannot resolve, in which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case lenity would apply. 

 

 

 

            

But we don't think it makes sense to apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lenity at the first step of the -- at the first step of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chevron, because at that step, the Court is asking, are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the words sufficiently clear that there's really only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one way to read them?  And it doesn't make sense to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply a tie-breaking canon that says you only come into 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

play at the end of the process after you simply cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure out what the words mean at all.  And certainly, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court has never applied lenity in that way --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I can understand Chevron

in regulating the environment or the forest service or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fisheries or nuclear power.  Why does the INS have any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expertise in determining the meaning of a criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

39 

statute? 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So, first of all, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy, I think it's important to orient ourselves 

   

 

 

 

 

 

around the fact that this is a civil statute that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being applied in a civil context.  But I do agree with 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

your point that it's not as if the agency can read a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dictionary or look at legislative history any better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than any -- any courts certainly.  And that's true of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies generally. 

 

            

But when the agencies give meaning to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, they bring to bear practical wisdom and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience in ways that are important.  And, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance, in this case, the Board of Immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appeals, first of all, decided that because there are so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many -- so much variation among the different State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses that are involved here, it made sense to apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an incremental approach to engage in case-by-case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication rather than trying to cover the waterfront. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why is INS in any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

better position to make that determination than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American Bar Association or the forest service? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So I think that the board

exercises delegated authority from the Attorney General, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who is administering the scheme in an administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity.  And I think to a certain extent talking about 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Chevron deference, while accurate, is actually a little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

bit misleading.  Because often when we're talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chevron, we're talking about the concept that when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress gives an agency the power to engage in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulemaking or formal adjudication, we basically assume 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that power comes along with the ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret the statute. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What he's saying -- I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

what the question is, is this:  There are many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies -- Social Security -- that have statutes that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are incredibly detailed and have to do rather directly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with how this program is being administered. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And they see some words 

  

 

 

 

 

 

over here in Part 1 on page 3860.  And they know, but we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't know, that if you interpret it one way rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than another, it's going to be much harder to do the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing as a practical matter that they have over there on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 842.  All right?  They'll know that; we won't know. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But you've just listed 

  

 

 

 

 

things that we seem to be able to know just as well as

they. 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So, Justice Breyer, one thing to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

keep in mind is that the aggravated felony definition is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a spine that runs throughout the INA and determines a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole range of administrative consequences, not merely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether a person is removable, but whether they're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

eligible, for instance, for cancelation of removal --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MR. KEDEM:  -- asylum, certain detention 

  

 

 

 

 

consequences, voluntary departure, readmission. 

 

 

 

            

And in this case we're dealing with a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delegation of interpretive authority that is not merely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicit in the sort of general sense Chevron talks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it, but an express provision 8 U.S.C. 1103(a), 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which says that the Attorney General not only gets to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct removal proceedings, but gets to render 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretations in those proceedings that are, quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"controlling."  And this Court has relied in cases like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Aguirre-Aguirre and Negusie on that fact. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So was there 

  

  

 

 

 

anything else?  Because what I asked -- I wanted my 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

first question, which you probably don't remember now. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But -- but I wanted to know why don't just look at 1143, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the end of it; okay?

JUSTICE BREYER:  And you said one, because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

42 

there's no cross-reference, so I got that one.  You said 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

two --

 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  Two --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it would be because if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you go read the thing, 1140 -- is it 1143 or whatever --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2243 --

 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- if I go read that, I'll 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

see that there are things that couldn't possibly apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That was your second.  And I think you were going to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make a third.  Was there a third? I want to know --

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So if there was a third, it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

might have been that a 16-year age of consent and 4-year 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

age differential would disqualify statutes from most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States.  Certainly, all of the States that set a higher 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

age of consent, but a number of the other States as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well. 

            

If I could return just briefly to basically 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the questions I've gotten about whether this statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to be a bit of an outlier and why not just rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out this statute.  I think there are a few really 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

serious problems with that. 

 

 

 

            

The first is that it would leave very patchy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and meager coverage because most State statutes are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

continuous.  Meaning that they don't have one provision 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

for 13-year-old minors, a different one for 14-year-old 

   

 

 

 

 

 

minors, and so on and so forth.  They tend to clump them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into age ranges.  And Arizona is a good example of this. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Arizona has one provision that covers minors' ages 15 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and up; a different provision that covers minors 14 and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below.  If this Court were to say that the 15 and up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision is disqualified because it applies to 16 and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17-year-olds or because it has a 2-year age 

   

 

 

 

 

 

differential, that would leave only the 14 and below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision, which means that a 15-year-old minor would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

get no coverage regardless of the age of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perpetrator.  And it's not alone.  There are other State 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes that are just like that; Virginia, North 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dakota. 

            

Second of all, it's actually quite --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that's a good 

   

  

 

 

reason to look at to 2243. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Well, 2243 would disqualify even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

more because, again, it requires a 16-year-old age of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent, a 4-year age differential, and it includes a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable mistake of age defense that most States don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have. 

              

I think it's also actually quite difficult 

 

 

 

 

 

to determine what is or isn't an outlier.  First of all,

because State statutes differ on a range of different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories simultaneously.  We've focused on four of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

them; the age of the victim, the perpetrator, the age 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differential, and the offense conduct.  But, again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's a mens rea requirement that some States have and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other States don't.  Some require an element of sexual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gratification that other States do not. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Moreover, it's difficult enough when you're 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about current State statutes.  You have to go to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of the criminal -- go through all of the criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

code of Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, and so on and so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forth, and that's difficult because States don't label 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these crimes the same way.  But it's possible because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all States currently put those online. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But as Petitioner has conceded, we're 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about State codes as they existed in 1996, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means to do that, you really have to go to the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

books.  And Petitioner himself, for all his talk about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how this is the required methodology, hasn't even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performed that task for the statutes as they existed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1996. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's one question 

  

 

 

 

about your interpretation.  You interpret the word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"abusive" to mean illegal.

argument that the government makes.  It's -- it's -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term is not just abusive, it's sexual abuse, which has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its own definition under the dictionary and its own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood meaning. 

 

45 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And -- and you -- but you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that sexual abuse means illegal sexual contact. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Illegal sexual conduct, usually, 

  

 

 

 

 

and the word "minor" added to the statutory provision, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of reinforces that we're just talking about minors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

So, in addition to the problems that I've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just been discussing with this multi-jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

survey and looking for outliers, it would also pull the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court into a number of very difficult line-drawing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

problems.  For instance, what's the right numerical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

threshold?  Is it 50 percent?  Two-thirds? 

  

  

 

 

 

Three-quarters?  Something else? 

  

 

            

You also have to figure out how to deal with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State populations.  Seems somewhat anomalous to treat 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Wyoming's statute exactly the same as California's, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though California's statute applies to more than 50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times the population. 

 

 

            

You also have to figure out how to deal with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defenses, the element of sexual gratification that some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States have and other things.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Mr. Kedem, Mr. Fisher 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said and I just want to make sure that this is right, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you no longer rely on the statute that the BIA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relied on; is that correct? 

 

 

 

 

46 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I think -- I think the BIA 

    

   

 

 

 

 

itself relied on it only in a very general way.  If you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read the decision below --

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So the answer is no. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

So what -- what do you rely on?  What are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the sources that you rely on to generate this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition?  Because you're not relying on the Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  You're not relying on the most common State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes.  You're not relying on the other Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute that the BIA relied on.  What are you relying on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to generate this definition? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So we treat this as an ordinary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case of statutory interpretation.  We rely --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm asking for ordinary --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  We -- we rely on the dictionary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitions --

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The term --

  

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  -- the legislative history.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

rely on context of the provisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So the -- the dictionary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

definition that you pull out is illegal sex acts

MR. KEDEM:  That is. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  But you're not using

that right? 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  No, that's not right.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

doesn't apply in this case because we're dealing with a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subset of those offenses just dealing with someone who's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a different age, but we would also think that it applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to familial relationship offenses and I -- and I --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no, no, no.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

this -- this limits it to those relationships. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I -- I --

    

   

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's what this does --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's right.  It included -- it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

included an acquaintance, which I'm pretty sure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner would have been in relation to his girlfriend

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Anything else? 

  

  

 

 

Dictionary definition.  What else? 

  

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  We point to legislative history, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which is relatively sparse, but I think it strongly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicates that Congress wanted to get a lot tougher on

INA provisions talk about minors as being people under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the age of 18. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What are -- what are those? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  So we cite two of them in -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- in this -- in our brief.  I don't have the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citations at -- at my fingertips.  There are provisions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing with different things, but they both said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the word "minor" --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  One -- one's -- one deals 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the rights of child witnesses.  The other is a rule 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for calculating the duration of unlawful presence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are those the two? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  Those are two. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So those two, which really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have nothing to do with the generic meaning of sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse of a minor. 

   

 

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  A single dictionary -- a 

    

 

 

 

 

single dictionary definition, and some legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

history that even you indicate is sparse. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I -- I think that that's 

    

   

 

 

 

accurate.  But if the Court engages in ordinary tools of

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it your understanding 

  

 

 

 

 

49 

anything other than -- if a stranger does anything to a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor other than commit a rape, then that would not be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual abuse of a minor because the person wouldn't be a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relative or an acquaintance? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I'm -- I'm not -- I'm not sure I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand the question. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought your definition 

    

 

 

 

was it had to be a relative -- parent, relative, or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquaintance; is that right? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I think those are probably what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

it targets.  I'm -- I'm not sure that -- I would say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if somebody isn't an acquaintance, it -- it doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

count. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If -- of course.  If

them and -- and gets the person drunk and they go home

MR. KEDEM:  But if --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Unless everyone is. 

  

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  If -- if I could turn to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of deference in this case.  I think Petitioner 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

often raises separation of powers concerns but doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually explain why those come into play in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance.  And I think -- let me give you the sort of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrinal response that the government has and then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of more general response. 

 

 

 

 

            

The narrow doctrinal response is that for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than 100 years, this Court has upheld the statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schemes that impose criminal consequences on decisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are made by administrative agencies.  Now, it may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be that there are concerns under that about notice or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns about delegation concerns, but Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

himself obviously has no notice problems here given that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're talking about a core administration in the civil 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme, and that any criminal conduct that he might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engage in in the future, he would have very clear notice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that his prior State offense was an aggravated felony. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Perhaps there would be someone in some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical case who engaged in the offense conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the board rendered its authoritative 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation, and maybe they would have an as-applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

51 

due process challenge, but apart from that, we're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aware of notice concerns ever coming into play. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Don't you have the 

  

 

 

 

 

problem that somebody in another State that did the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing that this defendant was -- this person was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted of would be no crime in another State? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. KEDEM:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So --

  

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  That -- that's true whenever you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the categorical approach.  So, for instance, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kawashima, this Court dealt with a provision covering 

   

 

 

 

 

 

offenses involving fraud or deceit.  It may be that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are certain of those offenses that apply to -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one State that don't apply in another State, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just a feature of the categorical approach. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

I also think there are a number of features 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of this case that distinguish it from maybe some of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more problematic criminal applications that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might have in mind. 

 

 

 

            

First of all, we're talking about a core INA 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision.  So if you're talking about which is the tail 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and which is the dog, in this case, the civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application is very much the dog.  It is applied civilly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousands of times a year.  The number of applications 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in the criminal context is vanishingly small.

52 

            

Second of all -- second of all, we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking here about an explicit delegation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretive authority, which is actually quite rare. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is rare that Congress says that an agency explicitly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets to render controlling interpretations of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

Furthermore, we're talking about only 

 

 

 

 

instances of further culpable conduct.  It is not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of the board's decision alone that gets you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into criminal trouble.  You have to engage in further 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct, and that conduct has its own culpability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And, finally, all of the potential criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences that we're talking about, these three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes, are ones that come for people who are trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to violate and frustrate the civil scheme. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So Section 1253 talks about people who are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordered to be removed but refuse to comply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Section 1326 talks about people who have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been removed but then try illegally to reenter the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country. 

            

And 1327 applies to people who try and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegally assist others who are entering the country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so they are all directed at frustration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the core civil scheme.  So that would be another way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to distinguish this case from other, more problematic

instances. 

            

Finally, I think part of what the Court is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

53 

reacting to, again, is the idea that drawing a line is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very difficult, and it's something that will be a little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bit arbitrary no matter what.  I think that's a strong 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

reason to defer to the board, because administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies are actually quite good at drawing these sorts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of lines.  And conversely, they're sort of problematic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for courts to do it. 

 

 

 

 

            

And there's a layer of political 

   

 

 

 

accountability that comes along when an agency does it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because if the agency puts the -- the line in the wrong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place, if they make it too strenuous or too lenient, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then they can be held accountable for that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

If the Court has no further questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Thank you.  I'd like to cover 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

seven -- I'm sorry -- four topics. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Four topics. 

  

 

 

First, as to multi-jurisdictional surveys, 

 

 

 

 

the cases the government talks about where the Court has

not conducted those kinds of surveys are cases where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

Court did not have to define a generic offense.  The two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases that the Court has had to do that are Taylor and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Duenas-Alvarez.  And in both cases, they looked to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court looked to multi-jurisdictional surveys. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And it's especially surprising to see the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government here criticizing multi-jurisdictional surveys 

 

 

 

 

because that's precisely the approach the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked this Court to adopt in Duenas-Alvarez.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court did, unanimously. 

 

 

            

If I -- if I could just read one sentence of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that opinion, because it's not just a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multi-jurisdictional analysis, but it's conducting it in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the precise manner we asked the Court to conduct it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

The Court says at page 191, "To succeed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Deunas-Alvarez must show something special about 

 

 

 

 

 

California's version of the statute" -- that was a theft 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute -- "that criminalizes conduct that other States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not consider illegal." 

 

 

 

            

That's the question the Court posed at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's behest and answered in Duenas-Alvarez, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the question we ask the Court to ask and answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here today.  And for good reason. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

You don't just -- you need to have something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

that's replicable and something that's objective when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you confront a provision that doesn't have an express 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

definition. 

            

Imagine the person in his lawyer's office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, should I plead guilty to this crime or the other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime?  Which one is going to render me deportable?  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't imagine a defendant's lawyer conducting his 

   

 

 

 

 

Padilla duties, and having to imagine what the BIA might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come up with when it surveys family planning journals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from 20 years ago and imagines the kinds of things the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor General was describing.  And so there are good 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instrumental reasons for using multi-jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

surveys. 

            

Finally, if you did end up in a situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Solicitor General would like you to believe exists 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, but we think doesn't, but if there were a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation where you just had a scatter plot among the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States, and it were too difficult to find any common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

core, what you would do in that situation is what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit, in a leading opinion by Judge Kozinski 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

did in a case called Anderson, which is revert back to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal statute, defining that Federal offense, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime itself, where Congress acted like a criminal law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

maker and said, here's what we want to cover. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second, as to the topic of ruling out some

56 

State statutes, depending on what rule the Court would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopt here.  We say, for the reasons in Footnote 1 of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our reply brief, that you actually don't have a serious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem with overinclusiveness, because, yes, there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some particular State laws that are going to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rendered not aggravated felonies.  All of those States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have laws dealing with 16 year olds, or -- or 15 year 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

old ages of consent, or slightly younger.  So you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still going to get the people that Congress most wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law to apply to. 

 

 

 

 

            

And just take an example like Georgia.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a law making it a crime for anyone to have sex with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody who's under 16, with no age differential at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all.  Even if you wanted to pick up the age differential 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Section 2243, it still wouldn't be a problem in that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state because Georgia has a second law making it a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony as opposed to a misdemeanor when there's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

four-year age differential.  So you find this time and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again in the State laws that you don't have a serious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem with consequences. 

 

 

            

Next, the Solicitor General talked about 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2243 if you were to adopt that definition, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaving out things like familial abuse or abuse of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority and the like. 

 

 

 

            

Now we agree, or at least our position is

that you don't have to answer that question.  I think, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57 

in all candor, that is the hard case.  It's the one that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

falls outside of Section 2243, and the reason why you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't necessarily have to choose in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But there would be a good reason to choose 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2243, is because the structure of the BIA -- I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry -- the structure of the INA has other provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that make other things deportable offenses, most notably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child abuse or crimes against moral turpitude.  So the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

familial abuse, like my friend here is describing, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be picked up in a separate subsection of the INA.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't have to worry about that consequence either. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then finally, as to statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

construction and the rule of lenity.  First, I'd say you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have to reach that difficult question about how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chevron and the rule of lenity interact when it comes to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hybrid statutes.  I think, if I understood the other 

    

   

 

 

 

 

side's argument, all it's down to is a Black's Law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dictionary citation, primarily.  And -- and even that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has its problems for the reason Justice Alito pointed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out, when it deals with people who are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquaintances. 

            

And secondly, because even that provision 

 

 

 

 

 

itself uses the word "illegal."  And to make the word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"illegal" have meaning, as Justice Kagan points out you

need to do, you turn to a different page in Black's Law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dictionary to find out when sex is illegal based on age, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it tells you that 16 is the age of consent.  So even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Black's Law Dictionary leads to where we would have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court go, so the BIA's interpretation cannot possibly be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable. 

            

But if you did want to address or need to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address the question of how Chevron and the rule of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lenity interact, at the end of the day, the Solicitor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General has to be arguing one of two things to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court. 

            

Either their position has to be that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes can be chameleons and mean one thing on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal side and a different thing in the civil side --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that would be in the teeth of many of this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases -- or they have to be arguing that the BIA has the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power to -- to control -- I'm sorry -- to control what a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute means, not just in civil settings, but in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal settings.  And that would be a dramatic 

   

  

 

 

 

 

departure from anything the Court has ever held, at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least where Congress hasn't delegated that power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressly to the agency to control, not only civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applications, but also the scope of criminal law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If there's a problem with that, if you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

troubled by that consequence, remember, Congress can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

59 

always draft two separate statutes.  At the end of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day, it's Congress's choice whether to have a statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply in both settings.  And I think it's reasonable to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclude that if Congress has a statute applying in both 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settings, it wants it, first of all, to mean the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing, and second of all, it doesn't intend the agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have power over that particular provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If the Court has any questions about our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach or about what I've said, I'm happy to answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them, otherwise I'll submit the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
