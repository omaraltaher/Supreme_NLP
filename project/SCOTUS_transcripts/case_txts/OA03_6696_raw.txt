 P R O C E E D I N G S 


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument 


first this morning in number 03-6696, Yaser Esam 


Hamdi vs. Donald Rumsfeld.  Mr. Dunham. 


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR. 


 ON BEHALF OF PEITIONERS 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


8 

please the Court: 


9

 Petitioner Hamdi is a citizen who has been 


10 

held over two years in the United States with no 


11 

opportunity to be heard as to the facts on which his 


12 

detention is based.  Mr. Hamdi makes two claims. 


13 

First, the Fourth Circuit wrongly prevented Hamdi in 


14 

this habeas proceeding from being heard as to the 


15 

facts of the case on grounds that allowing him to be 


16 

heard would interfere with executive power. 


17

 Second, that the Fourth Circuit erred in 


18 

finding even on the one-sided record that's before 


19 

this Court that his detention is authorized by law. 


20 

The historical core of habeas corpus is to challenge 


21 

extrajudicial executive detention.  It cannot be a 


22 

violation of the separation of powers for an Article 


23 

III court to perform its judicial function of inquiry 


24 

into long-term, indefinite detention of a citizen in 


25 

a habeas corpus proceeding.

 Quoting from INS v. St. Cyr, at its 

historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served 

as a means of reviewing the legality of executive 

detention and it is in that context that its 

protections have been strongest. 

 QUESTION:  Do we have precedents for 

applying the writ in wartime situations to enemy 

combatants? 

 MR. DUNHAM:  For aliens, yes.  And in 

10 

Quirin --

11

 QUESTION:  But for a citizen who turns out 

12 

to be an enemy combatant? 

13

14

15

 MR. DUNHAM:  There are two --

 QUESTION:  What precedents do we look to? 

 MR. DUNHAM:  There are only two precedents 

16 

that I'm aware of, Justice O'Connor.  The first is 

17 

the treatment of the American citizen saboteur spy in 

18 

Ex parte Quirin, and the other is Mr. Territo, in In 

19 

re Territo, which was a Ninth Circuit case.  It is 

20 

not a case coming out of this Court. 

21

 In our view, first off, in Territo, the , 

22 

-- he was not an enemy combatant.  He was called a 

23 

prisoner of war in that case, but in Territo, there 

24 

was a full hearing by the district judge.  Territo 

25 

was claiming that he was not a prisoner of war, that 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

4 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3 

4

he was forced to serve.  That he was an American 

citizen.  That he had a right to have it determined 

that he was not a voluntary combatant. 

 QUESTION:  That's not the complaint, or 

5 

the allegation here, is it? 

6

7 

8 

9 

 MR. DUNHAM:  The allegation here is that, 

as I understand it, is that Mr. Hamdi is an enemy 

combatant, whatever that means.  We don't find it 

defined in any case.  We don't find it defined in any 

10 

statute, and it hasn't been defined by regulation or 

11 

by anything that's been filed in this case. 

12

 QUESTION:  Well, it's an English word.  It 

13 

means somebody who is combatting. 

14

15

 MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct. 

 QUESTION:  I assume it means someone who 

16 

is -- has taken up arms against the armed forces of 

17 

the United States.  Isn't that -- really, do we have 

18 

to quibble about that word? 

19

 MR. DUNHAM:  No.  I mean, in its ordinary 

20 

sense, Your Honor, you're absolutely right.  And 

21 

that's what we would take it to mean.  We would give 

22 

it --

23

 QUESTION:  Well, if the Government's 

24 

right, he is an unlawful belligerent, I take it, if 

25 

the Government's right.

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, the Government hasn't 


claimed in this, on the record in this case, which is 


limited to the Mobbs Declaration, it doesn't say 


anywhere in the Mobbs Declaration that Mr. Hamdi is 


an unlawful combatant.  The Fourth Circuit in this 


case limited the district court's consideration to 


that, to that affidavit, and said he could consider 


nothing else. 


 Now, there is nothing in that declaration 


10 

that says that Mr. Hamdi was an unlawful combatant. 


11 

And getting back to Justice Scalia's point, we do 


12 

accord the words enemy combatant their ordinary 


13 

English meaning because we have nothing else to tie 


14 

ourselves to, and those words mean an enemy is -- an 


15 

enemy is a member of a hostile power or force.  And a 


16 

combatant is one taking part in combat. 


17

 QUESTION:  Well, it certainly is possible 


18 

that a U.S. citizen could end up fighting for the 


19 

enemy in a war against our country.  That's possible. 


20

21

22

23

 MR. DUNHAM:  That's happened. 


 QUESTION:  Yes. 


 QUESTION:  Happening. 


 QUESTION:  And so when that individual is 


24 

captured then, by our country, the question is, to 


25 

what extent does the habeas statute apply, and if it 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1 

2

9 

does, are the proceedings limited in some way? 


Because of that status of being an enemy combatant? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, I believe 


that the -- his status is the thing that is the 


subject of the habeas proceeding.  I mean, if you 


start from the premise that he is fighting against 


our country, that's one thing.  But what we are 


saying here is that that fact is in dispute, and that 


we ought to --


10

 QUESTION:  But you could say the same 


11 

thing about, about noncitizen combatants.  I mean, 


12 

anyone captured in a war could say, you got the wrong 


13 

man.  I, in fact, was not taking up arms against the 


14 

United States, and I insist upon a judicial 


15 

proceeding to let me make that point. 


16

 Now, you surely wouldn't allow every 


17 

captured enemy in a war to go through a habeas 


18 

proceeding because he wants to challenge the fact, 


19 

would you? 


20

21

22

 MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor --


 QUESTION:  Or would you?  I don't know. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  No.  I wouldn't allow every 


23 

person captured to go through a habeas proceeding, 


24 

but there is a different legal status of a U.S. 


25 

citizen from an enemy alien captured on a 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

7 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

battlefield.  They have a different status. 

2

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8

 QUESTION:  Well, I'm still not clear what 

you do with Justice O'Connor's question and it's 

basically the Quirin case.  You are a citizen but you 

are an enemy combatant and you are captured.  Are 

your rights any different from that of a noncitizen 

in the same status?  You haven't answered that. 

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, yes.  First off, in 

9 

Quirin, we have to start with the premise that the 

10 

Quirin proceeding was authorized by Congress.  They 

11 

were proceeding --

12

 QUESTION:  I'm asking you to distinguish 

13 

between citizen and noncitizen in the hypothetical 

14 

case where each are combatants against the United 

15 

States and are captured.  Any difference? 

16

 MR. DUNHAM:  Not in the Quirin case.  No, 

17 

Your Honor. 

18

 QUESTION:  Any difference in your view and 

19 

under your theory of the case that you're presenting 

20 

here? 

21

22

23

 MR. DUNHAM:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  And what is that difference? 

 MR. DUNHAM:  That difference is that 

24 

Mr. Hamdi is a citizen.  He is not entitled to 

25 

belligerent immunity.  He is subject to prosecution 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

under our laws if he was, in fact, participating in 


taking up arms against our forces.  But that begs the 


question. 


 QUESTION:  You mentioned, you mentioned in 


connection with Quirin that there was a statute, and 


I think one -- one of the defendants was alleged to  


be a U.S. citizen.  So I thought you were making what 


-- were there regimes in prior wars for entertaining 


the claims of people who said, I was an innocent 


10 

bystander, I was indeed captured by the enemy.  In 


11 

Vietnam and World War II, were there means to 


12 

entertain the claims of people who said, I wasn't an 


13 

enemy? 


14

 MR. DUNHAM:  There were regimes then and 


15 

there are regimes now, but they haven't been used by 


16 

the military here.  There are outstanding military 


17 

regulations that provide for a hearing for someone 


18 

captured on the battlefield to determine their status 


19 

if there is any doubt as to their status. 


20

 QUESTION:  Would those military 


21 

proceedings satisfy your claim?  Your point is that 


22 

Hamdi has not had a chance to be heard on his claim 


23 

that this was a dreadful mistake, I wasn't an enemy. 


24

 MR. DUNHAM:  Those proceedings would go a 


25 

long way towards satisfying the process part of our 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

claim, Your Honor, but they don't really address the 


authorization part of our claim, which we have two 


claims here really. 


 The first is that he has never been -- had 


an opportunity to give, to assert a claim of 


innocence.  And those regulations, if they had been 


followed in this case, would certainly have given him 


that opportunity.  And then if he filed a habeas 


corpus petition which would be his right, the 


10 

district judge would have had a record of a hearing 


11 

like he does on a -- on reviewing a state criminal 


12 

conviction. 


13

 QUESTION:  But I don't think any 


14 

proceeding, Mr. Dunham, conducted by the military at 


15 

this stage, is going to reveal much that's factual. 


16 

How are you going to get people, you know, if he was 


17 

seized on the battlefield, what evidence are you 


18 

going to get now from the, from those people who 


19 

probably don't even remember it?  If the military 


20 

accorded some process at that time, as I understand 


21 

they said they did, surely that is more reliable than 


22 

anything that would come up now two years later. 


23

 MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, they did not 


24 

provide any process as contemplated by their 


25 

regulations.  In fact, the district judge offered to 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2 

3

8

let the military take this man and give him one of 


those hearings.  The very hearings their own 


regulations specify. 


 QUESTION:  What would you expect the 


military to do?  As I understand it, he wasn't even 


captured by our own forces.  He was captured by 


allied forces and turned over to our forces. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, that's certainly, 


9 

certainly part of the problem, Your Honor.  We have a 


10 

strong --


11

 QUESTION:  Well, you want them to run down 


12 

the members of the Afghan allies who captured this 


13 

man and get them to testify in a proceeding?  It's 


14 

just putting unreasonable demands upon, upon a war 


15 

situation.  I just --


16

 MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, I don't -- my 


17 

view is that it can never be an unreasonable demand 


18 

to comply with habeas corpus and the Fifth Amendment. 


19

20

21

 QUESTION:  That is the question --


 QUESTION:  Are you claiming --


 QUESTION:  -- is what it means.  And the 


22 

Chief Justice and Justice Scalia both indicated and 


23 

it concerns me, too.  What do you want to happen at 


24 

this hearing?  You get your hearing.  Are we supposed 


25 

to send a Gulfstream over with 10 people who 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

witnessed the capture?  How does this work? 


2

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, the military's own 


regulations provide a good guide for how this hearing 


would work.  They allow testimony by affidavit when 


it can't, when it's not convenient to obtain it in 


any other way.  And we are living in an age where we 


have -- we are not living in the World War II age. 


We have fax machines.  We have phones that have 


pictures.  You can get depositions. 


10

 QUESTION:  What if they get a deposition 


11 

from an American colonel who says this prisoner was 


12 

turned over to me by allied forces, our Afghan allies 


13 

in this combat, and I was assured by them that they 


14 

had captured him in a firefight?  Now, is that going 


15 

to satisfy our habeas corpus review? 


16

 MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, that would be a 


17 

lot more than what we have now. 


18

 QUESTION:  Oh, it certainly would, but you 


19 

wouldn't accept that, would you? 


20

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, I wouldn't accept it 


21 

without Mr. Hamdi --


22

23

 QUESTION:  Of course you wouldn't. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  -- having an opportunity to be 


24 

heard.  Fundamental to --


25

 QUESTION:  So your objection is not the 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

12 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2 

3

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

hearsay rule, your objection is the right to make 


some kind of response.  That's your basic process 


claim? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


That we have, we have never authorized detention of a 


citizen in this country without giving him an 


opportunity to be heard, to say, hey, I am an 


innocent person.  We don't -- he hasn't even been 


able to say that yet.  He hasn't been able to look at 


10 

the facts that have been alleged against him and give 


11 

any kind of an explanation as to his side of the 


12 

story, which may well turn out to be true and may 


13 

well clear up some of the deficiencies in the Mobbs 


14 

Declaration. 


15

 QUESTION:  But if this -- I'm sorry.  Go 


16 

on. 


17

 QUESTION:  At this stage of the game, I 


18 

take it, you have no per se objection to some form of 


19 

military process, so long as he could be heard? 


20

 MR. DUNHAM:  The only problem I would have 


21 

with that, Your Honor, and it's a small one, is that 


22 

the military has refused to give this process to him. 


23

 QUESTION: No, I realize that.  But 


24 

that's what you're -- you're asking us for something. 


25 

And my suggestion is, if I understand your argument, 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

13 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6

that if ultimately you were found, your client was 


found to be entitled to some process, it might be, 


consistently with your position, that military 


process with an opportunity to be heard in response 


would satisfy your demand. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Yes.  That's correct, Your 


7 

Honor. 


8

9

 QUESTION:  All right. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  The military procedure 


10 

requires the military to call witnesses and allows 


11 

the detainee an opportunity to give his own side of 


12 

the story and call his own witnesses. 


13

 QUESTION:  Do you still think that habeas 


14 

is necessary in order to determine that that process 


15 

has been afforded him? 


16

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, right now, habeas is 


17 

necessary to even get him that process. 


18

 QUESTION:  Let's assume the regime that 


19 

Justice Souter suggested, it's in place.  You are 


20 

entitled to habeas in order to ensure that that has 


21 

taken place and have, have the Article III court 


22 

supervise that, or would affidavits that this, from 


23 

the Government that this procedure has been afforded 


24 

be satisfactory? 


25

 MR. DUNHAM:  That would be a separate 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3

habeas proceeding, Your Honor, which might be filed 


after the hearing was held by the military, and --


 QUESTION:  I'm asking if you are entitled 


4 

to file that as a matter of right. 


5

6 

7 

8 

9 

 MR. DUNHAM:  I believe that any U.S. 


citizen has a right to file a habeas corpus petition 


at any time he is detained by the government.  But I 


don't know that the Article III court would need to 


supervise the military hearing if that's what he got. 


10 

He would certainly have the right, when that hearing 


11 

was over, just like anybody does, to file a habeas 


12 

petition saying that I'm detained by the government. 


13

 And then the district judge could look at 


14 

the hearing, if there was a hearing by the military, 


15 

he could review it for fundamental fairness, if 


16 

that's what the detainee decided to do at that point. 


17 

But it wouldn't be --


18

 QUESTION:  But it is reviewable on habeas? 


19 

You are not saying that it would be an adequate 


20 

defense in a subsequent habeas position simply to say 


21 

there was a hearing of the kind prescribed in the 


22 

military regulations, and after that hearing, he was 


23 

found to be an enemy combatant.  That would not 


24 

satisfy you?  You would allow the habeas court to 


25 

re-examine the facts brought up in that hearing?

 MR. DUNHAM:  I believe that the habeas 


 court could always review the process to see that it 


 was fair.  That's a habeas court's function. 


 QUESTION:  Right. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  But it wouldn't be anything 


 extensive.  If there was a record from the military 


 proceeding, the district judge would simply --


 QUESTION:  Well, it depends on what you 


 mean by fair, of course, and what, you know, what 


 common law courts usually mean by fair, for example, 


 is no hearsay testimony.  And you apply that rule to 


 a wartime situation and everybody will get off. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, the 


 regulations, the military's own regulations say how 


 the hearing is to be held.  The district judge would 


 be basically looking to see whether those regulations 


17 

were complied with. 


18

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

 QUESTION:  Oh, that's different.  I 


 thought you said that he would look to see whether 


 those regulations were fair. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Oh, no, not the regulation --


 whether the proceeding was fair, whether it complied 


 with fundamental due process.  And that would --


 QUESTION:  That's something quite 


 different from saying they followed the regulations.

 The regulations might be something that a common law 


 judge thinks does not comply with due process.  In 


 that case, you would override the military judgment, 


 right? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, I believe the district 


 court has that power, Your Honor.  The Article III 


 court has that power in a habeas proceeding. 


 QUESTION:  But I didn't understand your 


 basic answer.  The basic question is, in the ordinary 


 case, not some unusual case, but in the ordinary 


 case, if they set up an ordinary military tribunal 


 according to Article I(6) and it worked and so forth, 


 then isn't that due process?  I thought Justice 


 Scalia -- in response to Justice Scalia's question, 


 you said that wouldn't satisfy you, but my impression 


 was you were saying in the ordinary case, that would 


 satisfy you. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct. 


 QUESTION:  All right, it would satisfy 


 you.  Fine. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  All I wanted to say was that 


 you haven't had that hearing. 


 QUESTION:  No, I understand that.  That's 


 the second half of my question.  They could satisfy 


 you, I take it, in one of two ways.  A, that they

 have the military tribunal that they've given in 


 every war and so forth, the ordinary procedure there, 


 a neutral decision maker and an opportunity to 


 present proofs and arguments, or B, they don't do 


 that. 


 Now, if they refuse to do that, then what, 


 in your opinion, should the habeas court do? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Then the habeas court should 


 hold a hearing that would be very similar to what the 


 military should have done.  Judge Doumar here tried 


 to send the case back to the military to have them 


 hold the very hearing we're talking about, using 


 their own officers to do it just as the military 


 regulations require it. 


 QUESTION:  But that would be a different 


 approach.  I mean, it might be not that the habeas 


 court has to hold the hearing that the military would 


 have held, but that the habeas court has to say to 


 the military, hold the hearing or let him go.  You 


 would be satisfied, I take it, if the habeas court, 


 on Justice Breyer's hypothesis, said, hold the 


 hearing. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  That would be satisfactory, 


 Your Honor, but the question is what interferes with 


 the military more, for the district judge to hold a

 hearing that the military has previously refused to 


 do, or to order the military to follow their own 


 rules? 


 QUESTION:  Was there a reason given --


 when the district judge suggested that solution, why 


 did the Government say, we don't want to use the 


 procedure that we used, say, in Vietnam? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  As I recall, the answer was 


 we're not required to and we don't choose to do so. 


 QUESTION:  Is that procedure -- does that 


 have -- did Congress have a part in that, the 


 military regulations that provided for how you treat 


 people in wartime situations who say, I'm innocent 


 essentially? 


 MR. DUNHAM: No, Congress has not passed 


 these rules. 


 QUESTION:  Well, Congress did pass 


 something called the Authorization for Use of 


 Military Force, did it not? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Yes, it did, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  And it affects this very 


 conflict. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Yes, it does, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  Now, what application does that 


 have here?  It appears to allow detention of people

 captured. 

 MR. DUNHAM:  The Authorization for Use of 

 Military Force does not have the word detention 

 anywhere in it.  It talks about use of force and it 

 is the equivalent, in our view, of a declaration of 

 war.  Although it is not a formal declaration of war, 

 it would have that same operative effect.  And in our 

 history, we have never had any substantive rights 

 conveyed to the commander-in-chief by the mere act of 

 a declaration of war.

 you know, when there is a declaration of war or a 

 resolution such as this, surely the President has the 

 right to kill foreign combatants, no? 

 MR. DUNHAM:  He certainly has the right to 

 kill them and if they're aliens --

 QUESTION:  Now, is it conceivable that he 

 has to kill them but not to detain them? 

 MR. DUNHAM:  He has the right to detain 

 alien combatants, no question about it.  But when it 

 comes to U.S. citizens, you don't simply detain them. 

 You prosecute them, like they did with John Walker 

 Lindh. 

 QUESTION:  You're saying that AMUF is

 insufficient in this case to detain, because 


 declarations of war and the AMUF historically have 


 simply authorized the President to use his judgment 


 and his force and his capacities and his power 


 without having an extensive list of the different 


 things that he can do.  And you're asking for 


 something quite different, it seems to me. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, in the War of 1812, 


 there was a general declaration of war but Congress 


 still passed a list of specific things the President 


 could do.  Obviously a declaration of war doesn't 


 give the President the power to appropriate funds to 


 fight the war. 


 QUESTION:  No, but look, it does say in 


 this authorization, the President is authorized to 


 use all necessary and appropriate force against 


 persons he determines planned, authorized, committed 


 or aided the terrorist attacks. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  If that is interpreted to 


 mean that he can impose indefinite executive 


 detention on anybody that he thinks is necessary in 


 order to fulfill that command, we could have people 


 locked up all over the country tomorrow without any 


 due process, without any opportunity to be heard, 


 because we know that this war that we're talking

 about here is going on worldwide and it's going on 


 within our own borders. 


 Congress didn't intend to -- when it 


 passed this Authorization for Use of Military Force 


 to authorize widespread detentions of people with no 


 opportunity to be heard, indefinite, solitary 


 confinement for as long as they might live.  Congress 


 -- there is no indication that Congress intended any 


 such thing. 


 QUESTION:  Did Congress intend that the 


 President has the authority and the right to use 


 whatever powers are necessary to suppress the 


 terrorists and to prevent future attacks, consistent 


 with the traditions and the powers of that office? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  I believe they authorize it 


 consistent with our laws.  I don't think Congress 


 repealed any laws when they wrote the Authorization 


 for Use of Military Force. 


 QUESTION:  Mr. Dunham, can I ask you sort 


 of a preliminary question.  We're talking about way 


 down the road now, but do you contest any of the 


 facts in the Mobbs Declaration? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, I've only recently been 


 allowed to talk to my client, Your Honor, and 


 everything he has told me they tell me is classified,

 so I'm not allowed to convey it to the Court this 


 morning.  But the best I can say is in an overall 


 general way, there is a substantial dispute. 


 QUESTION:  There is a substantial dispute, 


 and have you had an opportunity, on behalf of the 


 client, to supplement or to contradict or supplement 


 the information in the Mobbs Declaration? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  No, because it's -- it's 


 while the matter has been pending before this Court 


 and there is no way to go before the Court at this 


 point, absent a remand, in order to do that.  If the 


 Court remanded, I would be able to do that provided 


 that we had appropriate protective orders in place so 


 that I could convey classified information to the 


 Court. 


 QUESTION:  Mr. Dunham, one of the judges 


 on the Fourth Circuit in the en banc denial, Judge 


 Motz, had a proposal that was similar to the one that 


 Judge Mukasey proposed in New York.  And that is, 


 initially, the Mobbs affidavit is taken as true but 


 that you have an opportunity to rebut it.  Would that 


 be a satisfactory -- would that comport with due 


 process?  In your view?


 MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, that is the way 


 the statutory habeas proceeding is supposed to

 unfold.  The Government doesn't deny that we have a 


 right to have a habeas proceeding.  They've conceded 


 it at three different points in their brief.  So once 


 we're before the court on a petition for habeas 


 corpus, the question is what does that proceeding 


 look like.  And I suggest it's spelled out in the 


 U.S. code. 


 When Congress passed the Authorization for 


 Use of Military Force, it did not say we suspend 


 habeas.  Habeas corpus statutes are still on the 


 books and exactly what Your Honor is talking about is 


 what should happen. 


 QUESTION:  So every United States citizen, 


 even if captured on the field of combat, is 


 entitled to a habeas hearing? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  That of course assumes he's 


 captured on the field of combat, Your Honor, which we 


 don't concede. 


 QUESTION:  Well, that's right.  He's 


 entitled to a habeas hearing to determine whether in 


 fact he was captured on the field of combat opposing 


 the United States, right? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, if he files a petition 


 for habeas corpus, yes. 


 QUESTION:  And I presume that anybody who

 claims to be an American citizen would be entitled to 


 a habeas hearing on the question of whether he is in 


 fact an American citizen, and then the subsequent 


 question of whether he was captured on the field of 


 combat while taking up arms against the 


 United States, right? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, the military --


 QUESTION:  So every foreigner captured, if 


 he claims to be an American citizen, would be 


 entitled to the kind of habeas hearing you're talking 


 about? 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Not necessarily on a mere 


 claim, Your Honor.  The military is required to take 


 a long list of biographical data from anybody they 


 capture.  And in this particular case, there is no 


 dispute about the man's citizenship.  There is a 


 birth certificate in the record.  The military has 


 not -- they're the ones that determined he was a 


 citizen. 


 QUESTION:  I'm not talking about this 


 case.  I'm talking about the principle that you're 


 asking us to adopt and how it would apply.  I mean, 


 if there is a habeas corpus right for an American 


 citizen, there has to be, it seems to me, a habeas 


 corpus right for everyone who claims he is an

 American citizen. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, that may be the 


 case but that doesn't justify taking away the habeas 


 corpus right from a citizen.  That is a right that 


 has been there since this country was founded and it 


 doesn't justify taking away a citizen's right because 


 some sham claim might be made. 


 QUESTION:  Whether it's been there since 


 the country was founded when he is captured on the 


 field of battle is the very controverted question 


 that's up here.  You can't say that with that 


 assurance.  I mean, that's why we have a case here. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  If it please the Court, I 


 would like to save the balance of my time for 


 rebuttal. 


 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Dunham. 


 Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you. 


 ORAL ARGUMENT BY PAUL D. CLEMENT 


 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it 


 please the Court: 


 Petitioners contend that the Government 


 categorically lacks the authority to hold Hamdi as an 


 enemy combatant.  But it has been well established 


 and long established that the Government has the

 authority to hold both unlawful enemy combatants and 


 lawful prisoners of war captured on the battlefield 


 in order to prevent them from returning to the 


 battle. 


 Over 10,000 United States troops remain on 


 the field of battle in Afghanistan.  No principle of 


 law or logic requires the United States to release an 


 individual from detention so that he can rejoin the 


 battle against the United States. 


 QUESTION:  But the question of whether 


 it's a criminal procedure or this detention without 


 -- does the Government have any rhyme or rationale as 


 to why some of these people -- I think Mr. Dunham 


 mentioned Lindh, there is also Moussaoui, there is 


 this John -- they are also being kept away from 


 returning any place because there are criminal 


 charges against them. 


 And then there is Hamdi and Padilla and 


 al-Marri who are in this detention state with no 


 charges.  What does the Government -- how does the 


 Government justify some going through the criminal 


 process and others just being held indefinitely? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Ginsburg, I think 


 that reflects a sound exercise of prosecutorial and 


 executive discretion.  There are some individuals who

 may be captured in a situation where they do not 


 have any particular intelligence value, they have 


 been handled in a way where there are no difficult 


 evidentiary questions that would be raised in a 


 criminal prosecution and those individuals can be 


 dealt with in the Article III system. 


 But there are plenty of individuals who 


 either have a paramount intelligence value that 


 putting them into the Article III system immediately 


 and providing them with counsel whose first advice 


 would certainly be to not talk to the Government is a 


 counterproductive way to proceed in these cases. 


 QUESTION:  At the moment, nobody --


 QUESTION:  I'm trying to find whether 


 there is any literature or commentary on how long the 


 detention is required before the intelligence value, 


 the interrogation value of the custody serves no 


 further purpose.  Can you give me any ideas of the 


 outer bounds of how long the detention would take in 


 order to get the value from the interrogation that 


 you want? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm 


 not sure I can give you the outer bounds, but what I 


 can say is that the case here before you today in 


 Hamdi, and the case in Padilla, suggests that the

 amount of time that is necessary to allow for 


 interrogation without access to counsel in order to 


 get intelligence is not an indefinite period of time. 


 Both these individuals now have access to 


 counsel because the military intelligence experts who 


 make these judgments have made the judgment that 


 access to counsel at this point does not interfere 


 with the intelligence gathering process. 


 QUESTION:  Would it be --


 QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, how can you 


 assume --


 QUESTION:  Would it be a helpful line of 


 inquiry for a district court, assuming that there is 


 some jurisdiction in the district court, which you 


 would contest, to have testimony as to how effective 


 interrogations are and how long it takes.  And then 


 we could begin to get some understanding of this 


 process? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  I suppose you could.  One 


 thing I would point you to, Justice Kennedy, is the 


 declaration of Vice Admiral Jacoby, who is the director 


 of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  That's at page 75 of 


 the Joint Appendix in the Padilla case. 


 And I think that -- there obviously are

 various ways the courts could approach this.  A court 


 in one proceeding could take evidence of the question 


 generally.  I suppose if there were a situation in 


 which there was a habeas petition filed and there was 


 an initial period where there was no access to 


 counsel, if a judge for some reason thought that that 


 had taken too long, I suppose that judge could make 


 an inquiry of the Government, and in an ex parte 


 proceeding, they could make some kind of filing 


 explaining to the judge why it is that further 


 interrogation without counsel is necessary. 


 I think the important thing is twofold. 


 One, to recognize that there is a unique interest, 


 especially in the course of this conflict, where 


 intelligence is at unprecedented value, to have some 


 ability with some detainees to deal with them in a 


 way that allows us to get intelligence to prevent 


 future terrorist attacks, and not be limited just to 


 going after them retrospectively for past terrorist 


 attacks. 


 QUESTION:  We can accept that, but what do 


 you, what do you make of Section 4001.  I take it 


 it's the Government's position that it has absolutely 


 no application to the situation.  That it simply 


 refers to the normal circumstances of the criminal

 law.  Is that right? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  That's right, Justice 


 Souter, but I would be quick to add that we -- I 


 mean, all 4001(a) says is that an individual must be 


 detained pursuant to an act of Congress. 


 QUESTION:  Right. 


 MR. DUNHAM:  If one needs an act of 


 Congress, and we question whether this really has 


 anything to do with the detention of enemy combatants 


 by the military, but to the extent an act of Congress 


 is necessary, as I think Justice O'Connor's questions 


 indicated, the Authorization of Force provides more 


 than ample statutory --


 QUESTION:  It certainly did -- may I just 


 ask one more question?  I will concede certainly at 


 least for the sake of argument that it did in the, in 


 the early stages of the period starting with 


 September 11th.  I will assume for the sake of 


 argument that it did when it was passed. 


 It doesn't follow, however, that it is 


 adequate for all time.  The fact is, I will assume 


 that on September 12th, without any authorization 


 from Congress at all, the President could have taken 


 action in relation to this individual, I mean, if he 


 had been fighting on a battlefield that the President

 took. 


 But it doesn't follow that the President's 


 authority to do that is indefinite for all time.  And 


 I guess the question I would be interested in and 


 your response to is this.  Is it reasonable to think 


 that the, that the authorization was sufficient at 


 the time that it was passed, but that at some point, 


 it is a Congressional responsibility, and ultimately 


 a constitutional right on this person's part, for 


 Congress to assess the situation and either pass a 


 more specific continuing authorization or at least to 


 come up with the conclusion that its prior 


 authorization was good enough.  Doesn't Congress at 


 some point have a responsibility to do more than pass 


 that resolution? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Souter, I 


 would say a couple of things.  One is there may be 


 some difficult questions down the road, but if there 


 is emphasis that 10,000 United States troops remain 


 on the battlefield in Afghanistan --


 QUESTION:  Well, there are 10,000 troops 


 there, but it's two and a half years later.  And it 


 may very well be that the, that the constitutional 


 obligation and the constitutional demand that his 


 client can make is that the political branch take

 a -- make a further assessment and a more specific 


 one.  I'm not denying that there is a lot going on, 


 but there has also been time. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  I realize that, Justice 


 Souter.  Let me say one other thing.  And then if I 


 have time, I'd come back to the 10,000 troops still 


 on the ground.  What I would say is Congress has been 


 open with whatever appropriate recesses every day 


 since September 18th, 2001 when they passed the joint 


 resolution. 


 If they were to pass some specific statute 


 that either provided for more finely reticulated 


 procedures for dealing with enemy combatants or tried 


 to preclude the detention of certain individuals, 


 then I think one of two things would happen, either 


 the executive branch would follow those more 


 reticulated provisions, or I suppose if there was a 


 judgment by Congress that this authority was denied 


 all together and the President thought that that 


 authority was absolutely necessary to the fighting of 


 the battle in Afghanistan, then you might have a 


 situation where we came to this Court in a situation 


 that Justice Jackson would say the executive's power 


 is at its lowest ebb. 


 But here we come to the Court with that

 authorization that the President relied on. 


 QUESTION:  You come with an authorization 


 that the President relied on and which I will assume 


 he quite rightly relied on at the time it was passed. 


 But my question is a timing question.  Is it not 


 reasonable to at least consider whether that 


 resolution needs, at this point, to be supplemented 


 and made more specific to authorize what you are 


 doing? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, again, Justice Souter, 


 I can't imagine that the rule is that the executive 


 somehow suffers if Congress doesn't fill the breach. 


 Because the last word from Congress is that -- that 


 all necessary and appropriate force is authorized. 


 QUESTION:  Yes, but when you say the 


 executive suffers, I think your response is assuming that


17  the 


18

21

 executive has the power.  And it may very well be 


 that the executive has power in the early exigencies 


 of an emergency.  But that at some point in the 


 indefinite future, the other political branch has got 


 to act if that, if power is to continue. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  But Justice Souter, they 


 have authorized the use of force.  They recognize, if 


 you took --

 QUESTION:  Without any specific reference 


 to this situation, without any specific reference to 


 keeping American citizens detained indefinitely.  I 


 mean, that's the problem. 


 QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, this Section 4001 


 doesn't relate to a hearing, it relates to the 


 President's power to detain, doesn't it? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, absolutely. 


 QUESTION:  So if it expires after two and 


 a half years, it would just not mean you have to give 


 them counsel after two and a half years or give them 


 a hearing after two and a half years.  It means you 


 would have to let them go back to Afghanistan after 


 two and a half years, wouldn't it? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  It would, Justice Scalia --


 QUESTION:  It would, but it uses --


 MR. CLEMENT:  And that's why I find it so 


 remarkable that we have to confront this question 


 when our troops are still on the ground in 


 Afghanistan. 


 QUESTION:  Wait.  You're also -- the words 


 are necessary and appropriate.  And also the words in 


 the Constitution are due process of law.  And also 


 the words in the Magna Carta were according to law. 


 And whatever form of words in any of those documents

 there are, it seemed to refer to one basic idea 


 that's minimum.  That a person who contests something 


 of importance is entitled to a neutral decision maker 


 and an opportunity to present proofs and arguments. 


 You have heard, in the last hour, people 


 talking about the military itself recognizing that 


 basic principle with tribunals in what is called Army 


 Reg 190.8.  Now, is there any reason why, when a 


 person says I am not a combatant, I was a relief 


 worker, I wasn't even there, I was sold into this by 


 people who wanted a bounty, is there any reason why 


 you could not have that kind of proceeding, the kind 


 of proceeding that was given in the Gulf War on the 


 battlefield in hundreds of instances, that was given 


 in Iraq in hundreds of instances, the kind of 


 proceeding that the military itself has given over 


 and over and over. 


 Now, is there any reason why that isn't 


 necessary and appropriate, or why that isn't in 


 accordance with law or due process of law? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Breyer, let me say 


 several things.  One is that the regulations that are 


 being bandied about are the regulations that the Army 


 uses to comply with their obligations under Article V 


 of the Geneva Convention.

 Now, Article V of the Geneva Convention 


 does not apply here, and let me address why in a 


 minute, but let me say very clearly that these 


 individuals have gotten military process.  It might 


 not have been the exact process --


 QUESTION:  That wasn't the question I 


 asked.  The question I asked, is there any reason why 


 the Army itself could not give a comparable basic 


 proceeding where you have a neutral decision maker, 


 and a practical, but fair opportunity to present 


 proofs and arguments?  Not some kind of thing on the 


 battlefield, something two years later, not some kind 


 of thing where you haul in witnesses, but something 


 that's practical insofar as you get evidence that's 


 reasonably available. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Breyer --


 QUESTION:  I want a practical answer.  I 


 don't want a -- yes. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  I understand that.  But the 


 practical answer that you are looking for assumes a 


 process that's never been provided.  There has never 


 been a process that's removed from the battlefield. 


 What Article V provides and what the military 


 regulations provide is immediately adjunct to the 


 battlefield, you have three military officers who do

 a very quick hearing, the purpose of which primarily 

 is to figure out not whether somebody is completely 

 innocent, but to figure out whether they are properly 

 classified as a prisoner of war, as opposed to an 

 unlawful enemy combatant. 

 QUESTION:  So you say the regulations in 

 place provide for that battlefield type review? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  They do, Justice O'Connor --

 QUESTION:  Did this Petitioner have that 

 type of review? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  This Petitioner, Justice 

 O'Connor, did not get that precise type of review, 

 and the reason is because, based on a Presidential 

 determination, the military officers understood that 

 Article V of the Geneva Convention has no application 

 here.  Again, that provision, and I think it's worth 

 --

 QUESTION:  Well, perhaps not, but we are 

 here on habeas.  Do you agree that, that he is 

 entitled to bring a habeas action? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  We do agree that he is 

 entitled to bring a --

 QUESTION:  Okay. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  -- habeas action. 

 QUESTION:  So then we have to decide then

 to what is he entitled, and even that minimal review 


 by the military, you think, is not required? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't think it's 


 required, especially in a situation like this, where 


 although Hamdi did not receive an Article V hearing 


 because it was inapplicable, he did receive military 


 process.  When he was originally turned over to the 


 United States forces by the Northern Alliance, our 


 military allies, there was a screening process on the 


 ground in Afghanistan.  Now, that process screened 


 out 10,000 individuals out of U.S. custody.  So he 


 received that process. 


 Now, to be sure, it's a military process, 


 but it is the kind of process that prisoners of war 


 and enemy combatants have always gotten.  Now, 


 because of the nature of this war, Hamdi got 


 additional process.  And it's important to point out 


 that this Article V process that other prisoners of 


 war traditionally get is a one-shot deal.  It's done 


 off the battlefield and that's it.  You are under 


 detention for the remainder of the battle.  And 


 there's no reason for Congress to have to go in with 


 a new resolution.  You are there for the remainder of 


 the war. 


 Now, in this context, because we recognize

 that there are some unusual aspects of this war, and 


 also because the United States military has no 


 interest in detaining any individual who is not an 


 enemy combatant or who does not present a continuing 


 threat, when Hamdi got to Guantanamo, he was given 


 additional screening processes.  That screened him in 


 as well.  Did not screen him out. 


 Then it may not seem what you think of as 


 traditional due process in an Article III sense, but 


 the interrogation process itself provides an 


 opportunity for an individual to explain that this 


 has all been a mistake.  And as the affidavit that's 


 in the record here shows --


 QUESTION:  Do you say he had that 


 opportunity? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely, Justice 


 O'Connor.  And the affidavit that's filed here 


 represents, by Mr. Mobbs, that the interrogation 


 process, in that process, his story confirmed that he 


 was on the battlefield and surrendered with the 


 Taliban military unit while armed. 


 QUESTION:  Do you concede that you have 


 the obligation to make the representation that you 


 have just made to the habeas court? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Kennedy, I'm not

 positive what the ultimate minimum that the habeas 


 statutes would require in this context, but we do 


 think that an appropriate balance of individual 


 rights, the traditional role of habeas, that the 


 overwhelming military imperatives of this situation 


 are that the habeas corpus writ is available, first 


 to make legal challenges to the detention along the 


 lines of 4001(a) categorically precludes this, and 


 those challenges have been open. 


 We also think it appropriate for the 


 United States to come in with a declaration that 


 explains the basis for the military's decision.  And 


 particularly, I think what it does is it provides an 


 explanation that if believed, provides a basis for a 


 court to police the line that separates Quirin on the 


 one hand from Milligan on the other. 


 And obviously, a situation like this with 


 a battlefield detainee who surrendered while armed on 


 the battlefield is a classic case of an enemy 


 combatant. 


 QUESTION:  Is there any --


 QUESTION:  In Quirin, in Quirin, the 


 defendants were heard, and that's -- the Mobbs 


 affidavit is, I take it your position is, yes, 


 habeas, and yes, the Government has to come forward

 with something.  And the something they came forward 


 with is the Mobbs affidavit, which is hearsay, 


 because Mobbs doesn't know what happened on the 


 battlefield either.  And that there is no statement 


 at any point from Hamdi, although the claim before us 


 is that he would dispute what's in the Mobbs 


 affidavit, but he doesn't have an opportunity to do 


 that. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 


 mean, there actually is, I mean, it would be 


 something like double hearsay, but there is a 


 statement in the Mobbs declaration itself where Mobbs 


 is summarizing that Hamdi himself --


 QUESTION:  Yes, but that certainly is 


 double hearsay. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  It certainly is, but this 


 is --


 QUESTION:  The person who is locked up, 


 doesn't he have a right to bring before some tribunal 


 himself his own words, rather than have a Government 


 agent say what was told to him that somebody else 


 said. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  With respect, Justice 


 Ginsburg, he has an opportunity to explain it in his 


 own words.  Now, it may not --

 QUESTION:  During interrogation? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  During interrogation. 


 QUESTION:  I mean, is that your point? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  During interrogation. 


 During the initial screening.  During the screening 


 in Guantanamo. 


 QUESTION:  How about to a neutral decision 


 maker of some kind, perhaps in the military?  Is that 


 so extreme that it should not be required? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  No, Justice O'Connor.  And 


 let me say two things.  One is when the initial 


 screening criteria are applied in the field, for all 


 intents and purposes, that is a neutral decision 


 maker. 


 I mean, as I said before, the Army is not 


 interested in holding people as enemy combatants that 


 don't qualify for that and don't pose a threat.  The 


 second thing I would say, though, is that as I 


 understand it, the plan on a going-forward basis 


 reflecting the unique situation of this battle is to 


 provide individuals like Hamdi, like Padilla, with 


 the equivalent of the annual review process that's 


 laid out in the briefs --


 QUESTION:  Well, let's talk about that for 


 just a moment.  What is it that the Government is

 saying will be provided? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice O'Connor, 


 those regulations are still in draft form. 


 QUESTION:  So we don't know? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  We don't know for sure.  I 


 think what's envisioned is an opportunity to go 


 before a neutral tribunal, some opportunity to 


 present --


 QUESTION:  Yes, but Mr. Clement, you're 


 assuming he has no right to counsel, aren't you? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Stevens, what we're 


 assuming is that he has no right to counsel that is 


 automatic and as of right --


 QUESTION:  If he could get his own 


 counsel, would he be entitled to consult with his 


 counsel during the preliminary stages of his 


 detention? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Not at the preliminary 


 stages if the Government has made a determination 


 that access to counsel would interfere with the 


 intelligence gathering process. 


 QUESTION:  Are there any cases -- it 


 sounds from your argument that the principle 


 interests that the Government wants to advance is the 


 ability to interrogate the person for a sufficient

 length of time to determine whether they get valuable 


 information out of them or not. 


 And to deny him counsel during that 


 period, because he may not be as willing to talk. 


 Now, it seems to me there are two things about that I 


 wanted to ask you about.  One, have you considered 


 the possibility that perhaps a lawyer would have 


 explained to this man that if you do give some 


 information, you won't have to stay here 


 incommunicado for two or three years?  That might be 


 a motivation to talk.  That's one possibility. 


 And the second thing I want to ask you 


 about, are there any cases in the international field 


 or the law anywhere, explaining that the interest in 


 detaining a person incommunicado for a long period of 


 time for the purpose of obtaining information from 


 them is a legitimate justification? 


 I understand for arresting on the 


 battlefield, that's perfectly clear.  But is this 


 prolonged detention for that purpose the subject of 


 judicial writing anywhere that you know about? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Let me answer both parts of 


 your question, Justice Stevens.  Certainly it has 


 occurred to us and we have considered the possibility 


 that in some circumstances with some individuals, the

 best way to get them to cooperate and provide 


 information is to give them a lawyer who will tell 


 them, boy, you know, it's in your best interest to 


 plead to this relatively minor material support 


 charge or whatever and provide the Government with 


 everything that you have. 


 And that is part of the answer to 


 Justice Ginsburg's earlier question, is why is it 


 that there is this pattern that you look at and some 


 people are used in the Article III system and other 


 people are prosecuted or dealt with in preventative 


 detention in the military system. 


 And it reflects a judgment by people whose 


 job it is to make these judgments that certain 


 people, the best way to get them to cooperate, or 


 maybe with certain individuals after you've gotten a 


 certain amount of information from them, but you feel 


 there is one other area you're not going to get 


 unless the dynamic fundamentally changes, those 


 people may be best dealt with in the way that you 


 envisioned.  Whereas other individuals, the only way 


 that the judgment of the intelligence experts had to 


 deal with them is to provide them without counsel and 


 to use an interrogation. 


 I think to get to your second part of the

 question, I don't know that there are any authorities 


 that I'm aware of that address exactly what you're 


 talking about, but I think there are two types of 


 authority that we would point to as being very 


 important.  First of all, it's long been recognized 


 that one of the major justifications for the 


 detention of enemy combatants or prisoners of war is 


 to gather intelligence.  And we cite some sources to 


 that effect in the brief. 


 The second thing, and I think this is 


 important, is that it has never been the case that 


 prisoners of war are entitled to counsel to challenge 


 their capture or their detention.  What has happened 


 historically, and what the Geneva Convention 


 provides, is that if one of those enemy combatants is 


 charged with a specific war crime, then at that point 


 they're entitled to counsel.  But if they are just 


 being held in a preventative detention, then in that 


 circumstance, they are not entitled to counsel. 


 QUESTION:  But have we ever had a 


 situation like this where presumably this status --


 war-like status could last for 25 years, 50 years, 


 whatever it is. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  A couple of responses, 


 Justice O'Connor.  First of all, in the midst of any 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

 war, the detention may seem like it's indefinite 


 because if you talk about a detainee in 1942, they're 


 not going to know how long World War II is going to 


 last.  And their detention may seem indefinite but 


 those detentions have always been approved under the 


 law of war. 


 Second, with respect to Al Qaeda and 


 individuals who are hard core Al Qaeda operatives, 


 the end of the war is a very difficult thing to 


 perceive.  But with respect to somebody who is 


 captured on the battlefield with the Taliban, this 


 war may eventually -- the executive may make the 


 judgment or Congress may help us make the judgment 


 that the war in Afghanistan is effectively over. 


 And individuals who only really posed a 


 danger of rejoining the battle in Afghanistan would 


 be released.  Now, there may be a few individuals 


 who, as I say, are hard core Al Qaeda operatives and 


 they're going to join the battle against the 


 United States wherever it's waged.  They're just in 


 Afghanistan because that's where the action is. 


 QUESTION:  May I ask just one other 


 question, I think it's just relevant.  But do you 


 think there is anything in the law that curtails the 


 method of interrogation that may be employed?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think there is, 


 Justice Stevens.  I mean --


 QUESTION:  And what is that? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, just to give one 


 example, I think that the United States is signatory 


 to conventions that prohibit torture and that sort of 


 thing.  And the United States is going to honor its 


 treaty obligations.  The other thing that's worth 


 mentioning of course --


 QUESTION:  But you said something about 


 self-executing.  In connection with the Geneva 


 Convention, you said, well, it's not self-executing. 


 Would you say the same thing about the torture 


 convention? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Ginsburg, I actually 


 have the sense that the torture victims -- you have 


 the Torture Victim Protection Act, of course, which I 


 think doesn't actually apply to the United States. 


 So I'm not sure that there would be any other basis 


 for bringing a private cause of action against the 


 United States. 


 But as this Court noted in footnote 14 of 


 the Eisentrager opinion, the idea that a treaty is 


 going to be enforced through means other than a 


 private cause of action doesn't mean that it's not a

 binding treaty, doesn't mean that it's not going to 


 constrain the actions of the executive branch. 


 Just to finish up my answer to Justice 


 Stevens' question, I wouldn't want there to be any 


 misunderstanding about this.  It's also the judgment 


 of those involved in this process that the last thing 


 you want to do is torture somebody or try to do 


 something along those lines. 


 I mean, if there were an artificial -- if 


 you did that, you might get information more quickly, 


 but you would really wonder about the reliability of 


 the information you were getting.  So the judgment of 


 the people who do this as their responsibility is 


 that the way you would get the best information from 


 individuals is that you interrogate them, you try to 


 develop a relationship of trust. 


 QUESTION:  But doesn't the Court have some 


 business intervening at some point, if it's the 


 Hundred Years War or something? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Breyer, I 


 mean, there may be a point where, depending on the 


 nature of the war -- I mean, I'm not quite sure what 


 you have in mind that they would intervene on. 


 QUESTION:  At some point, if you're 


 holding people without a lawyer, with the only

 neutral decision maker being an interrogator, with no 


 opportunity to present proofs and evidence, with no 


 opportunity to hear the other side, in your opinion, 


 if that goes on and on, let's say it's the Hundred 


 Years War, is there no opportunity for a court, in 


 your view, to say that this violates, for an American 


 citizen, the elementary due process that the 


 Constitution guarantees? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, as I indicated 


 earlier, Justice Breyer, the courts remain open.  We 


 recognize the viability of the writ of habeas corpus. 


 There certainly is a challenge that can be brought to 


 the length of the detention at some point.  And the 


 courts would be open to hear claims --


 QUESTION:  But your answer to Justice 


 O'Connor, I thought, was, we don't have to worry or a 


 court should not be worrying about the indefiniteness 


 of the time because it may well be that the President 


 or Congress will at some point say the war in 


 Afghanistan is no longer a matter of concern and, 


 therefore, we don't have to hold the Hamdis. 


 I think that's the only answer that you 


 have given so far to Justice Breyer's question and 


 Justice O'Connor's question.  Am I wrong? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Souter, a couple of

 points.  One is, I don't think there is any 


 contradiction with that and my answer to Justice 


 Breyer's question.  I mean, you can imagine a 


 situation where the evidence in the Government's own 


 affidavit shows that somebody is only detained with 


 regard to war in Afghanistan.  And then you can 


 imagine that that has been signed, sealed and 


 delivered, it's over, the President says so, Congress 


 says so and there is an effort to continue to detain 


 that individual. 


 QUESTION:  I can imagine it and I can also 


 imagine that the concern about Afghanistan will go on 


 as long as there is concern about Al Qaeda, and there 


 is no endpoint that we can see at this point to that. 


 So that it seems to me your answer boils down to 


 saying, don't worry about the timing question, we'll 


 tell you when it's over. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  With respect, Justice 


 Souter, I continue to think that there may be a role 


 for the courts in dealing with the timing question at 


 some point.  I think that would be --


 QUESTION:  I'm taking away from the 


 argument the impression, and please correct me if I'm 


 wrong, that you think there is a continuing role for 


 the courts to examine the reasonableness of the

 period of detention. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I wouldn't take that 


 away, Justice Kennedy.  What I'm saying is there is a 


 continuing but modest role for the courts.  The 


 habeas courts will remain open.  I mean, the import 


 of one of Justice Souter's questions is that it's 


 already too long and if somebody raised that claim, 


 if there is another petition filed, a direct petition 


 now that Hamdi has counsel that's filed in this 


 claim, and that claim is raised, we would be in court 


 vehemently saying there is no role for the habeas 


 court there.  There are troops still on the ground in 


 Afghanistan.  It makes no sense whatsoever to release 


 an individual detained as an enemy combatant in 


 Afghanistan while the troops are still on the ground 


 in Afghanistan. 


 QUESTION:  But it may make every bit of 


 sense to have an opportunity on the part of that 


 individual, before someone other than an 


 interrogator, to say, I am not the kind of person 


 that they claim I am on the basis of which they are 


 holding me. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, again --


 QUESTION:  The alternative is not give him 


 some kind of a hearing or release him.

 MR. CLEMENT:  No, but the alternative is 

 to provide a means of allowing for a military process 

 to go forward.  It's not just the interrogator.  It's 

 the original screening team on the ground in 

 Afghanistan that, as I said before, released 10,000 

 individuals out of U.S. custody.  It's the screening 

 team in Guantanamo and then it is this annual review 

 process that will go forward.  Now that is a 

 tremendous amount of process that the executive 

 branch is providing. 

 QUESTION:  That we don't have yet.  It's 

 still on the drawing board, the annual review. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  That's quite correct, 

 Justice Ginsburg, but I would say that for the time 

 being, everything provided to date is more than 

 sufficient. 

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Clement. 

 Mr. Dunham, you have four minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR. 

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 

 MR. DUNHAM:  May it please the Court. 

22 

Mr. Clement is a worthy advocate and he can stand up 

23 

here and make the unreasonable sound reasonable.  But 

24 

when you take his argument at core, it is, "Trust 

25 

us."  And who is saying trust us?  The executive

branch.  And why do we have the great writ?  We have 

the great writ because we didn't trust the executive 

branch when we founded this Government.  That's why 

the Government is saying trust us is no excuse for 

taking away and driving a truck through the right of 

habeas corpus and the Fifth Amendment that no man 

shall be deprived of liberty except upon due process 

of law. 

 We have a small problem here.  One 

10 

citizen.  We're not talking about thousands.  One 

11 

citizen caught up in a problem in Afghanistan.  Is it 

12 

better to give him rights or is it better to start a 

13 

new dawn of saying there are circumstances where you 

14 

can't file a writ of habeas corpus and there are 

15 

circumstances where you can't get due process.  I 

16 

think not. 

17

 I would urge the Court not to go down that 

18 

road.  I would urge the Court to find that citizens 

19 

can only be detained by law.  And here there is no 

20 

law.  If there is any law at all, it is the 

21 

executive's own secret definition of whatever enemy 

22 

combatant is.  And don't fool yourselves into 

23 

thinking that that means somebody coming off a 

24 

battlefield because they've used it in Chicago, 

25 

they've used it in New York and they've used it in

 The Congress needs to act here.  Justice 


3 

Souter was on point when he was talking about the 


 fact that we're two years into this thing and 


 Congress leaves all the laws on the books that relate 


 to habeas corpus and how a habeas corpus proceeding 


 is supposed to go.  They leave the 4001(a) on the 


 books that says no executive detention.  But we 


 ignore those laws, we don't enforce them.  We don't 


 require Congress to fill a gap. 


 Congress tomorrow could take these 


 military regs and they could say, this is the law, we 


 authorize the executive to detain people and to give 


 them hearings the way the military says, and then it 


 would be lawful. 


 But Congress hasn't done that and I 


 respectfully submit, Your Honors, that until Congress 


 does act, these detentions are not lawful.  And I 


 would respectfully ask this Court to step up to the 


 plate and say so. 


 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Dunham.  The 


 case is submitted. 


 (Whereupon, at 11:19 a.m., the case in the 


 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
