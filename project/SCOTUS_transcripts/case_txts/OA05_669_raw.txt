 JUSTICE STEVENS:  We'll hear argument in BP 

America Production Company against the Secretary.

 [11:06 a.m.]

 Mr. Lamken.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. LAMKEN:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may 

it please the Court:

 Section 2415(a) established a limitations period 
for every action for money damages by the Government which 
is founded on any contract.  That provision, by its terms, 
applies to every contract action, every adversary 
adjudication seeking monetary compensation for breach, 
whether pursued before a court or an agency.

 The contention that every action encompasses 
only civil actions or judicial actions is incorrect for 
three reasons.  First, it is inconsistent with the broad 
language that Congress used.  It is inconsistent with the 
statutory structure, in that it renders another provision, 
the exception for administrative offset, totally 
superfluous.  It also creates an irrationality in the 
hierarchy of the Government's claims.  Finally, it robs 
Section 2415(a) of its intended effect.
 Turning to the text, Congress

and agencies  regularly use the term "action" to refer to 
adversary adjudications before administrative agencies and 
before the judiciary.  The term --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  What --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- denotes --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I ask you, on that point --
I understand what you're saying, and I've looked at your 
authority, but, right in the provision itself, there is a 
verbal distinction made between actions for money damages, 
and what, at the end of the provision, they refer to as 
"administrative proceedings" in providing for the 1-year 
supplementary rule.  Doesn't the statute, in effect, say, 
"We don't mean, by 'action,' what we would possibly --
what possibly might be included as an administrative 
proceeding"?  If they had wanted an administrative 
proceeding to be a subset of the actions for money 
damages, wouldn't it have been sensible for Congress to 
say in -- to refer, instead of to "administrative 
proceedings," to "administrative actions"?

 MR. LAMKEN:  Well, in fact, the -- it refers to 
"administrative proceedings required by contract or law." 
And that clause applies in the particular circumstance 
where a law or a contract requires some sort of 
administrative proceeding as a condition precedent to the 
action for money damages.  So, if you can bring your

money-damages action without any prior administrative 
proceeding, regardless of where you bring --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think your point has to be 
that there are administrative proceedings that are not 
actions.

 MR. LAMKEN:  That is absolutely correct. 

Nonadversarial administrative proceedings would, 
themselves, not be actions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
 MR. LAMKEN:  And they also wouldn't be money-

damages actions.  So, the distinction the statute draws is 
not between money-damages actions in court and money-
damages actions before agencies; it's before money-damages 
actions, wherever brought, and the administrative 
proceedings that have to be brought as a condition 
precedent.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You contend that what commenced 

the action here was the order demanding payment.

 MR. LAMKEN:  That is correct.  That is the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a very weird 

commencement of an action, where what then follows is what 
is referred to as an "appeal," within the agency.

 MR. LAMKEN:  For historical reasons, the 

denominations are quite strange, but for Grisa, quoted --

our reply brief, specifically state that the order to pay 
commences the proceedings.  And so, since that is the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which says that?
 MR. LAMKEN:  It's on page 5-6 of our brief. 

It's Section 1702 of our --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What page of your brief?
 MR. LAMKEN:  5 and 6 of the reply brief.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of the reply.
 MR. LAMKEN:  Yes.  And it's 13 U.S.C. 1724, and 

it talks -- or it defines the "demand" as the order to 
pay.  And then, the definitional provisions, in turn --
when they're talking about what commences the action, it 
says that the order to pay "commences" the action.  And so 
--

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not finding it.  Where is 

it, again?

 MR. LAMKEN:  Page 6 of the reply, Your Honor, 

very top.  The citation says "13 U.S.C. 1724(b), emphasis 
added."  It defines "demand" to include an order to pay 
issued by the Secretary.  And, in the next line down, we 
say, "For Grisa thus recognizes that the so-call order to 
pay, far from concluding the action, in fact, commences 
it," because the statute of limitations prepared -- uses 
the word "commenced" to describe what the action -- the 
order to pay does.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is -- why doesn't it make 
much more sense -- as I understand the proceeding, this 
order doesn't come out of the blue.  As required, there 
has to be a letter to the -- to the payee saying, "We 
think -- we think you owe so much money."  He is allowed 
to respond, right? 

MR. LAMKEN:  That --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And then, after considering the 
response, the order issues.  Now, I would consider that a 
-- you know, an -- that sounds to me like a complaint and 
an opportunity to respond to it.  And then, finally, the 
first decision of the agency, which is then appealed --
and CFR provides for an -- what he calls an appeal.  And 
it seems to me the final opinion of the agency is the 
opinion on the appeal.

 MR. LAMKEN:  In fact, that process, which isn't 
even mentioned in the regulations, doesn't have any legal 
operative effect.  It's more like a demand letter.  If the 
lessee doesn't respond to the letter, he doesn't waive any 
of his rights.  If the Government fails to include a claim 
in its demand letter, in the -- well, in the audit letter 
-- it doesn't waive any of its rights.  The --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it doesn't --

the order without having issued the letter first, giving --

MR. LAMKEN:  I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- giving the party an 

opportunity to say why this amount isn't owed.

 MR. LAMKEN:  Well, in fact, there's nothing in 

the regulations -- and I think the Solicitor General would 
concede -- that actually requires this informal process. 
It happens to be typically done.  And the SG uses the word 
"typically" in the brief.  But there's nothing that 
requires it.  And if you don't respond, there are no 
consequences to failure to respond.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there anything that requires 

the order?

 MR. LAMKEN:  The -- anything that requires the 

Secretary to proceed by order?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
 MR. LAMKEN:  That is the Secretary's traditional 

way of doing things --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- yes, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, you could say the same for 

the other.

 MR. LAMKEN:  Oh, but it -- but there is no 

liability if the order fails to issue.  The order, if it 
were the first salvo, you still would be required to

respond.  And so, your failure to respond is very much a 
default.  The failure to respond to the letter, the audit 
letter, has no legal operative effect --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't -- you don't -- but 
you don't respond to the order; you take an appeal from 
the order.

 MR. LAMKEN:  That's correct.  You file a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me crazy to call 
that order a complaint.  I -- even if I grant your other 
argument, that an administrative proceeding can be 
commenced by a complaint -- or that the term "complaint" 
can apply to administrative proceedings, I don't think 
that what you've hung your hat on here -- namely, the 
order -- seems to  me to fit that description.

 MR. LAMKEN:  Well, Justice Scalia, it is the 
first document, which is recognized in the regulations, 
which provides the lessor of the notice of claims against 
it, the first one that's required by the regulations in 
order to commence the proceedings.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  You mean --
MR. LAMKEN:  It's recognized --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- the regulations don't refer 

to the initial letter?

 MR. LAMKEN:  No.  They don't -- the regulations

JUSTICE SOUTER:  So, they literally could start, 

absolutely out of the blue, by issuing the order?

 MR. LAMKEN:  I think that's correct.  That is 

the way that it could be done.  There's an informal 
process that's typically followed; but you could ignore 
it, and there's no legal operative effect.  So, that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I doubt whether --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- informal process --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that would --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- can't be a complaint.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I doubt whether that would 

conform with the Administrative Procedure Act.  I mean, 
either -- even at the first level of agency decision --

MR. LAMKEN:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it seems to me you have to 

give the individual an opportunity to reply.

 MR. LAMKEN:  Well, that is perhaps why the 

agency tries this -- to do the informal process.  But, in 
fact, it does not have legal operative effect.  There --
you could completely ignore that initial demand letter, 
and say, "Sorry, Agency, I'm not responding."  The agency 
then files its order.  And that's the first time you must 
register your defenses, upon failure or forfeiture --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course you can ignore it.

That doesn't prove anything.  You could ignore an agency 
complaint, too --

MR. LAMKEN:  Right. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- I mean, a formal complaint, 

in which case you'll be found liable.  What does --

MR. LAMKEN:  That's the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the fact that you don't have 

to respond have to do with anything?

 MR. LAMKEN:  The legal consequences.  It's 

exactly right, Justice Scalia.  If you don't respond to 
the demand letter, there are no legal consequences.  If 
you don't respond to the letter by filing what's called an 
"appeal," you lose.  And so, it's just like a complaint; 
you default if you fail to raise your defenses at that 
point.  In addition, Section 2415 --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  And it's also, I assume, true 

that the demand letter would not toll a statute.

 MR. LAMKEN:  No, we don't believe a demand 

letter would toll a statute, because it's not required by 
--

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- by law.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you'd win in this case even 
if it did.  I don't think that the difference between the

-- what you call the "complaint," the  order -- that time 
period doesn't put you out of -- out of the permissible 
period.

 MR. LAMKEN:  Oh, I certainly hope --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
 MR. LAMKEN:  -- hope not.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
 MR. LAMKEN:  But, in fact, Section 2415(f), 
which is on page 4 and 5 of the appendix to our brief, 
makes it clear that whether something is denominated a 
complaint or not does not determine whether or not it's 
covered by the limitations period.  2415(f) is an 
exception for counterclaims and offsets by the Government 
where a private party brings an action against the 
Government.  But counterclaims and offsets typically 
aren't brought by complaint; they're brought in the 
answer, they're submitted in the answer.  Therefore, 
whether it's denominated an "order," an "answer," or 
something else, doesn't control whether or not 2415 
applies.  2415 applies to any action for money damages 
founded on a contract, however you might denominate the 
initial filing which commences the proceedings.  In --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Lamken, the point has 

been made that there are many indications that what 
Congress had in mind was ordinary civil action in a court.

In addition to finding this provision solely in title 28, 
the judiciary code, and not in title 5, there's also, if 
you read the following provision, 2416, time for 
commencing actions brought by the United States.  And then 
it tells us the tolling periods.  And, in doing that, it 
refers twice to the "defendant," which is a term that's 
used in civil proceedings, not administrative proceedings.

 MR. LAMKEN:  Well, starting at 28 U.S.C., why 
it's there, it, in fact, applies both to administrative 
agency actions and actions in courts.  And sometimes in 28 
U.S.C. there are provisions that apply to both.  The 
Federal Tort Claims Act, for example, is in 28 U.S.C., and 
it has a provision for administrative adjustment of claims. 
People must file their claims before an agency first, and 
then the agency can do administrative adjustment.  That's 
entirely separate from the attorney general's ability to 
compromise the claim once it's filed in court.

 Section -- title 5 also contains things that 
apply to courts and agencies -- the right to judicial 
review of agency actions, the waiver of immunity that's 
necessary for those -- in addition to standards that 
govern judicial review of agency actions.  Those were all 
in title 5, but they actually apply to courts.  These --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, 2415(a), (i), we -- you, 
you cannot possibly say that that only applies to judicial

 MR. LAMKEN:  Oh, no.  That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 
MR. LAMKEN:  -- actually completely --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's in --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- superfluous.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and that's in title 28.
 MR. LAMKEN:  And that's in -- yes, that's in 

title 28, as well.

 And with respect to the term  "defendants," 

Justice Ginsburg, Congress has often used the term 
"defendants" even in the context of administrative 
actions.  The Stockyard and Packers Act of 1921 -- it's in 
7 U.S.C. 210 -- actually talks about a complaint against a 
defendant for damages, all adjudicated before the 
Secretary of Agriculture, and that was 85 years ago.  It 
seems a little late in the day now to debate whether one 
can be a defendant, the person who defends before an 
agency, as well as the defendant --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's not the typical term 
used in agency proceedings to designate the responding 
party.

 MR. LAMKEN:  Well, you can talk about the 
"responding party," or the "defendant," but the term 
"defendant" is sufficiently broad to include one who

defends or denies, and that would be a term -- and it's 
been used in the past, as long as 85 years ago -- to 
discuss the person who might be liable for damages in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the content --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- an adversary --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the content of the tolling 

provision, as well, seems geared -- seems geared to a 
civil lawsuit.  It talks about a person being outside the 
United States; therefore, they wouldn't be amenable to 
service of process.

 MR. LAMKEN:  That's certainly right.  These are 

all things that would apply, we would expect, both to 
a civil action in court and an administrative-agency 
action, as well.  They may work better for one or 
the other in different particular circumstances, but they 
are all sufficiently broad that they can be used in both 
circumstances.  And the one the Government, in the 
administrative context, would be most interested in would 
be subsection C.  When the Government just doesn't know 
the facts, or the Government reasonably couldn't know the 
facts, it gets an exception, just tolling, until it 
reasonably could have known of the fact.  And that's just 
as applicable in an action before an agency as it would be 
in an action before a court.

 In addition, the Government's contrary

construction renders an entire provision superfluous.  And 
that is the one that Justice Scalia mentioned, Section 
2415(i), which is an exception for administrative offsets. 
That exception for administrative offsets would do no work 
at all if --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't part of the 

original statute, was it?

 MR. LAMKEN:  No, that was added about 16 years 

later, Your Honor.  And it was added, but it clarifies the 
scope of the statute.  And, as this Court admitted in --
pointed out in cases like Fausto and LaFranca, the later 
amendment to a statute can clarify its meaning; and, 
indeed, statutes are ordinarily read, once amended, as if 
they existed in their amended form from the offset.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that (i) was added 
because it's -- for a very specific reason, that there was 
a debate between the Department of Justice and -- I forgot 
the other agency --

MR. LAMKEN:  The Comptroller, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- yes -- about whether an 

offset would be subject to the time limit.

 MR. LAMKEN:  That's exactly right.  And Congress 

resolved that debate by providing an exception for 
administrative offsets, and no other exception for any --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- sort of administrative 

proceeding.  And that raises the strong inference that, in 
fact, this applies to administrative proceedings, and it 
simply doesn't apply to administrative offsets, because 
they're an exception.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They could have said -- if the 

other interpretation of 2415(a), as not applying to 
administrative proceedings, were correct, they could have 
said the provisions of this section do not apply to 
administrative proceedings --

MR. LAMKEN:  That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- which would have -- which 

would have handled the offset --

MR. LAMKEN:  Yes.  It would have --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- but would have been well 

beyond the offset.  And the fact --

MR. LAMKEN:  That's exactly right.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that they only focus on the 

offset certainly suggests that when you're not talking 
about offset, it does apply to administrative proceedings.

 MR. LAMKEN:  I could not have said it better, 

and I will not attempt to.  In fact, in addition, it 
raises another anomaly in the statute, the Government's 
contrary construction.  And that is, it creates sort of an

paying money, those must be brought within 10 years, under 
the administrative offset provision that was enacted 
together with the exception in (i).  However, offensive 
administrative actions to extract money may be brought in 
perpetuity, forever.  It simply strains credulity to 
believe that Congress, at the same time it was saying the 
Government has only 10 years to assert administrative 
offsets to avoid paying money, instead intended 
administrative agencies to be able to extract money on 
that very same claim --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I can believe that they do --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- in perpetuity.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- I can -- I can believe that 

they do that.

 [Laughter.]
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But --
MR. LAMKEN:  Well, Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  By mistake.  But I would not 

assume a mistake unless it's very clear.

 MR. LAMKEN:  I think that's exactly right, 

Justice Scalia.  And that's, again, going back to Fausto,

where there is a sensible hierarchy of claims, or a 
sensible hierarchy of preferences.  The Court doesn't 
ordinarily presume that Congress put in a structure that 
doesn't respect that ordinary hierarchy.  And the 
Government's construction here is inconsistent with the 
ordinary hierarchy which allows the Government to avoid 
making payment on more favorable terms; then the 
Government gets to go in and forcibly extract money from 
private individuals.

 Finally, the Government's construction also 

undermines the intended effect of the statute.  The effect 
of statute -- the purpose of statutes of limitations --
and this one, in particular -- is to provide repose -- to 
allow the individual to know that he will no longer 
confront Government claims, to dispose of his documents, 
and also to encourage the Government to be diligent in 
pursuing its claims.  None of those purposes are achieved, 
all of those purposes are defeated, if -- once the statute 
of limitations period expires --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Mr. Lamken --
MR. LAMKEN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- could we go back to Section 

(i) for a second more?  Is it also possible to say that

that the Comptroller General was right?  And, if that's 
true, should we not accept the Comptroller General's 
reading of the entire statute?

 MR. LAMKEN:  Well, if Congress had decided the 

Comptroller General is right, and had done that in 
subsection (i), it would have written subsection (i) the 
way Justice Scalia proposed, which is to say this doesn't 
apply to administrative claims at all.  What it did is, it 
said, "Ooh, this appears to apply to administrative claims 
and the Comptroller thinks these administrative offsets are 
important, so we will give a special statute of 
limitations period in 31 U.S.C. for those, and exempt them 
from the more general statute of limitations period in 
section 28 U.S.C. 2415."  So, I don't believe that it 
should be read that way.  Is it frivolous to suggest that 
that's the reading?  No, the Government --

MR. LAMKEN:  -- the Office of Legal Counsel and 

the Comptroller on this issue.  And Congress actually 
stepped into the fray and created an exception.  But it 
created a limited exception --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Okay.
 MR. LAMKEN:  -- an exception that applies only 
to one context, and that's administrative offsets.  And 
that certainly raises a very strong inference that, where 
there isn't such an exception, the statute applies to 
administrative proceedings, more generally.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't the most likely answer 

that they just -- they saw a small problem, and they 
rendered a decision on the small problem, and they didn't 
think about it any further than that?

 MR. LAMKEN:  Well, I have a hard time 

psychoanalyzing Congress, because it's sort of a corporate 
body, and I can't tell what Member of Member of Congress 
is saying what.  But when the Court of these statutes, it 
generally reads them -- and it, in fact, avoids, whenever 
possible, superfluity.  And if this provision applies to 
administrative proceedings from the outset, subsection (i) 
is superfluous, it's -- does no work whatsoever.  And so, 
the -- when Congress amended this statute, it certainly 
clarified that, where there is no exception, this statute 
applies to actions filed in administrative proceedings.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court:

 The presumption is that the Government is not 
bound by a statute of limitations.  And, when read as a 
whole, Section 2415(a) does not overcome that presumption, 
but instead makes clear that it applies only to suits in 
court.  There are several reasons for that.  First, the 
ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms refer 
to suits in court.  Second, the statute expressly 
distinguishes between administrative proceedings and 
actions.  Third the statute's located in the judicial 
code.  Fourth, the committee reports, for those who are 
inclined to consider them, strongly support the statute's 
ordinary meaning.  And, fifth, even if some administrative 
proceedings were governed by Section 2415(a), these would 
not, because they do not involve a complaint.

 Now, on the first of those points, the term 

"action" ordinarily refers to the pursuit of a right in 
court, which just is why, just 7 years ago, in West v.

Official 

Gibson, every member of this Court agreed that the term 
"action" often refers only to suits in court, and not to 
administrative proceedings.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It often does.  It often does. 
But it does not, universally.  And there are a number of 
instances cited by the Petitioner that -- where this Court 
and -- and statutes use the term in context where it 
clearly applies to administrative proceedings.

 MR. JOSEFFER: 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, the question is, How -- you 

Well --

 

know, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to 
administrative proceedings in this case?  And I find it 
pretty absurd, because you assume, if you read that it 
way, that there is effectively no statute of limitations 
whatever for the Government in these cases.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, the structure of the law 

here is that in those instances where Congress does 
authorize administrative recovery, it ordinarily provides 
a context-specific administrative limitations period, such 
as in the Contract Disputes Act, which governs almost all 
of the contract claims the Government can pursue 
administratively.  Congress specifically enacted a 6-year 
limitations period for the submission of a claim to a 
contracting officer. 

In this unique context, however, Congress had 

23


Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

very good reasons for not applying a limitations period 
until it prospectively enacted a partial one in 1996.  The 
reason is that what Congress found here, in context of 
mineral leasing, based on the findings of an independent 
commission, was that the companies were historically on an 
honors system and had abused that by underpaying royalties 
of up to half a billion dollars annually.  So, what 
Congress directed the agency to do is to audit all current 
and past lease accounts.  One of the committee reports 
said to focus on old accounts, because this was a Congress 
that was not concerned with repose, but with getting some 
of those vast underpayments back from the companies.

 Now, when we fast-forward to 1996 --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.
 MR. JOSEFFER:  -- at that point --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  And this was the 

Congress that enacted what?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  No, I -- agreed.  What I'm 

referring to now is the Congress that enacted the mineral 
leasing provisions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh.
 MR. JOSEFFER:  -- which is not a good --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is not what we're talking 

about here.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  No, but -- well, we are, because

the structure of the law here is that Section 2415(a), as 
we see it, governs court suits.  And that works, because, 
when Congress authorizes administrative recovery, it 
almost always provides a specific -- context-specific 
administrative limitations period.

 Also, when Congress was telling the agency to 

focus on old accounts, it certainly wasn't thinking that a 
statute of limitations applied to that, and the agency, in 
that contemporary context, did not understand that there 
was a limitations period, either, because the orders that 
issued in the aftermath of the 1982 Act went back 7, 8, 9, 
sometimes more, years than that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  As late as 1978, the Justice 

Department didn't think that way, did it?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  No, the Justice Department--
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The opinion of the Office of 
Legal Counsel, in '78, was exactly what the Petitioner 
here would urge.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  No, the OLC opinion was limited, 

by both its terms and its reasoning, to administrative 
offsets, not to administrative adjudications.  And if I 
could explain that, an administrative offset occurs in the 
situation -- this is what OLC was looking at -- where the 
Government, by statute, owed retirement benefits to a 
person, and, because it thought that person owed it money,

what the Government did was to unilaterally reduce the 
retirement benefits.  What OLC opined is that that is a --
nothing more than a prejudgment attachment.  And OLC 
thought that if the Government is time-barred from 
obtaining a judgment, it should be time-barred from 
obtaining a prejudgment attachment.

 An administrative adjudication is significantly 

different, because it does provide an actual judgment. 
So, there are a couple of important points from that.

 First is that the dispute between OLC and the 

Comptroller General was limited by its terms to 
administrative offsets, although, Justice Stevens, the 
Comptroller General did opine beyond that, that the 
statute specifically applies only to suits in court.  But 
the actual dispute was as to administrative offsets.  So, 
when Congress addressed that specific dispute, as Justice 
Alito pointed out, it resolved only that specific dispute.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- excuse me -- how could 

OLC possibly think that it applied to administrative 
offsets if it didn't apply to administrative proceedings? 
I mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which 
you're urging here, which is that this statute applies 
only to judicial proceedings.  I mean, that's the point. 
Whether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position 
taken by the Justice Department was that this statute

relates to administrative proceedings.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  No, the position of OLC was 

limited to administrative offsets, and it did not -- the 
important thing is, OLC opinion did not interpret the 
statutory term "action," or, frankly, any other statutory 
term.  Instead, it had a theory, which was probably wrong, 
that administrative offsets are unique because they are 
prejudgment attachment devices.  That's the dispute that 
went to Congress, and that's the dispute that Congress 
actually resolved.

 And, in any event, going forward --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, on that theory, then, 

there was -- there was no time issue with respect to the 
right to offset, then, in the OLC's position.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  No, the OLC's view is that if the 
Government was time-barred from obtaining a judgment under 
Section 2415(a), then it would be time-barred from 
obtaining a prejudgment attachment.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but I thought your -- in 
answer to Justice Scalia, you said what was essential to 
the -- to OLC's position was that the offset is like a 
prejudgment attachment, and, in effect, it's an attachment 
without process.  If that's the case, then timing should 
have nothing to do with it.  Conversely, as Justice Scalia 
said, if timing does have something to do with it, timing

presumably derives from this provision; this provision, 
therefore, must have been assumed to apply to 
administrative proceedings.

 So, either there's no time question with respect 

to the offsets, or, if there is a time question with 
respect to the offsets, it implies an OLC position that 
this provision applies to administrative proceedings.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  What's wrong with that logic?
 MR. JOSEFFER:  I think what's wrong with the 

logic is what was wrong with the logic of the OLC opinion. 
We don't mean to defend the --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  You put me --
MR. JOSEFFER:  -- reasoning of the OLC opinion --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- in good company, but --
MR. JOSEFFER:  -- but what OLC really did say --
and Comptroller General and Congress promptly disagreed --
was that -- it didn't see a problem -- OLC didn't see a 
problem with procedurally imposing an administrative 
offset.  What it saw a problem with was, it thought if an 
-- a judgment would be time-barred, then a prejudgment 
attachment should be time-barred, as well.  I mean, that 
was the reasoning of the --

point.  The OLC opinion was -- arose in the context where 
a judgment could be obtained at all only in court.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  The point's just -- the OLC 

reasoning was admittedly somewhat odd, but that was the 
context in which Congress was responding to.  And, going

arises.  If the Government could pursue its suit only in 
court, it would be time-barred from pursuing a suit in 
court.  The question would then still arise, under the OLC 
opinion, unless it had been overruled, whether the 
Government could, nonetheless, obtain a prejudgment 
attachment, even though it cannot obtain judgment.  That's 
all that Congress was looking at there.  And, as this 
Court's recognized in cases like O'Gilvie and Vonn, when 
Congress amends a statue to resolve a specific dispute, 
oftentimes its amendments should be read as doing no more 
than that.

 We -- I agree, though, that terms -- to get back 
to the beginning of this discussion -- terms do not always 
have their ordinary meanings, but they presumptively do, 
especially when a statute must be strictly construed.  And 
here, the context confirms that "action" does have its 
ordinary meaning, for several reasons.

 First, the ordinary meanings of the other key 
statutory terms, such as "right of action," "complaint," 
and "defendant," as Justice Ginsberg pointed out, all 
ordinarily refer to aspects of suits in court.  A "right 
of action" is the right to bring a suit in court; a 
"defendant" is the person defending in court ordinarily; 
and a "complaint" is the document that initiates 
proceedings by stating a claim that's seeking relief in a

civil action, which is a suit in court.  Especially when 
those terms are used together, this Court recognized, in 
Unexcelled Chemical, that a reference to commencing a 
action by filing a complaint ordinarily refers to filing a 
suit in court, not a pleading before an administrative 
agency.  The statute then goes on to expressly juxtapose 
an action against an administrative proceeding by saying 
that the time to file an action does not run until after 
the administrative proceedings have concluded, which 
certainly gives weight to the point that the action is --
an administrative proceeding is not an action.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Would the -- at the time that 

4515 -- is that the --

MR. JOSEFFER:  It's 2415.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  20- -- I'm sorry.  At the time 

that was enacted, were there any limitations in other 
statutes on the commencement of administrative 
proceedings?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  The ones that we have found were 
-- I'm not 100-percent sure, but the ones that we -- that 
we have found and cited in our brief do appear to be 
enacted after that time.  I think the reason is that -- I 
mean, historically, administrative -- obviously, court 
suits have been around a lot longer than administrative 
adjudications.  And, as Congress has authorized

administrative adjudications, it's dealt with them on a 
case-by-case basis.  And every time that it enacted a 
context-specific administrative adjudications period since 
1966 -- in theory, it could have just done an 
across-the-board one for all agency adjudications, but, 
instead, it's chosen to deal with the context-specific; in 
part, because of the great variety of administrative 
procedure. 

I mean, as this case illustrates, a statute of 
limitations that governs a complaint in an action is just 
not going to work in a lot of administrative contexts. 
Here, there's no complaint.  An "order" is a legally 
binding order.  It doesn't seek relief, it imposes it. 
And unless it is both appealed and stayed pending appeal 
--

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about the initial letter 

that, in the agency practice, precedes the order?  I 
gather there's a letter to the --

MR. JOSEFFER:  Right.  There's -- there are 
basically three steps here.  First, there's an audit. 
Then, if the audit reveals an apparent discrepancy, the 
agency or a State with delegate authority would send an 
issue letter requesting an explanation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  An issue letter.

letter."  And then would basically request an explanation 
of the apparent discrepancy.  And then, if the agency then 
decides, after consideration of the audit and the issue 
letter, that it's appropriate to issue an order to pay it, 
will do so.  It --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sounds to me like a complaint, 

a response --

MR. JOSEFFER:  An issue letter?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and an adjudication.  I 

mean, you know --

MR. JOSEFFER:  I don't know whether you mean the 

audit --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- "We think you owe this."
 MR. JOSEFFER:  -- or the issue letter, but 

either way --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The response comes back, "I 

don't think we owe it, and here's why."  And then there's 
a ruling, "You do owe it."  And that's the order.  And 
then you can appeal it.  And the CFR refers to it as an 
appeal.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes.  Well, there are a few 

things.  First, on the -- with respect to the issue letter 
-- I mean, a complaint, functionally, is a document that 
initiates proceedings, stating it -- by stating the claim 
for relief, is seeking relief in a civil action.  With

respect to the second of those, an issue letter does not 
-- is not an allegation of wrongdoing, and it does not 
seek relief; it seeks information so that the agency can 
determine whether or not an apparent discrepancy raised by 
an audit is, in fact, a discrepancy.  But there's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It does not --
MR. JOSEFFER:  -- no claim.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- assert that there's a 

discrepancy?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, what it -- what it asserts 

is that, "We've done an audit, and the audit has raised 
the following issues" -- that's why it's called an "issue 
letter" -- "Please provide an explanation."  And it -- so, 
at that point, the agency has not decided yet whether it 
is, in fact, asserting a claim.  It's not -- and it's not 
requesting relief, which a complaint definitely does.  All 
it's requesting is information to help the agency assess 
the issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we have an example of issue 
letters anywhere?  That's not in the materials either, is 
it?  In the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
 MR. JOSEFFER:  -- I think there would still be 

about a year in dispute here.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  There would be some in dispute.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Going forward, if we --
MR. JOSEFFER:  But --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- if we agree with your 

position, the result will be that there will be a 7-year 
limitations period for oil and gas leases, but, for Indian 
claims and for minerals, there'll be no statute of 
limitations?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes, and the reason is that 

that's what Congress chose to do.  I mean, in the 
prospective 1996 Act, it --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Did they --
MR. JOSEFFER:  -- enacted the limitations --
JUSTICE ALITO:  When they enacted the 7-year 

limitation period, did they explain why they would treat 
those two situations so differently?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  No, there's no explanation.  As a 
practical matter, though, the prospective 1996 legislation 
governs a wide variety of aspects of the -- of the 
relationship between the Federal Government and the 
lessees.  And, on balance, that package was pretty 
favorable to the oil companies, and I think Congress

probably just decided not to -- to apply that to itself, 
but not to the Indians.

 Getting back to the order, though, it's not only 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do you defend against a 
claim for, you know, stuff that went on a hundred years 
ago?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, as a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I'm really very reluctant 

to -- unless there is no possible other reading of the 
statute, to think that that's -- that that's what the law 
provides, that the Government can show up a hundred years 
later, and say, "Oh, by the way, you owe all this money." 

MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, first off, until --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The company says "Gee, I -- you 

know, I don't have records from a hundred years ago."

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Right.  Well, there are a few 
points, both legal and practical.  On the legal, until 
1966 that absolutely was the law, because historically no 
limitations period ever applies against the Government. 
And that's the reason for the strict construction canon, 
that the statute applies here only if it clearly applies, 
and thereby bars the Government from forcing the law in 
the public interest.

there were no statute of limitations against any 
Government suits?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Not contract.  I mean, the 
historic rule is that the Government is not bound by 
statutes of limitations, because what it's doing is 
enforcing the law in the public interest.  Now, in 1966, 
Congress enacted Section 2415(a) so that there would 
prospectively be a contract limitations period.  But it's 
strictly construed, because of the historical backdrop and 
the importance of enforcing the law in the public 
interest.  So that's why we do have a strict construction 
canon here.  As a --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  He didn't apply against the 

Government either.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  For the same reason laches is 

never applied against the Government.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, there's no limit at all, 
and you concede that that's the case.  So, the Government 
could go back on these royalties as long as it likes.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, as an abstract theoretical 

matter, the Government could reach back many, many 
decades.  As a practical matter, though, that's never 
happened that we've gone back, say, 50 or 100 years 
and there are practical reasons for that.  First is that 
the agency does not have enough resources to audit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, there's a case involving 

the Oneida Indians, that went back quite a ways --

MR. JOSEFFER:  That's true.  It's -- I meant in 

the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- 200 years --
MR. JOSEFFER:  -- leasing context here.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.
 MR. JOSEFFER:  I didn't mean in the leasing 

context here.  But in the leasing context, one -- there 
are a couple of important points.  One is that the 
Government does not have enough resources to audit all of 
the current accounts in all of the years, which is one of 
the reasons that we need to be able to go back farther 
when we catch the violation.  As a -- but as 
a result, the notion that we're going to pull auditing 
resources off of today to do a frolicking detour into 50 
years ago, there's a reason that's never happened.

 In addition, the farther we try to go back, the 

greater the proof problems, because oftentimes only the 
companies have the information that shows what royalties 
they would owe, and if they lawfully destroy those records 
after 6 years, it makes it even harder for us to try to go 
back, because of proof problems.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's another indication.  Why 

would you allow them to destroy those records after 6

years if you -- if you thought -- if you thought that 
there was no statute of limitations to claims for these 
things?  I mean, that's just another inconsistency that --
in the statutory scheme that's created.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, no, the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say, "You can destroy your 
records after 6 years."  Well, why?  It doesn't make any 
sense.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, first, it's optional, not 

mandatory.  If they want to keep them, they --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
 MR. JOSEFFER:  -- certainly can.  But there's no 

-- and, as a practical matter -- I mean, because the 
Government bears the initial burden of going forward, if 
the company destroys the sources of proof, that's, on 
balance, going to be in its favor.  But, in addition, 
there's not a strict congruence between the 6-year 
periods, because, first, the companies only have to keep 
records for 6 years, but, in some circumstances, the 
Secretary can require they be kept for longer.  In 
addition, sometimes the statute of limitations, because of 
tolling, is much longer than 6 years; and so, the lawful 
destruction of records would still leave absence-of-proof 
issues in situations where the statute might, because of 
tolling, be much longer.  So, there's not a strict

Official 

 There is also no indication that Congress 

enacted the 6-year records-retention policy because it was 
thinking about a 6-year limitations period.  There's never 
been any linkage between the two.

 If I could briefly cover, then, also -- I mean, 

in addition to all the textual points, this is also 
located in the judicial code.  And, although it's true 
that a couple stray provisions in the judicial code apply 
to administrative proceedings, they say that expressly. 
Every time the word "action" is used in the judicial code 
-- and Petitioners identified no examples -- every time 
the word "action" is used in the judicial code, it refers 
to a suit in court, and only a suit in court.

 When a provision of the judicial code applies to 
something else, it will say so.  For example, 28 U.S. Code 
2462, which is a statute of limitations for penalty 
proceedings, refers to an "action, suit, or proceeding." 
The Federal Tort Claims Act is very clear that what 
it's talking about is submitting something to an agency.
 So, if Congress was going to legislate against 

the backdrop of a strict construction canon with terms 
that ordinarily refer to suits in court, and put the 
provision in the judicial code, I mean, that just is a 
totally irrational way of expressing intent, especially

clear -- especially a clear intent, when it's trying to 
govern administrative proceedings.

 The committee reports also strongly confirm 

that, because they not only say that the statute defines 
the time limitation for bringing an action in the U.S. 
courts, and not only use court terminology from front to 
back, they also say, like the statute, that they're aware 
of the administrative proceedings, but what they're saying 
is that the time to bring an action in the courts does not 
expire until after the conclusion of those proceedings.

 The committee has explained that the reason for 

that provision was the great number and variety of 
administrative proceedings.  So, in other words, Congress 
was saying, "There's a great variety of administrative 
procedure.  We're just not going to deal with that here. 
We're taking it off the table by saying this limitations 
period does not expire until a year after those 
administrative proceedings, whatever they might be, have 
expired."

 There's also some relevance in the fact that 

this legislation was proposed by the Justice Department as 
part of an overall package of reforms that would govern 
the civil litigation that the Department was handling in 
the courts.  It was then referred to the Judiciary 
Committees, not to the House Government Reform Committees

that might consider administrative procedure matters, and, 
as I mentioned before, was enacted as part of the judicial 
code.

 From start to finish, this legislation has never 

had anything to do with anything other than court suits, 
which is why Congress has expressly provided for 
context-specific administrative systems -- limitations 
periods -- which make sense in the context of the relevant 
administrative procedures.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, except when you -- when 
you say "this legislation," you limit it to the body of 
2415(a) and you leave out (i), which -- -- or I guess it's 
"one."  Is it?  Little -- or --

MR. JOSEFFER:  It's (i).  It is (i). 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's (i).  I mean, that clearly 

does apply to administrative proceedings.  And I could 
understand the argument that Congress was just making 
things doubly clear -- okay? -- that (a) does not apply to 
administrative proceedings.  I could understand that 
argument if the way (i) was written is, "The provisions of 
this section shall not apply to administrative 
proceedings."  And then I would say, "You know, oh, well, 
that was always the case, and this is just making it 
clear."

 It doesn't say that.  It says that -- the only

administrative proceeding that they cut out of it is these 
offsets.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  I think the reason is that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, you know, the normal rule 

is inclusio unius, exclusio alterius.  I would -- it 
means, to me, when I read the statute as a whole -- and 
that's the way I read statutes, I don't ask whether this 
section was adopted this year, and the other section was 
adopted next year -- I don't do it bite by bite; you look 
at the whole text -- and, when you read all this stuff 
together, it seems to me that the import of (i) is that 
administrative proceedings, despite the fact that "action" 
is not a very common word to use for them, are covered.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  I mean, it's -- there's no doubt 
the statute should be read as a whole.  But, as this Court 
has explained in cases like the O'Gilvie and Vonn cases 
cited in our brief, when a court's trying to make sense of 
a statute read as a whole, oftentimes it will find that 
when Congress faces a specific dispute and amends a 
statute to resolve that specific dispute, that's all it 
resolves, and there's no reason to draw further negative 
inference, especially here, as the Court of Appeals 
pointed out, where a strict construction canon applies.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the best thing you have 

going for you, really, the strict construction canon.

MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, because -- I mean, and it 

is an important point, that the statute applies only if it 
clearly applies by its terms.  And it seems to me, the 
best that Petitioners can do is to say that some of the 
statutory terms, in isolation, are ambiguous.  But that --
all that means, as I said, is that, under the strict 
construction canon, we would prevail.  And even if the 
statute governs some administrative proceedings, but not 
others, it would not govern these, for the reason I gave 
earlier, which is that there's no complaint here.  We 
talked, before, about the ways in which an order is not a 
complaint.  It's another important point, though, that in 
order not only -- it is -- not only does it not begin the 
proceedings, it normally ends them, because appeals are 
only taken about a quarter of the time.  And in some 
limited circumstances there's not even a right of appeal, 
if the Assistant Secretary issued the order.  So --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if I didn't think the 

order was a complaint, but I thought the initial letter 
was a complaint?  Would the Petitioner lose?  Because they 
never made that argument.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Correct.  It's -- the only 

argument they've ever made --

complaint.  So, they haven't preserved the point.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because you're --
MR. JOSEFFER:  But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- you made the point that 

the issue letter is just raising the issues, and it's not 
charging, as a complaint would allege, "You owe us," but 
this is, "Maybe you owe us."

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Correct.  There's no -- in an 
issue letter, there's no claim for relief, just a claim 
for the request for information, and there's no allegation 
of wrongdoing.  So, it's just not a complaint in those 
ways.  Also, it doesn't -- it's not really fair to say 
that it begins proceedings, because it comes between an 
audit and an order to pay.  So it doesn't -- and plus, 
it's, of course, not filed in a civil action.  And, in 
that respect, it doesn't satisfy any of the -- any of the 
elements of the -- of the ordinary definition of 
"complaints."

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you saying that this doesn't 
apply to any administrative proceeding, or just those that 
are structured like this one, where you don't have 
anything that's labeled a "complaint"?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  We -- well, our primary 

submission is that it does not apply to any administrative 
proceedings, for the reason -- reasons I've given, that

the ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms 
are for suits in court.  A "complaint" itself is 
ordinarily defined to be --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even if you have an 

administrative proceeding which is called a "complaint"? 
You know, I mean -- and some are, I think.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  There are -- there are some 

contexts in administrative procedure in which the word 
"complaint" is used.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that would not be covered 

by 2415(a).

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Because it's not filed in an 
"action," which refers to a suit in court, following 
occurral of a right of action, which refers to the right 
to bring suit in court, in a statute which then juxtaposes 
the terms "action" against "administrative proceedings" --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And let's assume all those 

terms are used in the agency procedure.  They're talking 
about "action," "right of action."  All those terms are 
used in the agency's procedural rules.  Would they then 
come under this thing?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  No.

be up to the agency, just by renaming their things, to 
come in or out, right? 

MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, and it's a much more --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
 MR. JOSEFFER:  -- fundamental point than that, 
too, is that what Congress was doing here was, when using 
these terms in their ordinary sense, to lay out an across-
the-board rule that applies to suits in court.

 And, finally, one thing I should also emphasize 

is that what we have in this context is a comprehensive 
administrative scheme.  Petitioners like to say that, 
"Well, we could just as easily be in court."  There's a 
reason that no administrative royalty proceeding has ever 
been brought by the Government in a court.  And that's, 
first, that Congress directed the agency to establish a 
comprehensive auditing and collection system, and then 
gave the agency administrative authority to enforce its 
administrative orders.  The only way the agency could 
administer thousands of leases with something like $9 
billion in royalties every year is to do this in an 
efficient administrative manner.

 Congress has not only authorized that, and 

ratified it, it has strengthened that scheme and told the 
agency, as I said, in 1982, to go back and look at old 
leases, precisely because Congress knew that is a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. LAMKEN:  I will endeavor not to.  Thank you, 

Justice Stevens.

 I wanted to start with the ordinary meaning of 

the term "action."  I was somewhat bemused by the 
Government's insistence that had -- the term "action" in 
West versus Gibson was construed -- it must mean an action 
before a court, and has that as its ordinary meaning.

 The Solicitor General's own position in West 

versus Gibson, on page 25 and -6 of its brief was, 
"Section 1981(a) does not, however, define the term 
'action' as being limited to judicial proceedings.  The 
statutory language, read in context, suggests that no such 
limitation was intended."

 Page 6 of the Government's reply, "The term 

'action,' in Section 1981, can reasonably be construed as

encompassing both administrative and judicial 
proceedings."

 The term "action" is a term that's used for 

adversary adjudicative proceedings, whether those are in 
court or before an agency.  It is not limited to 
administrative agency proceedings, as the Government 
itself recognized in West versus Gibson.

 There are more general terms here.  There's also 

"complaint," there's also "defendant."  There's a number 
of those.  But those general terms are also the terms of 
adversary adjudication.  And Congress uses them, as far 
back as 1921, for adversary adjudications before agencies.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Lamken, have you had any 
second thoughts about your position that it's the order, 
rather than the issue letter, that we should look at?

 MR. LAMKEN:  Well, in fact -- no.  But the --

the answer is that we didn't -- no issue was engaged as to 
what was the functional equivalent of the complaint below. 
That raised -- was raised for the first time by the 
Solicitor General in its merits brief, saying, "No, no, 
no, there's actually some stuff that comes before the 
order."

 But if -- I would encourage the Court to look at 

the definitions in FOGRSFA, 1724 and 1702(A), which tell 
you what, under -- in Congress's view, commences the

proceedings here.  And, in Congress's view, what commences 
the proceedings, what triggers the new statute of 
limitations and stops it from running, is the order to 
pay, which Congress defines as a "demand."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's true.  That's 
true.  But the provision you're arguing that you come 
under does talk about a complaint.

 MR. LAMKEN:  That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's what -- you know, 

that's what starts the 6 years running.  And it's -- seems 
to me odd to call something a "complaint" which is, in 
fact, an order.  They're not complaining about anything; 
they're saying, "Pay the money."

 MR. LAMKEN:  Actually, Justice Scalia --

you're -- you make your point, and say, "What do you say?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's only true if you 
consider an appeal to be the response.  And that's rather 
weird, that --

MR. LAMKEN:  It is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that the response to a 

complaint is an appeal.

 MR. LAMKEN:  The language that has been used, 
and -- as a result of very odd historical anomalies and 
attempts to introduce a sense of due process to these 
proceedings over time -- is odd, and it is awkward.  But 
it's clear that when Congress wrote the scope of this 
statute, it said it applies to "every action for money 
damages by the Government which is founded in contract." 
It doesn't say "actions that are begun by complaint."

 Now, the complaint is what Congress assumes will 
stop the provision from running.  And there is always, in 
an adversary adjudication, some document that functions 
like a complaint, that provides the defendant the notice 
of what the claims are against it, and to which failure to 
respond will result in default. 

We believe that the most likely thing to be the 
complaint here is, the thing that provided us with notice,

is that -- "Boys, you've got to respond; otherwise, you're 
in trouble" -- was the order to pay.  And Congress came to 
that same conclusion when it enacted -- when it enacted 
FOGRSFA and established a 7-year statute of limitations 
provision.  But if we lose 2 years of the claim, and only 
get 1 because it is the agency letter, in the Court's 
view, well, that's fine, but there's some document here 
that started these agency proceedings, and it is that 
document which is a complaint.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could you get us -- we're going 

to have supplemental material filed, the OLC opinion. 
Could you -- could you get us a -- you know, a sample of 
an agency letter?  Or, if you can't, maybe the Government 
can?

 MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, I -- that's true.  And in 
terms of the OLC letter, we offered to lodge it in our 
brief.  Unfortunately, by the Court's rules, we're not 
allowed to lodge it, unless the Court specifically 
requests it.  And so, that's why it's not there.  But we 
will get that to you, or the Government will get it to 
you, as soon as possible.

 The actual agency letter, in this case, isn't in 

the administrative record.  And it turns out that we 
haven't been able to find it, and the Government hasn't 
been able to find it.  And so, it's a letter.  It's a

demand letter, but it is a letter, and that -- the order 
to pay is actually the opening salvo in these proceedings. 
And again, what opens the proceedings in -- the Justice 
Department regulations and other regulations --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I suggest --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- to try to define --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- this, Mr. Lamken, that when 
the -- when the filing is made giving us the OLC opinion, 
you include a -- an example of such a letter?
 MR. LAMKEN:  Yes.  Yes.  Of course.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And so, we'll get a notion of 

what it looks like.

 MR. LAMKEN:  Right.  It may have to be from some 

other proceeding; it wouldn't necessarily be from this 
case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your position is, this would 
apply to the universe of administrative proceedings.  Now, 
this particular lease arrangement is taken care of by an 
express statute of limitations.  So, what we're talking 
about, for the future -- what would change under your 
interpretation?  Not gas leases, because -- there's a 7-
year limitation for both administrative orders to pay and 
--

MR. LAMKEN:  Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- court actions.

MR. LAMKEN:  Right.  It would be all leases on 

Indian lands.  It would be all leases which involve 
minerals other than oil and gas, whether it be coal, gold, 
silver, anything like that.  It would also be all claims 
before September -- all production before September of 
1996.  That introduces something of an oddity, if one 
accepts the Government's position.  It would be that, for 
all claims going forward from September of 1996, the 
Government has 7 years, but, for the prior 200 years, 
those claims persist in perpetuity.  When Section 2415(a) 
itself was enacted, Congress avoided precisely that result 
by deeming all prior claims to have accrued on the date 
the statute of limitations was enacted.  And the very fact 
that Congress didn't do that here is evidence that 
Congress -- to the extent it has anything to do with it at 
all -- is evidence that Congress, in fact, understood that 
there already was a statute of limitations applicable. 
And, in fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- it also --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What other areas would we be 

messing up by finding for you?  I mean, here, you know, if 
we don't find that this administrative action is covered 
by this statute of limitations, there's no statute of 
limitations.  But there may -- there are other -- may be

other areas covered by this text -- namely, a suit by the 
United States -- founded upon any contract expressly or 
implied in law or in fact, where there is some kind of a 
statute of limitations.

 MR. LAMKEN:  Right.  There are -- there are some 

contexts in which there already is a separate 
administrative regime which would have its own statute of 
limitations.  The Contract Disputes Act, as the Government 
points out, is one of those.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that would prevail over 

this --

MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, because the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- because it's more --
MR. LAMKEN:  -- Contract Disputes --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- specific.
 MR. LAMKEN:  -- Act has an exception at the 
front and says "notwithstanding 2415."  It's its own 
animal to itself.  And there is a clause at the front of 
2415 that says "except as otherwise provided by Congress." 
And so, Congress often takes exceptions.  And when it 
modified the Mineral Leasing Act of 1996, that was an 
exception to the 2415 regime.  So, Congress knows how to 
conduct specialized situations and take things outside of 
2415 when it needs to.  But it enacted Section 2415 as a 
catchall for all of those situations where Congress hadn't

managed to anticipate the circumstances.  And the 
Government's premise of the whole provision is that 
Congress botched it.  Congress provided a catchall that 
catches judicial actions, but leaves the Government free, 
in perpetuity, to persist -- to proceed on precisely the 
same claims for precisely the same relief, plus interest. 
And, because interest is calculated at a relatively high 
rate, that makes those old claims much, much more valuable 
than the relatively more recent claims.  And it seems 
implausible to think that Congress enacted a catchall 
limitations period with a loophole so large that it 
deprives the statute of limitations period of effect 
almost entirely.

 Finally, I'd like to say, one moment about the 
statute -- the canon of strict construction.  And that is 
that it doesn't always require the court to narrow 
otherwise broad statutory language, particularly where 
doing so would have the effect of rendering another 
provision -- here, subsection (i) is superfluous --
introducing anomalies into the statutory structure and 
depriving the statute of its intended effect, as the 
Bowers case we cite in our reply brief on page 16 makes 
clear.  And Bowers case was virtually on point.  It 
was the case where the -- it was a statute of limitations 
that could have applied to administrative agency actions,

or it could not have.  And the Court declined to accept a 
narrowing construction proffered by the Government under 
statute of strict construction because it would have 
rendered one of the provisions -- one for consent 
proceedings -- superfluous, because it would have resulted 
in anomaly, and because it would have undermined the 
premise of repose which undergirded the statute of 
limitations in that case.  Precisely the same things are 
true here.  And, for those reasons, the Court should reach 
precisely the same result.

 If there are no further questions, thank you 

very much.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Lamken.
 The case is taken -- is -- as submitted.
