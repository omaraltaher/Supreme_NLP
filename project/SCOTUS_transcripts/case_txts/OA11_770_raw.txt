 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you,

8
9  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 In Michigan v. Summers, this Court 
10
11  established a categorical exception to the default 
12  Fourth Amendment requirement of probable cause. 
13
14  warrant for contraband may detain individuals they 
15
16  executing the warrant. 
17
18  Summers exception also permits officers to detain 
19  individuals who have left the scene before the warrant 
20
21  scene do not pose an immediate threat to the safe and 
22  efficient completion of the search, the court of appeals 
23  erred by permitting their detention absent probable 
24  cause or even individualized suspicion.  Its judgment 
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, the two tests, 

actually focuses on the police officer's conduct, which 

1
2  yours seem to be the immediate vicinity test, and the 
3  Second Circuit is as soon as practical test.  Your 
4  adversaries point out that the Second Circuit test 
5
6  should be the focus of reasonableness or 
7  unreasonableness.  Your test just creates an artificial 
8  line that is subject to as much play as the other.  Why 
9  isn't the focus on police conduct the right focus?
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, let me explain, 
10
11  Justice Sotomayor, first, the sort of theoretical basis 
12  for why we're offering this line, and, second, say a 
13  word about the comparative merits of the two tests. 
14
15
16  Court is that Summers does not create a police 
17  entitlement; it is instead a rule of necessity and 
18  should be confined to situations in which a detention 
19  serves search-related purposes.
20
21  detention evaporate once an individual has left the 
22  immediate vicinity of the premises.  And, again, that's 
23  because in those circumstances a detention serves no 
24  interest in ensuring the safe and efficient completion 
of the search because the individual poses no immediate 
25

 First of all, with regard to the theoretical 

basis for the line, our fundamental submission to this 

 And in our view, the justifications for a

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  May be?  There certainly 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And what is the immediate
 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, ordinarily, the
 

1  threat to the safe and efficient completion of the
 
2  search.
 
3
4  vicinity?  How would you define that?

5
6  immediate vicinity will be the physical bounds of the
 
7  property; but, there may be circumstances in which an
 
8  individual who is just outside the physical bounds of
 
9  the property should nevertheless be detained, so to
 
10
11
12  is.  I mean, that was Summers, wasn't it? 
13
14  individual was on the premises just outside the house 
15
16  the government's words in that case, approaching the 
17  property. 
18
19  premises, he was on the sidewalk, right?
20
21  he was on the property because he was on a sidewalk that 
22  connected the front steps to the public sidewalk in 
23  front of the house.  The officers were approaching the 
24  house, about to effectuate entry.
25

that was going to be searched, and the officers were, in 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, in Summers itself, the

difference is there's no immediate threat to the 

1  the house.

3  the curtilage, Justice Scalia. 
4
5
6  officers here.  But there is a threat, I suppose, I 
7  mean, if he finds out about the search and comes back, 
8  if he sees the officers outside his dwelling, if there's 
9  somebody in the dwelling who can notify him, send him a 
message that the police are searching and he can get his 
10
11  confederates and come back. 
12
 It seems to me that you're requiring that 
13  there be a larger number of police present at the site 
14  conducting the search, being lookouts for anybody that 
15
16  leaving as they approach.  There's no immediate threat, 
17  but there's certainly a threat. 
18
19  government's approach that requires a greater number of 
officers at the site because, under the government's 
20
21  approach, you have the two officers who conduct the 
22  detention while a separate group of officers execute the 
23  search.

 And this Court, in Arizona v. Gant, 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, let me say something 

have to look at the class of cases to which the rule 
would be extended to see if the justifications apply. 

1
2  more unless they want the guy to get away, I guess, 
3  right? 
4
about this prospect that the individual will return.  We 
5
6  think that the appropriate analysis here is the analysis 
7  that this Court set out in Arizona v. Gant. 
8
9  suggested that where a categorical rule is involved, you 
10
11 
12
13  individuals who have left the scene, we believe that it 
14  is simply unlikely either that such an individual who 
has left the scene will be aware of the presence of 
15
16  police, or that such an individual will return in an 
17  effort to disrupt the search. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what if he were aware, 
18
19  or what if there was reason to think he might be aware, 
20
21  did here? 
22
23  that's simply because we believe that this should be a 
24  categorical analysis.
25

would you then allow the police to do what the police 

 Now, with regard to this class of 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, we wouldn't.  And 

 And so, again, you're looking at this entire

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, the analysis under 

1  class of cases where individuals have left the scene to 
2  determine whether the justifications for the Summers 
3  rule apply. 
4
 Now, let me provide a --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If -- if you think that 
5
6  leaving the scene -- in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, 
7  that he's leaving the scene with incriminating evidence, 
8  at that point you have -- you have a Terry stop?  And 
9  he's right at the scene; he's just leaving the premises, 
10
11
12  Terry is whether there is reasonable suspicion, a 
13  reasonable basis to believe that the individual is 
14  engaged in criminal activity --
15
16 
17 
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, ordinarily, when an 
18
19  individual is seen leaving the scene -- and suppose --

23
24  individual who is leaving the scene doesn't necessarily 
25

generally in my hypothetical?  There'd be hundreds of 
other facts, but --

know that the search is about to take place.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  And so, to provide a 

 And so we simply submit that the analysis 

1
2
3  hypothetical that will hopefully put some meat on the 
4  bones of this issue, suppose that an individual leaves a 
house, and he actually sees police officers sitting in a 
5
6  car, whether marked or unmarked, outside the house.  And 
7  it is clear that he has seen the officers.  He waves at 
8  the officers and then ambles down the street. 
 I don't think that there would be any doubt 
9
but that that individual could not be detained unless he 
10
11  did something more; unless, for instance, he engaged in 
12  flight at that point, at which point he could perhaps be 
13  detained under Terry. 
14
should be no different in a situation in which the 
15
16  purpose -- the reason why the officers are sitting 
17  outside the house is because another group of officers 
18  is about to execute the search warrant. 
 Of course, that individual --
19
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But Terry -- Terry is an 
20
21 
22 
 So -- so you're arguing we shouldn't extend 
23
24  Summers, but that leaves this very case susceptible to 
25

open question in this case.  It wasn't decided below, 
but it was raised. 

the assertion that this was a legitimate Terry stop.

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  That is correct, 

 And just to be clear about how these two 

that within the search zone, within the immediate 

cause or individualized suspicion. 

 Outside that search zone, ordinary 

1
2  Justice Ginsburg. 
3
4  doctrines work together, our submission to this Court is 
5
6  vicinity of the premises, the rule of Summers applies, 
7  so that, if officers encounter an individual within that 
8  zone while they are in the process of executing the 
9  warrant, a detention is permissible absent probable 
10
11
12  Fourth Amendment principles apply.  And, of course, 
13  under the Fourth Amendment, detentions of persons have 
14  to be justified by some degree of individualized 
suspicion; probable cause for a full-fledged arrest, 
15
16  individualized suspicion for a more limited detention 
17  under Terry. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what would you think 
18
19  of this situation?  Officers have a no-knock warrant, 
20
21  come out the door and start to go down the steps, 
22  doesn't look like that person has noticed their 
23  presence. 
24
25

 Now, they have the choice, if you prevail, 
of either rushing in and stopping the person within the 

and they're -- they're at the house.  They see somebody

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  The justifications 

individual, they have to rush in and stop him before he 
leaves the premises? 

1  curtilage, in which case they could detain the person, 
2  or they could allow the person to walk some distance 
3  outside of the site of the house and then stop the 
4  person, and that would allow them to execute the warrant 
without endanger -- without enhancing the danger to them 
5
6  from potentially armed people inside or allowing the 
7  destruction of evidence. 
 What -- in that situation, what argues in 
8
9  favor of your rule, that if they want to detain this 
10
11 
12
13  articulated by this Court in Summers, Justice Alito, and 
14  in particular what we really believe are the primary 
justifications, first, minimizing the risk of harm to 
15
16  officers executing the warrant; and, second, 
17  facilitating the orderly completion of the search. 
18
19
20
21  undermined by your rule because it requires them to stop 
22  the person on the premises and, therefore, tip off those 
23  inside, potentially, about their presence. 
24
25

 And let me say a word about --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, without 

interrupting -- in that situation, officer safety is 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  But they also have the 

choice not to engage in a detention at all. 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 But we simply believe that the 

the house, they have an entitlement to detain that 

individual.  They are search-based justifications.  And 
the mere fact that an individual is seen leaving a house 
that is about to be searched in our view is insufficient 
to give rise to reasonable suspicion. 

1
2  court of appeals' rule and with the government's 
3  submission to this Court is that it really entails the 
4  conclusion that once officers see the individual leaving 
5
6  individual, with the only open question being where and 
7  how they go about effectuating the detention. 
8
9  justifications for the detention don't attach to the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Shanmugam, when you talk 
about the justifications in your brief and just now, you 
15
16  talk about two; but, there were, in fact, three, and the 
17  third was flight.  So how is it that that's dropped from 
18  your understanding of Summers? 
19
20
21  standing on its own.  And that is simply because the 
22  justification in preventing flight is different in kind 
23  from the other two justifications that we've been 
24  discussing.
25

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, we simply think, 

Justice Kagan, that that justification is insufficient 

Official 

 And I think the fundamental problem with the

subsequently flee. 

 And just as in my hypothetical, when the 

officers are sitting outside and they see an individual 

1  special law enforcement interests, to use this Court's 
2  words in Summers.  The interest in preventing flight, by 
3  contrast, is an ordinary law enforcement interest. 
4
5
6  wander by, the mere fact that the individual saw the 
7  police and perhaps would therefore conclude that the 
8  police were on to him would not give rise to a basis for 
9  detention simply because that individual could 
10
11
 So, too, we think that preventing flight in 
12  and of itself is insufficient.  That is the ordinary law 
13  enforcement interest that requires individualized 
14  suspicion.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, can I come back 
15
16  to the facts that my colleagues have raised and break it 
17  down implicating the Terry question? 
18
19  in the house, and they saw the defendant -- two people 
20
21
22  you think -- just the stop, not the detention, not the 
23  bringing them back to the house, why do you think that 
24  just stopping them was wrong?
25

 Here, the officers had a report of something 

leaving. 

 I know Terry hasn't been decided, but why do

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Just the 

stop and the --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under Terry. 
1
2
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Sure.  Well, and first of 
3  all, I should preface what I'm about to say by noting 
4  that the court of appeals itself didn't reach the Terry 
issue, and the government doesn't advance that issue in 
5
6  its merits brief. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the court below did. 
7
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  So that would be an issue 
8
9  that would be open on remand.  And let me say why on 
10
11
12  stop would be -- but -- but they did more than just stop 
13  them.  They --
14
15
16
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- they handcuffed them. 
17
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it goes back to if 
18  a police officer saw an individual leaving the house and 
19  was concerned about them tipping someone off, et cetera, 
what would be the problem with the officer stopping the 
20
21  person around the corner, holding them, making sure 
22  people got in and then letting them go. 
23
24  because there are the two separate issues.  There's the 
question of the stop and the question of the detention. 
25

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, that's right.  The 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  And just to be clear, 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But as to the stop, the argument that we 

1  And there would be a separate question about whether 
2  under Terry a detention of a particular length might or 
3  might not be permissible. 
4
would make on remand if we were to prevail before this 
5
6  Court would be that here what you have is insufficient 
7  to meet the reasonable suspicion standard.  And what I 
8  assume that the government would argue is that the 
9  combination of the search warrant and the fact that the 
individual was seen leaving the premises that were about 
10
11  to be searched, and as to which there was probable cause 
12  to believe that contraband was present, and the fact 
13  that my client met the extremely generic description 
14  provided by the confidential informant, would be 
sufficient to give rise to reasonable suspicion. 
15
16
17  going to say, clearly we don't think that either of 
18  those factors standing on its own would be sufficient. 
19  The question would be whether that combination of 
20
21  would be sufficient, and we would submit that that 
22  combination is insufficient as well. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If they did do -- if they 
23
24  did do a Terry stop, and in the process of that stop the 
25

factors under the facts and circumstances of this case 

 Now, clearly we don't think -- I was just

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  They could very well, with 

one caveat, and that caveat is simply that the 

individual constructively possessed the contraband at 

1  contraband, guns in this house, at that point they could 
2  have turned the Terry stop into an arrest, couldn't 
3  they? 
4
5
6  circumstances under which the contraband is found might 
7  be relevant to the analysis of whether or not there is 
8  probable cause, because the question would be whether or 
9  not there is probable cause to believe that the 
10
11  issue. 
12
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Shanmugam, please help 
13  me.  I -- I don't understand why -- why the Terry stop 
14  is at issue, inasmuch as there was not a Terry stop.  I 
mean, what occurred here went well beyond a Terry stop, 
15
16  did it not?  So what do you do?  You -- you slice the 
17  baloney that thin; you say well, the -- the first stop 
18  is a Terry stop.  Oh, yes, he later went on to detain 
19  them for a long time and put handcuffs on them and take 
them back to the premises.  What -- what relevance does 
20
21  the Terry stop have? 
22
23  additional question, whether the detention in this case, 
24  which did involve taking my client and the other 
25

individual, putting them in handcuffs, putting them in 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, that would be the 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I guess -- I guess, I 

you can do that much in -- in a mere Terry stop. 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, under Terry officers 

1  the patrol car, and then taking them back to the scene, 
2  was permissible within the scope of a Terry stop.  And I 
3  think that would also be an open question, and that 
4  would particularly be an open question in a number of 
these cases in which the detention, pursuant seemingly 
5
6  to Summers, occurs over a very lengthy period of time. 
7  Under Terry, of course --
8
9  just didn't realize that it's an open question whether 
10
11
12  may detain an individual for the period of time it takes 
13  for them to confirm or dispel the suspicion, and I think 
14  that there would be an open question as to whether or 
not when officers are executing a search warrant, for 
15
16  the duration of the execution of the search warrant, 
17  that falls within the scope of that Terry test. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you explain what you 
18
19  mean by the immediate vicinity?  Is it based on -- on 
20
21  the entrance to the premises?  Is it based on how far 
22  you could see from the -- the site of the search? 
23
24  be within the physical bounds of the property.  So --
25

property line?  Is it some absolute distance from the --

but -- but if, for instance, officers saw an individual 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  I think ordinarily it will

Alderson Reporting Company

off, I think your submissions sometimes say immediate 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, and the point of --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you are much better 

1  coming out of his house and he walked out and he just 
2  happened to step -- step off the curb into the road 
3  before the officers got to them, we would say that that 
4  would satisfy the immediate vicinity standard.
5
6  the property is -- is too much.  I mean, you know, what 
7  if it's a farm and it's a 50-acre farm? 
8
9
10
11  vicinity. 
12
13  this Court the immediate vicinity standard in large part 
14  because it really is comparable to similar limits this 
15
16
17  than boundaries of the property. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well -- and to provide a 
18
19  couple of examples, under Maryland v. Buie, the case 
that permits officers to conduct a protective sweep 
20
21  incident to an arrest, the Court permits officers to 
22  search the area immediately adjoining the place where 
23  the arrest occurs and that has not proven to be a 
24  difficult standard to apply in practice.
25

seems to me identical, as you said. 

 The last one is facilitating orderly 

1  difference?  I mean, you have two officers or three.  If 
2  they go into the property and somebody's there, they can 
3  detain him, and Summers gives three reasons:  One, as 
4  Justice Kagan pointed out, preventing flight in the 
event that incriminating evidence is found.  We are 
5
6  considering now the case where, instead of going and 
7  detaining the people, the people inside the house walk 
8  out and there are two officers in a patrol car or an 
9  unmarked car outside waiting to go in.  Okay.  That 
10
11

14  so he can unlock a closet, et cetera, okay.  Identical.
15
16  for difference, it seems to me, is minimizing the risk 
17  of harm to the officers.  Now, the harm, risk of harm to 
18  the officers I guess if he goes into the house is that, 
19  well, if they leave, they might come back, goodness 
knows, and they've seen they are looking for the drugs,

22  will be a -- well, any, goodness knows what.

10
11  be my next point, Justice Sotomayor; and the government 
12  really tries to make a broader and more ambitious 
13  argument.  The government tries to make the argument 
14  that an individual with a connection to the place to be 
searched could arrive at the scene while the search is

16  ongoing, really regardless of whether that individual

I don't know the risks involved there, but I can see the

we talked about officer safety.  What about the safety 
of others?  Suppose the place being searched is adjacent 
to a playground and there are, you know, dozens of 
children playing in the playground.  The police are 
worried there would be a shootout and they want to 
detain the person, so they say:  Well, let's wait until 
he gets a block down the street and detain him there for 
the safety of the kids.  That has -- they can't do that? 
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Officers will naturally take 

precautions in situations like that.  They will go in

 And again, all of the examples that the

4  it will be a lot safer.  Can they do that and be covered

8  individual for the period of time during which they are 
9  executing the warrant, or they can detain that

13  them -- but the examples that the government cites are 
14  examples of individuals who arrive at the scene and when

16  searched, they become obstreperous; and to the extent 
17  that there is a concern about the threat posed to the 
18  safety of officers in those circumstances, we would 
19  submit that the obvious solution is to make clear that 
Summers permits the detention of individuals who arrive 
20
21  at the scene; and officers routinely do establish 
22  perimeters when they are executing search warrants.  And 
23  so when they --

 What the government is really arguing for 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, if he were to return 

1  his friend home, and he would have come back while the 
2  search was ongoing, but the police could apprehend 
3  anyone while the search -- if that's what you're saying, 
4  while the search is ongoing --
5
6  to the scene while the search is ongoing, we believe 
7  that he could be detained pursuant to Summers, and we 
8  cite a number of court of appeals cases that have so 
9  held.
10
11  here is an even more ambitious rule, an additional layer 
12  of Fourth Amendment prophylaxis, if you will, that 
13  permits officers to detain an individual who is seen 
14  leaving the scene based on the possibility that they are 
going to return.  The government has not come even close

16  to making an empirical case as to why that additional

Justice Alito, the search team is marching up to the 
5
6  house, and they encounter the individual 50 feet away 
7  from the door or the property line while they are in the 
8  course of doing so, the justifications of Summers kick 
9  in at that point.  That individual is aware of the fact 
that the police are about to search his house, and, as 
10
11  such, that individual poses a threat to the safe and

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the problem.  The

that sometimes they can keep the people there, and you 
5
6  are saying, but they can't stop them from leaving if 
7  they're not -- all of a sudden, I'm a policeman, and I 
8  don't know what to do exactly because I don't know how 
9  to fill in that blank.  And therefore, I might rush 
in -- I don't know -- I see a recipe for a mess, and

that's what -- and the mess could involve physical harm,

4  but.  It comes very close to the facts of the Cochran 
case out of the Sixth Circuit.  Police arrive at the 
5
6  scene.  The occupant is known to carry a gun, and he has 
7  a guard dog.  So, rather than walk up to the door, they 
8  wait for him to leave; but, by the time they can catch 
9  up to him, he's off of the bounds of the property, but 
he's still very close to the residence.  They stop him.

They take him back to the residence.  He lets the 
officers in.  He secures the dog, and they complete the

12  that is, Justice Ginsburg, that the police see someone

8  you have smaller police departments in rural areas.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're missing the 
point, which is that's going to happen regardless, 
meaning that risk exists whether the person left the 
minute you got there or a minute before or an hour 
before or two hours before.  That's the whole point, 
which is the risk is extant no matter what. 

 The question is, do we want to increase that 
risk to officers?  Here, Petitioner is leaving, he'll be

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me what 

the premises against somebody entering. 

 MR. WALL:  Justice Scalia, first, that isn't

3  having -- having sufficient personnel to follow these 
4  persons, but not having sufficient personnel to defend

9  their assistance in the orderly completion of the

11
12  constitutional right entitles you to stop someone from, 
13  using the word, "fleeing"?  You certainly are entitled 
14  to stop someone with whom you have reasonable suspicion. 
But what constitutional right entitles you to stop a 
15
16  person who's just leaving in the normal act, without 
17  reasonable suspicion? 
 MR. WALL:  Justice Sotomayor, I think your 
18
19  question fills in the answer.  What the Court said in 
20
21  at a home or you see them leaving at a time when a 
22  neutral magistrate has determined there's probable cause 
23  to believe a crime is being committed inside, you have, 
24  in the words of the Summers Court, "articulable and

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Wall, you have 
3  that, too, about the person in her workplace, and you 
4  said that your argument didn't apply to the person in 
her workplace.  So you have to come up with something 
5
6  better than that.  And I guess the question is your rule 
7  would seem to encompass, you know, a whole set of people 
8  who are leaving their houses for ordinary reasons:  I'm 
9  going to work in the morning.
10
11  stop this person who's going to work in the morning, 
12  who's given no indication that he's seen the police 
13  officers at the scene, no indication that he's coming 
14  back immediately or, you know, in any amount of time

 And that's not an outlier case.  It seems to 
17  me that the hypothetical I just gave you might very well 
18  be the more common case than the hypothetical that you

1  making here could translate.  And I think when those 
2  cases come to the Court, the Court will have to decide 
3  whether to recognize doctrines analogous to Summers or 
4  Terry in those contexts.  But that's not what Summers is

8  connection at issue here. 
9
Does Summers apply and does this apply only when the 
10
11  police are in the process of executing a valid search 
12  warrant? 
13
14  Petitioner, the way I read his briefs, concedes that if 
police had caught him outside the basement apartment or 
15
16  somewhere within the property bounds --
17
18  executing the valid search warrant walked through the 
19  gate and at that moment the individual emerging from the 
house had not yet passed through the gate, then under 
20
21  Summers the police would have the right to detain him. 
22
23  walked through the gate.  All right.  Now, I guess the 
24  police -- all right, I see.  The police objection is:  I 
25

don't know.  These things are complicated and we might 

 All right.  So the question here is he's

through the gate, he's just as much of a flight risk, a 
danger to officers and just as able to assist in the 
orderly completion of a search.

9  central contention is there's nothing magical about the

11 
12

16  of the house.  What we're trying to apply here is an 
17  absolute rule to make it unnecessary for the officers to 
18  guess whether they can do this or that.  And the rule 
19  you propose is, well, you know, a mile away.  What's

4  absolute rule governing the -- the search of a home.

5
6  rule and it tells you who, it gives you a who, who is 
7  detainable.  People we find --
8
9  where.  You need more than a who.  You need a who and a

13  premises at a time when a magistrate has determined 
14  there's probable cause to believe a crime is being

22  probable cause.  So you are taking the exception, which 
23  was tied tightly to the house.  You want him to stay on 
24  the premises so he can -- there won't be any risk that 
he's going to disrupt the search, but it was -- it was 
25

 And so today you say, oh, well, we're not --

1  an exception to the main Fourth Amendment rule, and now 
2  you are asking to have that exception spread. 
3
4  we're not asking if the person gets to her workplace, 
but that the police, but maybe why -- why not?  I mean, 
5
6  you -- it's one thing to confine Summers to the house, 
7  the immediate premises, and another to say seven-tenths 
8  of a mile away, that's okay, too. 
 MR. WALL:  Justice Ginsburg, I think the 
9
reason Summers carved out the rule is it said, look, 
10
11  for -- for current and recent occupants as a class, 
12  we -- officers see, they find or see them at a residence 
13  where there's probable cause to believe a crime is 
14  committed, so across the board we've got reasonable 
15
16  not going to rebalance every time. 
17
18  across-the-board is a set of people who are at the house 
19  when you want to search the house.  And of course,

 MR. WALL:  Justice Kagan, as far as we know, 

1  indication that they've seen the police officers; 
2  they're going to work.  But we get to detain them, too, 
3  just because we have a warrant to search the house.  And 
4  the question is why?
5
6  George Summers was going to work.  I mean, George 
7  Summers was detainable, as was Petitioner here, on his 
8  view if we had caught him within the physical bounds of 
9  the property.  The question is not, you know, how to 
apply it in that circumstance.  It's does something 
10
11 
meaningfully -- meaningful change when he hits the 
12 
sidewalk or the neighbor's yard? 
13
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, something meaningful 
14  very -- very much changes.  Before, you're dealing with 
15
16  trying to search the premises.  And now you're talking 
17  about a person who is going to work, leaving the 
18  premises, letting you search the premises without any 
19  interference.
20
21  explains why you couldn't let George Summers go on his 
22  way, and it doesn't explain why the Court in Summers 
23  didn't say, look, rather than roam the house, if it 
24  really is true that once we let you outside the front 
door or the front gate, you are no longer a danger and

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You have to draw a line 

1  are likely only to be a hindrance, why not give you the 
2  option to leave.  Turn them out, because on Petitioner's 
3  view, they're safe to go.  And what the Court in Summers 
4  recognized is, no, important interests are served by 
5
6
7  someplace.  When he is descending the steps to his 
8  house, he is still associated with the house.  And once 
9  he steps over that line, the Summers rationale it seems 
10
11
12  maybe you can explain it to me.  They stop him 
13  seven-tenths of a mile away.  By that time, the search 
14  is ongoing.  They have found guns and contraband.  They 
15
16  was the reason for taking?  There was nothing there that 
17  he could -- he couldn't obstruct the search.  He was in 
18  handcuffs.

17  that -- assuming that's true, then they took him back to 
18  the scene to complete the search, by which time they had 
19  found the drugs and the guns, and then they did arrest 
him.  And he has not claimed that at that point there 
20
21  wasn't probable cause for an arrest.  But these risks 
22  are real, and they do play themselves out in the cases, 
23  Justice Kagan --
24

to take the case on the assumption -- I agree with you 
there probably was probable cause -- but I think you 
have to take the case on the assumption that there was 
no probable cause to arrest, because they didn't -- they 
did not rely on that authority.

7  of the Fourth Amendment? 
 MR. WALL:  Of course.  A very brief Terry

don't return.  So we're just going to hold them in 
place.  We don't have to drag them in a car back to a 
place they just left.  We're just going to stop them in 
place to get a phone call that everything's all clear.

is that courts will apply Terry the way that they have,

 So the only realistic additional threat is 

1  Justice Sotomayor, you can imagine a case where they 
2  execute the warrant, and it takes them a while to find 
3  something.  And, in the meantime, they stop a departing 
4  occupant, he's not carrying a gun, he answers the 
questions and does not arouse the officer's suspicion, 
5

7  the search is ongoing, and now he knows about it. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what?  What's he going

14  because we think you might tell us where the drugs are.
 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, I 
15
16  think it is one of three legitimate law enforcement 
17  interests where you have someone for whom there is 
18  articulable and individualized suspicion to believe that 
19  they are connected to criminal activity.
20
21  absolutely right.  You do find people securing guard 
22  dogs, moving families out of harm's way, providing keys 
23  so that officers don't have to break in and harm 
24  property or jeopardize third parties.  You find them 
25

handing over contraband rather than endanger officers.

 Now, this -- the situation in this case and

4  circumstance-driven power, Terry.  Your power is really 
going much more broadly, because you're basically saying

6  if that -- if probable cause exists to search a premise, 
7  it exists without being tied to an individual because 
8  anybody who leaves the house, whether or not they have 
9  been tied to a crime in that house in the past or not,

 So we have evidence that only a husband is 
12  involved in a fraud, and his wife is leaving for work. 
13  Because she was observed leaving the house, she can now 
14  be stopped a mile away.

17  rationale of the Court in Summers.

7
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but the
 
8  question is whether you have to detain them to do
 
9  something you're saying they'd want to do.

10
11  saying that every time somebody could be helpful in a 
12  search you could go out and detain them.  It is an 
13  exception to the normal probable cause requirement, but 
14  it's an exception analogous to Terry because you've got 
reasonable suspicion.  And the question is there, okay, 
15
16  as a categorical rule, you know you've got reasonable 
17  suspicion for this entire group of people, current and 
18  recent occupants; what reasons do police have to detain 
19  them?
 And there are really good reasons.  One, 
20
21  they tend to flee.  And we see that in Cavazos out of 
22  the Fifth Circuit.  Two, they provide assistance in the 
23  search; and three, they are often violent or aggressive 
24  individuals.
25

 I don't think it's irrelevant that the vast

and volatile situation in executing these warrants. 

 And I think Petitioner takes those risks way 

grappling with this every day, and what these opinions 
reveal is that these risks cannot be so easily 
dismissed.  They are serious and they are real, and we 
see them play themselves out across this entire set of 
cases.

1  majority of search warrants for contraband are for guns 
2  and drugs, and you see a number of amici states in here 
3  saying:  Look, this is a legitimate and important law 
4  enforcement practice for officers in a very dangerous 
5
6
7  too lightly, and will not -- steadfastly refuses to 
8  engage the realities on the ground that we see in the 
9  cases.  Judges and the Federal and state courts are 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  kinds of things that the Court tends to be worried about 
17  in Fourth Amendment cases:  Abuse and police 
18  entitlement.  Again and again, you see police detaining 
19  departing occupants a very short distance from a 
20
21  not engaging in exploitative questioning, and actually 
22  serving the three interests that the Court identified in 
23  Summers. 
24
25

 And to be clear, Petitioner's solution is 
more than just a solution in search of a problem; it

a number of cases where police can't catch up to a

2  under-inclusive.  It will not capture any number of 
3  cases where there are valuable law enforcement interests 
4  to be served.  And it will produce very silly results in 
5
6  departing occupant for one reason or another until after 
7  he's crossed some magical gate, and they will have to 
8  sit on their hands until he returns so that they can do

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They can follow him.

 MR. WALL:  They can, but, Justice Ginsburg,

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

 First of all, having suggested in its brief 

1  number of exceptions to the probable cause requirement 
2  in reasonable suspicion cases.  This is another, and it 
3  serves very valuable interests in this case and others. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
4
 Mr. Shanmugam, you have 3 minutes left. 
5
6
7
8
9  Justice.  Just -- just a couple of points.
10
11  that the police may detain any individual with a 
12  connection to the place to be searched under Summers, 
13  the government today falls back to the view that the 
14  police may detain any individual with an observed 
connection, suggesting that this Court can leave for 
15
16  another day the question of whether to detain people 
17  with a certain but non-observed connection. 
18
19  on at least five occasions today that that observed 
connection is sufficient to give rise to reasonable 
20
21  suspicion.  That was not the basis on which this Court 
22  adopted its categorical rule in Summers.  If it had 
23  been, the discussion of the special law enforcement 
24  interests supporting the rule would have been entirely 
25

 Leaving that aside, the government suggests 

superfluous. 

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And it's for that reason we would
 

justifying the detention of specific individuals. 

 And this Court's subsequent cases applying 

1
2  respectfully submit that the Court made clear in
 
3  footnote 19 that Summers permits officers to detain
 
4  individuals regardless of the quantum of proof
 
5
6
7  Summers have made clear that Summers permits the 
8  detention of individuals with no apparent connection to 
9  the criminal activity being investigated.
 And that leads into my second point, which 
10
11  is that Terry will serve as a fallback in many of these 
12  cases to permit detentions of individuals who are seen 
13  leaving the premises, where there is a sufficient 
14  additional basis to give rise to reasonable suspicion. 
In fact, it may very well be the exception to the rule 
15
16  that you have a case in which there aren't sufficient 
17  additional articulable facts to give rise to reasonable 
18  suspicion. 
19
20
21  underscores why the expansion of Summers that the 
22  government is seeking is really unnecessary. 
23
24  that Justice Scalia made, that the fundamental flaw with 
25

falls within that exceptional category, but it really 

the government's position is that it really can't be 

 We would respectfully submit that this case 

 I would just note, in response to a point 

59

of the premises. 

 And the problem with the government's 

to detain anyone with a connection or an observed 
connection to the place to be searched that operates 
alongside the warrant-conferred right to conduct the 
search. 

1  reconciled with any original understanding of the Fourth 
2  Amendment.  There's no historical evidence suggesting 
3  that officers at the time of the founding or thereafter, 
4  when executing search warrants, detained the occupants 
5
6
7  approach is that it really would convert any search 
8  warrant into a search and seizure warrant.  It would 
9  really would suggest that there is a freestanding right

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You think the original 
18
19  understanding was that what happened in Summers was 
okay, but if you get out of the immediate vicinity, 
20
21  that's where they drew the line? 
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  We're not challenging the 
22
23  rule of Summers itself.  We're simply suggesting that 
24  there's no historical basis for that rule, and for that 
25

reason we think that any expansion of Summers would 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What -- would you say the 

same thing about the exact situation in Summers? 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  No, we wouldn't,

effectuate entry when the detention took place. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you can say there was 

1  really be of questionable validity.  In Summers itself, 
2  the detention was truly incident to the execution of the 
3  warrant because, after all, the officers were 
4  approaching the house and literally just about to 
5
6
7  a historical basis for the rule, in that officers have 
8  always been allowed to take necessary action to protect 
9  themselves.  And that's the principal justification.
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Perhaps, but we have been 
10
11  unable to find any examples of detentions of occupants 
12  of the premises until at least 1880.  And our point is 
13  simply that the detention ceases to be truly incident to 
14  the search where the individual has left the scene.  The 
15
16  point.
