 As a general matter, a payment from one 
12  business to another in exchange for the recipient's 
13  agreement not to compete is an paradigmatic antitrust 
14  trust violation.  The question presented here is whether 
15
16  encompassed within the settlement of a patent 
17  infringement suit.  The answer to that question is no. 
18
19  suits are objectionable for the same reasons that 
20
21  They subvert the competitive process by giving generic 
22  manufacturers an incentive to accept a share of their 
23  rival's monopoly profits as a substitute for actual 
24  competition in the --
25

such a payment should be treated as lawful when it is

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why are payments not

exclusive -- exclusive rights to sell in a particular 

1  to compete different from, let's say, dividing a market? 
2  I mean, suppose there's a lawsuit, somebody challenging 
3  the validity of the patent and the patentee agrees to 
4  allow the person challenging the patent to have 
5
6  area. 
 Does that violate the antitrust laws? 
7
 MR. STEWART:  I mean, there are really two 
8
9  differences between that -- that scenario and the one 
presented here.  The first is that an exclusive license 
10
11 
is expressly authorized by the Patent Act, in Section 
12 
261 of Title 35, but -- but the second thing is --
13
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that doesn't 
14  impress me.  What else?  What's your second point? 
(Laughter.) 
15
16
 MR. STEWART:  The second thing is that an 
17  exclusive license doesn't give the -- the infringement 
18  defendant anything that it couldn't hope to achieve by 
19  prevailing in the lawsuit.  That is, if the -- at least 
any right to compete that it wouldn't get by prevailing 
20
21  in the lawsuit. 
22
23  be able to sell wherever it wanted to. 
24
25

 Now, there may be some --

 MR. STEWART:  But the point of --
2
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So instead of giving them a 
3
4  license to compete -- you know, we'll short-circuit the 
5
6
 MR. STEWART:  But the point here is that the 
7  money is being given as a substitute for earning profits 
8  in a competitive marketplace.  That is, in -- in the 
9  Hatch-Waxman settlement context, by definition, we have 
a disagreement by parties as to the relative merits of 
10
11 
the infringement and -- and/or validity questions as 
12 
to the patent infringement suit. 
13
14  and infringed.  The generic is saying either that the 
15
16  infringing or both.  And if the generic wins, it will be 
17  able to enter the market immediately.  If the brand name 
18  wins, it will be able to keep the generic off until the 
19  patent expires. 
20

subject of compromise would be to agree upon an entry 
date in between those two end points, just as the 
parties to a damages action would be expected to settle 
the case by the defendant agreeing to pay a portion of 
the money it would have to pay if it lost.  That's an

MR. STEWART:  Yes, if you adopt Respondent's

2  with that. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Stewart, do you have a

4  case in which the patentee, acting within the scope of 
the patent, has nonetheless been held liable under the 
5
6  antitrust laws --

23  period that the patent was in effect, and yet, the Court 
24  found antitrust liability in each of these. 
25

conception of what it means to act within the scope of 
the patent.  And let me explain.  When Respondents 
say that the restrictions at issue here are within the 
scope of the patent, what they mean is that the goods 
that are being restricted are arguably encompassed by 
the patent and the restriction doesn't extend past the 
date when the patent expires. 

Wrinkle, in Line Material, they would all have been off 

 That's all they mean.  And if that were the 

Now, the way that Respondent tries to 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

Now, Respondents say, well, that's 

consistent with their theory because the restriction 
imposed went beyond the scope of the patent because the 
right to control resale is not one of the rights that 
the Patent Act confers. 

But if that's the test for whether a 

1  explain Masonite, for example, Masonite involved a 
2  resale price maintenance agreement in which the 
3  patentholder sold goods and then attempted to control 
4  the price at which they would be resold, and the Court 
said that under the rule of patent exhaustion, the 

5
6  patentholder didn't have the right to do that and 

7  therefore the patent laws provided no shield and the 

8  agreement was held to be a violation of the antitrust 

9  laws.

23  non-sham allegation that a particular mode of 
24  competition would be an infringement of its patent, the 
25

restriction is within the scope of the patent, then we 
would say that it's not met here because there's nothing 
in the Patent Act that says you can pay your competitor 
not to engage in conduct that you believe to be 
infringing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Stewart, does this 

Schering-Plough case, that was also before the Eleventh 
Circuit, that the government was not taking that 
position it is now taking. 

 MR. STEWART:  Well, the FTC has consistently 

cases in which the patent holder has a non-sham

4  infringement has occurred.  We are just talking about

9  the idea from the briefs that at the time of this

13
14  taken this position.  The Department of Justice, up 
until 2009, we didn't endorse the scope of the patent 
15
16  test.  Indeed, in our invitation brief in Joblove we 
17  specifically said that the scope-of-the-patent test 
18  was -- didn't provide for enough scrutiny of these 
19  settlements. 
20

of Justice advocated, instead was a test that would 
focus on the strength and scope of the patent.  That is, 
the likelihood that the brand name would off --
ultimately have prevailed if the suit had been litigated 
to judgment. 

But what we advocated -- what the Department

 And in 2009, for the first time in an amicus 

way, that --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's -- that's my 

 MR. STEWART:  We would say that that's not a 

presumptively unlawful with the presumption able to be 

1
2  brief filed in the Second Circuit, we took essentially 
3  the position that we're taking here, that is that 
4  agreements of this sort should be treated as 
5
6  rebutted in various ways. 
7
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And one way is to assess 
8  the validity or the strength of the infringement case? 
9
10
11
12  concern, is your test is the same for a very weak patent 
13  as a very strong patent.  That doesn't make a lot of 
14  sense. 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
 Now, it probably is the case that our test 
22  would have greater practical import in cases where the 
23  parties perceive the patent to be --
24
25

MR. STEWART:  Well, the test is whether 
there has been a payment that would tend to skew the 
parties' choice of an entry date, that would tend to 
provide an incentive for the parties to -- for the 
generic to agree to an entry date later than the one 
that it would otherwise insist on. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why wouldn't that 

determination itself reflect the strength or weakness of

 MR. STEWART:  Well, I think in the kind of 

 And so if the parties believe that the brand 

name was likely to prevail, then if the brand name 

parties simply agree to a compromise date of generic 

1  the patent so that the market forces take that into 
2  account? 
3
4  settlement that we would regard as legitimate, where the 
5

7  account their own assessment of what would likely happen 
8  at the end of the suit. 
9
10
11  agreed to early generic entry at all, it would 
12  presumably be for a fairly small amount of time. 
13
14  believe that the generic -- that the brand name had a 
weak case and the generic was likely to prevail, then 
15
16  they would negotiate for an earlier date.  And the 
17  problem with the reverse payment is that it gives the 
18  generic an incentive to accept something other than 
19  competition as a means of earning money.

tried to cover its tracks in later amendments, right, 
which -- which deter these, these -- these payments. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, and so -- and so do 
1
2  suits against this kind of payment.  And I have -- I 
3  have the feeling that what happened is that Hatch-Waxman 
4  made a mistake.  It did not foresee that it would 
5
6
 And in order to rectify the mistake, the FTC 
7  comes in and brings in a new interpretation of antitrust 
8  law that did not exist before, just to make up for the 
9  mistake that Hatch-Waxman made, even though Congress has 
10
11 
12
 MR. STEWART:  Congress has tried to reduce 
13  the incentives for these payments to be made.  I mean --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So why should we overturn 
14
understood antitrust laws just to -- just to patch up a 
15
16  mistake that Hatch-Waxman made? 
17
 MR. STEWART:  Well, a couple things I would 
18  say.  First, I don't think we're -- we're not asking you 
19  to overturn established antitrust laws.  To take another 
analogy, for example, if Watson instead of developing a 
20
21  generic equivalent to AndroGel, had developed an 
22  entirely new drug that it believed would be better than 
23  AndroGel for the same conditions and if Solvay had paid 
24  Watson not to seek FDA approval and not to seek -- to 
25

market the drug, I think everyone would agree that that

 And so when we say it's unlawful to buy off 

 To focus on the distinction between 

Hatch-Waxman and other patent litigation, Professor 

uncertain competition, it's unlawful to buy off 

1  was a per se antitrust violation, even though Watson's 
2  ultimate ability to market the new drug would depend on 
3  FDA approval that might or might not be granted. 
4
5
6  competition, even when the competition might have been 
7  prevented by other means, we are just enforcing standard 
8  antitrust principles. 
9
10
11  Hovenkamp's conclusion is that the reason that you don't 
12  see payments like this in the normal patent infringement 
13  suit is that in the typical market if a patent holder 
14  were known to have paid a large sum of money to a 
competitor who had been making a challenge to the 
15
16  patent, if other competitors knew that that had 
17  happened, then they would perceive that to be a sign 
18  that the patent was weak and that they would leap in. 
19
20
21  unique incentives to the first paragraph 4 filer.

difficult for that to be done because Hatch-Waxman gives 

 But he says Hatch-Waxman makes it more 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that the 18 -- the 

 MR. STEWART:  It's a 180-day period of 

exclusivity. 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Congress granted the 180-day exclusivity 

period because it wanted generics to have ample 
incentives to challenge patents that were perceived to 
be weak. 

 And if the first filer is able to essentially 

 MR. STEWART:  Yes, and the way it works is 

1
2  yes. 
3
4  that the exclusivity period is not good in and of itself 
for consumers.  That is, during the period when one 
5
6  generic is on the market and the others are not yet 
7  allowed to compete, you have essentially duopoly 
8  conditions, the price of the -- the drug drops but only 
9  by a little bit. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  other than early entry into the marketplace, then other 
17  potential competitors face barriers to entry that

19  other industries.

that's rather thin, I think.  I don't know how -- I don't 
have the ability to assess that and the significance of 
it, empirically.  The thing I wonder, therefore, you said 
this is common in antitrust?

 I mean, is that what you want us to say?  It 
14  didn't seem as if in your briefs as if you were.  Either 
15
16  I don't mean to be pejorative, but it's rigid -- a whole 
17  set of complex per se burden of proof rules that I have 
18  never seen in other antitrust cases, I -- my question is,

sometimes there are business justifications, so Judge, 
15

4  Are there anticompetitive effects? 

I have 32 briefs here that explain very 
5
6  clearly what you said in a sentence.  It may be that 
7  they're simply dividing the monopoly profit.  I 
8  understand that -- you know, I can take that in and so 
9  can every judge in the country.  And what's complicated 
10
11
 And then I have some very nice dark green 
12  briefs that clearly say, four instances, maybe five, 
13  where there would be offsetting justifications.  I think 
14  they can get that, too.

23 
24 
25

MR. STEWART:  Well, certainly our proposed 
approach accounts for that.  It provides -- it provides 
really two different forms of rebuttal.  First our 
approach says, this is on its face an agreement not to 
compete, the generic has agreed to stay out of the 
market for a defined period of time, and the payment 
gives rise to an inference that the agree -- that the 
delay that the generic has agreed to is longer than the 
period that would otherwise reflect its best assessment 
of its likelihood of -- of success in the lawsuit. 

But then we say, there are basically two 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And then second, we're at least accepting 

1  different types of ways in which the presumption could 
2  be rebutted.  First, the parties can show that the 
3  payment was not in consideration for delay, that there 
4  was some other commensurate value transferred, and the 
payment -- and that arrangement would have been entered 
5
6  into even without the larger settlement. 
7
8  the possibility that brand names and generics could come 
9  in and say, even though our payment was for delay, even 
though we can't identify anything else that the payment 
10
11 
could have been consideration for, it's still, quote, 
12 
"competitive" under --
13
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And they mention at least 
14  two others.  The first one they mention is because the 
person's already in the market thinks that the next year 
15
16  or two or three years is worth $100 million a year, and 
17  the person who's suing thinks it's worth 30 million a 
18  year.  And so he says, hey, I have a great idea, I'll 
19  give him the 30 million and keep the 70.  And -- and 
20
21  what's going on. 
22
23  that it's very hard to break into a market.  So for the 
24  new generic to come in, he's thinking, giving me two 
25

that, I don't see why that's anticompetitive if that's 

 And the second instance they bring up is 

years isn't worth much because I'll spend a lot of

can start up a distribution system.  The second seems 

 The problem of deciding whether other 

1  money, it's very hard for me to do it.  But the 
2  defendant -- the defendant who wants this patent kept 
3  intact says, I will not only let -- I'll let you in a 
4  year earlier and I'll give you enough money so that you 
5
6  procompetitive, the first, neutral. 
7
8  matters are or are not really payments for something 
9  else, a true nightmare when you start talking about five 
drugs and different distribution systems and the matter 
10
11 
of whether you're paying for litigation costs, a matter 
of great debate for the judge.  Okay, that's the 
12 
13 
arguments that they make.  Go ahead. 
14
15
16  to the extent that these inquiries are difficult, 
17  they're difficult only by -- because the brand names and 
18  the generics have made them difficult by tacking on 
19  additional transactions to their settlement proposal. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

And to take an analogy, there are government 
ethics rules that say that -- what are called prohibited 
sources.  Basically, people who have business before the 
department can't give me gifts as a government employee. 
Now, obviously, it would be absurd to have a rule that 
said a prohibited source couldn't give me a Rolex watch,

19  of the agreement is the brand name pays the generic a 
lot of money, that that would be a legitimate agreement 
20
21  because the restriction would apply to arguably patented 
22  drugs and it wouldn't extend beyond the date of patent 
23  expiration.

 The brand name is never going to say, well,

3  compromise date of entry, but they couldn't agree. 
4  The -- the brand name said beginning of 2017 is the 
5
6  of 2015 is the latest date that we would accept.

 Now, the Respondents use the term "bridge 
8  the gap," but there's obviously no way that a payment

13  going to pay you a whole lot of money, then I'll let you 
14  in earlier and accept a -- a diminution of your profits. 
The brand name is going to say, if I pay you money, I'm 
15
16  going to insist on deferring entry even later than the 
17  2017 date that would otherwise be my preferred 
18  compromise.

You seem to be arguing that this is price

7  has to fall into something greater than the rule of 
8  reason.

12  charge.  The generic is agreeing to stay off the market 
13  first.  But that would be treated as per se --

3
 Just as if the party -- if someone was 
4  entering into a license agreement with -- with someone 
who had a product that they claimed did not infringe the 
5
6  patent, they sat down, negotiated a license and resolved 
7  it --
8
9  that they're not sharing the profits. 
MR. WEINBERGER:  Yes.

12  that a -- a product's been licensed and the -- that's 
13  normal.  The infringer is now paying the other side 
14  money to sell that product. 
15
16

18  suggests something different, that they're sharing 
19  profits. 
I don't know what else you can conclude.

22  think that's correct, and that's because many license 
23  disputes are, in fact, resolved by the -- the alleged 
24  infringer exiting the market for a period of time, or

agreeing to stay off until a certain time.

11  There's always an argument to be made with any delayed 
12  entry situation that monopoly profits are shared. 
13  That's just -- just inherent in the nature of it. 
14
15
16  anyone is agreeing to a delayed entry, and there's any 
17  other value that's being exchanged in that situation,

that every single patent dispute, would, especially in

 All they have to do is -- is file an ANDA,

19  drugs, that's not a lot, and certify it.  And the FTC's 
own studies have shown that it takes a very small chance

because a generic is given the right to certify against 
the patent and then basically challenge the patent 
without having actually developed the product, gotten a 
marketing force, gotten a factory, putting the product 
on sale and taking the risk that everyone else who 
challenges a patent has to take.

1  sounds like an argument, a discussion that you’d have in 
2  the district court, so -- so why -- what's your reaction 
3  to this.  Say A, sometimes these settlements can be very 
4  anticompetitive, dividing monopoly profit.  In deciding 
whether anticompetitive outweighs business practices 
5
6  without less restrictive alternatives, judge, you may 
7  take that into account.  Two, do not take into account 
8  the strength of a patent.  Three, do not try to 
9  relitigate the patent. 
10
11 
justifications, ones I listed before out of the briefs, 
12 
litigation costs -- the other products, different 
13 
assessments of -- of value.  Five, there could be, in 
14 
fact, no anticompetitive effect here because of what you 
just said now in response to Justice Kennedy and Justice 
15
16 
Kagan, but there could be.  We don't know.  Okay? 
17
 So start with where we were.  Could be 
18  anticompetitive.  Give the defense a chance to go 
19  through five, one through five, and if they convince you 
there is a six, we're not saying there isn't, but we 
20
21  can't think of one on the briefs, let them have the 
22  sixth, too.  Okay?  Now, judge, weigh and decide. 
23  That's what we do.  So we've structured it somewhat to 
24  keep the kitchen sink out on the basis of the briefs 
25

given to us.  What's wrong with that?

2  problem with it is that it's -- it's very unpredictable. 
3  It's really hard to figure out how that all gets sorted

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  For whom?  And -- and --
1
2  you know, the government is basically saying, we really 
3  don't want reverse payments, period.  We want people to 
4  settle this the way they should settle it, which is on 
the strength of the patent.  And that means settling it 
5
6  simply by either paying a royalty for use or settling as 
7  most cases do, on an early entry alone, so there's no 
8  sharing of -- of -- of profits.  What's so bad about 
9  that? 
10

13  concede that most cases settle like that.  But let's --

17  you conclude that it has 10 or 15 good years remaining. 
 Now, you have a generic who is -- or many 
18
19  generics who have sued with no risk or minimal risk in 
Hatch-Waxman, and their response is, why would I -- why 
20
21  would I drop this lawsuit to get an entry date in 2025 
22  or 2028?  That doesn't meet my business needs, I have

2  They're saying, well, what other -- remember, this is 
3  not just a cash payment.  There are all --

5
6  or two earlier entry, that has an inherent value, and 
7  that's what you'll pay for is what the government is

 If the FTC's kind of 

the-sky-is-going-to-fall approach is right, that 

 Some of the numbers increased last year, but 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

infringement suit. 

 If they won the patent infringement suit, 

MR. WEINBERGER:  Justice Ginsburg, first of 
all, every settlement agreement involving one of these 
cases must be filed with the FTC.  They have hundreds of 
them.  And they haven't pointed to a single example 
where that's the case. 

1  consideration that seems to be driving the government? 
2  That is, the generic is getting an offer that they would 
3  never get on the street.  I mean, they are being paid 
4  much more than they would get if they won the patent 
5
6
7  then they can sell their generic in competition with the 
8  brand.  But under this agreement they get more than they 
9  would get by winning the lawsuit. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  that hypothetical is correct.  That's what was my 
18  concern, too.  What the brand company can lose is much 
19  greater than what the generic can make.  So why don't 
you just put a cap on what the generic can make and then 
20
21  we won't have a real concern with the restraint of trade, 
22  or we'll have a lesser concern.  I think that's the 
23  thrust of Justice Ginsburg's question and it's my 
24  concern as well. 
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it's just an economic --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose -- suppose 

MR. WEINBERGER:  Yes, and I want to make 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company

easily challenge these patents without actually having a 

1  clear that I don't think that could happen because if a 
2  brand name company adopted that as a strategy to protect 
3  its patent, it would -- it would be held up.  It would 
4  be held up by the many generic companies that could 
5
6  manufactured product, without putting it on sale, et 
7  cetera. 
 So I think that the antitrust rule should 
8
9  not be fashioned to deal with a case on the extreme, 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the government 
18
19  was telling us that that's this case, that the -- what 
the generic is being offered in the way of sharing the 
20
21  monopoly profits is more than it could ever make if it 
22  wanted to and sold its drug. 
23
24  examples of that cited in their brief.  It's a theory, 
it's a hypothetical theory, but there is no data.  And 
25

which hasn't been shown to happen, which logically from 
an economic point of view is highly unlikely to happen. 
And if for some reason that starts happening 
empirically, then Congress -- and it is a loophole in 
Hatch-Waxman that is causing that, and there is really 
no evidence that that extreme example has happened --
then Congress can deal with it, just as it dealt with 
the exclusivity provision. 

 MR. WEINBERGER:  Well, I don't see any 

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but so then the 

 MR. WEINBERGER:  Of course.  I think that's 

question still holds.  If you -- if you key your payment 

1  we have had years of experience with this case. 
2
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but it's not 
3  hypothetical that if the generic wins everybody -- the 
4  brand companies’ profits are going to go way, way down 
right away and generic profits are not going to be that 
5
6  great. 
7
8  true in many -- many patent litigations. 
9
10
11  to what the brand company will make, it's just a much 
12  higher figure, and a greater danger of unreasonable 
13  restraint. 
14
15
16  it's not -- with the number of challenges you have here, 
17  which is basically unlimited, that if you put a sign 
18  around your neck that says, paying off all generic 
19  companies their profits, whoever wants to challenge my 
patent come do it, there is going to be a long line of 
20
21  people, of companies doing it. 
22
23  that point that the 180 days is not that big a 
24  difference, and that there are many generics out there. 
But isn't that true in every industry?  You said at the 
25

 MR. WEINBERGER:  There is that hypothetical 

risk.  What I'm -- I am trying to make the point that 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay, I will grant you 

44

they are going to be liable for enormous damages. 

 That's not the case under Hatch-Waxman.  All 

1  outset, oh, well, now in the drug industry there are a 
2  lot of people ready to pounce in.  Isn't that true in 
3  any industry? 
4
 MR. WEINBERGER:  It is true and that's why 
it doesn't happen.  It's -- it's more true here because 
5
6  it's much easier to challenge a patent.  So in any other 
7  industry a potential challenger has to make a major 
8  investment in a product, has to get it manufactured, has 
9  to put it on sale, and then litigate.  And if they lose, 
10
11
12  they need to do is file an ANDA.  They have nothing at 
13  risk.  If they lose, they haven't lost any damages. 
14  They just walk away.  So there is an enormous difference 
15
16  explains the particular form of some of these 
17  settlements and why they happen. 
18
19  argument that there is an economic reality in 
Hatch-Waxman that would require us not to apply any rule 
20
21  we choose or accept here to other situations, only here. 
22  That's the argument that you're creating for me, that 
23  there's a different economic reality here that requires 
24  a different rule. 
25

in the risks between Hatch-Waxman and other cases that 

MR. WEINBERGER:  Justice Sotomayor, I think

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And any settlement in 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, but it does because 

these cases deprives consumers of the potential of 
having the benefit of an earlier entry. 

1  the economic reality cuts the other way.  It doesn't cut 
2  in favor of making a rule that makes these more 
3  difficult.  What I'm saying is that --
4
in Hatch-Waxman Congress decided that there was a 
5
6  benefit for generics entering without suffering a 
7  potential loss to enter the market more quickly. 
8
9  think the legislation --
10
11 
12 
13
14  anything in Hatch-Waxman that supports the idea that the 
purpose was to provide for generic entry prior to patent 
15
16  expiration.  What the structure is designed to do is 
17  encourage challenges because --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly, and what you 
18
19  are doing with permitting settlements of this kind is 
20
21
22  anything in Hatch-Waxman that suggests, in any way, that 
23  settlements or -- should be discouraged or that cases 
24  should be mandated to proceed to judgment or that all

can I say that with 10 years of the application of the 
5
6  scope-of-the-patent rule, there is no particular problem 
7  with Hatch-Waxman.  It's working very well.  The 
8  amount -- the number of drugs that have now gone generic 
9  from just ten years ago to today has increased 
10
11
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So why does it help you to 
12  say, if the Court says or the FTC says when you get one 
13  of these suits you can settle it by letting them in, but 
14  you can't pay them money.  That that will help to stop 
strike suits if it costs them nothing to get in.  They 
15
16  have to really want to enter or they won't bring 
17  lawsuits.  So why does that hurt you? 
18
19  you raise a point that the generic -- in some of the 
amicus briefs, some of the generic parties have talked 
20
21  about, which is that their ability to challenge these 
22  cases depends on their not having to litigate every one 
23  of them to conclusion.  And that's not bad because most 
24  patent cases settle.  Most -- most of these disputes 
25

settle.  And if our system was one in which every case

 So -- so what I think the statute mandates 

challenge, and should have strong incentive to 

kind of a business settlement, that is going to mean 
that fewer generics are going to challenge these patents 
and that is contrary to the purpose of the Hatch-Waxman 
Act. 

1  had to be litigated fully to judgment, it -- we would be 
2  unable to cope with that. 
3
4  or contemplates is that generics should be able to 
5
6  challenge, but that doesn't mean that they should be 
7  required to litigate to conclusion.  And if settlement 
8  is made more difficult, so that different perceptions or 
9  different business objectives can't be bridged with some 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  scientists and attorneys, you need investment bankers. 
17  And you then need marketers because the cost of these

19  not going to do me much good because they're all going

22  180-day period, it's like even if one of those people 
23  wins, the person whom I've paid off is going to get the 
24  180-day exclusivity period, isn't that right? 
25

understand the way the 180-day period worked?  The first 

to be -- there's going to be a long line.  And that long 

MR. WEINBERGER:  Not completely.  First of

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if it's not waived by

 MR. WEINBERGER:  This was the exact problem 

that Congress addressed in 2003, when it amended 

1  all, it depends on the -- the agreement.  For example, 
2  in this case, that 180-day exclusivity was waived. 
3
4  the parties, in other words, it's not just like I don't 
5
6  competitor gets it.  So why in the world am I standing 
7  in line to -- to challenge this if my competitor is 
8  going to get the exclusive period? 
9
10
11  Hatch-Waxman and changed the exclusivity requirements. 
12  So the way the law now reads is that subsequent 
13  generics, subsequent filers can trigger that 180-day 
14  exclusivity by continuing to litigate.  So if the first 
15
16  they're litigating, they can force that period to start 
17  running and then they can come in right after.  So it is 
18  not correct that you can tie up the first filer in

Circuit, Federal circuit in the Second, applying the 
scope of the patent rule recognized that if the 
agreement creates a bottleneck to other filers that goes 
beyond what the statutory exclusivity provides, where 
they agree not to give up their exclusivity or agree to

 So I think that problem's been addressed by 

Congress can do that.  That they --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what was the change 

1  retain it, then that's beyond the scope of the patent. 
2  Because you can't achieve that kind of a restraint 
3  simply -- with a patent, you -- you're using the 
4  agreement to expand upon your patent rights to block 
5
6
7  Congress.  And if somebody feels that solution's not 
8  perfect and they want to make it even easier for 
9  subsequent filers to come in, then I submit that 
10
11
12  that was made? 
13
14  Justice Ginsburg, is that -- there were a number of 
changes, but the one that's relevant here is that if 
15
16  a -- if a subsequent filer -- strike that. 
17
 You can trigger the exclusivity beginning to 
18  run by getting the judgment.  So in the past, if a first 
19  filer settled and they just didn't do anything -- may I

24  to market.  But now anybody else who's litigating this

22  maximize profits in a competitive environment, that

 The second thing is, Mr. Weinberger said 


filers will attempt to challenge the brand name even 
after the first filer has been bought off.  I think 
we -- we disagree that it's as easy as he would say it 
is, but we'll concede it happens occasionally.  But the 
fact that particular anticompetitive conduct doesn't 
always work doesn't make it lawful. 

1  competitor that it will charge that price, that's a per 
2  se antitrust violation. 
 So it's not at all anomalous to say that 
3
4  this type of agreement can be deemed anticompetitive, 
even though the same result, namely, exclusion of the

17  thinking about entering into a price-fixing agreement, 
18  for instance, but thought to themselves, if we do that, 
19  there's a third competitor in the market who will be 
20
21  unprofitable.  And it might happen sometimes that two 
22  firms try to proceed with a price-fixing conspiracy, but 
23  they're thwarted because of the unexpected competition 
24  from a third firm.

able to undersell us, and this would make our agreement 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought Mr.

 MR. STEWART:  I mean, first, there certainly 

another firm out there in the abstract that -- that 

1  Weinberger's point was that this is always going to 
2  happen because it's very easy -- as he said, you put a 
3  sign on your neck saying, generics line up to get your 
4  payment.  That seems quite different than saying there's 
5
6  might want to enter into a similar market sharing 
7  arrangement.  This is a very different system. 
8
9  is no evidence suggesting that it has happened often, 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  the -- the brand name is attempting to purchase is 
19  protection from the possibility that it will have its 
20
21  competitive advantage.  If a brand name thinks in a 
22  particular instance there is somebody else who's going 
23  to expose it to -- me to that risk, the -- the payment 
24  wouldn't be expected to be made.  So at least --
25

although there is evidence that it has happened.  But if 
the brand name perceived on a systemic basis that the 
likely result of paying off one competitor was that 
another competitor would step in and couldn't be bought 
off would litigate the suit to judgment, there would be 
no incentive to make the reverse payment in the first 
place. 

 That is, in making the reverse payment, what 

patent invalidated, and it will suffer a large 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And what's your

 MR. STEWART:  I think for the reasons 

1  understanding of why there would not be a long line in 
2  some cases or in many cases? 
3
4  that -- that your question suggested, that there is the 
180-day exclusivity period and leaving aside the cases 
5
6  in which that is waived, subsequent manufacturers would 
7  realize not only that they wouldn't get that period of 
8  heightened profits themselves, but they would have to 
9  wait in line for others, and they might focus their 
attention on other patents that were perceived to be 
10
11 
weak as to which they could hope to -- to get the 
12 
180-day exclusivity contract. 
13
14  show what I think Justice Kennedy asked -- you know, how 
15
16  opposed to what happens after that? 
17
18  majority, I don't have a percentage figure.  And the 
19  reason, as I indicated earlier, was that during the 
20
21  competitors.  Basically, a biopoly arrangement.  And my 
22  understanding is that the generics would usually charge 
23  around 80 to 85 percent of the brand name's price during 
24  that period.  And after there is full competition, the 
25

much of one's profits comes from the 180-day period as 

180-day exclusivity period, you have only two 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And is there anything to 

 MR. STEWART:  I know it is the great 

price would drop to a fraction of that.

 The next thing I would say is that our 

internally, 600,000 is the least I will accept.  If they 

1
2  system encourages settlement, but not to the nth degree. 
3  And so for instance, if you had two -- two firms 
4  fighting over a million dollars and each firm decided 
5
6  stuck to their guns, the case couldn't be settled. 
7
 Now, if the public could be made to kick in 
8  an additional 200,000, then each of the firms could get 
9  its 600,000 and walk away content.  But we don't pursue 
the policy in favor of settlement to that degree.  But 
10
11 
that's essentially what's happening here.  The -- the 
way these payments facilitate settlement is by inducing 
12 
13 
the generics to agree to a later entry date by 
increasing the total pool of profits that are available 
14 
to the two firms combined and thereby maximizing the 
15
likelihood that each firm will find its own share of the 
16 
17 
profit satisfactory. 
 And the last thing I would say is I think 
18
19  everyone who comes to this issue recognized that there 
is a conundrum.  Our natural instinct is to compare the 
20
21  settlement to the expected outcome of litigation.  But 
22  everyone also recognizes that it just isn't feasible to 
23  try the patent suit. 
24
25

 And, therefore, our approach focuses on 
whether the competitive process has been preserved.
