          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument now

in No. 02-1183, the United States v. Samuel Francis

Patane.

          Mr. Dreeben.

           ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

          Before this Court's decision in Dickerson v.

United States in the year 2000, it was the uniform rule in

the lower Federal courts that the failure to issue Miranda

warnings meant that the unwarned statement was not

admissible in the Government's case, but that there was no

requirement to suppress physical evidence that was derived

from those unwarned statements.

          Following this Court's decision in Dickerson,

which affirmed that Miranda has constitutional stature,

the majority of the Federal courts of appeals to address

the issue continued to adhere to the pre-Dickerson rule

that physical fruits of an unwarned statement were

admissible.

          In this case, the Tenth Circuit broke ranks with

that uniform body of authority and held that, as a result

of Dickerson's ruling that Miranda has constitutional

stature, there is a derivative fruits suppression

component to the Miranda rule.  That holding should be

reversed.

          Miranda stands as a rule that implements the

Fifth Amendment, not by requiring the compulsion that the

Amendment literally speaks of, but by providing an extra

level of protection for the core of the Fifth Amendment

right, the right for the defendant's own statements that

are incriminating not to be used against him in a criminal

trial.

          QUESTION: Is it a Fifth Amendment right or not a

Fifth Amendment right?

          MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, as I understand it,

it is a right that implements the Fifth Amendment's

protection.

          QUESTION: It - it has to be based on something

in the Constitution or we would have had to respect the

statute enacted by Congress in Dickerson.  So it is -

there is obviously some provision of the Constitution that

enabled us to disregard that statute.  What - what

provision is that?

          MR. DREEBEN: The Fifth Amendment.  What the -

          QUESTION: All right.  It's a Fifth Amendment

right then.

          MR. DREEBEN: What the Court concluded in Miranda

and then reaffirmed in Dickerson is that the traditional

totality of the circumstances test for ascertaining

whether a statement is voluntary or has been compelled by

the Government is not adequate when the statements are

taken in the inherently pressuring environment of

custodial interrogation.  And to provide an extra layer of

protection to avoid the violation of the defendant's Fifth

Amendment rights, the Court adopted a prophylactic

warnings and wavier procedure.

          QUESTION: Whether it's prophylactic or not, it

is a constitutional right, is it not?  It is a

constitutional right.

          MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, it is a

constitutional right that is distinct from the right not

to have one's compelled statements used against oneself.

          QUESTION: Well, so is the constitutional right

not to be pistol-whipped in order to - to confess.

          MR. DREEBEN: Well -

          QUESTION: That's distinct from the introduction

of the coerced confession at trial, but we don't

distinguish between the two, do we?

          MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think you do, Justice Scalia. 

That is a violation of the core due process right not to

have substantive violations of one's liberty interests.

What we're talking about in this case is not a substantive

violation of the defendant's rights, but a procedural

violation of the Fifth Amendment that this Court has

defined in Miranda, but has defined it in a way that is

highly distinct from the basic, textually-mandated rule of

the Fifth Amendment that compelled statements may not be

used.

          QUESTION: Let me - let me take out the pistol-

whipping.  It - it - it is a coerced statement because of

the application of mental coercion.  Now, that is not a

violation of the Fifth Amendment, I suppose, until the

product of the - of the coercion is introduced at trial. 

Will you say the same thing?

          MR. DREEBEN: I would - I'm not sure, Justice

Scalia, that your question addresses what Miranda

addressed.  What Miranda addressed was a situation in

which it was extremely difficult for the courts to sort

out whether a statement was coerced or not coerced, and to

avoid the risk that an actually coerced statement would be

used in evidence against the defendant, thus violating the

core Fifth Amendment right.  The Miranda Court, as this

Court has later explained, adopted a presumption, a

presumption for a limited purpose.  In the government -

          QUESTION: May - may I ask a - a modified version

of Justice Scalia's question?  Supposing that the

Government used official powers, such as a grand jury

subpoena or a congressional committee subpoena, to - to

get a confession out of a person under threat of contempt

of court, so it was clearly just a Fifth Amendment was a -

he made an answer that revealed the existence of the gun

and then he - would that be a - would the gun be

admissible or un - inadmissible in that scenario?

          MR. DREEBEN: If your hypothetical, Justice

Stevens, presupposes an assertion of the Fifth Amendment

right and actual compulsion of the -

          QUESTION: The threat of contempt, yeah.

          MR. DREEBEN: - information, presumably under a

grant of immunity, then the gun would not be admissible,

because this Court has defined a violation of the Fifth

Amendment that involves actual compulsion as entailing two

different evidentiary consequences.  One evidentiary

consequence is that the statements themselves may not be

used.  The other evidentiary consequence is that nothing

derived from the statements may be used.  But the critical

feature of that hypothetical and its distinction from

Miranda, is it involves actual compulsion.  Miranda -

          QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben - Mr. - Miranda itself

said, but unless and until such warnings and waivers are

demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence

obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against

him, no evidence as a result of interrogation.  That

sounds like a - a - a derivative evidence rule to me.

          MR. DREEBEN: It does, Justice Ginsburg, and

there are many things in the Miranda opinion that have not

stood the test of later litigation in this Court, because

they extended the implications of Miranda far beyond where

this Court has gone.  And let me be precise about this. 

The rule, at the time of Miranda and today, is that if

there is actual compulsion, the Government may not make

use of the actual statements that are taken or their

evidentiary fruits.  The Government may also not use that

statement for impeachment, and there is no public safety

exception that could -

          QUESTION: Well, how are we going to determine

actual compulsion if it's a situation where the police

knowingly engage in conversation hoping to pick up

information without giving the Miranda warnings, and then

the minute they start hearing something useful, give the

warnings, but then rely on what they learned earlier to

further that information gathering.  How - how do we parse

that out?

          MR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, the determination

of whether the statements reflect voluntariness at the

outset and then a knowing and - and intelligent waiver of

Miranda warnings later on after they are given needs to be

determined based on the totality of the circumstances.

          But this Court has recognized, in allowing the

use of unwarned statements for impeachment and in adopting

the public safety exception, and in permitting a second

warned statement, as the Court did in Oregon v. Elstad, to

be admitted into evidence, notwithstanding an earlier

unwarned statement, that there is a difference between the

Miranda presumption and a finding of actual compulsion.

          QUESTION: May I ask you - you mentioned the

public safety exception.  We wouldn't - we really don't

need a public safety exception if you're correct in this

case, do we?

          MR. DREEBEN: No, we still do, because the

crucial thing about Miranda that is not challenged here is

that a failure to issue Miranda warnings, followed by

custodial interrogation, means that the unwarned statement

is inadmissible in the Government's case in chief.  That

is the core ruling of Miranda.

          QUESTION: But the core ruling of the public

safety exception, as I remember it, is that you can use

the gun.

          MR. DREEBEN: No, the core ruling of the public

safety exception is that you can use the statement.  The

Court held, in New York v. Quarles, that when pressing

public safety needs justify the conduct of custodial

interrogation without prior issuance of Miranda warnings,

that situation falls outside of the Miranda paradigm, and

the statements themselves can be used.

          Now, Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion

argued that there should be no exception for public safety

for the statements themselves, but the gun, as derivative

evidence, should come in, because it was not the product

of actual compulsion at which the Fifth Amendment is

aimed.  

          QUESTION: Mr. -

          QUESTION: The - the difficulty that I have

accepting that as the final answer is that there isn't any

functional difference in a case like this between

admitting the statement, the admission that he had the gun

on the shelf in the bedroom, and admitting the gun.  So

that, in functional terms, the - the Miranda protection,

even as you describe it, disappears on your theory.

          MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, if - if I accept

that that accurately describes this case, it does not

accurately describe the large class of cases in which

physical evidence is discovered as a result of unwarned

statements.  In many -

          QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, doesn't it occur - cover

quite a wide number of cases?  This was a case where the -

the crime that the police were after were - was gun

possession.  It might be narcotics possession, it might be

stolen goods.  And in all those situations, are you saying

that the constitutional rule is that a police chief can

say to his officers, go in and get him to tell you where

the narcotics are, where the gun is, where the stolen

goods are?  We don't worry about his statement, but we

want the goods.

          MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, that is my

position, but I don't think it would be a prudent policy

for law enforcement to adopt.  This case may be one in

which the Government can prove knowing possession of a

firearm by the defendant even without the benefit of his

statements, but police officers are not going to be able

to predict in advance that that is going to be true in the

vast majority of cases.  What they are going to know is

that if you have a statement that links the defendant to

the gun, that allows you to show knowing possession.  In

the absence of that, having the physical evidence alone

will not necessarily guarantee a conviction.

          QUESTION: You don't think the gun on the shelf

in the guy's bedroom is going to be sufficient to prove

knowing possession?

          MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I do in this case, Justice

Souter.

          QUESTION: You know what's in your bedroom.

          MR. DREEBEN: I think that the Court should

decide this case not based on the particularities of this

factual scenario, but on the class of cases in which

physical evidence is at issue, and should regard the

question of what incentives the police may have as

informed by the totality of cases that may arise.

          Police officers who decide to conduct custodial

interrogation without giving Miranda warnings know that

they will not be able to use the statements that the

defendant makes in the Government's case in chief, and

they have no way of knowing before they conduct custodial

interrogation what the defendant may say.  If the

defendant offers up information that is incriminating on

unanticipated crimes or provides leads to information that

the police haven't previously anticipated, then the police

officers run two risks. 

          The first is that they won't be able to use

those statements against the defendant in the case in

chief.  The second is that by failing to issue Miranda

warnings, they increase the likelihood that a later court

reviewing the facts will conclude that this is not a case

of a mere failure to give Miranda warnings, but is a case

involving actual compulsion.  And if a court concludes

that the statements are actually compelled, involuntary -

          QUESTION: Well, Mr. Dreeben, supposing that the

police decide that they're going to follow this strategy

that is perhaps suggested by Justice Ginsburg.  Would that

itself be evidence of compulsion?  In other words, they

won't give Miranda warnings and see - see what the person

says, then they give them.  Would that be evidence of

compulsion?

          MR. DREEBEN: It would be evidence that a

defendant could argue is relevant, but I don't think that

it would be evidence of compulsion.  What's relevant in

the compulsion analysis is what the police officers

actually say and do and communicate to the suspect.  Their

uncommunicated intent or law enforcement policies would

not add up to compulsion by itself.

          QUESTION: If we were to reject your position and

- and say that this is purely a constitutional violation,

would you then lose the case?

          MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Kennedy.  The Court

should still do as it has done in other contexts, balance

the costs of a Miranda suppression remedy against whatever

incremental benefits there may have.

          QUESTION: What's your -

          QUESTION: And why - why is this different than

the rule under the Fourth Amendment, say Wong Sun?

          MR. DREEBEN: What the Court has done in the

Fourth Amendment context is deal with an actual violation

of the Fourth Amendment and establish very exclusion -

various exclusionary rules that are designed to deter that

kind of police conduct.  The Miranda rule is very

different, because even if the Court holds that Miranda

prescribes a rule of substantive conduct for the police,

which we submit it does not, even if the Court were to

hold that, it still is a rule that merely presumes

compulsion.  It doesn't constitute a finding of actual

compulsion.

          QUESTION: Well, we said last year in Chavez that

the Miranda - that the Constitution was not violated by

failure to give Miranda warnings until they were offered

in evidence, didn't we?

          MR. DREEBEN: That - that is correct, Mr. Chief

Justice.  But what the Court has done under the Fifth

Amendment -

          QUESTION: Is it correct, was there a majority to

take that position?

          QUESTION: That was the trial court's opinion,

wasn't it?

          QUESTION: That - that - I believe to - you're

taking all the opinions together.  There were six votes

for that.

          MR. DREEBEN: I think this Court will be better

able than I am to say what Chavez held.

          (Laughter.)

          MR. DREEBEN: But the - the reason that that

principle alone does not decide this case is that the

Court has, in instances of actual compulsion out of court,

applied a derivative evidence suppression rule.   That's

the rule that the Court adopted in Counselman v.

Hitchcock, and it's followed it in its immunity line of

cases where it has held that to displace the Fifth

Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, you

need to suppress both the statement and the fruits.  

          QUESTION: Is part of your - is - is part of your

reasoning that in the Fourth Amendment violation case,

exclusion is the - really the best available, most direct

remedy?  And in - and in this case, there are other

remedies, number one, excluding the statement, so that

when you - when you find tangible evidence, it's - it's

just a - an ancillary and less necessary remedy.  Is that

the whole -

          MR. DREEBEN: That - that's -

          QUESTION: - thrust of the argument.

          MR. DREEBEN: That's the core of it, Justice

Kennedy.  What the Court did in Miranda was create a rule

that operates in the very heart of the Fifth Amendment by

creating a prophylactic buffer zone against the risk, not

the certainty, but the risk, that actual compulsion has

been exacted.  It is that risk that the Fifth Amendment

targets as the core concern.

          QUESTION: What's the theory of the compulsion? 

That is, what - why, assuming that there's compulsion but

there hasn't been an introduction of the statement that

was compelled into evidence.  Under that - and suppose

that the compulsion doesn't rise to the level of the due

process violation.  I mean, I - maybe - maybe they all do,

but - but if they don't, then what's the theory of keeping

out the evidence derived from that sort of compulsion.

          MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, as the Court

explained it in its immunity line of cases, the starting

point of analysis is that a defendant under the Fifth

Amendment can claim his privilege against testifying based

not only on incrimination from the statements that he

makes, but also that evidence that the Government can

obtain as a result of the statements is incriminating.

          If his testimony is a link in a chain of

incrimination, he can stand silent, and the Court reasoned

from that that the Government should not be able to

circumvent that right of the defendant not to be a witness

against his - himself, by calling him out of court,

compelling testimony over his objection that - based on

the Fifth Amendment, and then obtaining the very

incriminating information that the privilege shielded him

from having to provide.

          QUESTION: So why doesn't all that apply here?  I

mean, is - is that - I can understand it if they compel

the testimony, then you introduce it.  Then - then you

have the completed violation of what the Fifth Amendment

forbids, all right, the completed violation.  I can

understand it if you compel the person to the extent that

it violates the Due Process Clause, beating him up

severely, whatever.

          Now, I don't understand why, if you have neither

of those two things, you would keep the evidence that's

the fruits out, under some theory that doesn't also say

you should keep this out.

          MR. DREEBEN: Well, the - the distinction between

this situation and the true compulsion situation is,

Miranda does not involve an actual finding of compulsion,

and the Court has been very frank about this.  As a

result, the Court has repeatedly drawn distinctions

between the use of unwarned statements and the use of

actually compelled statements.  Actually compelled

statements may not be used to impeach a defendant's trial

testimony.  That too would violate the Fifth Amendment

right.

          But the Court held in - in the Hass case and in

the Harris case that statements that are merely unwarned,

but not compelled, can be used for impeachment.  The Court

similarly held in Michigan v. Tucker and then again in

Oregon v. Elstad that statements that are unwarned, but

not compelled, can be used as leads to find another

witness' testimony, or to obtain a second statement from

the defendant himself.  And if -

          QUESTION: So is this distinction that the - that

- that one case is just more egregious, more an affront to

the Constitution, more dangerous, i.e., physical

compulsion as opposed to the compulsion that's just

presumed from Miranda?

          MR. DREEBEN: One case, Justice Kennedy, involves

a literal violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Miranda

involves a presumption that this Court -

          QUESTION: Well, then - then you're back into

metaphysics.

          MR. DREEBEN: It is a little metaphysical,

Justice Kennedy, but there's a - a pot of truth, I think,

a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow here, which is

that the Miranda presumption does not mean, this Court has

held, that a statement is actually compelled.  It protects

against the most crucial right contained in the Fifth

Amendment itself, which is -

          QUESTION: But you don't think we should

differentiate based on the gravity of the - of the wrong

in either case?

          MR. DREEBEN: You could look at it that - that

way, Justice Kennedy.  What - what the Court has done when

it's dealt with a - a failure to issue warnings, is

balance.  It has recognized that, by providing a rule that

presumes compulsion in lieu of proving it, the Court has

taken a step beyond the core of the constitutional right

itself, and the Court's language in its previous cases of

calling Miranda warnings and the exclusionary rule under

Miranda a prophylactic right is understandable in that

sense.  Miranda excludes some statements that are not

compelled under the Fifth Amendment.

          QUESTION: May - may I ask this question, Mr.

Dreeben?  The - there's a distinction in - in your - you

submit, between a presumption of involuntariness and

actual involuntariness.  Do you know any other area of the

law in which we've differentiated between a presumed

result and an actual result?

          MR. DREEBEN: I - I - I don't want to go off into

an excursion into rules of law that might occur to me as I

stand here, Justice Stevens.  But what I do know is that

the Court's own Miranda jurisprudence -

          QUESTION: My understand - you're - you're -

there's - there's a lot in the case that support what you

say.  But I'm suggesting it is kind of a unique

development of the law, because normally I would think if

you presume X from Y, that would be the same as proving X.

          MR. DREEBEN: It -

          QUESTION: But you say that's new - that's not

true in this line of - this area of the law?

          MR. DREEBEN: There is language in the Miranda

opinion, as Justice Ginsburg has mentioned, that would

support the view that the original vision of Miranda was

that it would constitute compulsion -

          QUESTION: Right.

          MR. DREEBEN: - not merely presume it.  But as

the Court developed the rule and considered what the costs

and benefits would be of having a rule that merely

presumed compulsion, any context in which it was not

necessarily true.  The Miranda Court itself recognized

that not all statements taken in custodial interrogation

without warnings are compelled.  Once you are dealing with

a prophylactic rule, it's incumbent upon the Court to

balance the benefits against the burdens of the rule.

          QUESTION: Of course, one of the benefits of -

under the Miranda analysis, we will - we avoid the

necessity of resolving difficult issues of fact sometimes. 

There are a lot of borderline cases to whether there

really was compulsion or it's just presumed.  We'll have

to get back into that, under your view.

          MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the Court has put

itself back into it by adopting the holdings that permit

statements that are not warned to be used for impeachment

and to be used to obtain leads for other witnesses.

          QUESTION: Well, I guess we tell juries they can

disregard presumptions, but they can't disregard facts.

          MR. DREEBEN: And I think that that's what the

Court has really decided is the right approach when you

are outside the core concern that the Miranda Court was

addressing, namely the use of the unwarned statement

itself.  There is a terrible cost to the truth-seeking

function of a criminal trial to suppress reliable,

physical evidence that was obtained not as the result of a

core constitutional violation involving literal compulsion

or a substantive due process violation, but merely a

failure to issue warnings.

          QUESTION: It's a terrible cost, but it's a

terrible cost for which the law provides a ready means of

avoidance.  I mean, Miranda's been around for a long time. 

There is - there's no excuse at this point in our history

for the police to say, gee, I - I don't quite understand

what Miranda is getting at.  And - and that's why it seems

to me the cost argument is a weak one -

          MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -

          QUESTION: - and is a - let me just finish this

sentence.  And as against that weak argument, there seems

to me a fairly strong argument that if you accept your

position, there is a, in - in effect, a recipe for

disregarding Miranda, because in every physical evidence

case, as in Justice Ginsburg's examples, there's going to

be an inducement to say, never mind the statement, just

get the evidence, the evidence will take care of the case. 

          So I - it - it - it's seems to me that we got a

weak argument on one side and a strong argument on the

other side.

          MR. DREEBEN: Well, there - I - the argument

based on cost, Justice Souter, is - is not weak, because

the costs are quite real.  The jury does not hear the

evidence that's suppressed -

          QUESTION: The costs are quite real, but the

state knows how to avoid having to pay those costs.  It

gives the warning.

          MR. DREEBEN: This Court has repeatedly

recognized though that there are situations in which there

are ambiguities in the way that Miranda actually applies,

and law enforcement officers are going to make mistakes in

the way that they apply Miranda.

          QUESTION: I thought the main rule was, the

police, when they take someone into custody, are supposed

to give them four warnings, and that seems to me a simple,

clear rule.  Now you - you're shifting this to say, well,

they don't have to give the warnings up front, that's

okay.  

          MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  Our

position is that if they don't give the warnings up front,

they lose the statement that is taken without warnings. 

That is the Miranda rule, and it responds to the core

concern that Miranda had.

          The question is, how much further should that

rule go?  And, as I think I answered Justice Souter and

yourself earlier, police officers do not know before they

get hold of evidence whether they are going to be able to

link it to the defendant with other admissible evidence

and prove the violation at trial.  They are much better

off following the Miranda script, getting the admissible

evidence of - of the defendant's own statements, and using

it to tie the defendant to the evidence.  And in a large

percent -

          QUESTION: Then - then why do we have - if that's

the case, why do we have a case coming up in - in a few

minutes in which a - a contrary policy has been adopted? 

I mean, it - your - your statement that - that the police

have much to gain and much to lose if - if - if they - if

they follow the practice of avoiding the warnings is - is

not intuitively clear this morning.

          MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, I think as the

Court will hear more in the next hour, the - the officer

in that case acknowledged that he was rolling the dice. 

There are many reasons why -

          QUESTION: And there was a policy to roll the

dice.

          MR. DREEBEN: That officer testified that he had

been trained to do that -

          QUESTION: Yeah.

          MR. DREEBEN: - and he decided that - that he

would in that case.  The FBI policy has been, even before

Miranda and continuing to this day, that you issue the

warnings.  You avoid difficult voluntariness inquiries,

you smooth the path to admissibility of the evidence, you

ensure that the warned statements are admissible.

          QUESTION: No, I - I'm - I'm sure that that is

the FBI policy, but it - the point is, there is a

substantial, apparently a substantial body of thought

outside the FBI within American law enforcement that dice-

rolling pays off.

          MR. DREEBEN: Well, it - I think that in many

cases it pays off with risks that responsible law

enforcement officers often choose not to run.

          If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

          QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dreeben.

          Ms. Wichlens, we'll hear from you.

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JILL M. WICHLENS

               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

          MS. WICHLENS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

          I'd like to begin by responding to the

Government's argument that Miranda warnings are not a

requirement, they may be simply a matter of proving

policy, but are not a requirement.  Just three terms ago,

this Court reaffirmed in Dickerson that - and I'm quoting

from Dickerson - Miranda requires procedures that will

warn a suspect in custody of his right to remain silent,

which will assure the suspect that the exercise of that

right will be honored.

          QUESTION: Yeah, but I think, Ms. Wichlens, if

you read through the entire opinion in Dickerson, it's

clear that the warnings are required in order to make the

statements admissible.  They don't say that mere failure

to give the warnings without seeking to follow up with

admission is a constitutional violation.

          MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor, but in

this case they are seeking to admit the evidence.  So if

there are two components to a Miranda violation, one being

the violation in the field by the police officer, the

second component is admitting the evidence at trial, and

that is exactly what the Government is attempting -

          QUESTION: Well, is - isn't this a fruits case?

          MS. WICHLENS: It is a fruits case, Your Honor.

          QUESTION: It's not the statement.

          MS. WICHLENS: Correct.

          QUESTION: It is - it is derivatively obtained

information.

          MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, absolutely.

          QUESTION: Which might make a difference to you.

          MS. WICHLENS: It could make a difference, and -

          QUESTION: At least I've thought so.

          MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, Your Honor, and

following up on a question asked by Justice Kennedy,

whether, if this is a constitutional violation, the

derivative evidence rule, the fruits rule, would apply. 

And my answer to that is yes, absolutely, under Wong Sun. 

If this is a constitutional violation, it would apply in

Chavez, just -

          QUESTION: Well, what - what's the magic about

that metaphysical rule when we're talking about a

different amendment and a different kind of statement or a

different kind of - a different kind of evidence than is

in the - than the rule itself was designed for primarily? 

I mean, I don't know why we're just bound by that

metaphysical rule.

          MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I'm speaking of Wong

Sun for the general proposition that when we have a

constitutional violation, turning to the Fifth Amendment

specifically, the amendment that we're, of course,

concerned with here.  In Chavez, a plurality - the

plurality opinion in Chavez made it clear that if we have

a violation of the Fifth Amendment, then application of

the derivative evidence rule is virtually automatic.

          Now, my argument doesn't rest entirely on the

argument that this is a constitutional violation.  My

first position is that, if it is, it's an automatic

application of the derivative evidence rule.  But even if

it is not, then we go to a balancing and we balance the

costs, the benefits of applying a derivative evidence

rule.

          QUESTION: Why - why would there be any cost here

to anything if you took the position, as we might take,

that if a policeman goes in and purposely doesn't give the

warnings when he knows that he should, or even if he

reasonably should know and doesn't, we're not going to let

in derivatives.

          MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor -

          QUESTION: But in the unusual case, we're quite -

it was an honest mistake, as it could be here, because he

tried to give the warnings and the defendant said, no, no,

I know what they are, okay.  So - so what cost, if - if -

there?

          MS. WICHLENS: Justice Breyer, we need a bright

line in this area of the law.  This Court has virtually

always applied bright lines, particularly in the area of a

Miranda violation.

          QUESTION: Well, we've had - we've had, Ms.

Wichlens, probably somewhere between 40 and 50 cases since

Miranda was decided, deciding was this interrogation or

was it not, was this custody or was it not.  There are

factual disputes about every single aspect of Miranda.

          MS. WICHLENS: I think Your Honor's cases, which

were, particularly in the early years following Miranda,

have now made those rules quite clear what is

interrogation, what is custody -

          QUESTION: Well, we - we apply in this area, as

regrettably in a lot of others, what we call the totality

of the circumstances test.  Do you call that a bright

line?

          MS. WICHLENS: Well -

          QUESTION: It seems to me the fuzziest of all

lines.

          MS. WICHLENS: For the voluntariness

determination, it is a fuzzy totality of the

circumstances, but no, in Miranda, we apply bright lines

determining whether there was interrogation, whether there

was custody.  We don't try to get inside the head of the

individual police officers -

          QUESTION: Well, the brightest line, it seems to

me, would be if the policeman knew or should have known

that he was supposed to give a warning, fine, the evidence

stays out. 

          MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor -

          QUESTION: But now all we're excluding, we're

just letting in evidence in those cases where it genuinely

is fuzzy and no policeman knows what he's supposed to do,

or - or it's at least reasonable for him not to know. 

Now, under those circumstances, what you do is lose

evidence, lose evidence that could be useful in convicting

a criminal, and what you gain is precisely nothing, since

the policeman, by definition, was confused about the

matter and reasonably so.  Now, what's the answer to that?

          MS. WICHLENS: The answer to that is, drawing

that bright line, if it is one, Your Honor, I think does

require us to get inside the head of the police officer. 

It requires us to make determinations about whether it was

reasonable or not.  An individual police officer may have

mixed motives.  We're not giving -

          QUESTION: We're - we're - we're saying whether a

reasonable police officer in the - in the position of this

police officer, would have - would have made the mistake.

          MS. WICHLENS: If -

          QUESTION: Just as - just as you say, you say for

custody we apply a bright line.  We don't apply a bright

line for custody.  The test for custody is whether -

whether a - a reasonable person would have believed, given

the totality of the circumstances, that he was free to

leave.

          MS. WICHLENS: Perhaps, Your Honor, I -

          QUESTION: That - that is anything but bright.

          MS. WICHLENS: Perhaps I shouldn't say bright

line.  What I mean is objective versus subjective, and

what I urge this Court not to do is impose a subjective

test, which requires us to get inside the head of the

police officer.

          QUESTION: Okay.  Well, we can apply objective -

an objective test then.

          MS. WICHLENS: Under an -

          QUESTION: If a reasonable police officer in the

position of this police officer would - would have been

confused about the necessity of giving a Miranda warning,

then you're - we're at a different situation.

          MS. WICHLENS: And if it is an objective test,

Justice Scalia, then in this case the police officer fails

that test.

Patane said, I know my rights.  Then the detective - and

this is the most crucial thing - is the detective not only

didn't go on to read the other very critical Miranda

rights, also didn't obtain a knowing waiver.  He didn't -

          QUESTION: No, wait, you left out - he said it

twice, you have the right to remain silent.  Patane says,

I know my rights.  The detective says, you know your

rights?

          MS. WICHLENS: Correct.

          QUESTION: And the - Patane says, yeah, yeah, I

do.

          MS. WICHLENS: Correct.  What he didn't say -

          QUESTION: I know my rights.

          MS. WICHLENS: What he didn't say was, do you

know your right to have counsel here present, Mr. Patane?

          QUESTION: No, no, I understand that a lawyer

might have - who really knows this area, might have

understood that you have to do more than that.  But is it

fair to ask a policeman who's on the line of duty when he

tries twice to read him the rights, and each time the

defendant says, no, I know them, forget it.  Is it fair to

ask the policeman to be the lawyer who has to know you

have to go and get out a paper and have him sign it and so

forth?

          MS. WICHLENS: It is absolutely fair to require

that of a police officer.  He doesn't have to be a lawyer,

Your Honor.  He has to have attended police academy 101. 

You read four warnings to a defendant, a suspect, after

you arrest him.  That is not -

          QUESTION: Well, we're talking here about fruits,

the location of the gun and the gun.

          MS. WICHLENS: Correct.

          QUESTION: And ever since Oregon v. Elstad, which

said it didn't apply to fruits, all the courts of appeals

in the Federal circuits, but one, have said it comes in.

          MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor. 

          QUESTION: I - this is the - from the one circuit

that holds otherwise.

          MS. WICHLENS: That's correct.

          QUESTION: And it hasn't resulted in disaster,

has it?

          MS. WICHLENS: I think it is approaching

disaster, Your Honor, and the case that's going to follow

this one is at one end of the spectrum.  We have lawyers

in California going on record instructing police officers

to violate Miranda on purpose, and they actually use that

word.

          QUESTION: When you say violate, Miranda, Miranda

is - is not a command that prohibits police officers, or

that requires police officers to give the statements. 

It's a - it's a - it's a conditional thing.  Unless they

give the statements, the stuff can't be admitted in

evidence.

          MS. WICHLENS: I respectfully disagree with that,

Your Honor.  I think Dickerson has made it clear it is a

command.  Miranda -

          QUESTION: I think - well, I think, having

written Dickerson, I think differently.

          (Laughter.)

          QUESTION: You're - and you're entitled to read

the opinion as you wish.

          MS. WICHLENS: I understand, Your Honor.  The way

I read Miranda, its progeny, all the way up to Dickerson

and including Dickerson, which, of course, you, Your

Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, are the authority on, is that

there are two components to a Miranda rule.  If the

exclusion of evidence is the core of the rule, well then

the warning requirement is the rest of the apple.  There

are two components to the rule, and police officers are

being instructed out in the field to violate, to ignore

the first part of the rule.

          QUESTION: Well, that's not this case.  You're

arguing somebody else's case.  That certainly isn't this

case.

          MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I am trying to argue

the implications of this case.

          QUESTION: Well, that's why I raised the point,

because it seems to me you could have one simple rule

maybe.  I'm just tying - trying it out for all these

cases.  You say if the policeman knew or reasonably should

have known, well, we're talking about derivative evidence,

not - not the evidence itself, but derivative - knew or

reasonably should have known, keep it out.  But if in fact

it was really an honestly borderline thing, at least if

we're talking about derivative, then no, you don't have to

keep it out.

          Now, that's simple and we'd send yours back

maybe to find out whether he reasonably knew or should

have known, et cetera.  And I'm testing it on you.  I want

to see what your reaction is.

          MS. WICHLENS: Understood.  Understood, Your

Honor.  I think we - we could pass that test, and, of

course, it would need to be sent back -

          QUESTION: Oh no, I'm not - I don't - I'm not so

interested whether you pass it or not if you don't have

to.  But I'm interested in what you think of it.

          MS. WICHLENS: My preferred test is, you have a

Miranda violation, you suppress derivative evidence.  I

think that's the simplest rule, Your Honor, with all

respect.  But if we do have an objective reasonableness

test, in this case and others like it, it's not

objectively reasonable to think you can forego three of

the four Miranda warnings, and it's certainly not

objectively reasonable to think that you don't have to get

the suspect to waive those rights before you go on.

          QUESTION: Well, so - so far as the defendant is

concerned, what - what difference does it make to him

whether the officer's failure to give the warnings was

intentional or just negligent?

          MS. WICHLENS: No difference whatsoever, Your

Honor, none whatsoever.  The suspect is still not informed

of his constitutional rights.  That's why I believe a

brighter line, a simpler test, if you will, Your Honor, is

more appropriate.  But even under an objective

reasonableness test, the Miranda violation in this case

was certainly not objectively reasonable.

          QUESTION: What -

          QUESTION: May I ask you a background question? 

I think most cases you know whether there was a duty to

give the Miranda warnings.  Just take a case where it's

clear the officer failed in the - in the duty to give a

warning.  Is it not correct, as your opponent argued in

the first sentence of his oral presentation, that the law

has generally been settled for a long time that fruits are

nevertheless admissible, and what's your response to that

argument?

          MS. WICHLENS: My response to that, Your Honor,

is I think the lower courts have been mistaken.  What they

have done is taken the language in Elstad, and that

decision, of course, did include some language about

physical evidence, it was dicta in that case, and that's -

          QUESTION: But I would think very, very sound

dicta.

          (Laughter.)

          MS. WICHLENS: Well, with respect, Your Honor -

          QUESTION: It makes a very simple rule.  You can

let it in.

          MS. WICHLENS: With respect -

          QUESTION: There's your simplicity.

          MS. WICHLENS: With respect, Your Honor, it makes

things simpler, but it doesn't achieve the purposes here

for the reasons that some of the Justices here today have

pointed out.  In the case of physical evidence, the

physical evidence is the equivalent of the statements. 

The police officers -

          QUESTION: Well, let me - let me ask you this,

and I'll - I'll go back and read Miranda to - to make

sure.  To what extent was the Miranda rule founded on the

concern that compelled statements - we'll call them that -

are unreliable?  Wasn't that a - a significant factor?

          MS. WICHLENS: That was one of the factors.

          QUESTION: Now, when you have tangible evidence,

then the reliability component substantially drops out of

the case.

          MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor.

          QUESTION: And it seems to me that that makes

the, what you call dicta in Elstad, with reference to

physical evidence, point to a case that's even easier than

one - than the one that was in Elstad.

          MS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, I disagree with

the conclusion there, because the flip side of that is the

- the reliability of the physical evidence and the fact

that if the police find out where it is through a Miranda

violation, they just go and pick it up.  That's what makes

physical evidence different, and that what - that is what

makes the deterrence factors different here.  And so -

          QUESTION: Well, it certainly is reliable. 

There's no question that it's reliable.

          MS. WICHLENS: There's - there's no question. 

Physical evidence is what it is.  I - I don't -

          QUESTION: Then that's - I think that's the point

Justice Kennedy was making -

          MS. WICHLENS: Understood.

          QUESTION: - that the statement might not be

reliable.  Now, there - there may be other things that

work in Miranda, not just to make sure that the statement

is reliable.

          MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, Your Honor.  The other

thing that's at work in Miranda and in the Fifth Amendment

itself is the notion that the Fifth Amendment isn't just a

rule of evidence, just a rule designed to ensure reliable

evidence.  It's also a rule that recognizes that in a free

society, it's repugnant to the concepts of - concept of

ordered liberty to compel a citizen to incriminate

himself.  And so that -

          QUESTION: But we do - we do have a number of

things that are permissive - permissible, like a - a voice

exemplar -

          MS. WICHLENS: Correct.

          QUESTION: - or a blood test.

          MS. WICHLENS: Because none of those involve any

testimonial aspect whatsoever, this Court has made very

clear.  And so we don't really have the derivative

evidence rule, the fruit rule, even at issue in those

cases.  There's no violation whatsoever in those cases,

Your Honor.  There's no tree, so there can be no fruit. 

Here, we do have a violation.

          QUESTION: You have to wind up the rhetoric to a

high degree to say that all of society finds this

repugnant.  The man twice said he didn't want his warnings

and he had a gun in the house he wasn't supposed to have.

          MS. WICHLENS: And we don't know that he knew he

had a right to counsel to be there while Detective Benner

was saying, you need to tell us about the gun, Mr. Patane. 

I'm not sure I should tell you about the gun, you might

take it away from me.  You need to tell us about the gun. 

If you want to get in front of the domestic violence case,

you need to tell us about the gun.  I think that is -

          QUESTION: Well, half the problem is that that

isn't - I mean, it begs the question to say that that's

contrary to established ordered liberty, et cetera,

because that is the question. 

          MS. WICHLENS: It's -

          QUESTION: Everybody, I guess, agrees that it

does violate those basic principles to permit questioning

of the person, compel a statement and then introduce that

statement into evidence.

people haven't agreed under the same circumstances that it

violates ordered liberty to get a statement and get

physical evidence and introduce the physical evidence.

          MS. WICHLENS: What I'm talking about, Your

Honor, are the two bases underlying the Fifth Amendment,

going way back now, not just reliability, but also

concepts of, in a free society, should we compel people to

incriminate themselves?  I understand that there has been

a lot of water under the bridge since the framers came up

with the Fifth Amendment, but I was answering the

questions in terms of -

          QUESTION: And a lot of it was that the police

used to beat people up, say, they beat people up.  Now,

that's very repulsive.

          MS. WICHLENS: That's correct.

          QUESTION: But the answer to that is that if they

come even close to that, we'll keep the statement out and

we will also keep the fruits out.

          MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor.  But

here -

          QUESTION: The - the difference is Miranda

doesn't assume compulsion.  You're talking as though

Miranda - Miranda is a compulsion case.  It isn't.  It -

it's a prophylactic rule, even when there has been no

compulsion -

          MS. WICHLENS: It's a prophylactic rule required

by the Constitution, of course.

          QUESTION: That may well be, but you can't make

your argument as though what's at issue here is compulsion

and our society has set its face against - against the use

of anything obtained by compulsion.  There - there is not

necessarily compulsion.  In fact, there usually isn't

compulsion simply because a Miranda warning is - is not

given.  I expect this - this - this individual in this

case did indeed know his rights.

          MS. WICHLENS: We don't -

          QUESTION: I - I think probably most of the

people in this room could read - could - could recite

Miranda just from - just from listening to it on

television so often.

          MS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, when I pose that

question at cocktail parties, people generally fall off

with the fourth - the fourth warning.  They don't realize

that they would have a right to counsel appointed -

          QUESTION: Well, I mean, that might depend on how

late in the cocktail party.   I mean, we -

          QUESTION: I'm not in any position to pose the

question later in the cocktail party, Your Honor.  The

importance is that the Fifth Amendment protects two

things, and Miranda, of course, protects the Fifth

Amendment.  And if we give the police officer in the field

a pass to say, Miranda's optional, you can do a cost-

benefit analysis, you can decide whether you think the

statements are really what's going to be important, or you

can decide that it's the derivative evidence, the fruit of

those statements that's going to be important.  We don't

have much of a rule at all.

          As the Tenth Circuit summed it up very aptly, I

think, quoting from the decision of the Tenth Circuit,

from a practical perspective, we see little difference

between the confessional statement, the Glock is in my

bedroom on a shelf, which even the Government concedes

clearly excluded under Miranda and Wong Sun, and the

Government's introduction of the Glock found in the

defendant's bedroom on the shelf.  It's the same thing in

the context of physical evidence.

          QUESTION: But - but the latter you know is true. 

The former may - may have been the product of coercion and

be false.  

          MS. WICHLENS: Correct, Your Honor, but this is -

          QUESTION: So, I mean, that's a big difference if

you think the primary purpose of Miranda is to prevent

false testimony from - from being introduced, then it

seems to me quite reasonable to say that police can indeed

make the choice, do I want to use this testimony.  If I

don't want to use this testimony, I won't give a Miranda

warning, and anything the testimony leads to, if it leads

to anything, I - I don't know how the police will always

know that - that it will lead to something, so I - I think

it's a - a pretty high risk enterprise.

          But what's - what's wrong with it if - if you

think the primary - the primary function of Miranda is to

prevent browbeaten statements by - by - by confused people

in custody who - who confess mistakenly?

          MS. WICHLENS: The problem is, it lets the

individual officer on the street decide whether he or she

is going to give the Miranda warnings in a particular case

or not.  That's not a rule that law enforcement is behind

in, here I'm referring to an amicus filed in - in the

companion case of Seibert.  

          Law enforcement doesn't want such a rule, if I

may be so bold to say that, in general.  They don't want

the police officers to have to be trained in the police

academy to be a lawyer basically, Your Honor, and try to

decide which evidence is going to be most important -

          QUESTION: Well, what - what is your authority,

Ms. Wichlens, for saying that law enforcement doesn't want

this sort of a rule?

          MS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, what I'm

referring to there very specifically is an amicus filed in

the Seibert case by former law enforcement and

prosecution.

          QUESTION: And you think they represent the views

of, quote, law enforcement, closed quote, generally?

          MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I'm a public defender. 

I can't speak for the interests of law enforcement. 

Perhaps I've been presumptuous to -

          QUESTION: Well, you were - you were told in the

argument by Mr. Dreeben that that is the practice of the

FBI and the Federal law enforcement officers.

          MS. WICHLENS: That's - that's correct.  Prudent

police officers, as I understood him to say, will go ahead

and give the warnings.  But we have some very, if I may

say imprudent officers out there, at least in Missouri and

California.  We know about those.  And there are now Web

sites that police officers can go on to that instruct in

this method, instruct police officers to try to decide

what's really important in the case, put themselves in the

position of the DA, I suppose, and decide whether the

statements are really going to make the case or, in a

possessory case, is it the physical evidence that's really

going to make the case?

          In this case is a perfect example of that. 

The information was, he keeps it on his person or in his

car or in his home.  They're going to investigate a felon

in possession of a firearm case.  If they find that

firearm in his bedroom or in his car, that's pretty much

all she wrote.  The prosecution doesn't need a lot more. 

They don't need the suspect's statements about where that

is, and so that's why we can draw a line between physical

evidence and other types of evidence.

          And I could add -

          QUESTION: All right.  So what?  That's - we're

going to the same thing - let's suppose they found out

about that gun without compelling anything, no compulsion

-

          MS. WICHLENS: But violating Miranda.

          QUESTION: - no testifying against yourself.

          MS. WICHLENS: But violating the Miranda rule.

          QUESTION: But they didn't omit - they omitted

the Miranda warning.

          MS. WICHLENS: And we -

          QUESTION: And the Miranda warning is a way of

stopping the compulsion.  But if you're willing to assume

there is no compulsion, what's so horrible about it?

          MS. WICHLENS: Well, I'm - I'm not willing to

assume there is no compulsion.

          QUESTION: Ah, well if there is - then what

you've got is Miranda as a way of getting at instances

where there is compulsion.

          MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely.

          QUESTION: Fine.

          MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely.  That is the basic

premise of Miranda.

          QUESTION: Does that apply to the physical

evidence too?

          MS. WICHLENS: Yes.  I mean, the - the basic

premise, if we want police officers to comply with

Miranda.  And if I could say another word about Elstad,

part of - a central part of the holding in Elstad, as I

understand it, was that in that case, the initial

constitutional violation is cured by the time the

subsequent statement comes around.  In other words, you

have a Miranda violation, the Miranda warnings are not

read, the person is interrogated, then the Miranda

warnings are carefully and thoroughly read.

          And as this Court stated in Elstad, and I'm

quoting, a careful and thorough administration of Miranda

warnings serves to cure the condition that rendered the

unwarned statements inadmissible.  We can't possibly have

that type of cure in the case of physical evidence.  When

the police officer is going simply to seize the physical

evidence, there's no curing of the Miranda violation, and

that's another way that Elstad is distinguishable.

          QUESTION: But was there never a question in this

case of whether the - there was consent to this search,

because the defendant said twice, I know my rights?

          MS. WICHLENS: And you're speaking of the consent

to the search, Your Honor? Because then Detective Benner -

          QUESTION: Consent to the questioning, and then

voluntarily telling them, it's on a shelf in my bedroom? 

Why wasn't the - the whole thing pretty much like when you

go to the bus terminal and say, mind if I ask you a

question?

          MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, because he was under

arrest.  He - he had been told he was under formal arrest. 

He was in handcuffs.  And so the Miranda warnings - the

Miranda warning requirement clearly applied.  And so

Detective Benner was not to ask those questions without

having warned him first.

          QUESTION: Okay.  Well, that's just a silly rule,

isn't it?  I mean -

          MS. WICHLENS: Miranda's not a silly rule, Your

Honor.

          QUESTION: Well, it - it is when the person says,

I know my right.  What if he stuck his fingers in his

ears, saying, I don't want to hear them, I don't want to

hear them.

          (Laughter.)

          QUESTION: But you have to read it to him anyway?

          MS. WICHLENS: It's not hard to say, sorry, pal,

I have to read them to you, and even if you don't want to

require the officer to do that, how about, okay, pal,

would you like to waive those rights?  That's an important

part of Miranda law also: A, inform the suspect of his

rights, B, ask him if he would like to waive them.

          QUESTION: We take the case on the assumption,

the Government's question that there was a failure to give

a suspect the Miranda warnings here, do we not?

          MS. WICHLENS: Correct.  Although the

Government's concession in the lower courts, district

court and Tenth Circuit, is that Miranda was violated

because there was a lack of a knowing waiver of those

Miranda rights, and that's the basis on which the district

court accepted the Government's concession.  But the -

          QUESTION: What did the court of appeals - what

did the court of appeals -

          MS. WICHLENS: The court of appeals assumed a

Miranda violation, and I believe repeated the language

about the waiver problem.

of interruptions to your answer to my question.  If you

had inadequate time to say everything you wanted to say

about the settled state of the law before this case arose

by - in the lower courts, that's your opponent's original

argument.

          MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, simply that those

cases were mistaken.  This Court had never spoken directly

on the subject of derivative evidence rule in the context

of physical evidence.  And the times have changed, Your

Honor.  The time of Elstad and some of this Court's cases,

New York v. Harris, that followed Miranda most

immediately, we all assumed, naively it turns out, that

police officers would at least try to comply with Miranda.

And now there's this movement afoot to basically thumb

their noses, if you will, at this Court's Miranda decision

and say Miranda is just an option.

          QUESTION: May I ask you if the state courts were

uniform in the same way the Federal courts were?

          MS. WICHLENS: The state courts were not.  I've

cited some cases in my brief, both pre-Dickerson and post-

Dickerson, where the state courts were not at all uniform.

          QUESTION: And was that on both the matter of

subsequent confessions and physical evidence?

          MS. WICHLENS: Correct, Your Honor, as I recall.

Court, I would ask this Court to hold that the derivative

evidence rule applies to physical evidence fruit of a

Miranda violation and to affirm the judgment of the Tenth

Circuit Court of Appeals.

          QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Wichlens. 

          Mr. Dreeben, you have three minutes remaining.

         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Miranda is a rule that is perfectly matched to the problem

that the Court sought to address, namely the risk that the

defendant's own self-incriminating statements would be

obtained by compulsion and admitted against him to prove

his guilt.  That risk implicated two central concerns of

the Fifth Amendment, one going to reliability, the other

going to the state's burden to prove guilt with evidence

other than that extracted from the defendant's own mouth.

          Extension of Miranda to this case, which

involves physical evidence that does not involve the

reliability concerns that are at the heart of the Fifth

Amendment, and does not involve the concern about using

the defendant's own self-compelled words to incriminate

him, would not only be contrary to the body of authority

in the lower courts before this Court's decision in

Dickerson and largely after it, but would also be contrary

to the purpose of truth-seeking in a criminal trial that

is central to the Court's jurisprudence in this area.

          Justice Stevens, I - as far as the Government is

aware, there was no more than a handful of cases in the

state courts that have followed the rule, other than what

the Federal rule had been.  Justice White's dissenting

opinion from the denial of certiorari in the Patterson

case, I believe, collects them, but this was by no means a

groundswell movement in the state courts.

          QUESTION: Well, I understand, but I noticed that

in your brief, in your oral statement you said that they

were unanimous, your brief said there was a strong

majority in the Federal courts.  I haven't checked it out

myself but is it - is it a unanimous view in the Federal

courts?

          MR. DREEBEN: My understanding is that there are

eight Federal circuits before Dickerson, including the

Tenth Circuit, that it held that suppression of derivative

physical evidence was not warranted.  Since Dickerson,

only the Tenth Circuit has changed its position, and there

is no other court, other than the First Circuit, which

follows a rule that depends on - on balancing deterrence

concerns against the loss to - of evidence to the trial,

that follows anything akin to the kind of derivative

suppression rule that the Tenth Circuit adopted in this

case.

          Thank you.

          QUESTION: Well, wait, can I - if you have a

minute.  What if the policeman deliberately fails to give

the Miranda warning in order to get the physical evidence?

          MR. DREEBEN: In our view, Justice Breyer, no

different rule is warranted in that situation, because

Miranda continues to protect against the risk that it's

aimed at.  Absent actual compulsion, there is no warrant

for a rule that does anything other than suppress the

actual statements.

          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. 

The case is submitted.

          (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
