CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in Number 01-1862, Jeanne Woodford,


Warden versus Robert Frederick Garceau.


Ms. McLean.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANIS S. McLEAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. McLEAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In Lindh versus Murphy, this Court held that


chapter 153 was non-retroactive to cases pending at the


time of AEDPA's enactment.  In the general run of habeas


cases, this is determined by the filing date of the


application for habeas relief.


This case will resolve a split between the five


circuits that apply this rule to capital cases and the


Ninth Circuit which, instead, looks to the date the


pre-application motion for counsel was filed in a capital


case.


We believe that the five circuits are correct.


Neither chapter 153 nor Lindh versus Murphy


identifies the commencement event that triggers the


application of chapter 153.  In light of this, we must


determine Congress' intent, and the first place to look is

to the express terms of chapter 153 and, of course,


AEDPA's purposes to expedite habeas cases and to provide


greater deferential review to State -- State criminal


convictions.


Chapter 153 by its terms can only apply to a


merits petition.  It repeatedly contains express language,


such as that contained in 2244(d), which is found at


petitioner's appendix 185, which concerns the statute of


limitations provisions and provides that the statute of


limitations applies to the application for habeas relief.


Similarly, the standard of review in 2254(d) at


petitioner's appendix 191 --


QUESTION:  Well, what do we do about McFarland's


approach?


MS. McLEAN: 


Your Honor, I believe that -- that 

these are easily reconciled.  I believe that it -- that


there's a -- I think the habeas proceedings can be -- are


unique and can be extended.  They can also be divided


into -- into segments.


The first phase is the pre-application phase,


which is what McFarland was concerned about.  In that


case, this Court was concerned about providing, pursuant


to 21 U.S.C. 848 -- concerned about the pre-application


grant of counsel to habeas petitioners.  But that is


entirely separable from the merits proceeding that occurs

after the filing of the -- of the petition itself which


brings the merits before the court.


QUESTION:  It's the difference between a case


and a proceeding.  How -- how do you get us here under the


words of the statute?


MS. McLEAN:  The -- actually, the provisions of


chapter 153 themselves do not contain the word case. 


That -- we only come to that term at all because in this


Court's opinion in Lindh, the Court looked to -- created


a -- viewed the -- as being a negative inference from the


absence of the pending cases language that appears in the


154 provisions.


The 153 provisions do not have that -- those --


that term in them.  Instead, they use the specific express


words of an application. 


They clearly apply to an 

application.  And the case -- that's reconcilable because


the portion of the case that we're talking about is the


merits portion of the -- of the case.


This Court recognized that there can be multiple


cases in a habeas proceeding.  In Slack versus McDaniel,


the Court recognized that there could be a separate


appellate case that --


QUESTION:  How was it treated on the court's


docket?  I mean, the -- something was going on.  There was


a request for a stay.  There was a request for the

appointment of counsel.  So something was initiated, and


what was that something called?


MS. McLEAN:  That would -- it could be


characterized as -- you could use the word case.  You


could use the word habeas corpus proceeding.


QUESTION:  Do you know how it was in fact?  How


was it treated on the court's docket?


MS. McLEAN:  It --


QUESTION:  Was it given a case name and a file?


MS. McLEAN:  It was -- it was certainly given a


case name and assigned a case number, undoubtedly, but I


do not --


QUESTION:  And would that number indicate that


it was a habeas petition?


MS. McLEAN: 


I'm sure it did because our courts 

in California, the -- the district courts have numbers


that specify that it's a habeas proceeding.


QUESTION:  So it was on the docket as a habeas


case.


MS. McLEAN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  And that's not good enough.


MS. McLEAN:  That's not determinative.  What


I'm -- my position is, or our position is, is that


these -- that the habeas proceeding is unique and


extended.  It includes three phases; includes the

pre-application phase, which is the -- what McFarland was


concerned about.  It -- it then has the merits application


phase that begins with the filing of the application for


habeas relief.  It then also has the appellate phase.


QUESTION:  Well, McFarland was a totally


different statute from AEDPA, was it not?  It -- it was --


it's a totally separate statute.


MS. McLEAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And really, what we're trying to


interpret here, I take it, is the meaning of some of the


language in Lindh.  We're -- we're not talking about any


specific language in -- even in AEDPA.


MS. McLEAN:  Well, we're concerned about --


Lindh used the phrase that -- that there was


non-retroactivity of chapter 153 to cases -- to cases 

pending under 153.


So the question is, what is the commencement


event that we talked about, that -- that we're referring


to?  What -- what creates the pending case for purposes of


chapter 153?


For that, we have to look back to the express


terms of the statute.  Since 153 can -- doesn't apply to


the -- the pre-application phase --


QUESTION:  Why -- why would we look to the


express terms of the statute when Lindh itself didn't rely

on any express terms of this statute?  Why wouldn't we


look to -- to what makes sense with respect to the rule


that we have created?


MS. McLEAN:  I would agree with that, that


the -- what I'm saying is that in the absence of -- in the


absence of language -- there's clearly an absence of


language in 153 that addresses this commencement event. 


So that puts us into a position of looking to see what


Congress intended based on what the express words of


chapter 153 are.  Is -- is there anything in chapter 153


that tells us that, no, we didn't mean the -- the -- a


commencement of a habeas proceeding based on the filing of


an application?  We meant something earlier, i.e., the


motion for -- for a request for appointment of counsel.


And the answer to that is no.  Simply no.  There


is nothing in chapter 153 that has anything to do with the


pre-application proceeding.  Those provisions, as is


demonstrated by their terms and also the habeas corpus


rules concerning chapter 2254 cases -- those only can


apply -- expressly apply to applications for habeas


relief.  They do not apply to any earlier event, and it


doesn't -- it thwarts the purposes of AEDPA by -- by


unduly confining the number of cases covered by it,


capital cases covered by it.  It --


QUESTION:  That's the part I wonder.  I was

thinking that if it's open to -- pend -- the -- the


case -- what is it called?  Is it -- McFarland -- suggests


that it's at least open to calling this pending.  It's a


possible construction.


MS. McLEAN:  Yes, it's a possible construction.


QUESTION:  And then -- and then it being a


possible construction, I wonder, well, there was an awful


lot of proceeding that went on here.  There was a stay. 


It was opposed.  And all of this took place before the --


the petition was filed.  So if the purpose of AEDPA, at


least as we've interpreted it, is to stay away from


proceedings that were already underway, this would seem to


have been well underway.


MS. McLEAN:  It was -- the -- the proceeding was


well underway, but that doesn't -- is not determinative 

in -- in the sense that counsel had been appointed and a


petition was in the works.  But that --


QUESTION:  That's -- that's what I want you to


address precisely.  That's where I'm uncertain.  It seems


as if the language -- you could -- you could -- you


could -- the language is open to either interpretation --

QUESTION:  And yet -- well, you -- you think


it's more strong in your direction.  I -- I understand


that.  But if -- say, if it's open to either

interpretation, then why doesn't the purpose of the


application provisions, as we've interpreted them, suggest


don't apply it where proceedings are well underway, which


would mean the other side would win here.  That's why I'm


asking you.  I want to see what your response is.


MS. McLEAN:  In order to deviate from -- from


the normal -- also, there is no question that in -- in the


general run of habeas cases, it's triggered by the filing


of the application.  So the question is whether there's


some justification, some harm that would be caused by


not -- by treating them -- them being the capital cases --


under the Ninth Circuit's ruling differently than we do


the normal run of habeas cases.  And there's nothing about


the fact that a counsel had been appointed or that -- that


a application was in the works, but not yet filed, that 

would prevent us or harm in any way those petitioners from


ultimately being subject to the greater standards of


deferential review that -- that AEDPA ultimately imposed. 


There's no harm whatsoever.


And it doesn't further -- it thwarts the


purposes of AEDPA to do that.  It -- it also creates a


subclass of capital defendants who are treated


differently --


QUESTION:  But if everyone had focused on AEDPA,


which they didn't because it wasn't enacted at the time

all this started, then maybe the district judge would have


made the time lines different.  And the district court had


a proceeding before it with a number.  It was classified a


habeas case.  And the district court set a rather relaxed


schedule.  He gave the counsel, appointed counsel, many


months to file the actual petition.  And if everybody had


known that the -- that the time the district judge gave


would mean that AEDPA would apply, then I assume counsel,


being diligent, would have said, don't give me that much


time.  I have to get this in quickly.


MS. McLEAN:  This case that's before the Court


does not involve the statute of limitations, however.  The


concerns that you're expressing would be valid --


QUESTION:  But you don't want AEDPA to apply, if


you're diligent counsel, because the standards are much 

tighter.


MS. McLEAN:  It does affect the standards of


review, but they don't --


QUESTION:  Well, counsel didn't have to take all


the time that the district court allowed, did he?


MS. McLEAN:  He did not need to, but he -- he


was fully compliant.


To the extent that the Court's concern here


appears to this counsel to be concerned about the statute


of limitations, there was no issue here.  This case came

in timely.  And in fact, in the Ninth Circuit, they


followed the same rule that all the other five circuits


followed all the way up until 1998.  So really the statute


of limitations is virtually a non-issue in this situation. 


This case did -- the -- the -- any delays or long periods


of times that were granted or anything didn't have


anything to do with this case.  There is no harm in this


case.


The only issue is that now, once this case was


in the district court and in the Ninth Circuit, should it


be subject to the deferential standards of review that


AEDPA imposed, and the answer to that is yes.  There was


no -- there is absolutely no harm in now saying that


because the filing of the application came in after the


enactment of AEDPA, that it should be subject, just as all 

other habeas cases are, to --


QUESTION:  Do we know how many cases fall in


this category?  This is a transition case caught in


between.  No AEDPA when it all started; AEDPA in the


middle before the petition is filed.


MS. McLEAN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  How many cases are in that category?


MS. McLEAN:  We believe -- we believe that it


affects approximately -- in the Ninth Circuit,


particularly in California, it affects approximately

45 capital cases.


QUESTION:  45 cases.


MS. McLEAN:  It also -- it also, of course,


affects the other -- those cases, those capital cases,


that are covered by the other circuits which currently


use -- all of which, other than the Ninth Circuit, as to


those 45 cases, use the filing date of the application. 


So if the Court, obviously, was to choose the position


advocated by respondent, it would change the standard of


review from AEDPA to non-AEDPA in those States covered by


those circuits.


In the Ninth Circuit, what will -- would happen


if you adopted the position that I'm advocating is that


you -- that those 45 cases in California, approximately


45 cases in California, will now become AEDPA cases.  And


that will primarily affect the standard of review that is


applied to them.


Garceau --

 MS. McLEAN:  That's certainly true, but it's


very important.  Garceau is the perfect example of why


this is an important issue for this Court, the -- in


Garceau, the -- the State -- the State supreme court


issued a very well-reasoned opinion issuing -- saying that


it had decided that error was harmless, upholding the


conviction that occurred in this case.  It went through


the district court.  The district court agreed.  It went


to the Ninth Circuit in 2001 -- this was a 1984 killing. 


In -- in 2001, it was reversed by the Ninth Circuit, which


did -- because it did not believe it was an AEDPA case,


refused to apply the deferential standard of review,


refused to apply the precedents of this Court, instead


looked at its own -- its own cases, and reversed it.


And this is -- you know, this is the most 

important -- a capital conviction in California is the


most important cases -- some of the most important cases


that that State issues.  And -- and to have that reversed


for the failure to apply this -- the standards that


Congress imposed in 1996 is a very, very serious matter.


And that's just one case.  It's happened in other cases. 


And -- and so, we believe that it's very important to have


this issue straightened out.


QUESTION:  Do you wish to reserve the remainder


of your time?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LYNNE S. COFFIN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. COFFIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The issue is not whether this harms Mr. Garceau,


but whether it is appropriate under this Court's precedent


to rule the way the State asked this Court to rule.


For two independent reasons, the amendments to


chapter 153 do not apply to Mr. Garceau.


First, it simply cannot be, as the State


suggests, that after this Court found in McFarland that 

a capital case is commenced by the filing of a motion for


counsel, that Congress then passed a new statute,


intending it to be interpreted consistent with the dissent


in this case.  Congress must be presumed to have been


informed by this Court's majority ruling in McFarland. 


The McFarland Court ruled that -- that Congress had


permitted a capital proceeding to be initiated by the


filing of a motion for counsel.  That ruling was only


2 years before Congress made major revisions to the habeas


corpus law in AEDPA.  Under statutory construction

principles, Congress must be found to have been aware of


and followed this Court's precedent set in McFarland.


QUESTION:  Well, are you -- are you saying,


Ms. Coffin, that McFarland is controlling in the very


strict sense of the word here, that if -- we must rule in


your favor without looking anywhere else just because of


the decision in McFarland?


MS. COFFIN:  No.  What I'm -- what I am saying


is that I believe that this Court should look to what


informed Congress when they wrote AEDPA.  And I think once


that is done, this Court will conclude that if you


interpret the ruling in Lindh, where -- where 107(c)


applies to 153 and 154 -- where did Congress get the word


case when they were determining who would be subject to


this law? 


And I agree with Justice Ginsburg that when a 

case is begun, you get a number, you're put on a docket. 


That is your case, and that is consistent with what this


Court decided in McFarland.


What is not consistent is to believe that


Congress used the word case rather than petition when they


quite clearly used petition in many other parts of the


statute.


QUESTION:  When -- when did Congress pass the


law that -- that overturned the result in McFarland?  You


say they passed a law that overturned the result?

 MS. COFFIN:  No, no.  What I said was that they


passed AEDPA, and when they did that, they were informed


in how they wrote that statute by McFarland.  That was in


'96.


QUESTION:  Okay.  And they -- they haven't dealt


with the issue of McFarland.


MS. COFFIN:  Well, in -- yes and no.  I mean,


I think that they -- they had an opportunity to change


848(q) and looked at 848(q) --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. COFFIN:  -- when they wrote AEDPA, and they


chose to leave 848(q) in place.


QUESTION:  Well, now, is that supported by


something in, say, the legislative history, or is that


just your -- your own view of what must have happened? 

MS. COFFIN:  There is nothing in the legislative


history that supports one side or the other.  However, if


one looks at McFarland -- the majority decision, as well


as Justice O'Connor's concurrence and dissent -- one sees


that this Court made it very clear to Congress that if


they meant something like petition or application, which


are pretty much used synonymously, that they better put


those words in because, in fact, the majority in this --


in -- of this Court refused to read that kind of language


into McFarland, and that's part of how McFarland got

decided.


So very shortly thereafter, Congress wrote a law


completely revising or, you know, substantially revising


habeas corpus.  And it's simply difficult to believe that


at that point, they decided not to look at the majority


opinion in McFarland which uses the word case.


QUESTION:  But it's -- it's not at all an


unusual phenomenon that -- that a word in -- in statutes


has different application in different contexts where


you --


We had a case the other day.  When is something


final?  Congress says, you know, when -- when it's final. 


It depends on what the context is, and nothing -- nothing


says that just because you -- you think that the case for


one purpose, for the McFarland purpose, begins with the --

with the initial filings, for -- for all purposes it has


to begin there.


And what impresses me about this case is that I


don't see what is gained by extending the inapplicability


of AEDPA earlier than the filing of the habeas petition


because the purpose of -- of the non-retroactivity


provision is certainly not to cause somebody to be


frustrated in actions that he took in reliance upon the


prior law.  And -- and a -- a habeas applicant could be


frustrated in events that occur after the filing of his

habeas petition.  But all of the events prior to that


filing that were covered by McFarland, they aren't covered


by AEDPA anyway.  AEDPA could not possibly affect those


earlier events.  So -- so nothing -- nothing is served by


making the retroactivity go back further.


MS. COFFIN:  Well, I -- I think there are


actually two answers to that question.  The first one is


it isn't really an issue of whether or not -- in my


opinion, it's not an issue of whether or not some harm is


going to come to -- to Mr. Garceau by interpreting this


one way or the other.  That's not the issue.


The issue is what did Congress mean when they


did this.  They had one purpose, I agree with you, which


was to reform habeas corpus and make things move in a --


in a more orderly fashion.


QUESTION:  Right.


But they had another -- there -- there is also


another part to that, and that is, they determined that


certain cases would not be covered by AEDPA.  And so --


QUESTION:  Well, those cases -- those cases, in


which they did not want to frustrate legitimate


expectations.


But my point is, there is no possible legitimate


expectation that would be frustrated by AEDPA in the


pre-application stage.  AEDPA simply doesn't have anything

to do with that.


MS. COFFIN:  Well, the language of the statute


says case, and -- and I think there -- I think --


QUESTION:  Okay.  You're back to that argument,


but on that argument, you know, what's a case depends on


the context.


MS. COFFIN:  I also think that there is a -- a


reason that can be discerned from their retroactivity


provisions which was --


QUESTION:  Well, in your -- in your answer to


Justice Scalia, you said, well, you're not sure about the


harm, but the harm exists, it -- it seems to me, in not


giving full effect to the congressional scheme.  The --


the Congress obviously thought that this was a -- that


AEDPA was a preferred regime, and you are delaying what 

Congress has found a preferred regime.  So it's a harm in


that sense, maybe not the harm in a particular case that


would come out one way or the other, but you are delaying


the effectiveness of -- of a congressional scheme.


MS. COFFIN:  But Congress chose to determine


that not everyone would be immediately affected --


immediately affected by AEDPA, and they --


QUESTION:  Well, of course, for -- for the


reasons given.  We -- we want -- we want cases that


have -- where the merits have been addressed to be decided

under the -- the law before it was changed by AEDPA.


MS. COFFIN:  Justice Kennedy, I believe that, in


fact, the -- the cases that were in the pipeline, this


finite number of cases, were exactly the cases -- not the


154 cases, but the 153 capital cases that were in the


pipeline that Congress was aware that they were


pre-petition cases, petition cases, various kinds of


cases.  And if they wanted to make sure that it -- this


statute would be interpreted in a way so that anyone that


was in Federal court and that had vast proceedings take


place, but that had not filed a petition yet, all they had


to do was put the word petition in.  And I believe that we


are bound by what Congress did.  I understand that


they want --


QUESTION: 


But -- but that -- but that's just 

not true that -- that we give a word the same meaning in


all contexts.  We -- we evidently don't.  There are so


many instances of that, that your argument cannot --


cannot rely just upon that.  And it seems to me all of the


other courts that have come out the other way from the


Ninth Circuit have done so for a very sensible reason, and


that is that there is nothing to be gained, nothing


whatever to be gained, by refusing -- or by -- by refusing


to apply AEDPA to these pre-petition activities inasmuch


as AEDPA cannot affect them at all.

 MS. COFFIN:  Well, if -- to give you a brief


answer, on the other -- on the other circuits, the fact of


the matter is none of them analyzed this in terms of


Congress' intent at the time that they wrote AEDPA and how


they were informed by McFarland.


However, even if this Court is not convinced


that Congress' awareness of McFarland is dispositive as to


the meaning of case pending, Garceau had a case pending


pre-AEDPA under this Court's definitions of what


constitutes a case.


Prior to AEDPA, Garceau had begun the process of


challenging a State conviction and death sentence in part


by filing in the district court a pleading detailing two


fully exhausted claims of Federal constitutional


violations. 


Garceau sought and received counsel in order 

to raise claims and challenge a State conviction and death


sentence.  He filed a document detailing the two claims I


just mentioned with their factual and legal foundation


which were ripe for adjudication.  The district court made


a determination, after hearings, that these claims


presented viable grounds for habeas corpus relief.


Under Hohn, we believe Garceau had a case


pending.  The determination in Garceau's case is very


analogous to the judicial determination in Hohn concerning


the COA application.

 QUESTION:  I mean, is it true, by the way --


is -- is that the case or not that -- I'm interested in


the question -- that -- that if in fact AEDPA applies to


a -- AEDPA does -- there's a difference whether AEDPA


does -- does it make a difference if AEDPA applies or not


to the --


MS. COFFIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  How?


MS. COFFIN:  Well, there's more deferential


standard to the State -- to the State court's decision.


QUESTION:  So it does make just as much


difference.


QUESTION:  No, but not -- not to any decision


that is taken before the filing of the -- of the formal


habeas application.


MS. COFFIN:  Oh.  If you're asking whether this


particular thing that I was just talking about would have


made a difference, no.


QUESTION:  Your case.  In your case.  A person


files a petition asking for a lawyer, and then we have a


lot of litigation.


MS. COFFIN:  Right.


QUESTION:  Should there be a stay?  Should there


not be a stay?


MS. COFFIN:  Right.

 QUESTION:  And I guess the answer to that could


affect a later determination in the case.  I don't know.


MS. COFFIN:  I would concede that, in fact, in


this case and I think all the pipeline cases, that even if


AEDPA had applied at the time that the case originated,


there would not have been a different determination in


terms of those early proceedings.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. COFFIN:  However, the -- the point I'm


trying to make now is that even if this Court doesn't


believe that -- that case pending can be determined by


looking at McFarland and Lindh, I think that the -- what


Hohn has identified as what is needed for a case is, in


fact, found in the Garceau case and that's because of the


proceeding that Garceau followed where he actually filed 

what could have been a petition had that name been put on


it.


QUESTION:  Can you specify what were the


pre-petition -- I thought that there was -- there was also


something submitted by counsel, a kind of skeletal


statement of issues, and -- and because there was an


adversary proceeding, was there not?  The -- the State


moved to dismiss the stay.  And something what -- was


something different submitted by Garceau himself earlier,


and then something by counsel later?  What was the

sequence?


MS. COFFIN:  No.  What -- what happened is there


was an application for counsel.  Counsel was appointed. 


Counsel then -- there was a stay before counsel was


appointed so that counsel could be found.  Then counsel


was appointed, and an additional 120-day stay went into


effect before counsel filed the document I'm now talking


about.  And this document is the Specification of Non-


frivolous Issues, which includes two claims that were --


and were in the petition ultimately that put -- set forth


the factual and legal basis for those two claims.  And


then the judge had to determine whether or not one or both


of those claims were non-frivolous.  Otherwise, the stay


would have been dissolved, and Garceau -- actually I would


imagine that the counsel may have been pulled, but that's 

not what happened.


QUESTION:  And that statement of issues was


filed pre-AEDPA.


MS. COFFIN:  Yes.  Yes, and as in Hohn --


QUESTION:  Well, excuse me.  There was -- but


that was also after the application for habeas corpus had


been filed.  No?


QUESTION:  No.


MS. COFFIN:  No, no.  This is before.  What


I'm -- what I'm saying is this document, the Specification

of Non-frivolous Issues, which is required under the rules


of all of the district courts in California --


QUESTION:  In order to get counsel appointed.


MS. COFFIN:  No.  Actually, you get it after


counsel is appointed.  In order to get an additional stay


in which to file the petition, you --


QUESTION:  Isn't this --


MS. COFFIN:  -- you get counsel and then counsel


must file something that a district court determines is,


in fact -- has at least one non-frivolous issue --


QUESTION:  Is that ex parte?


MS. COFFIN:  No.  It's served -- it's served on


the other side.


QUESTION:  And it -- so is it generally argued


whether or not these are non-frivolous issues? 

MS. COFFIN:  It wasn't argued in this particular


case whether they were non-frivolous issues.  It's a --


it's a determination made by the district court.  However,


the other parties are served and certainly could make an


argument --


QUESTION:  See, that -- that's why I thought


there --


QUESTION:  Could any -- could any of those -- of


those events that you've just described, pre-filing of the


habeas, conceivably be affected by AEDPA?  Is there any

way that AEDPA could have disappointed expectations with


regard to that pre-application activity?


MS. COFFIN:  No.


QUESTION:  Why?  I mean, that's -- what I


don't -- I'm a petitioner.  I ask for a lawyer.  The judge


says, do you have any non-frivolous claim?  He says, sure,


this is it, and you list them.  Now, if, in fact, AEDPA's


in effect, we're going to apply a pretty lenient standard


in reviewing the State court determinations on those


issues, but if AEDPA isn't in effect, we're --


QUESTION:  Are the State court's determinations


reviewable?


MS. COFFIN:  Well, I -- I certainly --


QUESTION:  I mean, if the State court


appoints --


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  What I was thinking is


that if the standard for reviewing the State court


determinations is different, depending on whether you


apply AEDPA or not, I don't see why, in principle, that


couldn't affect the outcome of a judge's decision as to


whether the issue in the petition in front of me is or is


not a frivolous issue.


MS. COFFIN:  I agree.


QUESTION:  So I think in principle it could


affect the outcome.  In fact, probably -- I don't know if

it did or not, but I -- I don't see the difference between


that affecting the outcome there --


MS. COFFIN:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- and the outcome of an early stage


where you file the petition.


MS. COFFIN:  Well, in fact -- in fact, in this


case there probably would have been a different


determination at least as to one of the two issues that --


that Garceau put forward.


QUESTION:  I wasn't even aware that these things


were reviewable.  You -- you mean to say that you get


judicial review of whether, when counsel is appointed,


the -- the trial court allows counsel to proceed with a


habeas?  You -- you can take that up on judicial review?


MS. COFFIN:  Well, I -- I --


QUESTION:  Don't you just go ahead and what


ultimately is reviewed is the -- is the substantive


disposition of the habeas application?


MS. COFFIN:  No.  I -- I don't believe so.  In


fact, had the district court determined that there were no


non-frivolous issues, the stay would have been dissolved,


and unless Garceau appealed that judgment of -- of the


district court or filed something else, he would have been


out of court.


QUESTION:  Well, what -- but what if the

district court determined that these were non-frivolous


issues?  Does the State have any right to appeal that


determination?  Has it ever happened?


MS. COFFIN:  I don't believe it's ever happened.


QUESTION:  But does the State have a right to be


heard?  The -- the question is whether the stay will be


continued.  The Specification of Non-frivolous Issues is


filed.  If the State says these are frivolous issues, can


the State be heard?


MS. COFFIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Can the State file a responsive


pleading?


MS. COFFIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Do the -- do such hearings occur?


MS. COFFIN: 


It didn't occur in this case. 

QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  But there was some proceeding.


MS. COFFIN:  There was a proceeding.  Before the


statement of non-frivolous -- Specification of Non-


frivolous Issues was filed, the State objected to the stay


that the district court had put into place to -- so that a


petition could be filed because under the local rules, you


can't get an additional stay to file the petition unless


you file this document that shows that you have at least


one viable issue.  And so prior to the filing of that

specification by counsel, the State objected when the


district court extended the stay.


QUESTION:  And once the issue -- the statement


of issues -- once that was filed, then there was no


response?


MS. COFFIN:  No.  There was no response from the


State at that point.


QUESTION:  If there had been a response, the


State had lost, and the State wanted to contest it, could


the State take that up?


MS. COFFIN:  I believe -- I -- I believe that


they could, but it didn't happen in this case.


QUESTION:  It -- it would be interlocutory.


QUESTION:  You just answered a minute ago to my


question that they couldn't.


MS. COFFIN:  That they couldn't -- no.  I


said -- no.  My answer -- I'm sorry if I gave a confusing


answer.  My answer was they didn't in this case and I'm


not aware of it happening in other cases.


QUESTION:  Has -- you -- you don't know that


it's ever been done.

answer.


QUESTION:  But if -- if the district judge said,


all right, I accept these, you've got a non-frivolous

issue, at that point, the State couldn't go up to the


appellate court because it would be very -- it would be


interlocutory.


MS. COFFIN:  I believe that's correct.


QUESTION:  Help me out and -- and tell me


what -- what portion of -- of AEDPA would apply to this


pre-application event.


MS. COFFIN:  Well if --


QUESTION:  (d) says, an application for a writ


of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant


to the judgment of State court shall not be granted with


respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in


State court proceedings.  Well, that -- that provision


certainly wouldn't apply to any -- there -- nothing has


been -- been adjudicated on the merits. 

Right?


MS. COFFIN:  If the district court determined


that -- if AEDPA applied and the district court looked at


the issues that you wanted to go forward on, and applied


the deferential standard of AEDPA and, therefore,


determined that, in fact, it was a frivolous issue because


under AEDPA you would not be able to win --


QUESTION:  Would you call that an adjudication


on the merits?  Just the preliminary determination that


there is or is not a frivolous issue here?  I -- I


wouldn't call that a -- a determination on the merits.  So

I don't think (d) would apply.


What about (e)?  (e) says, in -- in a proceeding


instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus


by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State


court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State


court shall be presumed to be correct.  Are there factual


issues decided in these -- in -- in these --


MS. COFFIN:  Well, there are --


QUESTION:  -- pre-applications?


MS. COFFIN:  There are factual issues put forth. 


The factual and legal foundation of the claims that --


that are in the Specification of Non-frivolous Issues are


put forth.


But I think that there's an additional question


that -- that needs to be examined, which is, is what 

Garceau filed, under this Court's precedent in Hohn, a


case?  And I believe that it is.


QUESTION:  Was that the view of the Ninth


Circuit?


MS. COFFIN:  Excuse me?


QUESTION:  Was that the view of the Ninth


Circuit when it decided this case?


MS. COFFIN:  The Ninth Circuit didn't apply


AEDPA to this case.


QUESTION:  So you're saying even if AEDPA had

been -- had been applicable, your client still should have


prevailed.


MS. COFFIN:  No.  What -- what I'm suggesting is


that AEDPA should not be applied to Garceau either because


of the first argument that I made about McFarland, or if


this Court is not satisfied that, in fact, Garceau had a


case pending, which is the language from Lindh that


determines whether or not AEDPA should be retroactive.


And I'd like to make one other point, which is


that there are -- it is a finite number of cases that were


in the pipeline.  It's a very unusual situation.  In fact,


you had to be post-State court determination and in


Federal court and somewhere along in -- in the process in


Federal court in order to be in this sort of bubble area. 


And I think --


QUESTION:  Well, Lindh was a similar case, was


it not?


MS. COFFIN:  Yes, but it was non-capital.


QUESTION:  I have a question about this -- the


proceeding.  AEDPA was pending when this was going on, and


the counsel that represented this petitioner was the same


counsel who represented him in the State court.  Isn't


that so?


MS. COFFIN:  Actually not.  What happened was


lead counsel in State court was unavailable to go forward

and neither counsel that -- there were two counsel that


participated at one point or another in State court, but


neither participated in the whole case and neither was


lead counsel.  And so lead counsel was unavailable and the


court appointed two new counsel who had some familiarity


with the case.


QUESTION:  Knowing that AEDPA was on the front


burner, counsel having some familiarity with the case, why


did they use all the time that the district court gave


them instead of filing before AEDPA went into effect?


MS. COFFIN:  Well, there were a number of


reasons for that.  The first is that in State court,


they -- there was neither discovery nor any evidentiary


hearing.  There was no mechanism -- there was very little


money and there was no mechanism by which counsel could 

pull together an entire petition.  And the district court


agreed with that by giving counsel funds in Federal court.


However, the district court set forth a schedule


by which funds would be -- would be given, and those


funds -- you did some investigation, you got -- you


satisfied the district court, you got more funds.  The


last funds were not -- were not given to counsel until,


I believe, the end of May, which was only about 4 weeks


before the petition was filed.  So that's one reason.


The other reason is that counsel had to make a

determination, under this Court's precedent, whether or


not it would be a mistake not to file a full petition, the


best petition that could possibly be made and because it


would be possible that it might not have been able to be


amended.  And so --


QUESTION:  Ms. -- Ms. Coffin, you -- you have to


make the best argument for your client here, and -- and


you're doing that.


But it strikes me that -- that there -- this is


sort of a mixed bag, that actually, in agreeing with you,


we would probably be -- be harming most capital


defendants, that is to say, your client will win on this


retroactivity point which will eventually vanish.  It's


a -- it's a temporary problem.


But the effect of our holding that -- that the 

habeas action for purposes of AEDPA commences with the --


the initial request for counsel is that all -- all of the


transactions -- I mean, if -- if that provision that all


factual determinations by the State court must be deemed


to be correct, that means that AEDPA would, in the future,


apply to those -- to those determinations.  Whereas, if we


came out the other way, until the habeas application is --


is applied, the strictures of AEDPA don't -- are -- are


not applicable.  So, you know, it's a -- it's -- it's not


a -- not a win-win game, but it is for your client, I

suppose.


MS. COFFIN:  Well, actually, Your Honor, since I


have clients in many different positions here, I actually


don't believe that it would be a problem for other capital


defendants, and I do believe that it's the correct result


on either basis that I have put forth for Garceau.


QUESTION:  Because even under AEDPA, if you just


come in at the threshold, the court -- the Federal court,


in general, is quite liberal about letting you develop the


facts necessary to present your claim.  It may be a


problem with amending a petition in habeas, but your


point, I take it, is that you can't envision any real harm


to any of your clients if the starting date of AEDPA would


be considered the filing of the stay application and the


request for counsel.


MS. COFFIN:  No.


QUESTION:  May I just ask one question?  The --


the proceedings that took place between the appointment of


counsel, which involved the -- whether the -- the


statement as to the kind of issues and so forth and the


State's motion to vacate the stay and so forth -- were


they all given the same number that Justice Ginsburg


referred to earlier?


And then after the habeas application itself was


filed, was the case given a different number, or was the

same number continued?


MS. COFFIN:  This case has only had one number


in district court, and it is one of the kind of ironies of


all of this.  I would have thought that the word case is


very obvious.  You go to district court.  They stamp your


papers.  You have a number.  That's your district court


case and that's your case number.  And that's the number


that Garceau had all the way through his district court


proceedings.  He then got a different number stamped on


his case by the Ninth Circuit when he was on appeal --


QUESTION:  Oh, yes --


MS. COFFIN:  -- but there's been one -- one


number all the way through and you don't get a get a


different number when you file a habeas petition.


If there are no further questions. 

QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Coffin.


Ms. McLean, you have 16 minutes left.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANIS S. McLEAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


QUESTION:  Ms. McLean, we've been talking about


the statement of non-frivolous issues that's filed.  In


your view -- and I -- I would assume, at least for


purposes of my question, that AEDPA might make a


difference, that it might be non-frivolous before AEDPA,


but -- but then frivolous after.  I'm assuming that could

be true because of clear -- clear and convincing evidence


standing, for instance.


MS. McLEAN:  Your Honor, I respectfully disagree


with that.  There's nothing in AEDPA that applies


whatsoever to the pre-application period.  The deferential


provisions of 2254(d) can only apply once an application


is filed by its express terms.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm -- I -- I take it the


district court is interested.  That's because they --


that's why they require this filing -- whether or not


there's going to be anything here for the court to


adjudicate.  Is there some substantial issue?


And the point of my question was going to be


let's assume that post- and pre-AEDPA, the standard of


frivolity changes.  Let's assume that.  Or non-frivolity. 


Would you say that there is an expectation that's


legitimate and that exists if there's a filing of a


statement of non-frivolous issues pre-AEDPA and then


before the complaint is filed -- before the petition is


filed, AEDPA comes into effect?  Would you say an


expectation has been established?


MS. McLEAN:  No.  And the reason for that is


that that document that is filed is so skeletal that it


absolutely bears no resemblance to a -- ultimately to a


petition.  Its sole purpose is to satisfy the local

district court rules that require that there be some


showing for the court to exercise its discretion in


issuing a stay.


This Court recognized that requirement, or at


least a -- the discretionary nature of the State grant in


McFarland.  This isn't something that automatically


happens.  It's something that has to be deserved, and the


way the local rules in -- in California work are that they


have to file the statement -- a specification of non-


frivolous claims.  It doesn't ask for habeas relief.  In


this case, it stated 2 out of ultimately 28 claims that


were ultimately raised.  It -- it doesn't -- it's not


labeled a petition.  There was no expectation whatsoever


by Mr. Garceau that that was treated as any sort of a


petition --


QUESTION:  The only expectation is you'll get a


stay until you file your petition.


MS. McLEAN:  Exactly.  That was its sole


purpose.  There's absolutely nothing that is in --


contained in chapter 153 that has anything to do with the


pre-application proceedings.


QUESTION:  Well, why -- why --


QUESTION:  Would you just confirm for me the --


the language of 153 applies to an application for a writ


of habeas corpus.  Okay.  That's (d) and also (e) in a

proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of


habeas corpus.  Now, that -- that was not quite the


language involved in McFarland, was it?  What was the


language involved in McFarland?


MS. McLEAN:  In McFarland, this Court was


construing the term post-conviction proceeding and


saying -- because 848 -- 21 U.S.C. 848 --


QUESTION:  Before whom a habeas corpus


proceeding is pending.  I think --


MS. McLEAN:  That is actually the -- the


companion provision, the State provision, in 2251.  The


provision in 21 U.S.C. 848 specifies that there's an


entitlement to an appointment of counsel in a


post-conviction proceeding --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. McLEAN:  -- under -- arising under 2254 or


2255.


QUESTION:  So you think instituted by an


application for a writ of habeas corpus means just that. 


It has to be instituted by the application.


MS. McLEAN:  It's extremely explicit.  And it


also is consistent with how we're treating all other


habeas cases.


QUESTION:  Can you -- forgetting the -- the --


I -- I'm still slightly confused on what I'd call the

practical point.  Imagine on January 1, before AEDPA is


passed, they file a petition -- no, not a petition --


a petition for a lawyer.  And there's stay applications. 


And everything under the sun is litigated on that stay


application, as it often is in a capital case.  On June 1,


once the stay was granted, they file their official habeas


petition.  On December 1, AEDPA is enacted.  Now, the


question is whether AEDPA will govern future proceedings


in the case.  And what we've said is it doesn't govern


those future proceedings if, in fact, that petition had


been filed on June 1.  Right?


MS. McLEAN:  Well, this Court hasn't -- that's


what this case --


QUESTION:  No.  I'm saying the petition for


habeas. 


The habeas is pending as of the time that AEDPA 

was there.  The petition for habeas was filed on June 1. 


The petition for the lawyer and so forth was filed


6 months before.  Am I right?  Am I right?  Maybe I mixed


up that.


MS. McLEAN:  I -- I -- in all -- the only cases


that this Court has addressed is in the non-capital


context, and you have -- you've said that AEDPA applies


once the filed petition is -- if the filed petition


occurred prior to the enactment of AEDPA --


QUESTION:  If the filed -- the habeas petition

applies -- was filed, and habeas proceedings are underway,


and then later on AEDPA is enacted, does AEDPA apply?


MS. McLEAN:  Once -- if the habeas petition --


QUESTION:  Yes, the habeas petition.


MS. McLEAN:  -- the application for merits is


filed before --


QUESTION:  Before AEDPA.


MS. McLEAN:  -- the enactment of AEDPA, yes,


there -- that is not an AEDPA case in --


QUESTION:  Thank you.


Now, what I'm saying is -- is January 1, they


ask for a lawyer and then they go through the stay.  On


June 1 they file the habeas petition.  On December 1,


AEDPA is enacted.  Now, we don't apply it to that case


because the habeas proceeding was underway. 

MS. McLEAN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  All right.  Why don't we?  Because


that judge might have made up his mind about various


things because there could have been things decided.  Now,


why isn't precisely the same thing true as to the period


January 1 to June 1, where all kinds of things were


decided, the stay was litigated, the judge has made up his


mind, who knows how it affected the future proceedings? 


That's what -- do you see the question?


MS. McLEAN:  I do.

 QUESTION:  What's the answer?


MS. McLEAN:  Respectfully, though, I believe


that that ignores the express wording of -- of AEDPA.


QUESTION:  I get the linguistic point.  That's


why I said that I wanted to know the practical point,


which I think maybe Justice Kennedy's question was trying


to get at; I'm trying to get at.


MS. McLEAN:  Practically also, there is no --


whatever litigation might occur with regard to the State


proceedings has nothing to do with the merits of the case


which is what AEDPA goes to.  So there can be no harm. 


The fact that this was tremendously litigated State


proceedings doesn't decide any issues that ultimately will


be affected by AEDPA.  So there's no harm whatsoever.


QUESTION: 


Well, you -- you described the -- the 

State proceeding as, quote, tremendously litigated, close. 


What did that -- what did that involve?


MS. McLEAN:  And in our -- I'm not saying that


that happened in our case.  I think that usually they


don't have -- there's virtually no litigation involved.


In this case, what happened was that they're


required under our local rules to present the


Specification of Non-frivolous Issues.  They have to at


least put in one or two of the claims that are ultimately


going to be raised.  They didn't file anything.  What they

filed was a conclusory statement that there were


constitutional claims that would be made.  And we objected


to that rightfully because they didn't satisfy our local


rules.  And so, it was that -- that was the sum total of


our litigation related to the State proceedings.  It


certainly doesn't create -- nothing occurred in this case


that would affect in any way --


QUESTION:  Wasn't there also a request for


funds?


MS. McLEAN:  There was -- there was a request


for funds under -- there was a request for funds under


848.


QUESTION:  And that was before the -- before the


habeas corpus petition was filed, yes.


MS. McLEAN:  That's correct.  Under 848 because


of -- it's part of that -- or that post-conviction


proceeding that was construed in McFarland.


QUESTION:  I thought what had happened here was


that the petitioner asks for a lawyer and a stay, and then


the district court granted the stay.  Then the State came


in and said, we want you to vacate the stay.  And then,


the district court asked the petitioner to file the non-


frivolous issues, et cetera, and so there was a


considerable argument about whether the stay should be


vacated or not vacated, which I guess eventually the

petitioner won.


MS. McLEAN:  I think --


QUESTION:  It sounded to me like a fairly


substantial proceeding.


MS. McLEAN:  I think that overstates the


situation.


QUESTION:  What is it now?


MS. McLEAN:  We filed papers that objected to


the fact that the stay had been granted based on a


failure -- failure to comply with the local rules.  And we


filed papers that stated that and the court ruled against


us because they corrected the deficiency, and that's all


that happened.


QUESTION:  But you say that whether or not this


case is governed by AEDPA, AEDPA has no effect whatever on 

all of that.


MS. McLEAN:  AEDPA does --


QUESTION:  By its terms, it simply does not


affect it.


MS. McLEAN:  That's correct.  And that is really


demonstrated -- also another a twist on that is that an


848 appointment, by its very terms -- if you look at


848(q)(9), I believe is the provision, it talks about how


a -- how the appointment of counsel survives the habeas


proceeding.  It goes on.  The appointment continues on


45

into clemency proceedings and competency proceedings and


other things.  So clearly this is sort of an independent


track.  There's an appointment of counsel.  It includes


that habeas corpus proceeding under chapter 153, and then


it survives and may go on into other areas.


It also would survive the dismissal of a


petition.  We've had experiences in the Ninth Circuit


where the petition that ultimately ends up being filed is


deficient.  It gets dismissed out.  They go back into


State court and they've allowed them to continue with that


appointment of counsel.  And so it continues on.  It


clearly is a separate phenomenon.


QUESTION:  But doesn't it --


QUESTION:  Suppose Garceau had filed a


handwritten thing, and he called it petition for habeas 

corpus, and it had the same thing as the statement of


issues?


MS. McLEAN:  I think he would have -- if --


assuming that it had been -- asked for relief and stated


at least one claim with a summary of facts, fact pleading


that's required --


QUESTION:  Would there have been a problem then


for counsel, once counsel is appointed?  And my scenario


is Garceau files his own petition, it's handwritten, and


it's got one -- one issue.  Then the lawyer is appointed,

and a Dandy petition is filed with 28 issues.  Would


that -- would be any problem about that being considered a


successive petition?


MS. McLEAN:  No.  In my experience with the


Ninth Circuit, they're very liberal in that situation.  It


occurs frequently.  Especially in non-capital cases where


a -- a petitioner is initially unrepresented and files a


limited petition, the court's very liberal about granting


the ability to amend the petitions later.  They're not


considered successive.


QUESTION:  Is it ultimately beside the point


that AEDPA itself doesn't say anything about this -- the


so-called pre-petition, the stay stage?  Because if your


stay is dependent upon the Specification of Non-frivolous


Issues, and frivolousness has some reference to the 

standards that you're going to have to meet for success


and AEDPA affects those standards, doesn't, as a matter


of -- of implication, doesn't AEDPA affect your


frivolousness standard and hence have at least a potential


effect at the stay point?


MS. McLEAN:  Your Honor, I don't believe that


that's the case.  The -- the non-frivolous issue


standard -- very low.  They're just trying to make sure


that there's some colorable claim, that -- that the stay


is not being just granted on something that has -- that is

just air.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. McLEAN:  They want something there so that


the court is reasonably exercising its stay discretion


and -- and appointment of counsel discretion.


That's a substantially -- that's unaffected, in


my opinion -- unaffected and substantially different than


the question that comes up once the merits petition is on


file, and we're looking to see whether or not this is --


this is -- there's a valid constitutional violation --


QUESTION:  Oh, I -- I quite agree.  But if -- if


the State decided that it simply was going to be less


complacent at the stage at which there is a request for


stay and said, okay, we're going -- we're going to start


contesting the non-frivolous character of these -- these 

claims that are being raised, number one, wouldn't the


State be able to do that if it thought it was worthwhile


to spend its time doing that? 

And number two, if it did


that, wouldn't the ultimate standard of persuasion that


AEDPA applies have an effect on -- on the argument that


you would make as to what was or was non-frivolous at that


stage?


MS. McLEAN:  A State could do that.  The --


I don't believe, again, though, that AEDPA has any


application to that.  The question -- all we would be

looking at at that phase is whether there's enough to

The -- AEDPA goes to the issue of whether the --


you know, what the State court adjudication of the claim


was and whether it was a -- involved a reasonable


application of Supreme Court precedent and an entirely


different analysis.  I don't believe that there was,


a) any intent to affect that, or any actual effect


whatsoever from changing the deference that's ultimately


applied to a merits petition to have any effect whatsoever


on that initial inquiry that a -- that our courts in


California require in order to satisfy the stay


requirement, or the --


QUESTION:  In any event, you're saying it isn't
