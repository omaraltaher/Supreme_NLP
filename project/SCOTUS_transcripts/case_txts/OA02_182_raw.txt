CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 02-182, Georgia versus John Ashcroft.


Mr. Walbert.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID F. WALBERT


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. WALBERT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


For some 6 decades now, the policy of the United


States has been to embrace integration, reject segregation


and separation of people.  We stand -- really, the Nation


of the United States of America stands pretty much as the


beacon in the world to the notion that balkanization is


not the way to go. 


Particularly in public affairs and in 

public life, integration, working together, not separating


people on the basis of race is our goal.


This Court started that trend, that great trend,


in the early -- in the 1940s with the original decisions


of Smith versus Allright, putting aside segregation, the


past history of that in this country, the ICC, Interstate


Commerce Commission desegregation decisions, Brown versus


Board of Education, voting rights cases, jury cases, and


so on.  And the policy of the United States, as this


Court was the leader on that at all times, has always

been -- has been for integration, for treating people the


same independent of their color.


Congress followed behind this Court, started


adopting some of the early Civil Rights Act in the early


1950s, the more moderate ones, if you will, under -- under


President Eisenhower's administration, and of course, the


great Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted.  1965, Voting


Rights was enacted; and the 1968 Open Housing Act.


Throughout that entire time, the policy of


integration has been the policy that this Nation has


embraced and espoused and advocated.  And I would submit


to Your Honors respectfully that the State of Georgia --


the position the State of Georgia puts before this Court


in this case today stands four square in the center of


that tradition.


Georgia comes here to this Court today


advocating that politics should be open and integrated. 


Politics should not have allocations unnecessarily, in


particular, of seats based on race.  I would submit to


this Court that what we say is totally consistent with


everything this Court has said that touches upon this


matter and in this particular regard.


QUESTION:  Could we bring it down to what we


have to decide here, which is whether there was


retrogression or not?

 MR. WALBERT:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, and I was


going -- excuse me.


QUESTION:  And on that, do we look at the whole


State and what would happen overall, or do we just focus


on individual legislative senatorial districts?


MR. WALBERT:  Well, I think you look at both,


and when you look at the whole plan of redistricting, then


you go down to look at the district.  You can't do one


without the other.  One looks at, first of all, the whole


plan and sees if opportunities are the same in terms of


majority and minority seats, for example, or opportunities


where minorities have a real opportunity get election, and


sees whether that, under the whole plan, is the same and


whether that's been maintained.


And to do that, though, one has to look --

QUESTION:  Well, what -- what ended up deciding


this case apparently was the fact that in three of the


districts that were drawn for the Senate, the number of


black voters decreased under the new plan from what it had


been, and they had been very safe districts --


MR. WALBERT:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- assured of electing black


officials before, and it was reduced to around 50 percent. 


Is that right?


MR. WALBERT:  That's correct.  The -- the

likelihood of winning -- the -- the black voter age


population was reduced to about 50 percent --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. WALBERT:  -- which according to the


evidence, would give about a 75 percent chance of a


minority candidate of choice winning in that particular


district.


below?


QUESTION:  And was that the finding of the court


MR. WALBERT:  The finding was that safe seats --


the rule of law was that safe seats must be maintained. 


To get a safe seat here, one had to raise these 4 to


5 percent.


QUESTION:  Is --


QUESTION:  So that's the --


QUESTION:  Is -- is that one of the ways, at


least, that you think we ought to view this case?  As I


understand it, no one on the other side is claiming that


the percentage of safety has got to be maintained in order


to avoid retrogression.


But one difference between you and them, at


least as I am reading what you're saying, is you, I think,


are saying they maintain the same opportunity to elect. 


Minorities maintain the same opportunity to elect if they


use their best efforts and their good politicians in doing

it.  Whereas, the other side seems to be saying, there's


got to be more of a margin of safety for maintaining -- or


avoiding retrogression than merely best efforts.  There


should be some margin of safety, even if it's not as great


as it used to be under the old districts.  Is that a fair


way of looking at the disagreement?


MR. WALBERT:  I -- I think it understates it a


little bit, in all due respect, Justice Souter, because I


think the district court came squarely down.  If you look


at the majority opinions -- and both Judge Sullivan and


Judge Edwards wrote ones that were concurred in about each


other -- and Judge Oberdorfer's decision, the line is safe


seats.  One must maintain safe seats.  And I think the


only way that those can be looked at in this case is that


all of the evidence is -- when you get to that level, no 

one has ever -- on an open seat in Georgia, no one's ever


lost a 54 percent BVAP seat.


QUESTION:  Mr. Walbert, I didn't get that


impression from Judge Edwards' opinion or Judge


Sullivan's.  They both say we are dealing with a narrow


section 5.  It has a concept, retrogression, backsliding. 


And I assume that they would say if you start out, you


start with the status quo.  Everyone agrees with that.  If


you start out with, say, 30 percent and you end up with


30 percent, it's okay.  You don't have to have a safe

district because the starting point may not be safe.


MR. WALBERT:  I -- I agree entirely with that,


Your Honor.  I didn't mean to suggest that they are


requiring more than that.  The fact is that these


districts that evolved demographically from the 1990


Census, when two more districts under the old districting


plan became majority minority, became high BVAP -- let's


take Senate District 26, for example.


QUESTION:  Well, is it -- are you saying that


when you get up over a certain number of black voters,


say, 50 percent, then retrogression or backsliding is


really out of the picture because it's good enough?


MR. WALBERT:  Well, I would say this.  Where you


have a real equal opportunity at winning the seat, that is


enough.


QUESTION:  Yes, but that's the -- that's the


conclusion, and we're -- we're looking for some kind of


indication at this point of whether that is true.  And the


only indication that at least I have and I think that


Justice Ginsburg is -- is looking at right now are -- are


the percentage figures, the BVAP percentage figures.


MR. WALBERT:  Well, I think this, Your Honor.  I


mean, the -- the court accepted Dr. Epstein's probability


curve all over -- any number of times.  I think it was on


page 36 the first time.  Dr. Epstein's evidence is -- his

study is reliable and relevant is what the court says in


that regard.  And I guess the critical thing is that was


the only evidence in this case, plus the legislators who


testified, and -- and Congressman Lewis who testified


about the likelihood of winning at a 50 percent BVAP


level.


QUESTION:  Let -- let me ask you this because


some of what you say might be explained as just a


difference of -- of -- a conclusion of facts, which we


have to accept.  Were there legal premises that the


majority opinions adopted below that were wrong?  Was it


wrong to talk about robust campaigning?  Was it wrong to


consider polarized voting?  Were there -- did the


controlling opinions make reference to any impermissible


legal standards?


MR. WALBERT:  Well, I think the bottom line


standard of safe seat is the problem that we have.  I'm


not sure that -- they didn't speak of robust campaigning,


with all due respect, Justice Kennedy.  It was robust


districts, meaning -- they equated that with safe.  And


the -- the point -- that is the legal issue.  That is the


fundamental legal flaw in the opinion of the majority


below that we take issue with, the fact that one must


maintain safe seats and --


QUESTION:  What's -- what's the legal issue?

 MR. WALBERT:  That --


QUESTION:  That is, I -- I thought there's a


statute, and the statute here says that you cannot have a


new plan which will have the effect of abridging the right


to vote on account of race.


MR. WALBERT:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  And Judge Edwards says that that


statute has been interpreted to mean you cannot backslide,


and he adds that if you go from a safe seat to a seat


where there's only a fair opportunity, that is clearly


backsliding unless it's made up for in other districts. 


Let's call it frontsliding.  And here there is no evidence


of frontsliding, and here there are two experts who


disagree as to the backsliding.  One is Epstein who thinks


there isn't, and the other is Engstrom --


MR. WALBERT:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- who thinks there is.  And two


judges below agreed with Engstrom and one judge below


agreed with Epstein.


MR. WALBERT:  I --


QUESTION:  Now, are we supposed to do -- to go


back and redo the work of those three judges and say,


well, we happen to think Epstein was better or the other


one thinks Engstrom was better?  Is that this -- what this


case is about?  And if it isn't about this, I don't know

what it's about.


MR. WALBERT:  Well, first, that's not what


happened in the record.  Professor Engstrom gave no


testimony.  There was no testimony but from our side of


the case about the likelihood of winning.  Professor


Engstrom came in and said there is racially polarized


voting, and he criticized that and the Department


criticized it, and it was relied upon.  But the African


American candidates were winning in election after


election after election in which he said there is a


problematic racially polarized voting.


QUESTION:  I -- I'm overstating what I say for


purposes of clarity, because you're giving a view of


Engstrom, and I'm sure the other side will give a somewhat


different view, but nonetheless, I want to know what it is 

I'm supposed to do as a judge in this Court.


After reading it, I thought what you're asking


me to do is to go back, look at what Judge Edwards and the


other majority judge cite as convincing, factual, detailed


statistical evidence, look at the evidence of the


political figures who are very distinguished whom Judge


Oberdorfer cites the other way, and remake that evaluation


that three judges of -- of a three-judge district court


did.  Now, my question is, is that right?  Have it got it


right what you think we should do in this case?

 MR. WALBERT:  No, you do not.


QUESTION:  All right.  Good.  Then what is it


I'm supposed to do?


MR. WALBERT:  The rule of law that was


established here by the majority of having to maintain --


having to maintain a safe seat.  There's no question


they're not saying you have to create one if there wasn't


one, but the question is, do you have to maintain a seat


that's safe?


QUESTION:  All right.  Why -- if that's the


issue, assuming that the safe seat, going down to only a


probable seat, is nowhere made up for by countervailing


factors elsewhere in the State, assuming that, why isn't


going from a safe seat to a fair probability seat -- why


is that not backsliding, retrogression, other things being 

equal, an abridgement, a -- the effect of abridging the


right to vote because of race?


MR. WALBERT:  Well --


QUESTION:  Why isn't it?  It if that's the


issue, why isn't it?


MR. WALBERT:  There's two reasons.  And -- and


first of all, no one disagrees that lowering


the percentage and the likelihood down -- the -- we're


not -- no one in this case, including the district court,


says you can't lower the probabilities.  So what Your

Honor is saying is a position more extreme than what the


majority says below.


QUESTION:  I'm reading -- I'll say it again


because I'm reading from Judge Edwards.  Going from a safe


district --


MR. WALBERT:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  -- into one where there is only a


fair opportunity, that -- that, he says, other things


being equal in the State, will constitute retrogression in


effect, not necessarily in purpose, but in effect.  And


now, why isn't that so?


MR. WALBERT:  And -- and my point is that he is


conceding that dropping down from a certain seat to a safe


seat is okay.  Now, how does that -- how can that possibly


square to the notion of retrogression? 


Everybody agrees 

in this courtroom, including the majority below, that


there can be decreases in the likelihood of success.  The


only question in this Court -- in this case is where do


you draw the line?  Safe or equal seats?


Safe is just out of the air.  Never before in


the history of this Court has anyone ever said safe is


the -- is the Plimsoll line or the water line beyond which


you cannot drop.


QUESTION:  You're drawing a distinction between


safe and certain.  Now, did --

 MR. WALBERT:  Well, safe is --


QUESTION:  Did Judge Edwards --


MR. WALBERT:  And that's what the -- and the


court is acknowledging that there is a drop for sure.  The


court said --


QUESTION:  A drop that makes no difference. 


That's -- that's how I understood their opinion.


MR. WALBERT:  I don't think that could be,


because --


QUESTION:  A safe seat is a safe seat.  It means


a certain seat.


MR. WALBERT:  No, it doesn't in this case, Your


Honor, because when you get to the levels they're talking


about, there is still a possibility for sure, whether it's


20 percent or whatever, but that's a real possibility. 

QUESTION:  But I didn't think we're dealing with


safe versus certain in this case.  I thought what we're


dealing in this case is two judges decided that dropping


from safe to whatever you want to characterize this


level -- Edwards characterizes it as fair probability, but


characterize it as you wish -- dropping from safe to this


level, however you want to characterize this, is a


retrogression.  And one judge thought it wasn't given the


circumstances.


So what is it that you, aside from re-evaluating

the evidence, believe that we should say?


MR. WALBERT:  They used different legal


standards, with all due respect, Justice Breyer.


QUESTION:  And what is that difference?


MR. WALBERT:  Safe versus equal.  That is the


difference in the legal standards between the majority


and -- and the decision below.


QUESTION:  Or why is Edwards' standard in your


opinion wrong?


MR. WALBERT:  Because I think it's inconsistent


with what this Court has said on section 5 before.  And if


I might read several of the -- just a sentence.  And I'm


going to start with Justice Marshall, who was the most


aggressive interpreter and advocate of what section 5


would mean. 


And in his dissent, in the case of United 

States versus Mississippi in 1980, he three times


addressed what section 5 requires in a retrogression


context.


And he said in the first thing, it requires a


reasonable opportunity to elect a candidate of their


choice.  That is what a district had to be maintained like


under Justice Marshall's interpretation of section 5. 


That's on page 1055 of that decision.


Again, on the next -- on page 1057, Justice


Marshall says, the numbers must be sufficient to provide,

quote, a fair opportunity to elect candidates, unquote.


QUESTION:  That sounds very much like section 2


language.


MR. WALBERT:  And -- and that's in section 5


under Justice Marshall is all I'm saying, Your Honor,


because this issue that is in this case today has never


been squarely put before this Court.  But all the prior


language of the Court interpreting, where does section 5


kick in when there is still fair, equal districts.


QUESTION:  I thought that the Bossier, the two


cases, clarified the difference between section 2 and


section 5, and what you just read from Justice Marshall


sounds to me like the section 2 standard.


MR. WALBERT:  Well --


QUESTION: 


Section 5 standard is you start with 

what you have, you look to see if there's backsliding.


MR. WALBERT:  I think the problem, though,


Judge -- and -- and certainly you start with backsliding


and retrogression, but the question is, where does inquiry


stop?  Truly, you could say at a 100 percent district goes


down to 80 percent, the chances clearly change on


electoral success, without a doubt.  That is inevitable. 


Goes from 100 to 60, 100 to 55.  That is a real and


palpable change.  That is okay, according to the district


court, because at least we stopped at safe.

 That's our problem.  We don't think safe is


where you arbitrarily draw the line to stop.  No decision


of this Court ever has suggested that before.  So is --


QUESTION:  Well, you start with, say, 55.  Where


does backsliding start in your view of section 5?


MR. WALBERT:  In our view of section 5, so long


as -- if you have a district that is -- that it has at


least an equal opportunity, it must be maintained in that


fashion.  If you have a -- a district where minorities


have an equal opportunity or better, to prevail and to


control.


QUESTION:  Well, then how do you fit


backsliding, retrogression --


MR. WALBERT:  If you go -- excuse me.


QUESTION: 


If -- if you go, say, from 55 to 

what?  44?  That's okay because you -- you would have a


fair opportunity?


MR. WALBERT:  If the evidence in a particular


case would show that, that -- you know, we never went


below 50 on anything, so that's not here in this case.


QUESTION:  Although it would seem an unusual


definition of backslide.


MR. WALBERT:  Well, I think the problem is this,


though, Your Honor.  Where -- what would be the policy


reason where a section of the Voting Rights Act,

section 5, could be construed to mandate a State to


maintain something more than what Federal law could


possibly compel it to under section 2?


QUESTION:  It doesn't contain --


QUESTION:  So -- so what you're saying is --


QUESTION:  It doesn't contain the word


backsliding, does it?  What -- what's --


MR. WALBERT:  Section 5 does not, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  What's the text that -- that we're


interpreting and -- and --


MR. WALBERT:  It's abridge --


QUESTION:  -- interpreting to mean backsliding?


MR. WALBERT:  It's abridge or deny the right to


vote --


QUESTION: 


Abridge or deny the right to vote. 

MR. WALBERT:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  And -- and that has been interpreted


by some of our opinions to mean that once a certain level


is reached, you're abridging or denying the right to vote


if it goes below that level of -- of safety.  Is that it?


MR. WALBERT:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And you --


QUESTION:  And the reason for that is because, I


gather, historically there were quite a few instances


where, indeed, in the South, you could elect -- a black

representative was elected by a black community in, let's


say, one district.  And then, lo and behold, what happens


is that the district boundaries are changed so that there


happened to be a lot fewer black representatives elected


out of districts that were predominantly black.  I take it


that's why Congress passed this statute.


MR. WALBERT:  Section 5?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. WALBERT:  No.  Congress passed the


statute -- section 5 in 1965 because they were concerned


about voter registration laws changing after --


QUESTION:  And backsliding so that you had fewer


people who were --


MR. WALBERT:  It was -- it was passed to


dovetail with the literacy test. 


That's why it was 

passed.


QUESTION:  So it doesn't really have to do with


retrogression in your view?


MR. WALBERT:  Sure, it does, as been interpreted


by this Court since then, but the original reason why it


was passed was to fit in with the literacy test.


QUESTION:  So what it -- what it comes down to


is not a -- is -- is that the State is entitled to take a


safe district and make it a district where there's just


a -- an even chance.

 MR. WALBERT:  Equal opportunity, yes, Your


Honor.  And -- and our reasoning on that is -- is a simple


thing.  If one looks at it from the other side, and -- and


we're not saying section 2 is incorporated in section 5.


QUESTION:  And -- and this cannot be within the


definition of retrogression.


MR. WALBERT:  That's correct, Your Honor.  That


cannot be the abridgement of the right to vote.


QUESTION:  May I ask a sort of a general


question?  In any of the analysis, do the -- the judges


take into account the likelihood of winning primaries as


opposed to the likelihood of winning the election itself?


MR. WALBERT:  It's -- it's implicit in what we


did because we looked at the whole election scheme. 


Everything that Dr. Epstein did was the whole election. 

Dr. Engstrom made no distinction between nonpartisan


elections, generals, and primaries.  He lumped them all


together and treated them in one ball of wax.  We


certainly did, and our evidence always looked at


winning/winning, winning the seat.  If you won the primary


and lost the seat, you're a loser because we're talking


about winning the election.  That's all we looked at.  If


you didn't win it, we didn't count it.


But the thing that is the most troubling, I


guess, in this regard that is -- and the reason I looked

to section 2 is not that section 2 is incorporated in


here, but if you assume that section 2 was proved -- that


a plaintiff came in and proved a section 2 violation in


Georgia, what would be the high water mark relief that


they would get?  They would get under Justice Souter's


opinion for the Court in Johnson versus DeGrandy a


district with an equal opportunity to prevail.  That --


QUESTION:  But we really haven't equated


section 2 challenges with section 5 challenges.


MR. WALBERT:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  I know that's what you're arguing,


but we have not done that.  And we have said that


section 5 prevents retrogression.  So I think this case


boils down to what amounts to retrogression.


MR. WALBERT: 


And I think, Your Honor, with all 

due respect here, I believe that the problem with


interpreting it to be an absolutist at the safe seat


level, you've got to -- in our opinion -- and we raised


the issue, of course -- is a grave constitutional


question.  What is the legitimate ends?  What is the


legitimate ends into -- I think the Court's discussion in


City of Boerne versus Florida is the most detailed


discussion recently about section 5 enforcement power


under the 14th and section 2 under the 15th -- and


everybody on the Court agreed with the formulation there.

 The ends of Congress must be legitimate and the


ends must be related proportionately and with congruence,


the -- the remedies that are chosen by Congress.  And I


would have to say what is -- other than just preserving


what happens to be there -- the only reason we're talking


about keeping safe seats is they happen to be there.  This


is not because they're ever put in because of a remedy.


QUESTION:  Is it illegitimate for the State to


decide to keep the safe seat if it wants?


MR. WALBERT:  That's a different question


surely, but no, I would say it's not, Your Honor.  I think


as long as it's not --


QUESTION:  It is not --


MR. WALBERT:  Excuse me.


QUESTION:  -- illegitimate.


MR. WALBERT:  Correct.


QUESTION:  It -- it is proper.


MR. WALBERT:  I think that is within the State's


prerogative so long as --


QUESTION:  Well, then is it proper for the


Justice Department to consider that in its discretion in


deciding whether or not to preclear?


MR. WALBERT:  You know --


QUESTION:  It's not using an illegitimate


factor.

 MR. WALBERT:  I'm going to add on the last part


of that.  So long as it's not the predominant reason for


the way the lines are drawn is how I was going to try and


answer the -- the rest of the last question.  So the State


can do it.


And -- and it is illegitimate in this sense,


Your Honor, because you're getting back to the question


about why didn't the State do it, which is almost like


Bossier II.  What's the purpose and so on behind it?  So


long as we maintain a system that satisfies the -- what I


would call the high water liability remedy level of


section 2, that has got to be enough.


QUESTION:  All right.  What is your answer to


this -- this counter-argument?  I don't know whether the


other side is going to make it, but let -- let me -- let 

me try it here.


The reason that section 5 is in there is that


efforts simply to achieve your Plimsoll line, the -- the


equal opportunity, historically failed over and over and


over and over again because every time a decree came down


saying equal opportunity is required, there would be


another voting change that, in fact, would inject a -- a


new fact pattern.  And the new fact pattern, just about


every time, resulted in something less than equality.


Section 5 is there, in effect, to say you

can't -- you can't make a move without advance approval,


and the only way, in effect -- this Court has said in


Beer, the only way to -- or the -- the best way at least,


to keep from moving that line in a way which is going to


result in less than an equal opportunity is to insist that


at least the status quo, as best you can determine it, is,


in fact, not going to be modified by the change.  And if


the status quo is some measure of safety, then the theory


of section 5 is preserve the measure of safety because if


you don't do that, we know what's going to happen, and


what's going to happen is you're not going to get to the


line of equality.


That's the argument.  It's essentially an


historical argument.  And what do you say to that?


MR. WALBERT:  Several things. 


First of all, the 

history Your Honor cites, which is correct in some


regards, has nothing to do with redistricting history as a


matter of fact in Georgia at least.  We have eight --


QUESTION:  That's what we -- that's what you get


for general laws.  We -- we've got a general law, and


that's the theory behind it.


MR. WALBERT:  Well, I think insofar as you're


trying to apply that in interpreting section 5 in this


context, with all due respect, Justice Souter, I don't


think that that is a realistic way of interpreting it here

because of that history.


If the mere fact that there was segregation and


so on before 1965, a horrible history before 1965, that


that was enough to justify in the year 2003 where African


Americans are demonstrably having success that no one


would have dreamed of in 1965 in the State of Georgia --


in a 26 percent black State, one-quarter of the statewide


elected officials are African American today in the State


of Georgia.  And to say that it is necessary is so


divorced from the factual reality that it wouldn't be a


fair factual predicate to apply that constitutionally to


the State of Georgia at this time in history.


QUESTION:  Why wouldn't it be -- why wouldn't it


be fair for us to say, number one, we're going to maintain


the Beer theory? 


And we're going to accept the position 

taken by Judge Edwards that if there was a margin of


safety before, there's got to be some margin of safety now


in order to comply with Beer and ultimately with


section 5, and we're going to leave the law alone to that


extent because the statute is up for renewal in a few


years, and that will be an appropriate time for Congress


to decide whether it wants to modify the standard or,


indeed, to continue to have any section 5 standard at all. 


That's a timing argument.  What's your response to that?


MR. WALBERT:  I would say that's punting the

Court's constitutional and statutory interpretation duty


to a coincidence of time like that, with all due respect,


Your Honor.  We have this case today.


QUESTION:  Well, we've --


MR. WALBERT:  And what Georgia can do today is


the questions before this Court.  And the fact that


Congress may or may not -- any law that ever comes before


this Court may be repealed the next week.


QUESTION:  Maybe -- maybe it would be --

MR. WALBERT:  It's a de facto extension as a


practical matter.  There is no real likelihood that


section 5 will not be extended as a practical matter.


That's been true in '70, '75, '82.  Whether it will be for


25 years, 20 or 50 or become permanent this time, I don't


know.


QUESTION:  Maybe if we make it bad enough,


they'll think about repealing it.

 QUESTION:  Maybe worse is better from your


standpoint.


MR. WALBERT:  I don't know about that, Judge. 


We don't have a problem with section 5.  It's the way it


would be applied if the district court were affirmed in


this case.


And the difficulty is that just the whole notion


of making section 5 compel more than the substance of


section 2 in a redistricting context, there's a grave


illogic about that given the narrow purpose of section 5


which is always the freeze and the backslide, the


emergencies.  Don't -- don't let anything bad happen.


If what Your Honor just said, Justice Souter, if


it happened that there was a mistake and, oh, my gosh, it


really -- the world changed in Georgia and 55 percent or 

50 percent wasn't equal and it turned -- and 40 percent


wasn't and it had to go back up to 60 -- let's take an


unimaginably bad situation -- section 2 is still there. 


Section 5 could be applied.


Section 5 is a stopgap, extraordinarily harsh


statute that is unique.  It is unique in our Federal


system.


And the answer, I truly believe, to Your Honor's


question is section 2 is always there if any of those kind


of parade of horribles, if you will -- if the expectation

of equality disappeared.  But we're dealing with the facts


of today, and the facts of today at the time of this trial


showed equality was absolutely established at the level


that we were talking about.  And that is the problem with


this case that is before this Court today.


If I may reserve the remainder of my time for


rebuttal, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Walbert.


Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART


ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT


MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In a section 5 preclearance action, the


appropriate comparison is between a covered jurisdiction's 

proposed voting change and the jurisdiction's existing


practice.


In the present case, the district court found


that Georgia's proposed Senate districting plan was likely


to cause a significant diminution of black voters' ability


to elect their candidates of choice.


QUESTION:  In -- in preclearing, does the


Government look at the effect as a whole?  What if, under


the plan, it's true that the districts reduced the black


voter population somewhat from the prior districting, but

in so doing, they picked up enough black voters in another


district that gave them an additional elected official of


the minority race --


MR. STEWART:  The Justice Department --


QUESTION:  -- and -- and as a whole might be


better off?


MR. STEWART:  The Justice Department's view is


that the analysis should focus on the plan as a whole, and


our guidance is --


QUESTION:  You do look at it as a whole.


MR. STEWART:  We do look at the plan as a whole.


QUESTION:  And you didn't think that this plan


resulted in a gain as a whole?


MR. STEWART:  No, because our -- our feeling was


that there were three Senate districts that we focused on 

specifically because we felt, for a variety of reasons,


that the diminution in black population was likely to have


a significant impact on black voters' ability to elect


candidates of choice in those three districts.  And we --


we also looked to where those black voters were going. 


Were they being redistributed to other districts in which


they would increase the ability to elect candidates of


choice?


The -- the focus of the inquiry has always been


on the ability to elect candidates of choice.  So, for

instance, if --


QUESTION:  Well, with certainty or -- or


ability?  I'm -- I'm really concerned about how far we are


getting from the text of the statute.  The statute says


nothing about retrogression.  Indeed, it says nothing


about redistricting.  It -- it's -- it -- it says that if


one of the States who were covered by section 5 seeks to


administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to


voting, or standard practice or procedure with respect to


voting, which I would have thought meant, you know,


whether you vote on a -- on a working day or on a


non-working day, whether the polls are open for a certain


amount of time or not.  Anyway, we've expanded that to


cover districting.


Then it goes on and it says, any change cannot 

have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying


or abridging the right to vote on account of race or


color.  And we have said that that means you're denying or


abridging the right -- the right to vote if you backslide. 


If -- if a -- even though all of the black or minority


citizens can vote just the way they did before, if


the percentage of -- of minority voters in a -- in a


certain district goes down, we have denied or abridged


their right to vote.


I -- I find that -- maybe that is a plausible

interpretation of the statute when you are going from a


good chance to elect a minority candidate to no chance of


electing a minority candidate.  Maybe you can stretch it


that far, but to say that you're abridging or denying the


right to vote when you go from a certainty or safe seat


for electing a minority candidate to a mere probability


of -- of electing a minority candidate -- to say that that


constitutes a denying or abridging of the right to vote


seems to me to -- you know, in violation of the -- of the


legal principle that fun's fun but you can't die laughing.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  I mean, that is such a -- such a


stretch of the statutory language that the -- that the


Government is asking us to accept that I -- I find it


implausible.


MR. STEWART:  Several points.  The -- the Court-


in the second Bossier Parish case discussed the


retrogression standard and grounded it in the word abridge


and explained that the -- the word abridge necessarily


implies a comparison to some baseline.  And in the


section 2 context, the baseline is a hypothetical


reasonable world.  But because section 5 is targeted


specifically at voting changes, the appropriate baseline


is the jurisdiction's existing practice.


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you wouldn't say that a

reduction from 90 percent minority to 85 percent minority


abridges, would you?


MR. STEWART:  No, because I think the likelihood


of --


QUESTION:  So that proposition that mere


reduction is enough is -- is simply not valid.


MR. STEWART:  I mean, I think -- I think the --


QUESTION:  So why isn't it reasonable to say


that the reduction that counts is the reduction below the


point where the minority has a probability of winning the


election?  Why does it have to be below the point where


the minority has a certainty of -- of winning the


election?


MR. STEWART:  Well, I -- I think one -- one


thing the Court should focus on is that when we're talking 

about the Senate districts at issue here, we are talking


about districts that are among the strongest for blacks in


the State of Georgia; that is, under the benchmark plan,


13 out of 56 districts with -- Senate districts within the


State had majority black voting age populations.  That's


in a State that's approximately 27 percent black in terms


of voting age population.  So to say that the districts in


which blacks are strongest have been reduced to a point


where blacks have an equal opportunity to elect candidates


is not equivalent to saying that in the State as a whole

blacks have equal electoral opportunities.


QUESTION:  Well, how about if it's reduced to a

MR. STEWART:  I mean, I think if we're going


from the 90 percent certainty to the 51 percent


likelihood --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. STEWART:  -- we would still say that's


retrogression.  We -- we do have a sort of substantiality


inquiry in Department of Justice preclearance practice


where --


QUESTION:  Well, there was another district,


Senate District 15, where the percentage dropped from


62 percent to 50.8 percent, and the Government didn't


challenge that.


MR. STEWART:  I -- I think part of the reason --


QUESTION:  Why?


MR. STEWART:  Part of the reason that the


Government challenged these three districts had to do with


the magnitude of the increase, but part of it also had to


do with electoral history and evidence of racially


polarized voting.  And I -- I don't --


QUESTION:  Does the --


QUESTION:  What about section 15?


MR. STEWART:  I -- I don't know the reason that

as to Senate District 2, for instance, that even though


the BVAP under the benchmark plan was over 60 percent, in


a 1999 runoff election, the black candidate of choice had


won the -- the primary by only 70 votes, and the reason


was that the black candidate received approximately


78 percent of the black vote but only 9 percent of the


white vote, and then --


QUESTION:  Does the State have any latitude


insofar as your interpretation of the statute is concerned


and insofar as your Department policy is concerned to


experiment to see if it can't expand the black franchise


in other districts?  Nothing in life is certain, and your


position is -- is that the State is simply frozen in these


supermajority districts and it can't attempt to increase 

minority representation in other districts.


MR. STEWART:  No.


QUESTION:  Doesn't it have -- doesn't the State


have some latitude to try that?


MR. STEWART:  We certainly think that they do,


and -- and nothing that we've said in this case and


nothing that the district court said is to the contrary. 


That is, if the State had sought to prove that the


likelihood of electing black voters' candidates of choice


in these three districts would be somewhat reduced, but

that that was likely to be offset by corresponding


increases in the ability to elect -- to elect candidates


of choice in other districts --


QUESTION:  Well, was that -- where did I get the


notion that there was very likely going to be, under their


plan, another minority official elected --


MR. STEWART:  I --


QUESTION:  -- in an additional district?


MR. STEWART:  I don't -- there was -- there was


a pair of Senate Districts, not 2, 12, and 26, one of


which was reduced sharply in black population --


QUESTION:  I have the same -- I have the same


problem with Justice O'Connor.  I -- I thought the case


was before us on -- on the assumption that there is a


likelihood that there will be another black representative 

from another district --


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- and that that was the testimony of


the State and the State said that this is the reason why


we're doing this.


MR. STEWART:  No.  That -- that's not the case


at all.  I think the -- the nature of the State's plan was


to reduce the high majorities of black voters in some


districts, and those voters would be redistributed to


other districts, but not districts in which there would be

a high enough black population to create a plausible


likelihood of electing black candidates of choice.


QUESTION:  Why -- why is that the only change


that's relevant?  Why is it insignificant that you -- you


change a district that was previously lily-white into a


district that has, let's say, 30 percent black voters


whose wishes and whose desires have to be taken into


account by whoever is elected from that district, whether


he's white or black?  Why is that an insignificant benefit


to -- to the black voters in that district so they won't


get some -- some redneck discriminatory representative,


but rather somebody who will take into account their


needs, even if he's not a black man?


MR. STEWART:  As -- as an original matter, I


think an argument could be made that black voters 

throughout the State of Georgia would be better off if


every district were 27 percent black on the theory that


even though they couldn't elect any candidates of choice,


they could influence all legislators.  But although an


argument could be made along those lines, the Court has


consistently, in its vote dilution cases, framed the


inquiry in terms of the ability to elect -- to elect


candidates of choice.


QUESTION:  We've never had a case before that --


that amounts to a reduction not below the level where they

can elect, but -- but just to the level where it's merely


probable as opposed to certain that -- that they can


elect.  I -- I don't know that we're foreclosed from


taking that reality into account.


MR. STEWART:  I -- I agree that the -- the


precise question hasn't come before this Court.


The two things I'd say are that, first, we are


talking about the strongest districts for blacks.  So to


say that those districts have been reduced to an even


shot, a toss-up, is not to say that blacks have equal


electoral power statewide.


The second point I'd make is this is not


different in principle from what goes on all the time in


other preclearance settings.  That is, it is often the


case that a covered jurisdiction will seek preclearance of 

a voting change, and the change will consist of getting


rid of something that the jurisdiction had no obligation


to create in the first instance.  But the inquiry has


always focused on retrogression, on whether the State has


made black voters worse off than they were --


QUESTION:  Now, worse off, I thought -- and I'm


still at my same problem of what am I supposed to do in


this case.  But I thought worse off means their right to


vote is abridged because of race.  Abridged is the word. 


And that it isn't so much a question, though it's partly a

question, of percentage of black voters in the district. 


It is really a question of what a reduction in


that percentage means in terms of a -- a race, black


people, being able, across the State, to have a better or


worse chance of electing public officials that they want. 


And that's a function of polarization because if there


isn't a lot of polarization, there is no such person as


the official they want.  But there might be where there is


polarization.  And it's also a function of how much of a


reduction you get in a particular district in terms of


what that means.


Now, if I'm thinking that way, A, is that the


right way to think about it?  B, if it is, do I have any


alternative in this case but to go through the statistical


testimony about polarization? 


The testimony, if there is 

any, which I'm not sure that there is or not -- I thought


the majority held there wasn't -- that somehow other


districts will be benefitted, and then sort of second


guess the district court.  What is it I'm supposed to do? 


Do I have it right?  And if I have it right, is that what


I'm supposed to do?


MR. STEWART:  I -- I think you're looking at it


correctly.  And when the Justice Department approached


this case, there were other Senate districts in which the


absolute drop in black voting age population was much

greater than in these three districts.  The reason we


found these districts problematic was partly the -- the


magnitude of the reduction, partly the fact that it had


occurred along a point in the spectrum where a 10 percent


reduction was especially likely to have a concrete impact. 


That is, it stands to reason that reducing black


population from 60 percent to 50 percent will more likely


affect concrete results than reducing it from 80 percent


to 70 percent or from 20 percent to 10 percent.


QUESTION:  It isn't just percents --


MR. STEWART:  And --


QUESTION:  -- it's a question of what a percent


means in the context of the particular district.


MR. STEWART:  That's correct.  And we -- we


introduced --


QUESTION:  And it's not just a little.  It has


to be a lot.


MR. STEWART:  We introduced --


QUESTION:  It has to mean a lot.


MR. STEWART:  We introduced substantial


district-specific evidence of racial polarization in these


three specific Senate districts.  We -- both statistical


and anecdotal evidence to the effect that there was a high


degree of correlation between the race of the voter and


the candidate of choice and evidence that racial appeals

had been made in prior elections within those districts. 


So the first step was to say, based on all that evidence,


there is a -- this change is likely to have a significant


impact on black voters' ability to elect candidates of


choice in these districts.  And the district court found


to that effect.


And the second thing that the district court


said --


QUESTION:  I think the -- the district court


found that -- I thought there was a heavy concentration on


crossover in this record.  Wasn't that the whole


controversy about Engstrom?  Didn't he say that there


would be minimal white crossover in these districts?


MR. STEWART:  That's correct.  His -- his


analysis of the statistical evidence of prior elections 

within the districts was that there would be minimal white


crossover voting.  There was substantial racial


polarization within these three districts specifically. 


And so the district court found that the likelihood of


black candidates -- of black voters' ability being able to


elect candidates of choice in these three districts --


QUESTION:  Do the findings tell us whether


there's been any change in the last few years in the


amount of white crossover voting?  It seems to me there's


some anecdotal evidence to that effect.

 MR. STEWART:  I -- I don't believe that there


were findings to that effect.  The -- the findings were


basically surveying the last --


QUESTION:  Were they based on evidence during


the last few years, or back in the '80s and '90s?


MR. STEWART:  During the last few years. 


Basically the experience under the benchmark district.


But the second thing that the district court


said and -- and emphasized -- and I believe it's on


pages 133 and 134a of the appendix to the jurisdictional


statement.  The district court said at the very bottom of


the page, once again we note that it may well be the case


that any decrease in African American electoral power in


Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26 will be offset by gains in


other districts, but plaintiff, namely the State, has 

failed to present any such evidence.


So the district court acknowledged in principle


that even though black voters' ability to elect candidates


of choice in these three districts had been substantially


decreased, the State might, nevertheless, be able to prove


non-retrogression for the plan as a whole if it presented


evidence that there would be offsetting gains in other


districts.  And the court faulted the State for a failure


of proof not for any -- not -- it didn't suggest that


there was a -- an analytical barrier to proceeding along

that basis.


So I think the district court regarded this as a


relatively easy case precisely because there were


meaningful losses in identified districts and no attempt


to prove offsetting gains in others.  And again, the


retrogression standard has always focused on whether the


change renders minority voters worse off.


And again, the -- the preclearance inquiry would


substantially -- be substantially complicated if the


analysis were otherwise.  That is the Court has held, for


instance, that relocation of polling places is one type of


change that has to be precleared before it can --


QUESTION:  Well, if they were not offsetting


gains, what was the gravamen of the testimony of the black


State officials who testified in favor of this plan? 

MR. STEWART:  The -- the gravamen of the -- the


testimony was not that there would be offsetting gains in


black voters' ability to elect candidates of choice. 


Really, the thrust of the plan was black voters would be


taken out of majority black districts and placed in


districts that were predominantly white.  The black


percentages would be too low for the black electorate to


elect candidates of choice, but it might be high enough


that the black vote could swing the balance between a


white Republican and a white Democratic candidate.  That

was really the thrust of the plan.


And because -- again, whatever might have been


said in the first instance, the Court's analysis has


focused on ability to elect candidates of choice. 


Congress has amended section 2 to facilitate vote dilution


claims along those lines.  Congress has continued to


reenact section 5 against the backdrop of the Court's


decision.  So even though the argument could have been


made that it's more important for blacks to be the balance


of power in a lot of districts than to be able to elect


candidates of choice in a few, the Court has rejected that


proposition and Congress appears to have endorsed the


Court's holdings by continuing to reenact these provisions


without change.


If the Court has nothing further.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. MARSHALL BRADEN


ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE INTERVENORS


MR. BRADEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please this Court:


I assume that the threshold question for the


intervenors in this case raised by the State is whether or


not the two intervenors of the four intervenors, two


African American Republican voters and two African

American Democrat voters, are properly in this case.  Is


intervention permitted in a section 5 case?


If precedent or experience provides any guidance


to this Court, the answer clearly is yes.  In more than


70 percent of the section 5 litigation in district court


here in the District of Columbia, more than 70 percent of


those cases have involved intervenors.  There is not a


single case -- not a single case -- cited by the State of


Georgia where the Court has rejected the concept of


intervention in section 5 litigation.


QUESTION:  Well, in -- this type of case is


governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is it


not, which provide for intervention under given


circumstances?


MR. BRADEN: 


Absolutely correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and --

you're correct that intervention was appropriate, did the


intervenors join in the appeal here?

issue?


QUESTION:  So why isn't it moot as to your

because this Court might fashion a remedy to send it back

to the district court for additional findings, in which we


would have presumably a position to argue it in that case.


QUESTION:  Well, then you should have appealed. 


I mean, that -- if that was a real possibility, you should


have appealed, but not to appeal and then ask us to decide


whether you're proper intervenors because this might


affect you, it seems to me --

MR. BRADEN:  Intervention was granted.


QUESTION:  So how could you appeal from a

to me that --


QUESTION:  Well, intervention was granted, but


you didn't join the appeal from -- from the decision below


or file a cross appeal.  Right?


MR. BRADEN:  That is correct.


But we are before this Court now and that -- in


that issue I think we are properly before this Court as


decided by the lower court.


Now, the real issue I think below -- before this


Court is the question of whether or not you can accept

Georgia's invitation to throw out 27 years of your


jurisprudence because the reality of the Georgia position


is the rejection of retrogression.  It's not this bugaboo


about safe seats.


Every redistricting plan, by its very nature,


creates safe seats.  The plan that wasn't precleared


created safe seats.  It simply created safe seats solely


for white members of the legislature.  Their proposal


would permit the State to decide that there's only one


class of Georgia's citizens entitled to safe electoral


seats, and that would be white voters in Georgia.


The reality of what happened in the Georgia


redistricting process is clear from the record in this


case.  To maintain the political majority in the State


legislature in Georgia, the individuals involved in the 

process looked at it and decided, well, these existing


black districts, these existing represented communities


have to be divided up.  Black precincts have to be pulled


out of those districts and put in adjoining white


districts so we may be able to maintain the Democrat level


of vote in those districts so white Democrats can win.


QUESTION:  Didn't -- didn't almost all of the


black legislature -- legislators in the Georgia assembly


favor this -- this plan?


MR. BRADEN:  That is, in fact, correct, Justice

QUESTION:  How -- how many opposed it?  Was it

QUESTION:  A woman.  I forget her name.


MR. BRADEN:  Actually, I believe there were two,


but one in the Senate.  Actually the senator representing


District 2 which was one of the districts that was


rejected in this case.


But I might make the observation that the view


from aboard the ship of state and on the dock is quite


different.  If you're on board the ship, if you're already


in the legislature, the gangplank doesn't look very steep


going up, but if you're there trying to get aboard the


ship of state, if you're not an incumbent -- incumbents 

have a different view and when an incumbent needs to be


elected, it's totally different than a challenger


candidate.


QUESTION:  Well, that may be, but I -- I find it


hard to believe that they didn't have the -- the -- or a


majority of them at least didn't have the best interests


of their -- of their race in -- in mind.


And -- and of course, you know that one of the


problems has been in the southern States packing


minorities into one district.  I mean, it's been the -- in

the interest of particular parties on occasion to put all


the black voters in one district so that all the other


districts can be -- can go to the other party.  And, you


know, maybe the black voters who supported this plan did


so because they thought it was a good thing to disperse


some of the black voters who weren't needed to -- to


produce a high probability of success for a black


candidate into other districts.  I mean, that's -- that's


a very plausible explanation --


MR. BRADEN:  That -- that -- Justice Scalia,


that is a very plausible explanation in a hypothetical


State.  It simply isn't a plausible explanation in the


case of Georgia.


One, no one alleged that these districts were


packed. 
 That simply -- argument was never made. 

Second, we're not talking about incumbents


looking at the notion of whether or not we will maintain,


quote/unquote, our racial position.  We're talking about


incumbents looking about --


QUESTION:  Yes, but don't the figures --


MR. BRADEN:  -- whether or not they'll be


elected.


QUESTION:  Don't the figures show that some of


the districts were way up there before, were -- were


packed and they reduced them something like 80 percent to

55 or 60?  Doesn't that fit precisely under what Justice


Scalia described?


MR. BRADEN:  Absolutely correct.  And in fact,


to be candid with you, it's our view as the intervenors --


we believe the court actually probably went too low, that


they took the numbers down, and frankly, the election


results from the last election showed that our argument


was vindicated by the failure to elect in certain district


candidates of choice.


The process -- the district court took a very


conservative view on the issue of retrogression.  They


permitted the State to decrease the number of black voting


age populations in many districts, and the reason for that


was not to unpack.  Look at the record.  I ask the Court


to look at the record. 


Look at the testimony of the 

person who drew the plan.  Look at the dissenting opinion


of the judge.  Clearly what was happening here was a


desire to divide up an existing community, to move black


precincts into other districts to help elect Democrat


candidates.


Now, politically that's understandable and


political gerrymandering -- it would appear to me, that


it's possibly constitutional to do that, but not in a


retrogression situation where we would reduce the black


community's ability to elect its candidates of choice.

And that's what's happening.  Undeniable.


And you're talking about two different classes


of candidates.  We have white safe seats but not black.


QUESTION:  The black -- the black community's


candidates of choice has overwhelmingly been Democrats and


to -- to increase the probability of getting a Democrat


elected by moving black voters into another district is


precisely to give black voters a -- a better choice, to --


to -- it may not be a black candidate, but it will be the


candidate the black voters want.


MR. BRADEN:  And I think that's a


misinterpretation of this Court's position and a


misunderstanding of what the voting rights is meant to


protect.  This is not a max Democrat plan.  Our


jurisprudence doesn't point -- we've got to create as many 

Democrat seats as possible.  We're talking about


maintaining the existing level of the choice of the


minority community which might be Democrat or might be


Republican.


But we're not -- it's hard to imagine the


Congress in 1982 renewed this act and thought it would be


interpreted of -- of not looking at how many black or


minority candidates would be chosen, but how many


Democrats would be elected to a legislature.  One can't


possibly believe that they would think that your

jurisprudence would metamorphose to something like that. 


That cannot be what we're looking at.


QUESTION:  No.  But -- but I -- it's an


implausible argument that you are -- you are contravening


the choice of black voters by increasing the probability


of a Democrat's getting elected.


MR. BRADEN:  In -- Justice Scalia, the fallacy I


believe of that argument, in all due respect, is that


there's one type of Democrat candidate, and the reality to


that is there isn't one type.


And the political science on this is abundantly


clear and the record in this case is abundantly clear that


there's racial polarization and bloc voting.  No one


denies that.  It exists in Georgia.  And this is simply a


continuation of Georgia's sad history of 100 years of not 

just blocking minority voting rights, but enacting


statutes and working very hard to do this.  And this is,


in fact, another statute that was created to -- again to


divide up existing representative districts, move out


black precincts to elect Democrats.  That's the process


here.


There is no tension whatsoever --


QUESTION:  Move out -- move out black voters to


elect Democrats in the district they are moved to or in


the district they're moved from?

 MR. BRADEN:  In the district that they're moved


to.  This is just a carefully calculated scheme to move


the numbers down to make adjoining districts to those


existing black districts more likely to elect Democrat


candidates.  And what happens is those districts the black


precincts are moved from become less likely to choose the


candidate of choice in more --


QUESTION:  Whether they're Democrats or


Republicans or whatever they are in these other districts,


I take it in your view if evidence had been put on the


stand that the black voter was better off, then you might


lose your side of the case.


MR. BRADEN:  Absolutely correct.


QUESTION:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Braden.


Mr. Walbert, you have 3 minutes left. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID F. WALBERT


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. WALBERT:  Thank you, Your Honor.


I would ask the Court to think of one question


here, and it is this question.  Is it remotely realistic


in the real world that 43 out of 45 African American


legislators who are the most sophisticated, knowledgeable


African Americans about politics and winning and political


power and electoral power would have voted for this if it


did all these bad things, if this wasn't the best way they

could see of enhancing the power?  Is that conceivable? 


It's not conceivable.  That's -- that's fanciful.  One


can't possibly say that's possible.  And --


QUESTION:  Well, it's conceivable if all they're


interested in -- is, is in race and you want us to presume


that.  They might also wanted to have kept their jobs.


MR. WALBERT:  Well, Your Honor, I don't think


that there's -- that's realistic to think that the


delegation would vote themselves out of office, which is


what we're talking about.  Are they making their districts


so weak they're voting themselves out of office?  No.


Their testimony is unequivocal that this


enhances black voting strength because -- and the


Solicitor General was wrong when he says there's no


testimony that the other districts would be enhanced. 

There is no testimony that any other districts would


become safe seats, but from a black point of view,


absolutely.  When you're shifting the black votes into


those other districts, the potential is enhancing, the


potential of getting someone the Democrats prefer who


happens to be white.


QUESTION:  And the evidence is where?  What am I


supposed to read?


MR. WALBERT:  That's in the testimony of every


one of the legislators, said that's why we get --

 QUESTION:  So what -- what do I read and what


pages do I read?


MR. WALBERT:  It would be in the -- it's in


the -- the testimony of the legislators.  It would be in


the proposed --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. WALBERT:  It's -- I'm sorry.  It's the


testimony of the legislators.  Some little bit of it is


quoted in our brief.  It's in the proposed findings of


fact in great detail, but it's the testimony of the


legislators.


QUESTION:  The district court didn't consider


that relevant testimony because it was not testimony about


safe seats elsewhere.


MR. WALBERT: 


I would think that's a fair 

characterization, Your Honor.


As a practical matter, it would be a tragedy. 


And we're well aware of the history.  We're not up here


apologizing that we are disowning the history of race in


Georgia.  We know what it is.  The Attorney General knows


what it is.  But it would be a tragedy on the facts of


this case to utilize that history to penalize what African


Americans are trying to do -- tried to do in this


reapportionment under this evidence.


Integration's working in Georgia.  We have the

most politically integrated political system probably in


the United States.


QUESTION:  That's what we're supposed to, go


into which political party is better for which particular


group of people?


MR. WALBERT:  No.  We look at the success of


what the record unequivocally and without contradiction


demonstrates in terms of African American success in the


State of Georgia, and it's a compelling record, Your


Honor.


It shows again that we have 4 congressmen out


of 13 who are African American, 52 percent district,


50 percent district, 41 percent district, and 38 percent


district.  Last one just elected 13 -- Congressional


District 13 just created -- this reapportionment got two 

new districts.  13 was open, 38 percent, African American


elected.  African American elected in the last election in


a 28 percent multi-member house district.  It's working.


QUESTION:  May I ask before -- before you


conclude your argument, what is the status of the


litigation that's pending in the State court to resolve


the dispute between the Attorney General and the Governor?


MR. WALBERT:  Yes.  There's oral argument next


week on that, Your Honor, and we expect that to be decided


very quickly.  There is, of course, your favorable


55 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

decision from our position from the superior court. 


That's on direct appeal to the supreme court, oral


argument next week and that will in all likelihood be


decided very, very promptly.  So --


And I think that -- what is the reason --


putting all these facts aside, which are compelling, if


this Court were to hold that section 5 --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Walbert.


MR. WALBERT:  Thank you, Your Honor.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
