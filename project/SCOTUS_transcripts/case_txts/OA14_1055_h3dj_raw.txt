ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

There is only one natural way to read the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

language at issue here.  A "court of competent 

    

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction" is a court that has an independent source 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of subject-matter jurisdiction.  That is what this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has held five times those words mean.  So let's start 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the plain language. 

 

 

 

            

The statute grants Freddie, quote, "The 

 

 

 

 

 

power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

'court of competent jurisdiction,' State or Federal." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that you don't get to go to any Federal court or any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State court, but rather, you have to choose a court, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State or Federal, that must be a "court of competent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction."  And the only way to find out whether a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court is a "court of competent jurisdiction" is to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

1 

examine the statutes creating that court and granting it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

jurisdiction. 

3 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does that include --

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but "is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this court competent to hear this controversy" would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction? 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I -- I am not limiting it 

    

   

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

to subject-matter jurisdiction over an original action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It has appellate -- it has cert jurisdiction.  But no, a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court of competent jurisdiction at a minimum has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

subject-matter jurisdiction, but I think it also has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

13 

personal jurisdiction. 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

And the -- the cases that my friends rely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases in which there was already subject-matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  And this Court held, hold on.  Wait a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

minute.  It's not enough just to have subject-matter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  It needs to be personal jurisdiction. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, five times this Court has interpreted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the words "competent jurisdiction" to mean, quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"outside" -- "outside sources of jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

authority."  That's from Phoenix.  Or from Shoshone; 

  

  

 

 

 

 

this Court held that any reference to competent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, "it 

   

 

 

 

 

unquestionably meant that the competency of the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

And Fannie's interpretation simply does not 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Look at the sentence.  Fannie's interpretation would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

require the Court to read the phrase "competent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction" to mean different things depending upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which word modifies it. 

 

 

 

12 

            

So Fannie concedes that the clause referring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

to any "court of competent jurisdiction" State cannot be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court.  A 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State court can't take jurisdiction unless you point to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a statutory authority for the State. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What did you do -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does Justice Souter's statement in Red Cross do to your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument?  I'm talking about the statement on page 257 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Red Cross, "In expressly authorizing suit in Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate 

   

   

 

 

 

 

capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

jurisdiction." 

24 

25 

            

That seems to say if you authorize suit in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court, then that's it.  Specifically mentioning 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

1 

Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Understood, Justice 

  

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

Ginsburg.  And I think the way to look at Red Cross is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to look at what Red Cross referred to as the rule that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Souter was describing.  The rule is, and I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote, "A congressional charter's sue-and-be-sued 

 

 

 

 

provision may be read to confer Federal jurisdiction if, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but only if, it specifically mentions the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

courts." 

10 

            

So you need a mention of Federal courts in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

order to even have a conversation about whether the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"may" is in play.  But a reference to Federal courts is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

not sufficient. 

 

14 

            

And so another way to think about it is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

sure, if a clause says, sue or be sued in any court, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State or Federal, Red Cross tells us, that, without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more, is a grant of Federal jurisdiction. 

   

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's tough.  I mean, I find 

    

   

  

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

this pretty tough.  I think that there are five major 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases:  Three are against you; two are for you.  Deveaux 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is for you.  Osborn uses the word "incompetent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction"; it's against you.  Not surprising, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Bankers' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

1 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It comes out the other way. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes out the other way.  And so what I see going for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you is one page of legislative history which says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicitly, you're right. 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you want to deny that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

legislative history?  It helps you, doesn't it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, no.  I accept the 

    

  

 

 

 

10 

legislative history. 

 

11 

            

12 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right. 

  

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  But we have a lot more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

going for us than that.  This Court's interpretation of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the phrase of "competent jurisdiction" over and over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again, three times before this provision -- those words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were added to this provision.  This Court interpreted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that phrase twice in the statutory construction setting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and said, it must point to an outside source of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  And our --

  

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's true.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

these cases that you're talking about are not directly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in point.  D'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, and it used the word "competent jurisdiction." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did say that the language, absolutely clear, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

means -- because it refers probably to specific courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and isn't just a general statement of courts in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

general -- this means that they're giving jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's just not just authority to sue and be sued. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I disagree 

   

  

 

 

respectfully with how they -- how you've characterized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

these cases. 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

            

So Osborn, if you wanted to write a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision that parses the legislative language the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fannie does, you would write the Osborn provision.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, sue and be sued in all State courts having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competent jurisdiction -- great -- and in a circuit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

court of the United States.  That's how you distinguish 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

State courts. 

 

15 

            

16 

            

17 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I got that one. 

    

 

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  D'Oench, Duhme, my God, is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

the -- that's identical to the Bankers' one.  Identical. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And they come out the other way, and all that's there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the word "State and Federal" --

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So, Your Honor, D'Oench, 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Duhme says, any court of law or equity, State or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal.  This Court did not analyze this provision in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D'Oench, Duhme, and so there's nothing -- we can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure out what this Court was saying in D'Oench because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

it was a drive-by jurisdictional reference in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

situation in which there was clear Federal jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there was an arising-under clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

5 

            

And then when you --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, is there a 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision 

   

   

 

 

 

from a provision creating a cause of action?  Let's do 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorizes suit in any Federal district court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

competent jurisdiction. 

 

11 

12 

            

How do you deal with the fact that the ADA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

courts? 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, so the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer is that provision -- excuse me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The ADA has jurisdiction, but not because of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that jurisdiction.  There is Federal-question 

  

 

 

 

jurisdiction under the ADEA.  The sue-or-be-sued clause 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is a clause that provides for the direction as to which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts you go into.  And the same is true --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, there, I'm 

  

 

 

 

presuming they mean personal jurisdiction.  So in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

personal jurisdiction. 

 

25 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

10 

disagree.  It is personal and subject-matter 

  

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  It means, show me where the Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject-matter jurisdiction.  Easy.  There is a Federal 

   

  

  

 

 

question under 1331.  Show me where there is personal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  Okay.  That's where it gets a little bit 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

harder.  Make sure that the person is within the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confines of the Court.

But -- but I would also say just mapping, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

again, this language or the way Fannie reads it onto the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, Fannie admits that this grant of -- that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause that says, "court of competent jurisdiction" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State or Federal does not mean a grant of jurisdiction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to every Federal court either. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements 

 

 

 

 

 

are otherwise satisfied. 

 

 

18 

            

And Fannie has never explained how you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

take the same language and map it out differently to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach different results depending upon which word it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modifies and even different results when it modifies the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

same word. 

 

23 

24 

25 

            

And the statutory evolution also confirms 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  It unfolded in three critical steps. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Step 1 was the original enactment.  It was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

11

2 

before D'Oench.  And Congress chose language that, per 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer's question, it was assured would not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

grant jurisdiction. 

 

4 

            

Step 2 was 1954.  So now D'Oench has been 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

decided.  And what did Congress do?  It did the opposite 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of what happened in Red Cross.  In Red Cross, remember, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was a provision that didn't match D'Oench, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

then Congress takes a left turn and says, we're going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

match D'Oench.  Here, Congress began with a provision 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that matched what was later assessed in D'Oench and took 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a right turn and added the words "competent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction," which this Court had previously, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, "depends on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other provisions of law." 

 

 

 

            

Step 3 was 1974.  After the shift to private 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

entity was consummated, Congress further amended the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer an agency.  If there was a source of jurisdiction 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for diversity jurisdiction.  So Congress changed 

  

 

 

 

 

Fannie's charter to say that it is a District of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Columbia corporation, quote, "for purposes of 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction and venue."

keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor.  "For 

  

  

 

 

 

purposes of venue" doesn't mean all suits are in D.C. It 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could -- it means that D.C. is a permissible venue, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look to the venue provisions to figure out where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit is appropriately brought. 

 

 

 

            

This was a grant of diversity jurisdiction. 

   

 

 

 

 

Every court that has ever evaluated this language has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded it's a grant of diversity jurisdiction. 

   

 

 

 

 

Fannie walks into Federal court consistently with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only basis being diversity jurisdiction.  So a dozen 

   

  

 

 

 

 

times since this case was first briefed, and just last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction.  You don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

need diversity jurisdiction if there is a sue-or-be-sued 

   

 

 

 

 

 

clause that grants Federal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's just a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

belt-and-suspenders point, it seems to me.  They can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely on diversity jurisdiction.  It's not a concession 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that they don't have general Federal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well -- understood, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

Honor, although compare it to what happened with Ginnie. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So -- so Ginnie Mae has Federal jurisdiction, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress did not at the same time in 1974 -- now, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

it's -- it's the same charter.  The sue-and-be-sued 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause is actually in the same language, not -- not --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not same language in separate provisions.  Ginnie and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fannie are treated together; one is private, one is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public.  Ginnie has Federal jurisdiction because it is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal agency.  Congress in 1974 does not add the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diversity provision to Ginnie's charter, only to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fannie's charter.  And I do think --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Go ahead.  Finish. 

  

  

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No.  No.  Please go ahead. 

  

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  This is what's really 

  

 

 

 

 

12

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

bothering me here, and I don't know if you can help or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not.  After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would think you're right, if I were doing this afresh, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and particularly when you have that page of legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history.  I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

it to the senators, and they thought, we don't want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time.  We just want them to have the right when they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise would be in Federal court. 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

But when I finished reading the cases, going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something of a rule here.  It may not make too much 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense, but it's even there in D'Oench, Duhme, and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it's -- actually, I do think it is more even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

stronger for the other side than -- than this one.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is add some old report that sort of seemed to support 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative history here. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

But I see now it's jurisdiction.  And we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

shouldn't get things too mixed up.  They are hard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough.  And then that seems to say if you say State and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal, you -- you see where I'm going? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So I don't know whether to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

look into it deeply in this particular case where you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to end up with a result that seems to be different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was all decided.  Keep to the precedent.  Forget the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

page of legislative history.  It will be better for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers.  And it will be better for the judges.  It will 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be simpler for them. 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

21 

I'm in. 

 

22 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's the dilemma that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Anything anybody wants to say to help me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

would be welcome. 

 

 

24 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Sure, Your Honor.  Let 

  

  

 

 

 

25 

me -- let me answer that quickly, because I know my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

white light is on. 

 

 

 

2 

            

And so, look, this is perfectly simple.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

need the word "Federal" in order to even have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conversation about Federal jurisdiction.  If all you've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

got is any court, State or Federal, that will be enough. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But if Congress, after reading that opinion that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find so powerful, Justice Breyer, says, "court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competent jurisdiction," there is no case out there that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- that has held that those words, those precise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, "court of competent jurisdiction," means anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other than what this Court has held it means. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

And in 1954, by the way, Congress was deeply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

concerned about one thing, which is, Fannie was going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private.  It was now going to be in the mortgage market. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I did a search.  There are 60,000 cases that Fannie is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved in, 60,000 cases of which 70 percent are in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State court.  If all of a sudden this Court says that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is Federal jurisdiction, all of those foreclosure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases are moving tomorrow to Federal court.

1 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

3 

            

The government's view is that the rule of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

Red Cross should not be extended to a statute that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorizes a federally chartered corporation to sue or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

be sued in a "court of competent jurisdiction." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

The best reading of that phrase in Fannie 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mae's charter is that it authorizes the corporation to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue and be sued in a Federal or State court that is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vested with jurisdiction through some other provision of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

law. 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

            

We think there is a plausible story for why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't find that explanation completely satisfying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the text of the statute should control. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

Federal courts. 

 

23 

24 

25 

            

In this case, the Court should give Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"suit is authorized in a State or Federal 'court of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

competent jurisdiction,'" then that means that you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to look to some other provision of law to see if that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court is vested with jurisdiction.

8 

9 

10 

11 

my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to identify, eight other statutes that use the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"incompetent jurisdiction" language. 

 

 

            

Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of other statutes that are identical to this?  And, B, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

Mae is? 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  I -- I am aware of those 

    

   

 

 

 

 

statutes.  I have on my list seven that just have the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue-and-be-sued clause, and then no other provision that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, you know, for any purpose -- any suit involving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

this entity. 

 

18 

19 

20 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We are off by one. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But tell me what you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

mean. 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  So, no, I am not troubled by 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this.  In fact, I think this is the reason, two of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- of the entities are Federal agencies, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department of Housing and Urban Development and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18

Department of Veterans Affairs. 

 

 

 

2 

            

3 

would be --

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So a Federal question 

   

  

 

 

MS. O'CONNELL:  No, the Federal agencies 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

have the power to bring a suit in Federal court.  They 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also have the power to remove a case from Federal court. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But if the Court interpret's Fannie's charter to mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that any case involving Fannie can be brought in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court or can be removed to a Federal court, then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of those cases involving HUD, where HUD is a party 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or where the VA is a party, those cases can now be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought in Federal court against the agency, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can also be removed to Federal court when the agency is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

a party. 

 

15 

            

I'll give you an example that HUD has given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

to me over time.  HUD often likes to litigate these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases in State court.  These are mortgage foreclosure

frequently -- where a lender will sue a borrower in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

State court.  HUD may also be named as a defendant if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

HUD has an interest in the mortgage.  HUD may want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave that case in the State court where the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts address questions about mortgage foreclosure all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time.  They are all State law causes of action, just

as in this case.

which is also in HUD's charter, that it can sue or be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued in any State or Federal court of competent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction means that there is Federal subject matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over that suit, then the private party can now remove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case to a Federal court, creating delay in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolution of the case which is to the advantage of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrower in a mortgage foreclosure suit. 

   

 

 

 

10 

            

HUD interprets its own sue-and-be-sued 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

clause to just be a waiver of sovereign immunity and not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to authorize Federal subject matter jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over any case involving HUD.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So those are five

two --

 

18 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.  They are Federal 

  

  

 

 

 

19 

corporations, federally chartered corporations. 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Have all of them read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

the statute in the same way you have? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  I know that the Seventh 

    

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

Circuit has interpreted the V.A.'s sue-and-be-sued 

 

 

 

 

 

clause to only waive sovereign immunity and not to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create Federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  I think

there is a split in the district courts after Red Cross

I don't -- the -- we are definitely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advocating for the approach that -- in all of those, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Fannie Mae's charter, that Federal subject-matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction is not created by the sue-and-be-sued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause, that you have to --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, the one that used 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the word "competent jurisdiction," "having competent 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction," was Osborn. 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Right, but it --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you do about that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  But in -- in Osborn, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Rosenkranz explained, the language in Osborn says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"all State courts having competent jurisdiction and any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit court of the United States." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think in that case what the Court said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was, Congress clearly wanted to confer jurisdiction on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all circuit courts of the United States.  It didn't use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the language "court of competent jurisdiction" when it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred to the Federal courts.  It used that language 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only with respect to the State courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

D'Oench, Duhme did not use the language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"court of competent jurisdiction," Justice Breyer.

It's -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae's charter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked 

   

 

 

 

 

 

exactly the same as the FDIC's, which the Court said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D'Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1954, Congress changed it to mean something different. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One of the main rationales of the court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals in this case was that the -- the work that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"court of competent jurisdiction" is doing is that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

telling you that you can't file suit in a specialized 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, like a State traffic court or a Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy court.  Well, the reason why the phrase 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"court of competent jurisdiction" would tell you to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is because you've got to look at the statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit that's being brought can be brought in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular court.  We are just asking for the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis to be done with Federal district courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What happens to all the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

judgments that have been entered, reading this the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction with district courts going other ways? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What happens to those old judgments where there wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal subject-matter jurisdiction? 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. O'CONNELL:  I would think if those cases 

    

 

 

 

 

 

are already finished that res judicata would -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, their -- those cases would still stand on their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own.  But I think going forward, if the Court were to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say there is no subject-matter jurisdiction, those cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could no longer be -- be brought in Federal court or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removed to Federal court. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How could you have 

  

 

 

 

 

res judicata if you never had subject-matter

jurisdiction?

21 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  So -- so you're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about a case where --

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You can bring up 

  

 

 

 

 

subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't when you --

 

 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Once the case is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- haven't brought it up

MS. O'CONNELL:  I -- correct.  If -- if 

    

  

 

 

 

 

these cases are -- I mean, if -- if these cases are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still going on, then, yes, you could bring up

MS. O'CONNELL:  The -- the words "court of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

competent jurisdiction" in the statute tell you to look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the statutes authorizing that court to see if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could bring a claim there.  And we are just asking for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same rule in the Federal district courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I guess language 

    

   

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

that hurts you is "any court of law, equity, State, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal."  I mean, that's the D'Oench, Duhme one, and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

they say that puts you in Federal court.  And you -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"competent jurisdiction," and we'd love them to be in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State court; we want them to be in State court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

Have you found any that say just something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

like "in any court of law, in equity, State, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

Federal," and you want them to be in Federal court? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, those -- those can be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

in Federal court, per the Court's decisions in D'Oench, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Duhme and in Red Cross.  If that's the way --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But what we have to say is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

once you added these words "in any competent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction," what they did, those words took the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out of Federal court unless it's some other basis for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting there and require you to go to State court, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to subtract words -- God, it's -- I mean, as a matter of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the English language, it just seems a little tough. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  No, no.  I think as a matter 

    

   

  

 

 

 

13 

of an English language that's our strongest point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It is. 

  

 

 

MS. O'CONNELL:  That natural reading of that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

phrase, a "court of competent jurisdiction" means that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you have to look somewhere else to determine if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court is a competent jurisdiction -- is a "court of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

19 

competent jurisdiction." 

 

20 

            

The Court has observed that about various 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

statutes --

 

22 

            

23 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.  I see. 

    

    

 

MS. O'CONNELL:  -- and -- and we are just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

asking for the same rule to be applied to the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

district courts.

The Respondents refer to the Federal

5 

6 

7 

district courts as courts of general jurisdiction, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just like a Federal bankruptcy court, the Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot typically bring a pure State law claim in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal district court unless there is complete 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diversity of citizenship and the requisite amount in

20

22 

            

So that language, "court of competent 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction," should just tell you, look at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes authorizing the Federal court and check whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this suit is authorized to be brought there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's a few other textual points that I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

think reinforce the point we are trying to make.  One is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Section 1349 should be an important point of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference.  Congress established a general rule that 

   

  

 

 

 

having a government charter is not enough to confer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal subject-matter jurisdiction unless the United 

 

 

 

 

 

States owns 50 percent of the corporation's stock, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you have a privately owned corporation like Fannie 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mae, you should be looking for a pretty clear indication 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from Congress that they wanted to confer subject-matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

jurisdiction.

MR. BROOKS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

The Red Cross decision reaffirmed a strong 

   

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

and long-standing rule going back through D'Oench, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Duhme, all the way to Osborn, which sets a baseline for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress to follow when it chooses to pursue Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy through the corporate form. 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

Now, when Congress expressly provides that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

federally chartered corporation like Fannie Mae may sue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and be sued in Federal court, that confers jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under D'Oench, Duhme, Red Cross, Osborn, and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

their prodigy. 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

Congress can obviously displace that rule if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it wants to.  There are a lot of ways Congress can do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  One way would be to eliminate the word "Federal," 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as Congress did in 1954 in the very same statute that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rechartered Fannie Mae for another agency.  But adding 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the words "competent jurisdiction" is pretty weak tea as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a solution for abolishing jurisdiction that otherwise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existed, particularly given the history of what was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

going on.

jurisdiction."  That is not the whole phrase. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

The whole phrase is, "competent 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, State or Federal."  That entire phrase had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been interpreted three times in three different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate decisions in the 1940s for a sister housing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency in the same statute, and that is the language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress adopted for Fannie Mae in 1954.  Each of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those appellate decisions at that time, every one of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them, held that the full phrase "court of competent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, State or Federal," conferred jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm talking about the Ferguson case, the George H. Evans 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, and the Seven Oaks case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress in 1954 would have had no idea that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the language it was borrowing from another agency in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same statute that had been repeatedly interpreted would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrict Fannie Mae's access to Federal court, and that

history shows the distinction. 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why didn't they do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

the same thing in Ginnie Mae? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Well, Ginnie --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They chose very 

  

 

 

 

different language, so doesn't that show a conscious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

7 

act. 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

make sure I understand the question, because Ginnie Mae 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically has had the identical language to Fannie 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mae.  Now, FSLIC, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corporation, they changed their language in the '54 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute to remove the word "Federal."  We think the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for that was that FSLIC, as understood at that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time, was truly a Federal agency. 

   

 

 

 

            

Fannie Mae, by contrast, as counsel says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was transitioning into a new structure, right?  There 

   

  

 

 

 

 

would eventually be private ownership.  And the idea 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, if anything, shows we think the opposite of what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Petitioners mean here.  They wanted to adopt the FHA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language, the language that had been interpreted in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

'40s, and, again, at the time of the '54 Act there had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been no case which had held that language didn't confer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

jurisdiction. 

25 

            

Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

Court that have interpreted the phrase "competent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction."  What this Court needs to understand 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about those cases is the number of those five cases that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted "competent jurisdiction" together with the 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase "State or Federal" is zero.  No case, not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the two phrases together. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

And when counsel argues that the phrase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

"competent jurisdiction" needs a separate source of 

   

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, they are right.  The separate source of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction is the phrase "State or Federal" if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's rule in Red Cross means anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, your -- your 

  

 

 

 

 

position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have the word "Federal" -- "State" or "Federal," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're home free.  So it doesn't -- the words "of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competent jurisdiction" doesn't mean anything.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

don't -- it's the use of the word "Federal" that gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you into Federal court.  And "of competent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction," they just tagged along those words, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they don't mean anything. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Well, actually, Your Honor, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the context of the late New Deal era, the words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"competent jurisdiction" meant a lot.  They just don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

mean what the Petitioners say they mean.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

            

So the three things we think competent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

jurisdiction was doing in the contemporary history of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the New Deal of the '40s and early '50s was -- these was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these three things. 

 

 

            

 

So the first thing was, there was a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

vigorous debate in the appeals courts about the nature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these new New Deal entities in terms of whether they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were limited by the Tucker Act and could only be heard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the court of claims, or whether they could be heard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally in the district courts.  This was the precise 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question presented in Ferguson, a case, I might add, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

that the Solicitor General has previously interpreted in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing to this Court as conferring jurisdiction under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these exact same words.  That was the SG's briefing in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Portsmouth case.  Okay? 

  

 

 

            

But what "competent jurisdiction" in this 

 

 

 

 

 

context was held to mean at that time was the direction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that general jurisdiction courts, and not only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specialized jurisdiction courts, could hear the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The way the Fourth Circuit put it in Ferguson at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time was that it would be puzzling if this exact phrase, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later barred for Fannie Mae, could be heard in any State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, but in Federal court, only in the Court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Claims.  And that issue was resolved. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The second thing --

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

1 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, the court said 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

"general jurisdiction," right? 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

MR. BROOKS:  They -- they certainly did. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  "General jurisdiction," 

  

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

instead of saying "of competent jurisdiction" when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"competent" generally means -- is this -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the Court. 

 

 

10 

            

Does this Court have authority to proceed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

this category of cases? 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Yes, Your Honor.  So the way we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

think all these things work together is, first of all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as I say, the entire phrase, "court of competent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction," State or Federal, had been unanimously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

 

Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases to the contrary at the time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

And the understanding of what "competent 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

jurisdiction" was adding was twofold.  First of all, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from Congress's perspective at the time, I think it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair to say they weren't thinking about much, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal housing policy having very little to do with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

jurisdiction. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

1 

            

 

And we think what happened is they simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There was no other reason to think they meant anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different from that. 

 

 

6 

            

But we also know that less than two years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court looked at the phrase "competent jurisdiction" on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standalone basis and said that all it referred to at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that time in that context was personal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That doesn't mean that's what "competent 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction" means always.  But what we think it means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is when coupled with the words "State" or "Federal," it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means personal jurisdiction courts of general 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

jurisdiction. 

16 

17 

18 

19 

            

Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the 

 

 

 

 

 

question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clauses like ours.  We have the same count, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that your clerk has.  We have nine total, including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

Fannie Mae. 

 

21 

22 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We now have three 

  

 

 

 

 

versions, but that's okay. 

 

 

 

23 

            

(Laughter.) 

24 

            

MR. BROOKS:  I'm going to go with nine. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

(Laughter.) 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

            

MR. BROOKS:  But here's what else we know.

3

5 

6 

7

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

The number of statutes that have the phrase "competent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction" alone, based on some Lexis research very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

early this morning, is 781.  So if the phrase "competent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction" together with "State" or "Federal" exists 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only nine times, but "competent jurisdiction" as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generic matter occurs 781 times, that's the rule that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

urge on this Court today. 

 

 

 

 

            

The rule is, when combined with the grant of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction embodied in the word "Federal" under Red 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cross, you have the personal jurisdiction and general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction holdings of other cases.  You have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant of subject-matter jurisdiction per Red Cross and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its progenitors, and that becomes the jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule that is very clean. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If -- I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOKS:  So Your Honor, I was going 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to -- go ahead. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your friend on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

other side scares me when he says there are 60,000 cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are going to be added to the Federal docket. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Do you have an answer to that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOKS:  I have many answers to that, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor, but the easiest answer is this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

The easiest answer is no --

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Don't tell us we're not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

working hard enough. 

 

 

4 

            

(Laughter.) 

5 

            

MR. BROOKS:  I do recall, Justice Kennedy, 

    

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

that once upon a time, the Court took 150 cases a year. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maybe foreclosures could be among them. 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They were easier cases. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BROOKS:  Perhaps I should sit down. 

   

  

 

 

 

10 

            

(Laughter.) 

11 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Your Honor, the easiest answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

to that is that it's undisputed in this case that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Freddie Mac -- whatever one thinks of the Fannie Mae 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charter, Freddie Mac has clear, undisputed 

 

 

 

 

 

belt-and-suspenders jurisdiction.  Freddie Mac has 

  

 

 

 

almost as many foreclosures as Fannie Mae has.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been no race to the Federal courthouse. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is a specific 

   

  

 

 

 

statute that makes that crystal clear.  And if we -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

said --

 

24 

25 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Well, so, Your Honor, we know a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of things that Congress thought about Freddie 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

Mac.  But just let me make sure I've closed off on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief Justice's question, which is the fact that there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no race to the Federal courthouse on foreclosures for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Freddie Mac tells you what you need to know about Fannie 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mae, its sister organization. 

 

 

 

            

Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about 

 

 

 

 

 

Freddie Mac is severalfold.  So the first thing we know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history in both the House Report and the Senate Report 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make crystal clear that Congress's intention was to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create an entity that had identical powers that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

develop in parallel and that would have no advantage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over Fannie Mae.  We know that was their intention in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

drafting it. 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Now, the words were unquestionably 

 

 

 

 

different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were different from the words in the Second Bank of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The reason the words were different at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

writing in a blank slate.  So Congress sat down, without 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

60 years of history, without the need to extricate a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legacy agency from Ginnie Mae with a privatization 

   

 

 

 

 

 

scheme over six different amendments, and to simply sit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down and say, this is what we think the GSE should look

we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to go into a Federal court, although the matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may be purely a State matter?  That's not what we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended.  All we intended -- then they say, well, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, they have to look to see whether it's really a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State case or whether it's really a Federal case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean -- and the words "competent 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction" do -- she says do that.  That is their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

natural meaning.  I hadn't quite taken that in, but --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the point of having these here if the statute without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you want? 

 

 

20 

            

21 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Well, Justice Breyer, on the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let me give you that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

what do I do?  Maybe you could just say you shouldn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at legislative history.  I'm not prepared to say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  What -- what should I do? 

   

  

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Justice Breyer, two -- two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

37 

1 

points. 

2 

            

So first of all, on the -- on the natural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

reading, I would just urge that the natural reading of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"competent jurisdiction" standing alone is different 

 

 

 

 

 

from the natural reading of "competent jurisdiction" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State or Federal.  And there is no case, I emphasize, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that holds those words together, don't confer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

jurisdiction. 

9 

            

But now, on the question about what was --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

you know, how to understand the colloquy in 1934, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is one respect in which that colloquy could be clearer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that respect is if the colloquy related to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute that created Fannie Mae.  That would make it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

clearer. 

15 

            

But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created Fannie Mae, and so it's not that much more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probative than if it had been the legislative history of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an utterly unrelated statute.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

20 

            

In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

authorized the creation of entirely different private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mortgage associations which never came into being.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that private capital would come into the market pursuant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chicago, and New York, and would start creating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liquidity to solve the problem. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

So in 1938, a new statute was passed.  That 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his re-election campaign. 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  For this reason. 

  

 

 

 

9 

            

(Laughter.) 

10 

            

MR. BROOKS:  We -- we -- we can only assume, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

or perhaps hope. 

 

 

12 

            

But in any case, 1938 was a different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

statute.  The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't even created in 1938.  The congressional charter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for Fannie Mae that's being reviewed today was created 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted, and six years after D'Oench, Duhme.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language adopted in 1948 was the D'Oench, Duhme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

language. 

20 

            

So somebody has to prevail, either the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

Supreme Court unanimously in D'Oench, Duhme, or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failed Senator Bulkley.  We -- we think the answer is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most likely this Court in D'Oench, Duhme followed in Red 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

Cross. 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The -- the Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

courts -- may be stepping back a bit.  There are courts 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of limited jurisdiction.  And to get into them you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish 

   

   

 

 

 

 

their right to be there. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

Now, I think you have to do more than win 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

51/49, given a presumption against Federal jurisdiction. 

   

 

 

 

 

Do you think -- I suspect you think you do win by more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than 51/49, but that seems to me that is a consideration 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we need to take into account. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. BROOKS:  So, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

there's no question that the courts are limited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction courts, and we should look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject-matter jurisdiction with a careful eye. 

   

 

 

 

14 

            

Having said that, this fundamentally is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

case about statutory construction.  It's about what did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress mean to do in 1954.  That's really all it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about.  I don't think there's a serious question but 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that under Article III --

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's so many ways 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

that you could -- if you want to make sure that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity gets into Federal court all the time, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

removal purposes. 

 

25 

            

Now, that is very clear.  It means it can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

1 

2 

come into Federal court to sue.  It means it can remove 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it's sued in State court. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

This, compared to "court of competent 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

jurisdiction" -- which, as I go back to competent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court, which consists of two things:  subject matter and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

personal. 

8 

            

MR. BROOKS:  So, Your Honor, let me begin 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

where you ended, if I might, and just say that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"competent jurisdiction" again, standing alone, okay, 

 

 

 

 

 

has multiple different meanings depending on context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction citing cases. 

 

 

17 

            

In the earlier case law of Blackmar v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our statute was decided, it said that in that context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

So I think the only way to harmonize all of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language/Osborn/D'Oench, Duhme, it means all of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other things that "competent jurisdiction" normally 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

means:  personal jurisdiction, courts of general 

  

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, et cetera.  And that's what the case law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

holds. 

4 

            

5 

            

But the most --

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's because this 

  

 

 

 

6 

7 

Court's competence is general competence, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject matter, and it's specific competence, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

personal. 

9 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Correct.  That's exactly right. 

  

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

And, again, because this is a case about Congress' 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand is when Congress borrowed this language that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for 20 years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language had held it was sufficient to confer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those words were no more restrictive than the phrase "in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any United States District Court."  That's the tapestry 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on which Congress was weaving at the time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

Now, let me address, if I might just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

briefly, the policy issue.  We talked about the text and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the history.  But counsel spent a few moments talking 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

about this privatization concept and how it would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that what must have happened in the '50s was Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company and deprive it of special access to the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

courts. 

6 

            

The presumption behind that argument is 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately 

   

 

 

 

 

 

owned company to have special access, except we know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are times when a privately owned company is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently important, it can have special access.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

shareholders. 

14 

            

Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its inception with clear and undisputed access to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, because it was writing in a different era and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

writing on a different slate without all the baggage 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Fannie Mae had gone through.  But there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that privately owned instrumentalities when 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

qualify under these circumstances. 

 

 

 

            

But the other problem with their theory if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

in its mechanism.  The truth is this:  Congress did not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privatize Fannie Mae in 1954.  On the contrary, even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

still had special access to the Federal courts under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

1345. 

7 

            

So if there had been a conscious legislative 

   

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that time, they surely would have had to do the work of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking away its agency status. 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It shouldn't matter to 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

the Federal court.  They can be there if there is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

MR. BROOKS:  That's true, Your Honor.  That 

  

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

exact issue, however, I might point out, was raised 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically in Red Cross.  It was a point of discussion 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Red Cross oral argument before this Court that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Red Cross had repeatedly moved on diversity grounds. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that issue was pointed out in the opinion as not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being particularly relevant.  Lots of companies remove 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on lots of grounds all the time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

23 

            

And by the way --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But Red Cross didn't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

the competence language.  It was just any court, State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

or Federal. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

1 

            

MR. BROOKS:  That's true.  But the point I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

was making is that the fact of diversity jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't have some negative implication for other sources, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, indeed, the Freddie Mac charter is very powerful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that that shouldn't matter. 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

Freddie Mac -- talk about belt and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

suspenders -- has a charter which says, sue and be sued 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in State or Federal court.  It also says, Freddie --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Freddie doesn't say competent jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

But what else Freddie says is Freddie says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

that Freddie shall be deemed an agency for 1345 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes.  It separately says Freddie shall have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statutory authorization to remove, notwithstanding the 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations of 1442.  So Freddie has four distinct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

grounds for getting to Federal court. 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why didn't they do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

that for Fannie Mae? 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Because we -- I mean, it's hard 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

to know the subjective intentions, Justice Sotomayor, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Framers of our charter.  But the original charter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language was written in the '30s and '40s.  It was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

written at a time when we were connected with multiple 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other agencies.  We were part of the Department of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Housing and Urban Development.  We comprised what became 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginnie Mae.  And our language was an attempt to do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

45 

1 

2 

essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

big accretion of language over decades. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

Freddie Mac didn't have that problem.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5

I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I'm trying to imagine what would happen to the poor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We -- we'd like to change Fannie Mae's language.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to add this competent jurisdiction language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

Now, that's only been looked at three times 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

before, and all of those cases said that confers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  But we think that was just dicta or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way of removing jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

18 

            

That doesn't sound plausible any more in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

this case than it did in the prior case to me, given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the case law backdrop was of the time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

Now, if I might, I'd like to say one point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, we are sister companies.  Obviously, Freddie Mac 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has different language.  The question is, is this a good 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing for our side?  Is it a bad thing for our side? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

Our view basically is Congress said what it

16

18

20 

21 

meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate.  It said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that companies were supposed to be parallel.  They were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed to have no advantages over each other and have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all the same powers. 

 

 

 

            

The question for this Court is:  Why would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress -- although it used a different language across 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but have different Federal court litigating powers? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's no answer to that. 

 

 

 

 

            

And all we know is that in terms of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much, much bigger.  So it doesn't make a lot of sense to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imagine that a $3 trillion dollar company, the largest 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

company in the United States by assets, creating housing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended not to be protected by Federal court

JUSTICE BREYER:  Did you look it up?  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language really came from?  I mean, somebody wrote it. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

It didn't just have computers write it.  I mean, there 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a human being who wrote it.

from?  Who did he work for?  Does anybody know?

JUSTICE BREYER:  He was fired. 

  

 

 

 

MR. BROOKS:  It's possible it was a former 

   

  

 

 

 

 

9 

staffer for Senator Buckley, although I certainly hope 

   

 

 

 

 

 

10 

not. 

11 

            

Your Honor, the -- here is what we know.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

know the language pre-existed.  We know it wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

created in nineteen --

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are those words, 

  

 

 

 

15 

"competent" -- you know, in any "court of competent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

jurisdiction" --

 

17 

            

18 

            

MR. BROOKS:  "State or Federal." 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, "State or Federal." 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

You know, I've got that point.  I just want to know who 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

did this. 

 

21 

            

22 

know. 

23 

            

MR. BROOKS:  If I find them, I will let you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Your Honor, here's what we do know:  We know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

the language was not de novo in 1954.  We know it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

written in the '30s for the Federal Housing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

Administration.  That's what we know.  That's where the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

phrase first came from.  And we know that that language 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had been repeatedly held to mean one thing, and Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had no indication it could have meant anything else.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know from Ferguson, from George H. Evans, and from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seven Oaks case at a minimum, okay, that that phrase, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"competent jurisdiction," State or Federal, conferred 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4

jurisdiction. 

9 

            

Here's what else we know:  We know that in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

briefing before this Court in the '80s, looking at this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exact language at Section 1702 of the National Housing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act, the Solicitor General filed a brief in opposition 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to certiorari in this Court in the Portsmouth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Redevelopment case.  And in that brief citing Ferguson, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Solicitor General's office said that phrase creates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction in the district courts.  Okay?  That's what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

we know.  That has always been the understanding. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

And if we didn't have that history and we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

didn't have that case law, we might write it differently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on a blank slate.  But writing 200 years after Osborn 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and in the wake of all of that New Deal era case law, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know what it means. 

 

 

 

23 

            

The disruption that would be created in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

markets, would this Court suddenly reverse the lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts -- and there are multiple of them all coming to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

the same result, at least three in the courts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals -- and hold that Freddie Mac has different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powers than Fannie Mae has would be significant?

23 

24 

25 

reason -- your -- your friend on the other side suggests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was a reason for treating them differently, which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that the board -- the Freddie board is -- consists of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal officers, while the idea, of course, is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fannie's board, two-thirds of it does not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Right.  But the Fannie board, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

unlike the Freddie board, was one-third appointed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President of the United States until conservatorship in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2008, and at the same time had the same special Treasury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access, the same tax exemptions, the same SEC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration exemptions.  I mean, Your Honor, there is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

no material policy different between these two agencies, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and again, we have the legislative history that shows an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent to treat these the same. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I will say that since 1974, every GSE 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Freddie Mac charter.  So since Freddie was created, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress has never treated one differently, not in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

'70s and not today.  So there's no plausible reason why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they would have wanted these treated differently.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you know why they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2

have that different structure on the board of directors? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOKS:  Well, again, Your Honor, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's interesting, I've actually personally spoken to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some of the original Fannie Mae directors from the late 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

'60s, okay?  They were all former government officials, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because Fannie was, in '68, being extricated from its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal agency role. 

 

 

9 

            

Freddie Mac was a clean sheet of paper. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1970 would have wanted it.  Fannie Mae wasn't.  Fannie 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

torn apart from Ginnie Mae.  That's why the original 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Undersecretary.  It consisted of a former general 

   

  

 

 

 

counsel of HUD.  They were all Federal officials at that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time, and it took multiple years before they could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extricated.  There is just a history here, which makes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

it different. 

 

21 

            

But I would re-emphasize, Fannie Mae is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

largest participant in the largest market in the U.S. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economy.  Holding that Fannie Mae has different powers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and lesser powers than Freddie Mac has, simply because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the language of the '50s and a complicated history 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

differed a little bit from the language of the '70s, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be a significant policy shift that we would argue 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't justified by either history or policy or text.

9 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

Just a couple of points. 

   

 

 

12 

            

First, Justice Breyer wanted to know:  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

do you do when the language points one way and the cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem to point another?  I would -- I'd dispute the "the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases seem to point another," but my direct answer is: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This Court has never gone wrong by going with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language, and in those previous cases, what the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was trying to do in each case was go with the language, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right down to Red Cross where the operative principle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was:  What did this very language mean last time this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court addressed it? 

 

 

22 

            

Justice Breyer, you also asked:  Which is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

simpler for lawyers?  Now -- now, Fannie doesn't dispute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that our reading is a natural reading of the language. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fannie doesn't even dispute that it's the most natural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

52 

reading.  Instead, its entire argument revolves around 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this proposition that it might actually mean other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things, but I still don't know what Fannie thinks it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

means. 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

            

Fannie says it could mean personal 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  It could mean -- it could mean venue.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could mean general jurisdiction.  Plug each of those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

words into the statute, and it just doesn't parse.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bottom line is you need to commit to what that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning is, and this Court can't go wrong by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting those words to mean what this Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said of competent jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, suppose it means 

  

 

 

 

 

personal jurisdiction.  Why doesn't it parse? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Okay.  So now the statute 

  

  

 

 

 

 

says, Fannie can sue or be sued in any court that has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal jurisdiction over the parties, State or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

Federal. 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Well, the Federal Court of Claims has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal jurisdiction over Fannie, but this was not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant of jurisdiction, because the -- the whole idea is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this now turns into a grant of Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject-matter jurisdiction.  It's not a grant of 

   

  

 

 

 

jurisdiction to Fannie. 

 

 

            

So what about the court of appeals cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

53 

that Mr. Brooks has addressed?  Those cases did not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret the phrase of "competent jurisdiction," and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were not about Federal jurisdiction.  Everyone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understood in those cases, Ferguson and so on, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was Federal jurisdiction.  The question was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether something about the Tucker Act trumped district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court jurisdiction to move the cases to the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court -- excuse me, to the Court of Federal Claims.

position in Portsmouth? 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, I can't 

   

  

 

 

 

explain the position that the government has taken, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government has said that those were also kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not involve the question of what is the source of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

Federal jurisdiction.

If I may, one last point on Fannie and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Freddie.  Why -- why did Congress treat them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently?  The answer is different era, 32 years 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

apart, and better lobbyists.  Freddie was being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board.  They

advantage.  But case after case has held that, of

of cases have held that there was no automatic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction for Fannie.
