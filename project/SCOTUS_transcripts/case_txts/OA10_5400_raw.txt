 ORAL ARGUMENT OF REUBEN C. CAHN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. CAHN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 When it instructed courts to recognize that 

imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting 

correction and rehabilitation, Congress intended to end 

the practice of sending defendants to prison so that 

they might get treatment.  The commands of 3582 are 

clear on this point:  Do not imprison and do not 

lengthen prison sentences for the purposes of 

rehabilitation.  This plain meaning is confirmed by the 

structure of the statute.

 Under the statute, judges have the power to 

sentence defendants to prison but not to prison 

programs.  Judges once had that power under the Youth 

Corrections Act and under the Narcotic Addicts 

Rehabilitation Act.  With the Sentencing Reform Act 

Congress took that power away.  That structure makes

sense only because Congress intended that defendants 

should no longer be sent to prison for purposes of 

rehabilitation. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You have, in effect, a 

one-way ratchet.  If the judge really thinks 

rehabilitation is a -- a -- a primary or an important 

component of the sentence, then it reduces the prison 

term.  It could never increase it.  So you have a 

one-way ratchet.

 MR. CAHN:  Yes, Your Honor.  I believe that 

that's correct, that the -- that the way in which the 

statute is set up, the logic of 3582 is that a need for 

rehabilitation can push the judge, the sentencing judge, 

into moving the individual either out of an 

incarceration sentence into probation or lower the 

sentence to get that individual into supervisory release 

where rehabilitation current -- concerns are properly 

addressed under the statute. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that's -- do 

you think that's consistent with what Congress thought 

about rehabilitation when it adopted the Sentencing 

Reform Act?  And you discuss their thinking, and I think 

accurately, in your brief, but was their thinking simply 

that rehabilitation is very feasible and it's reasonably 

predictable whether somebody can be rehabilitated or has

been rehabilitated so long as it's done outside of 

prison, but it just doesn't work in prison?  Was that 

their thinking? 

 MR. CAHN:  Well, there's relatively little 

evidence of what Congress thought about the possibility 

of rehabilitating individuals outside of prison.  What's 

clear is that they doubted that rehabilitation could be 

reliably induced in the prison setting.  There is at 

least one comment that indicates that they doubt that we 

know enough about human behavior to rehabilitate 

individuals on a regular basis in any case, but they 

certainly -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it is strange, isn't 

14 

it, that they can take rehabilitation into account for 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

the supervised release.  I mean, that -- that's a 

provision, isn't it?  As far as supervised release is 

concerned, the judge can take account of rehabilitation 

in setting the length of the term, but can't do that for 

the prison time.

 MR. CAHN:  Well, certainly with regard to 

supervised release, we think, as far as setting the term 

of supervised release, the judge is required to take 

rehabilitation concerns into account, and that's because 

supervised release is intended to smooth the transition 

from prison to true liberty and is specifically a 

5

rehabilitative vehicle.

24 

25

 Now, with regard to revocation, to the 

extent that that's -- that's at issue, we concur with 

the Solicitor General that 3582, by its terms, simply 

doesn't govern a revocation of supervised release 

because it's not the imposition of a term of 

imprisonment but, rather, requiring the individual to 

serve a portion of the supervised release term in 

prison.  So, by its plain terms, it simply isn't 

applicable. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, aren't -- isn't 

punishment and rehabilitation often flip sides of each 

other?  If you read what the judge said here, his 

comment was this man -- or this woman, I'm sorry, has 

been involved in a series -- escalating series of 

serious offenses.  Logically, she has to be put away for 

a long time unless she gets rehabilitation because 

there's going to be no deterrence otherwise. 

 And so, what the judge was basically saying, 

in my judgment -- and I don't know why it's not just the 

flip, which is without -- without drug treatment, we 

can't deter her.  And so, this crime, given her 

background, deserves this kind of sentence.  One of its 

by-products is a drug treatment program.

 How different is that, or do you really 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

think that a judge who knows that someone is going to 

get a rehab program if they serve 50 months and the 

sentencing range is between 45 and 55, do you think that 

they're going to take 50 -- they're not going to choose 

50 if they understand that there's no chance for this 

6 

person to be deterred without drug treatment? 

7

8 

9 

10

13

 MR. CAHN:  The problem is the judge has no 

ability to ensure that the individual gets that 

treatment if they're sent to prison.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your client -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- didn't get, did she? 

 MR. CAHN:  She did not get that treatment, 

14 

in fact.  And then, she's past the -­

15

16 

17 

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, if he gave her extra 

years in order to get that treatment, he just gave her 

extra years without the treatment, as it turned out? 

 MR. CAHN:  Yes, and I don't think that was 

19 

that -­

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, wait a minute. 

That's the whole point, because what the judge said was 

if she doesn't get treatment, she needs to be in jail a 

long time because her crime was serious, because she's 

just going to continue committing crimes.  There's a 

chance if she gets it that she won't, but without it,

for sure, she's not, and this is the just punishment she 

deserves, this amount of years.  That's how I read the 

transcript. 

 MR. CAHN:  Well, Judge -- I mean, Justice, I 

would disagree with that characterization of Judge 

Moskowitz's comments, and I'd point specifically to the 

Joint Appendix, really, at pages 25 through 38, and 

particularly to pages 27 through 29, where he very 

specifically says not that he's imposing this time for 

punishment purposes, but really to get her into the drug 

program.  He says:  I'm going to impose a 51-month 

sentence, 46 months plus 5 months for the bail jump, and 

one of the factors that affects this is the need to 

provide treatment.  In other words, so she is in long 

enough to get the 500-hour drug program. 

 And then, again, when he actually imposes 

sentence, he says -- the judge says:  I think a 

sentence -- I'm sorry.  Well, he says:  The court 

recommends, strongly recommends, that she participate in 

the 500-hour drug program. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're ignoring his 

lengthy discussion talking about she was really going 

down the wrong road here.  I understand her troubled 

past.  She gets involved in alien smuggling, which is 

very serious.  He is talking at length about the 

8

seriousness of the crime.

12 

13

15

 So what I'm asking you is, if what we see is 

a judge who's talking about a flip situation, i.e., you 

need to punish strongly because the crimes are serious, 

and an added benefit is rehabilitation, why does that 

violate 3582?  What about 3582, in using the word 

"recognizing," stops a judge from saying without 

something there's going to be no deterrence? 

 MR. CAHN:  There's nothing that stops a 

sentencing judge from saying I think that 

incapacitation, retribution, deterrence justify a 

sentence of X, and in addition you'll receive 

rehabilitative resources while you're inside; make -­

you know, make best use of them.  There's nothing that 

stops a judge from urging a defendant to, in fact, make 

16 

better of herself while she's in prison or outside. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're talking only 

about when rehabilitation is the primary purpose?  So 

the issue here is what was the judge's primary purpose?

 MR. CAHN:  No.  No.  Whenever the judge 

lengthens a sentence or imposes a sentence of 

imprisonment that that judge otherwise would not have 

imposed, that is a violation of 3582.  You could -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So now we want some 

talismanic words where the judge says what I said?  This

crime is so serious that the sentence should be X 

amount, and now talismanically I'll say rehab is just a 

side effect, really the sentence is motivated by -­

completely by punishment?

 MR. CAHN:  I think a fair reading of Judge 

Moskowitz's statements at the sentencing was that, in 

fact, he was lengthening the sentence for purposes of 

rehabilitation -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, how do we -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- can we know that when

months?

 MR. CAHN:  The government did ask for 63 

months.  We requested 36 months.  There's -- we don't 

know with certainty -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the judge came up 

19 

with something in between those two?

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. CAHN:  He did, indeed.  I believe that 

-- that these particular issues are appropriately -- I'm 

sorry -- addressed on plain error review in the circuit 

court first.  I don't think they're essential to the 

legal question that's before this Court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The judge did say, didn't

he -- this is on page 27 of the Joint Appendix -- "the 

sentence has to be sufficient to provide needed 

correctional treatment, and here I think the needed 

correctional treatment is the 500-hour drug program." 

It couldn't be clearer that he's computing the length of 

the sentence on the basis of what correctional treatment 

will be received.  It "has to be sufficient to provide 

needed correctional treatment." 

 MR. CAHN:  Indeed, he did, and I believe 

that he was taking into account his own knowledge of the 

prison system and what it would require to allow Ms. 

Tapia to participate in the 500-hour program. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- putting 

14 

aside the particular statement here, what if a judge 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

says:  I appreciate that one purpose of punishment is 

deterrence; that's what -- and that's what's going to 

guide me, and I think you will not be deterred if I only 

sentence you for 2 years, but I think if you have to go 

away for 3 years, you will appreciate that what you've 

done is wrong and you won't do it again. 

 Is that for rehabilitation, that extra year, 

22 

or is it for punishment? 

23

 MR. CAHN:  I believe that's for punishment 

24 

and deterrence, and I don't believe that's an improper 

25

purpose.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, maybe -- what 

is the difference between deterrence and rehabilitation? 

The person doesn't commit any crimes anymore but wishes 

-- wishes she could?  Or -- and, well, if she's 

rehabilitated, she doesn't want to?  It seems to me it's 

6 

a very artificial distinction.

 MR. CAHN:  Well, I don't think it is, 

because I think we can look at the purposes Congress had 

in mind when it enacted the statute and, in particular, 

the system it had in mind, the system it intended to 

overturn when it enacted the statute.  As I mentioned 

before, one of the statements, a prominent statement, in 

the Senate report that comes up again and again is 

Congress doubted that rehabilitation could be reliably 

induced in the prison setting.  The system that was 

being overturned was one of coercive rehabilitation in 

which individuals were sent to prison and prison 

sentences were tied to their completion of these 

programs.

 And so for that reason, I think when you 

look at a sentence that's employed specifically to get 

somebody into treatment, it is exactly within the 

proscription Congress intended. 

 If there are no questions at this time, I'd 

ask to reserve the rest of my time, Your Honor.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN SUPPORT OF VACATUR

 MR. ROBERTS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 Section 3582(a) prohibits courts from 

imposing or lengthening a term of imprisonment to 

promote a defendant's rehabilitation, including by

facilitating her access to a prison drug treatment

program.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Roberts, could I take 

you back to Justice Kennedy's question at the start 

about the one-way ratchet?  What's the government's 

theory about what Congress might have been thinking when 

it said you can't think about rehabilitation to sentence 

or to lengthen a sentence, but you can think about 

rehabilitation to make a decision not to sentence or to 

shorten a sentence?  What would -- what would have been 

in Congress's mind? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, Congress was intending 

to reject the prevailing rehabilitation model of 

sentencing, and under that model, defendants were kept 

in prison until they were declared rehabilitated based 

on their participation in treatment programs.  And what

18 

19 

20

Congress determined was that -- that coercing 

participation in prison programs that way wasn't -- had 

failed and that rehabilitation couldn't be accomplished 

reliably in a prison setting.  So -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's only one-half of what 

the thinking was at the time about rehabilitation.  The 

thinking was that -- that some people were being 

sentenced to coercive rehabilitation, but also that 

other people were being paroled before they should be on 

the theory that they had been rehabilitated.  It was a 

general skepticism about rehabilitation, and that is 

inconsistent with the idea that you can take 

rehabilitation into account in going down, but you can't 

take rehabilitation into account in going up.

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, Congress expressly 

determined to retain -- there were people that said 

rehabilitation never works; it can't be a legitimate 

purpose of sentencing.  And Congress decided not to go 

that far.  It expressly retained rehabilitation as a 

purpose of sentencing.  That's reflected in section 

21 

3553(a)(2)(D). 

22

23 

24 

25

 But what Congress determined was that it -­

that because you couldn't reliably induce it in prison, 

it wasn't appropriate to deprive defendants of their 

liberty, expend the resources on keeping them in prison 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

for that purpose, but that -- that rehabilitation 

remained a possibility, that other forms of sentencing 

were appropriate ways to attempt to achieve 

rehabilitation, and that's why Congress expressly 

provided that, in imposing a sentence of probation, the 

court can require a defendant to participate in 

particular treatment programs -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes, but that's different 

9 

from saying that a lower sentence can be imposed on the 

10

theory that with rehabilitation outside of prison, a 

11 

lengthier sentence isn't needed.

13

15

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 Would you agree that when the guidelines 

were mandatory a judge could not sentence to -- to 

additional time, certainly not additional time outside 

the guideline range for the purpose of rehabilitation, 

but the judge also generally could not depart below the 

guideline range on the theory that this defendant had 

led a life of crime because the defendant lacked 

vocational skills or the defendant was dependent on 

drugs or alcohol, and with treatment outside of 

incarceration, those problems which had led to the 

criminality could be alleviated? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think it would depend 

24 

whether that was an aggravating or, you know, mitigating 

25

circumstance that the guidelines hadn't adequately taken

into account, but I don't think that Congress was trying 

to prevent a court from selecting another sentencing 

option, such as probation, in lieu of imprisonment 

because the court determined that the primary purpose of 

the sentence should be rehabilitation, or to shorten the 

sentence to speed the defendant from imprisonment to 

supervised release, where the court could guarantee the 

defendant would participate in programs. 

 On the other hand, if the -- it was very 

important, if there were important purposes of 

protecting the public, deterring the defendant from 

committing other crimes, deterring generally, then the 

court was supposed to sentence the defendant to prison 

in accordance with that, even if the defendant also 

needed rehabilitation. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose -- suppose the 

case in which the judge is going to sentence to 2 years 

no matter, but there is a 2-year rehabilitation program, 

and the defendant is -- the prisoner is receiving that. 

Would you say that, at that point, the prisoner is 

21 

receiving an imprisonment term and rehabilitation? 

22

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the prisoner is 

23 

receiving an imprisonment term -­

24

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Hypothetical.  The term 

isn't affected by the program, but the judge recommends 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company

the program, and the prisoner is receiving it. 

2

3

 MR. ROBERTS:  I -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you agree the 

4 

prisoner is then receiving both an imprisonment term and 

5

6

7 

8 

9

10

rehabilitation? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think the prisoner is 

receiving rehabilitative services, yes, in prison -- in 

prison, yes. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- so then, we can use 

those two goals of sentencing in -- in the 

11 

conjunctive -­

12

13

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- and you can have 

14 

imprisonment and rehabilitation at the same time?

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

24

25

 MR. ROBERTS:  Congress intended that, even 

if a defendant needed rehabilitation, if the other goals 

of sentencing such as deterrence and protecting the 

public justified a term of imprisonment, that the court 

should impose a term of imprisonment.  So Congress -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm just talking about a 

matter of diction.  You would agree there are instances, 

in a hypothetical -­

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, yes, but what Congress 

wanted courts to -- required courts to recognize was 

that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of 

promoting rehabilitation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We're -- we're talking 

about what the statute says, and the question indicates, 

the hypothetical indicates, that those are not mutually 

exclusive.  You can have imprisonment and rehabilitation 

at same time.  Now, this case is a little different 

10

because she didn't get it, but let's just talk about the 

11 

hypothetical. 

12

13

15

 MR. ROBERTS:  I agree that you can -- there 

can be rehabilitative programs in prison.  But what 

Congress was trying to preclude was imposing 

imprisonment for the purpose of providing those programs 

16 

or lengthening the imprisonment term for that purpose.

this man or this woman needs rehabilitation, and I want 

this program for her, but in the prison setting, the

judge, this judge -- as the colloquy with Justice Scalia 

showed, this judge wanted her to be in the program, but 

she never got into it because the judge has no control? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Exactly, Your Honor.  The -­

under the SRA, judges have no authority to place 

prisoners in -- place defendants in prison treatment 

programs or to require their participation in those 

programs.  And Petitioner, in fact, did not participate 

in the drug treatment program on which the sentencing 

court relied in setting her prison term. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- what if 

the judge sentences people who commit robbery with 

assault typically to 1 year; he can do it 1 to 2 years, 

he gives them 1 year; except whenever the presentencing 

report says the person has a drug problem and there's a 

one-and-a-half-year drug program in the prison, he 

sentences those people to one and a half years? 

Regularly.  But each time he says I recognize 

rehabilitation is not a permitted factor; I can send 

sentence this person to one to two, I'm going to pick 

21 

one and a half. 

22

23

 MR. ROBERTS:  Right. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that a problem, 

24 

or does it always just depend on what the judge says?

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think generally you take the

district court at the court's word for what the purposes 

of the sentence are, and the sentence has to be 

justified by the reasons that the district court gives 

in sentencing the defendant.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you'd say it was 

6 

wrong for the district court to do that.

recognizing that rehabilitation is an appropriate means 

of promoting -- that imprisonment is an appropriate 

means of promoting rehabilitation but is in fact doing 

that, but not -- but being disingenuous about the 

court's reason, then the court is violating the statute, 

but we're not going to know that. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does the defendant 

24 

have the right to raise arguments and inquire into that 

25

in -- in every case?  Say that, well, he did say this

was just to -- just to punish me, but here is a list of 

10 cases where I think it's like my case and those 

people got less.

going to be hard for the defendant to obtain reversal of 

6 

a conviction under those circumstances.

under those circumstances.

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I think, as I said, that 

the words that you -- that the court is required to give 

its reasons for imposing sentence.  We presume that 

district courts honestly give their reasons for imposing 

the sentence and that if the court is indeed lengthening 

the term of imprisonment because the court wants the 

defendant to be in a program, that the court will say 

that's what they're doing, just as Judge Moskowitz did 

here.  And once this Court makes clear that imprisonment 

is not an appropriate means of promoting rehabilitation, 

therefore, courts cannot impose or lengthen a term of 

imprisonment to serve that purpose, sentencing courts 

will follow that -­

I'm going to sentence you to 12 months.  Now, there is a 

particular facility where there is a drug treatment 

program that you can really benefit from, and you'd be a 

safer citizen, but I'm not going to mix up imprisonment 

and rehabilitation.  I'm not even going to make that -­

I'm not going to consider it.  All I'm interested in is 

imprisonment. 

 Is that an abuse of discretion?  The failure 

9 

to consider the factors that Congress set forth, 

10

11

12 

13 

14

15

16

including rehabilitation? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  No.  I think that the -- that 

the -- what the court has to do is consider all of the 

factors, including rehabilitative purposes. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, he said I -- no, he 

said I'm not going to consider that. 

 MR. ROBERTS:  He's not going to consider 

17 

rehabilitation at all in imposing sentence?

would be a procedural error -­

all.

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so then he must 

consider rehabilitation in the context of imprisonment? 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  We don't think that it 

precludes -- the statute precludes considering 

rehabilitation in the context of imprisonment.  What it 

precludes is imposing or lengthening the term.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what 

you're saying.  It -- it seems to me what the statute 

requires is that he consider rehabilitation in imposing 

the sentence.  Right? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not in imposing

imprisonment.

 MR. ROBERTS:  It does require -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So he can consider

rehabilitation in deciding what this person will be 

15

16 

17 

18

required to do in -- in a probated term, but not in how 

long he's going to stay in prison before he gets 

probation. 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, but the court can also 

19 

consider rehabilitation to choose a sentence of 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

probation rather than a sentence of imprisonment. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose the judge thinks 

that a -- a defendant would benefit from a type of a 

vocational or educational training that may be available 

in prison but that is not available in -- on the outside 

in the particular community where this defendant

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think the court can still 

require the availability -- require that as a condition

or as probation; if the judge thinks that that's a 

really critical provision to have, and the judge can 

require the defendant -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, what if that's not -­

 MR. ROBERTS:  -- to reside in the 

appropriate place. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it's not available 

12 

in the community on the outside? 

13

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, then the judge would 

14 

have to decide whether moving from -- whether having the

defendant in a different location than the defendant 

ordinarily would be is worth providing that program.  I 

don't know that -- that there are such specialized 

programs that those things can't be accommodated as a 

general matter in -- in most communities -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that wouldn't affect 

the length of the sentence.  Are you talking about, say, 

can the judge prescribe that he be incarcerated in a 

particular facility? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  The judge cannot prescribe 

that he be incarcerated in a particular facility.  The

judge can make a recommendation for a particular 

facility, but the judge can require participation in a 

particular program on supervised release and residing in 

a particular area on supervised release or on probation. 

So a judge can, if the judge thinks it's important 

enough, address that situation if it would arise.  I'm 

not -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, can a judge who 

9 

believes a defendant is dangerous to the public and 

10

11 

12 

13 

14

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

thinks that that danger can't be abated without a drug 

treatment program, could the judge nevertheless under 

3553(a)(2)(C) say, because of the danger to the public, 

I'm going to lengthen the sentence? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And in the hopes that a 

drug rehabilitation program will be available?  I don't 

care if it is or it's not; this person's dangerous to 

the community otherwise? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think the judge can say that 

-- that this person needs to be in prison for this 

21 

amount of time to protect the public. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's different than 

what the judge did here, where he talked about, 

explicitly, on page 26, "it has to deter" -- the 

sentence has to deter criminal conduct by others, and it 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

has to protect the public from further crimes of the 

defendant, and the sentence -- that's a big factor here, 

given her failure to appear and what she did out on 

bail.

 So, if the sentence has a dual motive, is 

1

that okay? 

7

 MR. ROBERTS:  That is -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, I know that you're

-- there's -- there's an issue about whether this 

10

11

12

transcript can be read as a dual motive or not. 

 MR. ROBERTS:  Right. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But my question is, is a 

13 

dual-motive sentence permissible? 

14

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21

22

 MR. ROBERTS:  No, a dual-motive sentence -­

if one reason that the judge is selecting the term is to 

impose a sentence of imprisonment, that violates the 

prohibition.  However, if the sentence would have been 

the same otherwise, then that would be harmless error. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that what "dual 

motive" means?  Unless -­

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think -- yes.  We -­

words.  I would have picked the sentence anyway. 

24

 MR. ROBERTS:  We -- we think that -- that in 

this case the Petitioner won't be able to show plain

substantial rights on remand.

 Sentencing judges may consider needed 

correctional treatments in deciding both whether to 

imprison and for how long.  The Sentencing Reform Act 

rejected the rehabilitation model's unstructured 

sentencing procedures designed to confine every inmate 

indefinitely until a parole board found he had reformed 

himself. 

 It did not, however, forbid treatment 

programs targeting specific defendants' pathologies, 

such as the drug treatment at issue here.  The Act 

rejected one means of promoting rehabilitation that was 

bound up with indeterminate sentencing, not 

21 

rehabilitation itself. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I could follow your 

argument much better if the judge could say that this 

specialized program -- as I am making that a term of 

your incarceration.  The disturbing factor about your 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

argument is the judge can only recommend; the judge has 

no way of making sure that this person will be in prison 

longer and get the treatment the -- the judge wants, 

because the judge can't control where the person will 

serve her sentence and what treatment will be available 

6 

for her.

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, I don't believe 

that's a large concern for several reasons.  The first 

is this Residential Drug Abuse Program, RDAP, is given 

to 93 percent of eligible defendants.  The only reason 

Petitioner did not get it is because she affirmatively 

refused, said she was not interested. 

 The second point I would make is that if we 

14 

look at the legislative history, the Petitioner and the 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

government's reply brief say, well, this Act stripped 

judges of the power to do this.  The Senate report makes 

clear this was a simple administrative simplification 

designed to make it clear that the Bureau of Prisons 

ultimately controlled all of these things but that at 

the same time it was supposed to listen seriously to 

21 

judges' recommendations.  It was not -­

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wasn't there something -­

you responded that she didn't -- she said I'd rather 

not.  But wasn't there something about placing her 

with -- in the same facility as another inmate?  Wasn't 

28

that involved?

 MR. BIBAS:  There were two distinct issues 

here.  One was putting her in the particular prison that 

was named was not possible because she needed to be 

separated from another inmate.  The other is whether she 

could be put in a facility that had one of these 

programs.  About half of prisons -- Federal prisons do, 

and the reason she didn't get that was because she 

refused, she said she wasn't interested.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know why you 

consider that that solves your case, that that makes 

everything okay.  She refused it.  She would not have 

been able to refuse it had it been made a condition of 

her supervised release.  You either take the program or 

you go back to jail.  I mean, that's -- why is that an 

16 

insignificant difference? 

17

18 

19 

20

21

22

23

 The fact is the judge has no control over 

whether this person gets the rehabilitation that was 

supposedly the purpose of the -- of the extended prison 

term. 

 MR. BIBAS:  A couple of -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It makes no sense. 

 MR. BIBAS:  I just note, Your Honor, first 

24 

of all, the statute requires judges to make predictions 

25

about deterrence.  That is a forward-looking matter.

The fact that a judge must predict the future calls for 

appropriate skepticism and a statement of reasons in 

appellate review.  It does not mean that a judge may not 

consider deterrence because it's a speculative 

possibility. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're -- you're not 

responding to my point.  You're -- you're -- you're 

making a different point.  I'm saying that it's -- it -­

it -- it does not help your case that the reason she did 

not get the rehabilitative treatment that this judge 

wanted her to get was that she simply refused it.  Why 

does that help your case?  She couldn't have refused it 

if, as the other side says, had to be the case, he had 

imposed this rehabilitative measure as a portion of 

supervised release.  Then she would have had to take it. 

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor is correct that there 

is a contingency involved here, but the contingency 

involved is no greater than the contingency involved in 

other sentencing decisions judges must make and that is 

a reason for skepticism.  It doesn't imply that the Act 

21 

meant to disable judges from doing this. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bibas, I -- I -- I have 

to say I don't really understand the whole premise of 

your argument.  You're basically saying the judge cannot 

consider rehabilitation, but the judge can consider 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

educational programs, vocational programs, treatment 

programs, and so forth. 

 I think most people would think that all of 

4 

those things are rehabilitation, that there's nothing 

5

left over when you say that the judge can consider all 

6 

of those things. 

7

8 

9 

10

11

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, I don't believe you 

phrased correctly.  Our point is not that judges can't 

consider rehabilitation.  It is that judges may not use 

imprisonment as the means of promoting rehabilitation. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Well, I'll ask the 

12 

same question. 

13

14

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

 MR. BIBAS:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  You're saying they can 

consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence, they 

cannot consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence, 

but they can consider all these programs in imposing a 

sentence.  And I'm saying what's the difference between 

all these programs and rehabilitation?  Once you say 

they -- they can consider all these programs, what's 

21 

left over that they can't consider? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, I think the answer 

is clear if we look at the statutory text.  It's in 

Petitioner's brief, the blue brief at Appendix 2 and 

Appendix 3.  The contrast becomes clear if we look at 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

3553(a)(2)(D).  There were four simple purposes of 

punishment the judge must consider.  And (D) is not 

everything that was ever considered rehabilitation.  It 

is a specifically limited subset of rehabilitation.

 It must be needed, must be educational or 

vocational training, medical care or other correctional 

treatment, and it must be in the most effective manner. 

 So, judges may no longer rest on what Judge 

9 

Frankel and the -- the Senate decried as the eerie 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

nonsense that everyone can be rehabilitated simply by 

throwing them in prison or simply by having everybody 

going to social workers or classes, but because 

criminality is not a pathology that needs treatment. 

But he and the Senate report contrasted that with drug 

treatment, which is very different, because there's a 

diagnosed pathology, there is a criterion for success 

that's measurable, and there's a fixed limited time. 

 And that third point is crucial here, 

19 

because both Petitioner and the government in their 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

argument said that you can't keep someone in jail tied 

to completion of programs or keep them in until he has 

been rehabilitated through treatment.  The indeterminant 

aspect here was a crucial part of what Congress was 

targeting that's very different from -­

crucial provision of the statute.  Yes, you read the -­

the section entitled imposition of a sentence, but there 

is another provision in the statute which says 

imposition of a sentence of imprisonment.  You can 

indeed consider those factors in imposing the sentence, 

which includes probation, supervised release and any 

other matters.  But what -- what 3582(a) says is that 

the court in determining whether to impose a -- whether 

to impose a term of imprisonment as opposed to just 

parole or -- or supervised release, and if a term of 

imprisonment is to be imposed and determining the length 

of term shall consider the factors set forth in, that 

you mentioned in 3553(a) to the extent they are 

recognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate 

means of promoting correction and rehabilitation. 

 You have to reconcile the two sections.  And 

the way to reconcile them is to say that the former 

applies to sentencing in general but when you're dealing 

with the length of a sentence of imprisonment or whether 

there should be any imprisonment at all, you cannot 

21 

consider rehabilitation. 

22

23

 MR. BIBAS:  No, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know any other way 

24 

to read it.

25

 MR. BIBAS:  No, Your Honor.  The main clause 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

of 3582(a) says shall consider the factors set forth in 

3553(a).  It does not say (a)(2) -- (a), (a)(2)(B) and 

(a)(2)(C).  As the very next section of the sentencing 

format goes, 3583 says consider only these purposes, but 

3582 says consider all of these factors to the extent 

6 

they apply in a particular case.

 Now, the way Your Honor reads the 

recognizing clause is as if it said, except the court 

shall not consider in imposing or lengthening a sentence 

(a)(2)(D) or if it tracked the language of (a)(2)(D). 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I don't know what else 

recognizing that factor would consist of, except you 

won't use that factor in deciding imprisonment or length 

of term of imprisonment.

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, we've looked through 

the entire United States Code.  We have not found a 

single instance in which a recognizing clause is used to 

mean an exception -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you tell me what it 

means here, then.  What, he -- he should say, you know, 

I recognize that rehabilitation is not a -- an 

appropriate factor to take into account in determining 

the length of your sentence or the -- or whether you 

should go to jail at all.  That said, I'm going to send 

you to jail in order to rehabilitate you.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that all it means? 

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, a recognize -- we 

4 

found dozens of instances in the U.S. Code where 

5

6 

7 

8

recognizing introduces a statement of principle or 

policy or rationale.  Petitioner or the government cite 

no instances in which it's used to impose a flat ban. 

 What we point out is -- Justice Kennedy made 

9 

the point that logically there is a distinction between

the imprisonment and the treatment that occurs during 

the imprisonment.  And if it's recognizing that the 

imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting 

correction rehabilitation, that itself bans a 

penological policy that was known in our history and had 

been known into the 1970s. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the judge only has the 

power to impose imprisonment.  He does not have the 

empower to impose anything else during the imprisonment. 

I mean, what you're saying might make sense if indeed he 

could prescribe some treatment during imprisonment, but 

he can't.  There are prisons -- and why can't he, by the 

way?  Why has he been prevented from doing that, 

although he's allowed to do it during supervised 

release?  Does that make any sense, if indeed, as you 

say, he can take that into account in imprisonment?

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, judges in supervised 

release, it -- it -- it's hard to understand why in 

3583(e)(3) judges may consider rehabilitation in 

deciding whether to impose a term of imprisonment on 

resentencing, and we've been offered no logical 

explanation as to why that same logic Congress would 

have meant a flat ban here that it didn't spell out in 

an initial sentencing. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It -- it does seem to me 

that the principal trouble I have with your argument is 

that, as Justice Scalia mentioned, the judge can't be 

certain that the treatment will -- will be provided. 

And in an answer to an earlier question you said, well, 

90 percent of the time the judge's recommendation is 

followed, the program is -- is offered. 

 Suppose we're only 10 percent of the time? 

Suppose only 10 percent of the time could or did the 

Bureau of Prisons follow the judge's recommendation, 

wouldn't your interpretation of the statute then be very 

difficult to sustain? 

 MR. BIBAS:  Justice Kennedy, while I agree 

that the reliability of the prediction is an important 

factor, I think this is dealt with through the ordinary 

appellate review that this Court has fleshed out in 

Rita, Gall, and Kimbrough.  If there's 93 percent

likelihood, predictability, here, then the judge can 

give it a fair amount of weight as the judge can give a 

fair amount of weight to deterrence calculations.  If 

it's highly unpredictable, then the judge shouldn't be 

putting very much weight on that at all. 

 And I would point out particularly that if 

we look at those appellate review cases, it's very 

relevant that the judge here imposed a sentence within 

the range.  As Justice Sotomayor pointed out, there are 

multiple explanations going on here; the judge arrives 

at a sentence within the range.  It's hard to tell here 

that it's even a but-for cause versus just a hope. 

 The -- the thicket of issues that

appellate courts into in disentangling sentences that 

are otherwise reasonable, that are within the range that 

could have been justified any number of ways, counsels 

against requiring us to say one factor is categorically 

forbidden in the sentencing format.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bibas, just practically 

speaking what does this clause instruct a court not to 

do in your view? 

 MR. BIBAS:  It instructs a court to bear in 

24 

mind that simply locking someone in a cell away from his 

25

criminal associates, away from his pattern of life, is 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

not itself going to reform him.  We've been down that 

road. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, really who thought 

4 

that?  This was 1984.  When people talked about 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11

12 

13 

14 

15

rehabilitation, they were talking about drug programs, 

they were talking about education programs, they were 

talking about vocation programs.  They were not talking 

about some idea that had passed away long since, that 

just locking you in a cell was going to rehabilitate 

you. 

 MR. BIBAS:  A couple of responses that I 

think show that to be incorrect.  The first of these is 

most of the references in the Senate report are to just 

generic open-ended education, vocation, and counseling. 

We see maybe one reference to alcohol and drug treatment 

16 

in there. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

 The second of these is that idea of 

isolation, though it had diminished, was still alive in 

the 1970s.  There was a widely cited manual for judges, 

the "Guides for Sentencing" in 1974, that said that 

confinement, quote, "may be necessary to break criminal 

associations and in time to modify antisocial attitudes 

and tendencies." 

 My third point is this is not just about the 

substantive idea of rehabilitating.  The government and 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

Petitioner point out that there was a rehabilitation 

model, a procedural approach here that was bound up with 

that history of the penitentiary, and the approach was 

that, in the Senate report, the rehabilitation model 

ties prison release dates to successful completion of 

6 

programs.

 We don't have open-ended, unpredictable 

sentences any more.  The Sentencing Reform Act in 

multiple ways gets rid of that unpredictability -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But wouldn't your 

proposal lead to unevenness in sentencing?  If you -- if 

you're right, then this choice of extending a term to 

accommodate a drug program, that could be -- the judge 

would have the option.  I think nearly half of the 

people who are incarcerated have a drug addiction.  So 

one judge might say:  I'm not going to let that person 

out until they -- they should at least have a chance to 

get into this program.  And another will say:  I can't 

control that; I'm not going to subject -- you would be 

introducing that, just what the framers of the Reform 

Act were trying to get away from, that this swings from 

one judge to another, and you're dealing with almost 

half the prison population. 

 MR. BIBAS:  A couple of points.  One is, 

statistically I think the number is lower than you say. 

39

The RDAP program here requires 12 months before 

admission having a provable addiction or abuse, so it's 

about 30, 35 percent of inmates. 

 But granted that issue, that's why the 

Sentencing Reform Act requires statements of reasons, 

subject to appellate review.  If judges are varying 

widely, this Court's case law in Rita, Gall, and 

Kimbrough allows appellate courts to harmonize what 

they're doing.  If this judge had added 5 years to her 

sentence, this would be a different case.  Judge 

Franklin and others were concerned about sentences 

exceeding 5 years, open-ended, airy hopes that everyone 

will be cured of criminality. 

 We're talking about a sentence within the 

range, sentence that, if a few lines of the transcript 

had been whited out we wouldn't be here.  A judge could 

have reached the same sentence on a lot of different 

grounds.  And are we going to tell judges you can 

consider other things, but if you muse about this ground 

you can't offer a thoughtful, reasoned justification -­

21 

per se automatic reversal. 

22

23 

24 

25

 There are only a couple of places in the 

Sentencing Reform Act that have categorical bans and 

they don't read the way this one does.  The very next 

section in the Act, 3583(c) says:  "In considering a

supervised release sentence, a judge shall consider the 

factors in 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and 

(a)(2)(D). 

 It skips over retribution explicitly where 

Congress meant to omit it. 

 The other place in the Act where Congress 

explicitly banned the factor was in 28 U.S.C. 994(d). 

The commission, the sentencing commission, not a judge, 

shall ensure that the guidelines are entirely neutral 

with respect to race, sex, creed, national original, and 

socioeconomic status.  When Congress meant to ban 

something, even within the range, it spoke much more 

clearly.  What it did usually was it gave some guidance 

to the sentencing commission.  And section 994 has a 

number of places where the commission shall do this, the 

commission shall ensure that this is generally an 

appropriate or inappropriate. 

 But it left a range, and it simultaneously 

19 

said judges should individualize sentences within that 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

range.  991(b)(1)(B) says there are factors not 

adequately taken into account in the guidelines that can 

lead to aggravating or mitigating, and judges can also 

adjust sentences to individualize them within the range. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you articulate an 

interpretation of this provision that would guide 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

appellate review?  If rehabilitation can always be a 

factor, then when and how does a court of appeals 

determine whether a judge has abused his or her 

discretion?  You said 5 years, if the guideline range 

presumably is 24 months and the judge adds 5 years.  But 

6 

how do you define that? 

7

8 

9 

 The simple answer is if the judge is 

imposing the sentence because of rehabilitation, they 

can't do that.  Is that what you're arguing or are you 

10

arguing they can do it except within a range?  I'm not 

11 

quite sure I understand how far you're going. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 MR. BIBAS:  I understand, Justice Sotomayor. 

Our primary argument is that 3582's recognizing clause 

isn't about this at all.  This is dealt with by 

3553(a)(3)(D), what is it that's needed correctional 

treatment, and if it fits within (a)(2)(D), ordinary 

appellate review. 

 If the Court is not comfortable with that 

19 

and thinks that there ought to be more discouragement, 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

we do have a fallback argument that says that the Senate 

report talks about discouraging using this as the sole 

basis, right, but that if it's one of several factors, 

if it appears to be given a proper balanced weight, then 

there's no need to be so suspicious of it.  And indeed, 

when we look at the case law in the circuits -- and 

42

11 

12 

13

we've surveyed the most recent 150 or so cases on 

rehabilitation in the courts -- we see very rarely -­

first of all, we haven't found any cases where judges 

are putting someone into prison versus out based solely 

on this. 

 We find only a couple of cases where judges 

appear to be lengthening a sentence solely because of a 

desire to put someone into drug treatment.  Usually, 

what's happening is something like what happened here. 

The judge is balancing three or four factors; it's in 

the mix; the judge might well have gotten the same 

result anyway. 

 Are we going to forbid courts to have that 

14 

kind of reasoned, open review, subject to appellate

review, in order to ban something that isn't banned in 

the way that 994 bans race and sex or 3583 bans 

retribution?  It's simply not the way the statute words 

things elsewhere and it's not the wording Congress chose 

here, especially since this -- it's a subordinate 

clause, it's hidden, it's not at all clear in 

undercutting the main clause of 3582 in saying shall 

consider all the factors of punishment here to the 

extent they apply in an individual case. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I still find it hard, 

if I were going to write the opinion, to rule for your

position to ignore the 90 percent-10 percent 

hypothetical problem I have, to say, well now, 90 

percent of the time the judge's rules are going to be 

followed or the judge's recommendations are going to be 

followed.  That's an odd way to support the 

interpretation of the statute that we have to -- that we 

have to adopt in order to rule in your favor because, as 

I say, suppose his position, his recommendation, were 

followed only 10 percent of the time?

 MR. BIBAS:  Justice Kennedy, first of all, 

there are programs out there for which the judge's 

recommendation is a prerequisite and 100 percent of the 

people who get into the program are ones whom the judge 

recommended.  There are some drug education programs, I 

believe a mental health or sex offender program, where 

there's a link between those two.  It's just this 

particular program that we're talking about. 

 The second point is, as I said, one of the 

19 

explicit purposes of sentencing is deterrence.  A judge 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

can never guarantee that he's going to deter a 

particular offender from committing a crime in the 

future.  The judge has to make an educated prediction 

with the help of the probation or pretrial services 

officer's report, and that's subject to appellate 

review.  But the fact of the prediction, the fact of

uncertainty about whether someone will be deterred or 

not doesn't disable the judge from weighing that 

prediction. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If -- if it is as you say, 

why -- why did Congress leave it up to the Bureau of 

Prisons to decide whether this person can enter into a 

rehabilitation program, and not allow the judge to 

prescribe that the person will enter into it? 

 Why?  What -- what possible sense could that 

make? 

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, if you will bear 

with me for your colleagues who like legislative 

history, and I quote from the Senate report, that this 

change is designed only to simplify the administration 

of the prison system, at page 141 of the Senate report. 

It was not designed to introduce any substantive change 

in the role of judges or the Attorney General. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Judges can prescribe it? 

 MR. BIBAS:  No, the change was made -­

21 

change, they can't prescribe, right?

 MR. BIBAS:  Yes, it was, actually.

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, I believe that there 

were some legal issues that were coming up in litigation 

over prison conditions and sentencing in the years 

leading up to this Act, where there was unclarity as to 

whether the Attorney General or the judge or the Bureau 

of Prisons -- whose decision ultimately was being 

challenged in this litigation.  And the Act made that 

change, but it was designed only to simplify the 

administration.  It was not meant to say that judges 

therefore are cut out of the process, and unfortunately 

that's all that we know about that provision. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the Senate report 

24 

says that the provisions we've been talking about make 

25

clear a defendant should not be sent to prison only 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4

6

because the prison has a program that might be good for 

him.  Drug dependence in the committee's view generally 

should not play a role in the decision whether or not to 

incarcerate the offender.  Is there something that 

conflicts with that? 

 Because that was pretty clear indication of 

7 

the committee's view. 

8

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, the committee in 

9 

dealing with drug dependence said the commission shall

shall take it into account only to the extent that it is 

relevant; and the commission decided as with most of 

these other factors that drug dependence shall not be 

used ordinarily in sentencing outside the range, but 

left it to the judge to decide within the range. 

 As to your -- so judges have some 

flexibility in using drug dependence for 

within-guideline sentencing. 

 And then on your point about a person should 

not be sent to prison only because the prison has a -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You put a great deal of 

weight on the word only.  I guess if it's a dual motive 

we don't really know what would have happened in the 

absence of one of the motives.  So should we send the 

whole thing back for resentencing?

 MR. BIBAS:  No, I think this goes to Justice 

Sotomayor's question.  That very often these things are 

bound up and judge ought to be able to consider it in 

the mix, especially when it's not just a program that 

quote, "might" be good for him this -- this airy hope 

that everybody who has criminality can be cured -- but 

specifically there's a specific targeted program. 

 Particularly where, as here, Congress made a 

9 

point of approving of in-prison drug treatment as 

10

11 

12 

13

effective to reduce recidivism where we have a fixed 

term and a specific diagnosis that Congress has funded 

and encouraged with a 12-month sentence reduction. 

 If this Court has no further questions, the 

14 

statute allows judges to consider needed correctional 

15

treatment programs in prison sentencing.  The judgment 

16 

of the court of appeals should therefore be affirmed.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF REUBEN C. CAHN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. CAHN:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

 Let me begin with a couple points about the 

plain language of this statute.  When a defendant is 

sent to prison so that he can gain access to 

rehabilitative programs, imprisonment is used as a means 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company

12 

13

to promote rehabilitation.  Counsel stresses only the 

imprisonment portion of that sentence, but it is 

strictly speaking within the very prohibition that 

Congress has articulated.

 Beyond that I would point to 3553(a)(2)(D), 

and counsel has left off the last few words in 

discussing that purpose of sentencing that's set out 

there.  Congress required that these rehabilitative 

resources be provided in the most effective manner.  As 

is discussed in the brief, Congress had determined with 

regard to in-prison rehabilitation programs that they 

simply were not the most effective manner. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, this makes a 

14 

lot of sense when we're talking about huge disparities 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

in a guideline sentence, versus one where the judge goes 

outside the guidelines or imposes a greater sentence 

than otherwise the guidelines would determine for 

rehabilitation purposes. 

 But not infrequently guideline ranges are 

within very narrow scopes, and in fact there are some 

prison advantages that you get from being sentenced to a 

year and a day that you don't get if you're sentenced to 

12 months; and district courts routinely will choose 

between a year and a day or 12 months based on knowledge 

about what might be available if you're there for over a 

49

22 

23 

24 

25

 What would be the difference?  You see, I'm 

having a hard time in this case, because if a judge 

comes in and says guideline range is 50 to 60, I think 

in the middle is perfectly fine, I just don't know 

whether I should give him 54 or 55 months, but I know 

that at 55 months there's this kind of program 

available.  I'm going to do -- I'm going to -- you know, 

it is -- judging is not so precise that you know exactly 

where to go within the small ranges, and so there are 

many factors that influence that decision.  Why should 

we announce a rule that says to a judge in those 

situations, don't give him that extra month? 

 MR. CAHN:  Because Congress has prescribed 

it.  Because Congress made the choice that it shouldn't 

be allowed; and it may seem unreasonable to all of us, 

but Congress made a determination that it wasn't 

appropriate to lengthen these sentences or impose them 

for purposes of rehabilitation.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you arguing for 

something like a plain statement rule, if the judge says 

plainly, I'm increasing your sentence so you can get 

rehabilitation, then there's a problem?  Or would there 

possibly be situations in which one could infer that the 

desire to provide for rehabilitation in prison had

 MR. CAHN:  It's possible, but I think that 

this Court entrusts sentencing judges to follow its 

mandate, and if this Court says you're not to increase

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Bibas, you were appointed by this Court 

to brief and argue this case.  You have ably carried out 

that responsibility, for which the Court is grateful. 

 The case is submitted. 

 (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
