CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 00-8452, Daryl Renard Atkins v. Virginia. 


Mr. Ellis.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. ELLIS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. ELLIS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


In 1989, this Court, surveying the already


growing evidence from a variety of sources that the people


of this country oppose the execution of individuals with


mental retardation, observed that that growing sentiment


might some day be manifested in legislation, particularly


by the States, which this Court identified as the sort of


evidence upon which it typically can rely in Eighth


Amendment cases. 


The evidence is now clear that the American


people in every region of the country have reached a


consensus on that question.  By every measurement and


through a course of legislative enactments that is


literally unprecedented in the field of capital


punishment --


QUESTION:  What is your definition of a


consensus, Mr. Ellis?

 MR. ELLIS:  Mr. Chief Justice, the -- I would


define consensus -- and this Court had discussed it in


various terms in the cases, but I would distill from the


cases in which the Court has described it that it is when


the American people have reached a settled judgment based


on a --


QUESTION:  Yes, but I -- that's -- that's a


perfectly sound phrase, but how do we go about figuring


out when that occurs?  I mean, how many States must be on


a particular side?  Does the population make any


difference?  How about those factors? 


MR. ELLIS:  Your Honor, there -- there has never


been a suggestion by this Court that it differentiates


among States with regard to size, and yet obviously


logically if -- if a -- an -- if a collection of statutes


only was found in the smallest of the States or the States


of a single particular region, it would cut against the


evidence that there was a consensus.


QUESTION:  And -- and how many States out of the


50 do you need, do you think, for -- for a consensus?


MR. ELLIS:  This Court has never suggested that


there's a particular number in response to that.  And when


you look at the cases, both that have found a consensus


and that have not, they vary. 


QUESTION:  Well, but you're saying there is a

consensus.  So, you must have some figure that you're


submitting to us. 


MR. ELLIS:  I'm -- I'm not submitting on the


basis of a figure, Your Honor.  I'm suggesting that read


in their entirety, the Court's cases talking about


consensus seem closer to us to be a -- a totality of the


evidence test but with the requirement that that evidence


across the board have found expression unambiguously in


statutes.


QUESTION:  Should we not look at legislative


enactments as the surest indicator of what the view of the


-- the particular State is? 


MR. ELLIS:  Yes, Your Honor, I think that you


should, and I took that to be the -- the teaching of this


Court's opinion in the first Penry case. 


QUESTION:  And looking at that, where do we


stand today?  We have -- how many States have no death


penalty at all?  Is it 12?


MR. ELLIS:  It's roughly 12.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. ELLIS:  It in part depends on how Vermont is


counted, but -- but it --


QUESTION:  And how many States have now enacted


legislation providing that a retarded person may not


suffer the death penalty?

 MR. ELLIS:  There are now 18 States as compared


to the 2 that -- that were on the books or were about to


go on the books, in the case of Maryland, when this Court


decided the Penry case. 


QUESTION:  Of course, not -- not all of those 18


feel so strongly that it is unconstitutional to execute


someone with reduced mental capacity that they are willing


to apply that to people who've already been sentenced. 


How many of those 18 States have adopted that law only


prospectively?


MR. ELLIS:  A number of them.  Again, there's a


categorization --


QUESTION:  I think there's quite a few. 


MR. ELLIS:  We don't have a precise number.


QUESTION:  And that doesn't -- that doesn't


bespeak such a -- such a intransigent view that this is


unconstitutional.  I mean, you say, well, you know, we


won't do it in the future, but this person has already


been tried and convicted, you know, go ahead.  Does that


suggest to you that -- that I think it's really


unconstitutional or just that I think it's a good idea in


the future not to do it? 


MR. ELLIS:  I guess I would characterize,


Justice Scalia, the statutes not as having concluded that


the practice was unconstitutional, but instead that it was

unacceptable.  But that still leaves your point.


QUESTION:  Well, no, it doesn't.  It just says


it's not desirable.  That's all the statute suggests, it


seems to me.  And I -- I thought when you were talking


about a consensus, you're talking about a consensus that


something is so -- so terrible that it should not be


permitted.  And these States are permitting it.  They're


just not going to do it in the future. 


MR. ELLIS:  I -- I would respectfully suggest


that they have not reached that judgment.  In the bulk of


the States that have prospective only language, that is to


say, some kind of bar -- and it varies among the statutes


to looking backward to cases already decided.  In the bulk


of those cases, it was clear that there was no one with


mental retardation currently under sentence of death in


that State.  And so, passing a statute that would


encompass people on death row in that State would have


been unnecessary in the view of legislators and might


have --


that? 


QUESTION:  How do we know that?  How do we know


MR. ELLIS:  The -- the discussion in the -- in


State legislatures, there isn't legislative history in


quite the way there is in Congress.


QUESTION:  Pity.

 (Laughter.) 


MR. ELLIS:  I was going to say this must be a


source of substantial disappointment. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. ELLIS:  But -- but what -- what evidence we


have comes from recordings of the debates and, in


particular, journalistic accounts from -- from those


debates.  It -- it is clear from those that the -- that


the concern of treating differently people who have been


sentenced to death previously and those who would face a


capital trial prospectively was not a principal concern. 


And I'm trying to come up with a State in which it was


known that there was someone who had mental retardation on


death row.  The only State in which I might have reached


that conclusion, there had already been a judgment by


another court that the individual involved -- it was in


Arkansas -- didn't have mental retardation.


QUESTION:  Mr. Ellis, would you -- would you


agree -- you know, I'm not -- assuming I agree that --


that when there is a -- a new consensus that the


Constitution means something it didn't mean before the


Constitution means that new thing, assuming I agree with


that, you -- you must agree that -- that we have to be


very careful about finding new consensuses, don't you? 


Because we can't go back.

 I mean, if we find a consensus here that it is


indeed unconstitutional to execute the mentally retarded


and then it turns out that there are a lot of problems,


that indeed in every case, every capital case, there's


going to be a claim of mental retardation and people come


to believe that in many of these cases you get expert


witnesses -- you can easily get them on -- on both sides


-- people become dissatisfied with that.  We won't be able


to go back, will we?  Because the evidence of the


consensus is supposed to be legislation, and once we've


decided that you cannot legislate the execution of the


mentally retarded, there can't be any legislation that


enables us to go back.  So, we better be very careful


about the national consensus before we come to such a


judgment, don't you think?


MR. ELLIS:  I would agree with you, Justice


Scalia, that as the Court has said in various ways in


several of the cases that the -- that the proponents of


the view that there is a consensus bear an extraordinarily


heavy burden of demonstration.  But the particular


concerns that you raise about the possibility that


sentiment might especially in the -- in the presence of


experience enacting a statute swing the other way, while


theoretically possible, is not borne out by the experience


in the 18 States, but in particular in the States that

enacted some years ago.


QUESTION:  Well, but Justice Scalia's basic


premise that it's a one-way ratchet is correct.  Is it


not?


MR. ELLIS:  This Court has not had -- had


occasion to address that in particular.  The closest, I


suppose, that it has come is the Court confronting the


ambiguity with regard to the execution of individuals


below the age of 16 and -- and the presumption that the


Court reached in the face of that ambiguity. 


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Ellis, logically it has to


be a one-way ratchet.  Logically it has to be because a


consensus cannot be manifested.  States cannot


constitutionally pass any laws allowing the execution of


the mentally retarded once -- once we agree with you that


it's unconstitutional.  That is the end of it.  We will


never be able to go back because there will never be any


legislation that can reflect a changed consensus.


QUESTION:  Of course, isn't it true that every


new constitutional holding is a one-way ratchet in exactly


the same way? 


MR. ELLIS:  Not only in the area of the Eighth


Amendment but in others as well.  We could all imagine


ways in which dissatisfaction with the ruling might


manifest itself --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Ellis --


MR. ELLIS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- I guess there's no uniform


determination of when someone should be regarded as


mentally retarded.  The standards probably vary somewhat


from State to State, do they not? 


MR. ELLIS:  Justice O'Connor, they vary


remarkably little.  The definitions are not framed in


exactly identical forms because often States have adopted


the definition that they employ for disability benefits


purposes or guardianship purposes or commitment.


QUESTION:  I guess my point is even if this


Court were to say that it's unconstitutional to execute a


person who's mentally retarded, presumably it would still


be open to the State to determine whether that individual


is mentally retarded under the State's definition, or is


there some Federal definition you're asking us to employ?


MR. ELLIS:  It seems to me that the States would


be free to define mental retardation -- and, as I say,


many use the definition they already have, that their


clinicians are accustomed to -- so long as the definition


they chose carried with it the core principles of the


definition of mental retardation that this Court discussed


in Penry, that is to say, a measured intelligence in the


bottom 2 percent -- in the bottom 2-and-a-half percent of

the population or 2 standard deviations below the mean,


plus an impact on the real world functioning of the


individual and as --


QUESTION:  Well, this -- this actually links up


to the consensus problem if you take -- I don't think a


poll is relevant, but assuming you took a poll and since


you execute the retarded, I think most people would have


in -- in mind an image of mental retardation which doesn't


reflect the sophistication of the DSM which talks about


mild retardation and defines somebody who's mildly


retarded as educable with an IQ of maybe as high as -- in


that range of -- of 70 with -- with some -- with some room


for statistical error.  Do the States have some leeway in


defining retardation that's any different than what's in


the DSM?


MR. ELLIS:  With regard to -- with regard to


details, as I suggested a moment ago, there -- there is


room for some difference, but with regard to the core


principles, which I take to be at the center of -- of your


question, are we describing the same group of people --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. ELLIS:  -- what we've discovered in the


States is that they've all come to essentially the same


conclusion, which is all the people who fall within the


AAMR or DSM-IV-TR definition are the people that they

chose to protect.


And going to your earlier point about what


people know about the level of functioning of individuals


with mental retardation -- yes, Your Honor -- there --


other than parents -- parents I'd put aside -- there is, I


think, no group in this country more aware of the variety


among people with mental retardation and the levels of


functioning at each level than State legislators.


QUESTION:  This -- this goes to the -- where is


the burden of proof in a case like -- supposing your view


is adopted, the State charges capital murder.  Is the


burden of proof on the defendant to show that he's


retarded?


MR. ELLIS:  Yes, Your Honor.  Every State that


has enacted a statute has placed the burden on the


defendant, although they have done it in somewhat


different ways. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Ellis, what about this very case? 


There was some confusion, but the Virginia Supreme Court


seemed to doubt that this person would qualify as mentally


retarded.  If -- if you would prevail, wouldn't there have


to be a remand on that question? 


MR. ELLIS:  Obviously, in our -- we would not be


totally disappointed if this Court were to resolve that


question, but the -- the likelihood and prospect of a

remand obviously would be an appropriate response so that


the Virginia courts who did not, in this case, have before


them mental retardation as a legal question that was going


to decide anything -- it was simply an observation in the


course of making --


QUESTION:  Well, what precisely did the Virginia


Supreme Court say about this defendant and --


MR. ELLIS:  I -- I think maybe the -- the


Virginia Supreme Court's decision on that can be best


characterized as expressing concern as to whether or not


the individual -- in this case Mr. Atkins -- had mental


retardation because of the testimony of Dr. Samenow that


-- that suggested that there had not been a full


demonstration of the impact of his impairment in his life,


the second prong of the definition --


QUESTION:  Can you tell me --


QUESTION:  Mr. Ellis, apart from the consensus


argument and these details, what is the real reason behind


your position?  What's wrong with executing the mentally


retarded?


MR. ELLIS:  In our view, Your Honor, the people


with mental retardation who have both that intellectual


functioning as the core and it has manifested itself in


their life throughout their life -- those individuals in


our view lack the culpability or blame worthiness because

their understanding of their actions, their understanding


of the context in which their actions took place --


QUESTION:  Well, why are they subject to


criminal liability at all then? 


MR. ELLIS:  They are subject to criminal


liability because it isn't our contention that they, for


example, can't tell -- to use the -- the language in -- in


Virginia's defense of insanity, that they can't tell right


from wrong.  What we're suggesting -- so, we're not


suggesting they can't be punished.  What -- what we're --


what we are contending is that, though they can be


punished, the death penalty is different, and it is


reserved for those whose understanding is sufficiently


clear that the penalty of death can be appropriate. 


QUESTION:  So, nothing wrong with putting a


retarded person -- we know that there's a problem with


definition, but -- in -- in jail for life, solitary.  He


can exercise in a cage.


MR. ELLIS:  Nothing in the ruling that we seek


here would preclude the State from imposing the most


serious penalty it has other than the penalty of death. 


Most States do.  A number of the States that have passed


statutes have explicitly provided in those statutes that


an individual exempted from the death penalty by the


statute will be subjected to -- and then it explicitly

says, in some cases, life imprisonment without possibility


of parole, or whatever the heaviest penalty.


QUESTION:  Should the test be the same as for


executing someone with a mental illness?  We -- we have


dealt with that, and -- and with the level of


comprehension that someone must have in order to be


eligible for the death penalty who has mental illness. 


Should the test be the same? 


MR. ELLIS:  Your Honor, I believe you're


discussing the Ford issue with regard to competence to be


executed?  I read the Ford case as suggesting that whether


the individual had mental illness or mental retardation,


if -- if that individual lacked the understanding as


execution became imminent, that they -- that the State


would be precluded from executing.  This --


QUESTION:  So, is that test not adequate here in


your view? 


MR. ELLIS:  That test, it seems to me, is not


adequate for several reasons.  One is that the Ford


holding focuses on a defendant and -- and his mental state


late in the process, as -- as execution is impending.  The


mental retardation question, as addressed by the States in


-- in the years since Penry, focuses on the individual's


mental functioning at the time of the crime. 


QUESTION:  What -- what about our -- what about

our mental illness cases dealing with the time of the


crime?  Why aren't they sufficient to indeed excuse


somebody who couldn't help themselves?  You're saying


these people can help themselves.  They did know the


difference from right to wrong, but what?  They're --


they're slower than others and therefore shouldn't be


executed. 


MR. ELLIS:  Yes.  Their -- that their


understanding was, of necessity, limited by their mental


functioning.


QUESTION:  Their understanding -- I mean, they


have to have known that what they were doing is wrong.


MR. ELLIS:  In order to be convicted in any of


these States, yes. 


QUESTION:  So, isn't that the only thing that


bears upon culpability? 


MR. ELLIS:  It seems to me, Your Honor, that it


is not because -- because under our system of capital


punishment, as it has been shaped by the decisions by this


Court, we don't say that the death penalty is available


for everyone who can be punished.  The Court, through a


variety of mechanisms, including the mitigation system,


has said that among those who can be punished, some can be


punished by death and others not.  In a number of those


cases, this Court has reached categorical rules, which is

based upon the fact that some people are not as culpable.


Their crime was not as heinous and so forth.  You have to


narrow the category to those people who are really morally


reprehensible. 


I do not see the necessary connection between --


between intelligence and moral reprehensibility unless you


truly think that -- I guess the -- I guess the result of


your argument is that there -- that there is more crime


among -- among the mentally retarded because they don't


really understand the consequences of what they're doing. 


Is that a demonstrable proposition?  I don't think it is. 


MR. ELLIS:  It is not, and I think it's untrue.


QUESTION:  Yes, I think it's totally untrue. 


So, I don't --


MR. ELLIS:  So, what we're saying in -- in


response to -- to your question, what we are saying is


that a person who commits an act -- who has mental


retardation, who commits an act which is subject to


punishment, does so within the scope of the limitations


imposed by his disability.  And that may allow him to form


a criminal intent sufficient to satisfy the criminal law


for punishment in general, but in our view and now the


view of -- of the people of the States manifested in these

statutes and of the people manifested in the Congress,


those individuals who can be punished, as individuals


under the age of 16 can be punished, cannot be punished by


the penalty of death because, as this Court frequently


reminds, death is different, a different calculus, a


different set of concern.  The judgment by the people as


expressed in their legislatures has been these are


individuals for whom we do not want the death penalty


used.  It's not --


QUESTION:  And what is -- what is the reason?  I


mean, you -- you -- in responding to Justice Scalia's


question, you -- you point out, well, these people pass


the -- the test of -- of comprehension, which is a


condition of culpability for execution.  What test don't


they pass?  What is the reason for this emerging


consensus?


MR. ELLIS:  The principal reason -- and -- and


it has changed a little bit as -- as the -- as the process


has gone on.  The original and continuing principal reason


is that people, as expressed through the legislature, have


reached a judgment that someone whose intellect is at this


level and who has grown up with that limitation on their


ability to learn -- because age of onset is part of the


definition of mental retardation as well -- are not


individuals for whom death is an appropriate punishment.

 QUESTION:  No.  I realize that that's the


judgment they're reaching, and you want us to recognize


that judgment as now having constitutional significance. 


What I want to know is why are they reaching that


judgment?  What is the reason that elevates that judgment


to one of constitutional significance? 


I guess the -- the converse of my question is


we're not here simply to add up numbers and say, oh, when


it gets to 37, the result is different.  You're -- you're


asking us to make a different kind of -- of -- draw a


different kind of conclusion.  And what I want to know is


what is it behind the judgment of these emerging States as


a reason that should recommend itself to us? 


MR. ELLIS:  And -- and as I said, the principal


focus is on the understanding of people of what the


limitations imposed on people with mental retardation are


and how it affects their comprehension --


QUESTION:  They know it's wrong but they don't


appreciate how wrong it is? 


MR. ELLIS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  I mean, is that the idea?


MR. ELLIS:  It is -- it is that their


understanding of the wrongness of their action may be


incomplete and in a sense immature in the same way or in a


parallel way at least --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Ellis, I thought that you had


said something different in your brief, and it was that


people in this class have diminished capacity when it


comes to the life or death decision.  I thought you said


that they will be smiling in the -- and the jury will say,


well, how inappropriate.  They're not expressing any


remorse.  That they will not be able to communicate as


effectively with their -- their counsel.  That it's --


that it's the image of this person when the life/death


decision is made that they give false clues to the trier,


to the jury, and that will disable counsel from


representing such a person on that life/death decision. 


You haven't said anything like that in your oral argument.


MR. ELLIS:  And -- and that was the point I was


adverting -- was adverting to a moment ago, that the


principal reason is, as I've suggested, the shared


understanding of the diminished culpability of people with


mental retardation. 


But increasingly, especially in the last 3 or 4


years, there has been a second and secondary reason for


enactment of the statutes which is a growing concern that


individuals with mental retardation facing capital charges


present a particularly and uncomfortably large possibility


of wrongful conviction and thus wrongful execution.  The


-- the cases in both Virginia and in Illinois over the

last few years have made what I acknowledge is a secondary


argument but one which comes up in legislative discussions


with increasing frequency, that -- that in just the way


you were describing, that the process of adjudicating in a


capital case someone who has mental retardation and who's


understanding that -- is that limited may, through a


variety of mechanisms, increase the likelihood of wrongful


conviction and thus unjust execution. 


QUESTION:  Counsel is not able to bring that to


the jury's attention --


MR. ELLIS:  Counsel --


QUESTION:  -- and say, ladies and gentlemen of


the jury -- in fact, he can bring mental retardation to


the attention of the jury as a basis for the -- for the


jury's deciding not to execute the person, can he not?


MR. ELLIS:  He clearly can.


QUESTION:  There's no question that in all


States he can do that. 


MR. ELLIS:  That's right. 


QUESTION:  So, you're saying the jury is not


constitutionally even allowed to -- to be given the


option. 


And counsel can say to the jury, during this


trial, you -- you may see my client smiling inappropriate


at some points.  You should know that this is -- this is

because he's mentally retarded.  He really doesn't fully


comprehend what is going on here and I ask you not to take


his -- his reactions into account.  It seems to me that


would just reaffirm the -- the more he'd smile, the more a


-- the jury would say, boy, this -- this person really


shouldn't be executed.  He's not playing with a full deck,


or whatever. 


MR. ELLIS:  There may well be cases in which


that would be effective in guarding against that concern,


but that also backs into the problem this Court observed


in Penry, which is in a case-by-case determination,


particularly in cases in which juries are making the


decision, the mental retardation may in fact be a two-


edged sword, that the -- that the juror, in evaluating


whether or not to impose the penalty of death, may see


mental retardation not only as a mitigating or potentially


mitigating factor, but it may also see it as tied to


prospective dangerousness.  That issue is -- is present


everywhere it seems to me.  It is particularly present


in --


QUESTION:  Isn't it present in all cases of


mental illness as well? 


MR. ELLIS:  Is -- is the difficulty of case-by-


case?  Yes.  It --


QUESTION:  Your arguments seem to be equally

applicable to those who are mentally ill.  It's a two-


edged sword in effect. 


MR. ELLIS:  It is but unlike mental -- in the


case of the mental illness, unlike mental retardation,


there has not been a manifestation of a national


consensus, either in legislation or elsewhere, that


suggests the American people have rejected the notion.


QUESTION:  But the reasons you put forward to us


seem to me remarkably the same.


MR. ELLIS:  The -- the reasons that I've


offered --


QUESTION:  Am I right? 


MR. ELLIS:  -- would apply to other defendants


who don't have mental retardation.


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. ELLIS:  But -- but they are not so closely


tied to the defining characteristics of a class as they


are here to have produced that consensus. 


QUESTION:  All right.  So, come back and tell us


how we know when there's a consensus.


MR. ELLIS:  Your Honor, it seems to me that I


read this Court's cases as saying that they will -- that


the Court will look to -- that in prospective cases you


will look to a variety of forms of evidence, but that any


proffer of evidence of a consensus which does not have

substantial and in one case a discussion of recent


formulation of that consensus into enactments by the


legislature will be viewed with skepticism or impact --


QUESTION:  How many States still allow the


execution of retarded?


MR. ELLIS:  Theoretically there -- there could


be 20.  There -- there --


QUESTION:  In how many of those States have


there been executions of retarded people since Penry the


last 20 years?  I count two. 


MR. ELLIS:  We -- we cannot be sure but it is


roughly two or three, yes.


QUESTION:  So, you -- you have less -- less than


half of the States that have capital punishment make an


exception for the mentally retarded, and you say that that


constitutes a consensus.  Less than half.


MR. ELLIS:  Not by itself. 


QUESTION:  I can see the argument that there's a


consensus on the other side since the other side seems to


be in the majority, but you say less than half represents


a consensus.


MR. ELLIS:  I'm not sure that -- that we could


conclude, for example, that people in the States that


don't have the death penalty approve its imposition or if


they adopted a death penalty would include within the

scope of this --

QUESTION:  But you're saying 48 constituted a


consensus.


MR. ELLIS:  Well, that -- that is another way of


counting.  And I don't -- I don't want to slip into what


an amicus on the other side referred to as the counting of


noses.  This is a serious business, as this Court has


recognized, and the fact that the Court has not treated


large States differently from small suggests that the


Court is looking at these enactments not only to count up


the jurisdictions that have adopted it, but also to see


whether the process by which they have been enacted is


revealing of a settled moral judgment, in this case a


moral judgment of revulsion --


QUESTION:  Settled.  But we also said in Penry


that -- you know, the argument was made to us that there


was an emerging consensus, and we rejected that.  We said


an emerging consensus is not enough.  There has to be a


consensus.


MR. ELLIS:  And our position, on the basis of


what has happened in the 13 years since Penry, is that the


consensus that was then emerging is now manifest, both in


the legislation and in every other indicator we have of

I'll reserve --


QUESTION:  You're not talking about polls if


you're talking about public sentiment, are you? 


MR. ELLIS:  It seems to me, Your Honor, that --


that the polling information, which was quite scanty then


and is now quite full, as suggested in the AAMR amicus


brief in McCarver, is part of the picture. 


QUESTION:  Well, wouldn't you expect if people


feel that way, it would -- it would be manifested in


legislation?


MR. ELLIS:  And increasingly it is.


QUESTION:  Yes, but are you saying that somehow


polls are to be considered in addition to legislation? 


MR. ELLIS:  Polls, it seems to me, Your Honor


are a way of -- of viewing the legislation, of seeing


whether or not the consensus the legislation appears to


reveal is in fact --


QUESTION:  And I take it polls should be


admitted in -- if we're going to talk about polls as


contributing to this discussion, they should be admitted


in the trial court and subject to examination by the other


side.  Are any -- have any of yours done that?


MR. ELLIS:  I -- I don't believe -- I -- I'm


trying to think of a case in which polling has played a

QUESTION:  Very well. 


Ms. Rumpz.  Am I pronouncing your name


correctly?


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA A. RUMPZ


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. RUMPZ:  Yes.


Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


What is at stake here is this Court's long-


established jurisprudence of individualized sentencing in


matters of the death penalty.  Penry would have -- not


Penry.  I'm sorry.  Atkins would have this Court removed


from individualized sentencing one whole group of people


based upon one mere factor, and that is their alleged


mental retardation.


QUESTION:  Well, the position of the


Commonwealth of Virginia is that you can execute the


retarded.  Is that correct? 


MS. RUMPZ:  Yes, the retarded individuals who,


like Atkins, were found competent at the time of the


crime, competent at the time of -- to assist his lawyers,


who were found guilty of a premeditated, deliberated, and

calculated murder, and who --


QUESTION:  So, any person who has criminal


responsibility can be executed no matter how retarded they


are.  That's your position. 


MS. RUMPZ:  That is the position of the


Commonwealth of Virginia, yes.  And they -- of course, the


jury has to be instructed, in -- in keeping with Penry I,


about the mitigating value of the defendant's mental


retardation.


QUESTION:  You -- you would not say no matter


how retarded.  I mean, presumably there's some point at


which the retardation is so severe that the person does


not comprehend what he's doing. 


MS. RUMPZ:  Exactly, Your Honor, but if --


QUESTION:  But short of that, you're saying --


MS. RUMPZ:  But short of that, exactly.  But


the --


QUESTION:  Then --


MS. RUMPZ:  -- the DSM-TR -- IV-TR recognizes


four different categories of mental retardation.  As this


Court noted in Penry, the profoundly or severely retarded


are not likely to face the prospect of punishment, and


they're not really who we're arguing about here today. 


We're arguing --


QUESTION:  Well, why don't we say the same thing

then about -- about children, about young people?  So long


as the State can prove the premeditation, the


deliberation, the -- the other requirements of -- of


mental culpability, let them be executed.


MS. RUMPZ:  But this Court has said that about


16-year-olds in Stanford.


QUESTION:  Well, let's take 5-year-olds.  Would


-- would you argue that 5-year-olds should be executed if


-- if they have deliberated on -- on the act and -- and


otherwise the State can prove the -- the mental element?


MS. RUMPZ:  I think that that's -- that's


unlikely to happen.  But if -- if a person can deliberate


and premeditate and if a person can commit a brutal,


calculated, premeditated murder, and if a person is found


competent at the time he commits that murder and competent


to assist his lawyers at the time of the trial, then we're


not looking at somebody whose culpability is in any way


less than yours or mine. 


QUESTION:  Do you believe there is -- there is


any role at all in -- in the -- in Eighth Amendment


jurisprudence, death penalty jurisprudence I guess, for --


for general rules to the effect that, yes, there may in


some instances, let's say, of retardation be -- be proof


of -- that would at least be enough to get to a jury on


premeditation and -- and deliberation and so on, but that

the very fact of -- of retardation makes it unlikely in


most cases that this can be proven and makes the evidence


at least highly debatable, even in those cases that get to


a jury?  And therefore, the sensible thing to do in order


to avoid a high risk either of wrong conviction or in the


case of -- of the penalty phase a high risk of -- of


unsound judgments imposing the death penalty, there ought


to be a cutoff point of some sort.  There ought to be a


cutoff of the high risk cases from the general rules of


proof.  Do you -- do you take the position that there is


no place in -- in death penalty jurisprudence for that


kind of a -- we'll say a high risk cutoff rule?


MS. RUMPZ:  A high risk cutoff rule of?  I'm


sorry.  I didn't follow exactly what you were saying.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm -- I'm assuming that, sure,


there are cases of borderline retardation and so on in


which the -- there would be enough evidence to get to a


jury on the various mental elements for a -- for a capital


sentencing.  I'm also assuming that in cases of


retardation, including retardation near the borderline,


that that evidence is -- is highly debatable in most


cases, and it is sufficiently uncertain, it is


sufficiently debatable that there's a high risk that a


jury is going to come to the wrong conclusion.  It's going


to say, oh, yes, this person really is the worst of the

worst and sentence him in -- in a case in which that


really is not so. 


And the reason for having a rule saying, we're


going to have a -- a retardation cutoff -- a person who is


retarded will be ineligible for the death penalty -- is to


avoid those high risk cases and avoid the risk, in effect,


of wrong imposition of the death penalty.  That's why we


would have such a rule, quite apart from moral judgments


or anything else.  I'm just talking about this practical


risk judgment. 


And my question to you is, do you say that our


death penalty jurisprudence should have no place for such


a -- a risk assessment rule?


MS. RUMPZ:  That's what individualized


sentencing is.  That is the risk assessment rule.  That's


what juries --


QUESTION:  Well, it's -- its very clear that


within the category of those who ought to be subject to


the death penalty, there should be individual assessment. 


I'm asking whether you believe that in risky cases there


ought to be rules to eliminate the risk.  And I take it


your answer is yes, but I don't want to say that if -- if


I'm being unfair to -- to your position here.


MS. RUMPZ:  You know, I don't want to play dumb


here, Justice Souter, but I'm afraid I'm not understanding

what -- what you're asking me.  I think that the risk


assessments that you're talking about play into the -- the


concepts of individualized sentencing under the Eighth


Amendment.  The juries make those assessments.  The juries


determine whether someone is sufficiently culpable for the


death penalty and they determine whether his mental


retardation is a mitigating factor sufficient to outweigh


giving the -- the defendant the death penalty.


QUESTION:  Let's assume, because I'd like to get


the answer to Justice Souter's question myself -- let's


assume.  You may disagree with it. 


MS. RUMPZ:  Okay. 


QUESTION:  Let's assume that there's a higher


risk of inaccurate determinations by a jury, both for


guilt and -- and penalty, when the person is retarded. 


Let's assume that.  You may disagree with that, but let's


assume it. 


MS. RUMPZ:  Okay, I'll assume that. 


QUESTION:  Justice -- Justice Souter asked the


question, if there is that risk, is there a place in our


Eighth Amendment jurisprudence for us to take account of


that risk and draw some lines?


MS. RUMPZ:  No.  I -- I think -- if I understand


what you're asking is -- is -- does the Eighth Amendment


provide exemption from the death penalty to a class of

persons who may be at a greater risk for an inappropriate


death sentence?  I don't think the Eighth Amendment plays


into -- that's what the Eighth Amendment sets up


individualized consideration and individualized sentencing


for. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Rumpz, I -- it's a hard question


to answer because I guess you -- you would need a


definition of what constitutes an inappropriate or


improper death penalty, and we haven't -- we haven't


established any guidelines.  We have said you must leave


it to the jury to take into account all mitigating


factors.  Whatever the jury considers mitigating it may


allow.  In such a scheme, I don't know -- it is


meaningless to talk about an inappropriate death -- death


sentence.  There are no criteria.  It's up to the jury. 


Whatever the jury considers mitigating it may allow. 


And --


MS. RUMPZ:  Exactly.


QUESTION:  I guess you're talking --


QUESTION:  There -- there is not a proper or an


improper death -- death sentence.


QUESTION:  I guess you're talking about a class


of -- you said this class of people -- and I'm not sure


you meant that -- is no less culpable than you or me.  But


I thought the class of people we're talking about is a

class of people that might simply barely understand what's


going on.  Barely.  So, they know right from wrong, but


they can't understand anything complicated.  They have a


hard time functioning.  Their emotions are no more


different than yours nor mine, than anybody's.  So, they


feel things strongly.  But they won't take in the nature


of the punishment, in all likelihood, and they're quite


capable of following the leader, whoever is the leader


nearby.  And therefore, this class of people is different


enough than you, than me, that we wouldn't say they are


similarly culpable.  And I guess in 48 of the 50 States,


people have reached that conclusion.


All right.  Now -- now, that's I take this case. 


And I say 48 because I want you to disagree with me so we


can then explore that. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  But I thought that that was -- I


mean, there's an argument --


MS. RUMPZ:  I'll be --


QUESTION:  But I want you to address, A, I've


tried to make a point maybe they are not so culpable as


you or me.  And second, an awful lot of people in the


United States seem to agree with that.  In fact, I -- now,


those are the two things I want you to address. 


MS. RUMPZ:  Well, first of all, I think this

case is a perfect illustration of the first point, the


first point being that -- that they are.  If you are found


competent to stand trial and competent to assist your


lawyers, you are like you and me.  Daryl Atkins had a


perfect understanding of the system, knew all about


mitigation evidence, recommended witnesses to testify in


mitigation, was competent to assist his lawyers, said he


wanted his retardation put in front of the jury if it


helped him.  He had no deficits in understanding the


system. 


Moving on to the second point, 18 of the 38


death penalty States have formed or have enacted some sort


-- excuse me -- some sort of laws prohibiting execution of


the mentally retarded.  The Commonwealth's position,


however, is that that 18 is -- is not written in stone


because many of the statutes don't provide for retroactive


application.  So, you're looking --


QUESTION:  There was a time -- there was a


time --


QUESTION:  The -- the question I have on that is


you want to say less than 18.


MS. RUMPZ:  I -- I sure do.


QUESTION:  I want to know why not far more than


18, and my reason for that is that in -- of the remaining


20 -- there are two States that have executed retarded

people, and they account, I gather, for about 7 percent of


the population.  But in the remaining States that haven't


passed this law yet, why would someone feel a need to pass


it? 


I noticed, which I copied here, that the


Governor of Texas said, I am -- I am going to veto this


law because we do not execute mentally retarded murderers


today.  Now -- now, he might have been wrong about that in


Texas.  I don't know.  But regardless, why would a State


that never even has executions, but they have it on the


books, feel constrained to pass a law?


MS. RUMPZ:  Well, I -- I think that -- that the


fact that 18 States have done so in the last 13 years --


it doesn't mean that that --


QUESTION:  Presumably those States were


executing a lot of retarded people, and that's why the


laws were passed. 


MS. RUMPZ:  Well, that's an equally good


assumption. 


QUESTION:  Well, I assume -- an even simpler


assumption is that they were executing people. 


Let me ask you a kind of a -- a specific example


of Justice Breyer's question.  In -- in your calculation,


how do you account for the -- for a State like the one


that I come from that has not executed somebody in over 60

years?  Do you say, well, that's a State that apparently


approves of executing the retarded?  Do you say that's a


State that shouldn't be counted at all?  How do you


account for that in your calculus?


MS. RUMPZ:  I don't know what State you come


from, first of all. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  I'm from -- I'm from New Hampshire,


and the last execution was in '38 or '39.


MS. RUMPZ:  I guess my answer to that is that


this Court has said that societal consensuses are formed,


and when you're looking to see whether there is a societal


consensus, you look to the statutes that the -- that the


legislators have passed. 


QUESTION:  But that's what we're asking about,


and Justice Breyer's question, as well as Justice


Souter's, is -- I think must recognize the premise that


one of the great facts of life in American Government is


legislative inertia.  Legislatures don't act unless


they're prompted to do so.  And a legislature is not going


to just sit down and say, oh, I think it's a good time for


us to pass a -- a bill on -- against executing the


mentally retarded if there's no such person on death row. 


Legislatures just don't operate that way. 


MS. RUMPZ:  Or there's no such person -- person

on death row who was not competent to -- to commit his


crime, was not competent at the time of his trial, was not


competent to assist his lawyers.  There's a difference


there.


QUESTION:  What -- what do we know, Ms. Rumpz,


about the situation in the States, the 18 States which


have prohibited the execution of the retarded?  Had they


just gone through a tremendous number of retarded


executions? 


MS. RUMPZ:  I suspect not. 


QUESTION:  Do we -- is there any -- anything in


the briefs that indicates why these States passed the


legislation that they did? 


MS. RUMPZ:  No, there's not.  And -- and I can


speculate that it's a pretty pro -- anti-death penalty


machine out there working, but --


QUESTION:  Justice Breyer says only two mentally


retarded people have been executed in -- in the last I


don't know what.  So, that couldn't explain these 18


States.  So, maybe legislatures do enact laws because they


think they're good laws to enact, and maybe that's why the


18 did it. 


QUESTION:  No, no.  I said two in -- two, but it


may be a few more.  That's what I'm not -- in two States


in those States that haven't enacted the laws.  Of course,

the ones that have enacted the laws don't have the


executions, and some of them did execute mentally retarded


people before they passed the law.


MS. RUMPZ:  Well, the Federal Death Penalty


Information Center, if you get on their web site, says


that since Penry was decided in 1989, 25 mentally


retarded --


QUESTION:  We've gone through those and -- and


tried bit by bit, and most of them are in these States and


then some of them are -- have IQ's of 70 or over.  And I


would say in that -- they're -- they're erring on the side


of counting mentally retarded.  But if you draw the line


at 70, look below it, you get to the numbers I had. 


I'm looking to you for giving me the good


numbers and -- and the lawyers.  That's why I -- I figured


it out it was two States, but I'm not certain.


MS. RUMPZ:  I -- I think just because two States


in -- in -- since 1989 have executed mentally retarded


offenders doesn't mean that there aren't mentally retarded


offenders in the pipeline waiting to be -- to become


executed or waiting to go through their appellate process


or -- or coming up to trial.  You know and I know that


this is a very slow process.  These cases drag on for


years and years, decades.  And -- and when you look to a


number like that, you necessarily have to figure in all --

 QUESTION:  Leave it at this, that since Penry --


Penry.  There's no consensus.  Since Penry, 18 States have


said by law, no.  And in the remaining States, we're


pretty sure that two of them, accounting for about 7


percent of the population, have executed mentally retarded


people and maybe double that if you want, triple it.  Say


there are 14 percent, 20 percent.  Still, isn't that a


consensus?  Why not? 


MS. RUMPZ:  Well, I -- I guess I'd go back to


what Justice Scalia said in one of his opinions is that


that may very well just be that juries and prosecutors and


society believes that the death penalty ought to be


imposed on the mentally retarded less often.


QUESTION:  Ms. Rumpz, if we stayed just with the


18 plus the 12 that don't have the death penalty, then we


get up to what? 


MS. RUMPZ:  30. 


QUESTION:  Three-fifths of all the States.  We


get enough to, for example, block a filibuster in the


Senate.  That's a super majority.  Why isn't that -- why


doesn't that suffice?


MS. RUMPZ:  For two reasons.  First of all, I


don't think you can count 18 as 18 because in some of


those States, you can execute the mentally retarded.


QUESTION:  Now, there was a time in this Court


41

-- it wasn't all that long ago -- when this Court was


making prospective declarations of unconstitutionality,


this case and all future cases, not past cases.  Maybe the


States that haven't made it retroactive haven't gotten up


to speed on that once it's -- once we make a declaration


of unconstitutionality, it's retrospective.


MS. RUMPZ:  Even given that, New York has in its


statute specifically that people who commit murders, while


in prison, can be executed even if they're mentally


retarded.  So, you have to take New York from the list. 


Mentally retarded offenders can be executed in New York.


Second of all, I don't think you can add the 12


non-death penalty States and -- to -- to a number of death


penalty States to try to form a societal consensus.


QUESTION:  Why not?


MS. RUMPZ:  Well, because they may have some


bearing on whether there's a consensus against the death


penalty altogether. 


QUESTION:  Right, and it includes that.  I can't


imagine that you would say you couldn't count those


States.


MS. RUMPZ:  Well, Wisconsin tomorrow may decide


to adopt a death penalty statute, and if they do, they'll


have to affirmatively legislate a number of things. 


They'll have to pick an age where it can be imposed.

They'll have to decide whether they're weighing or non-


weighing.  They'll have to decide whether they're going to


have a provision to execute the mentally retarded.  All of


those things have to be considered by the State


legislature, and I don't think we can presume --


QUESTION:  Let me try this another way.  Do you


-- do you concede that if there is a consensus, whatever


that means, then this Court should make the determination


that we're asked to make here? 


MS. RUMPZ:  No.


QUESTION:  You don't agree that if there's a


consensus, then the Eighth Amendment would bar it.


MS. RUMPZ:  No.  And -- and I think that --


QUESTION:  This Court said that might, indeed,


be the law in Penry, but you say we were wrong there.


MS. RUMPZ:  No.  I -- I refer the Court to


Spaziano v. Florida where the -- where the Court said you


don't just nose count.  You -- you have to look at the


whole -- the whole picture, and just because sister States


decide to do one thing or not do other things doesn't


necessarily bind the -- the -- this Court and the other


States. 


QUESTION:  But you do not even accept the notion


that if there is a consensus and we find there is, that


that answers the question.  I take it you do not accept

that.


MS. RUMPZ:  I think that Spaziano says


different. 


QUESTION:  Well, do you accept the view that


there is in fact an evolutionary element in Eighth


Amendment jurisprudence, that in fact it does change as --


as societal notions of reasonableness in terms of cruelty


change? 


MS. RUMPZ:  Well, this Court has said that there


-- that there is. 


QUESTION:  That's the answer.  You don't have to


agree with it.  The Court said that.  That's the position


I'm in too. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  So, you -- you accept that as the


framework that we are supposed to be working in.  You


submit your case on the basis of that framework.


MS. RUMPZ:  That's what -- that's what this


Court said in Penry. 


QUESTION:  May I ask another question on a


little different line?  I think there's been sort of a


consensus in the argument here that the number of


executions of the mentally retarded is rather small.


MS. RUMPZ:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And does not that reflect the fact

that juries generally are reluctant to execute the


mentally retarded, to impose the death penalty on the


mentally retarded?


MS. RUMPZ:  I -- I don't know that that reflects


that.  That -- that could reflect a number of things. 


That could -- that could reflect mitigation versus non-


mitigation.  It could reflect -- the brief of the --


QUESTION:  Well, if -- if it is true, isn't --


is that not one of the facts on which the Court relied in


the rape case, holding that the crime of rape could not be


-- command the death penalty?


MS. RUMPZ:  Exactly.  This Court looks at the


laws and the application of the laws.


QUESTION:  And the -- and the number of juries


that refuse to impose the death penalty.  And so, that's


part of the consensus is what the juries have done as well


as what State legislatures have done.  Is that not right? 


MS. RUMPZ:  That is exactly right.  But I don't


think that you can infer that because there are X many of


-- of juries who have given sentences to mentally retarded


that that means juries are -- are reluctant to do it.


QUESTION:  There are very few executions of


women in the United States.  There have been for many


years.  Do you think we should make an exception to the


death penalty for women?

 MS. RUMPZ:  Absolutely not.


QUESTION:  Because juries so rarely impose it?


QUESTION:  No, but it is -- it is part of our


law.  And I read you a sentence out of Coker against


Georgia.  It is true that in the vast majority of cases,


at least 9 out of 10, juries have not imposed the death


sentence.  And that was one of the reasons why the Court


held that the death sentence was unconstitutional.  Is


that not correct?


MS. RUMPZ:  Well, I think that the fact that


we're here arguing this case today is proof that juries


do, in fact, give the death penalty to mentally retarded


people.  They -- they gave it -- the Commonwealth's brief


is -- is -- got two or three pages of cases where --


QUESTION:  No.  The point isn't that they never


do.  It's the point that they rarely do. 


MS. RUMPZ:  And the fact that they rarely do,


like I said earlier, could mean that juries believe, just


as Atkins' team believes, that it -- that it should be


rarely imposed. 


QUESTION:  Well, it -- it also may represent a


jury's belief that it is a mitigating circumstance of such


force that they should be spared the death penalty.


QUESTION:  Of course. 


MS. RUMPZ:  And I agree.  And in this case, the

jury was specifically told about Atkins' mental


retardation.  Two doctors testified about it at length,


and two different sentencing juries, after hearing from


Atkins' expert witness, and after hearing the vile nature


of his crime and about his 25 prior felonies, 24 jurors


gave him the death sentence. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Rumpz, in making this cruel and


unusual decision -- this is an issue that's come up


before, but does what the rest of the world think about


executing the mentally retarded -- should that have any


relevance at all?  I mean, we have, since the time we said


we don't look to the rest of the world, been supporters of


international human rights tribunals in -- for the former


Yugoslavia, for the former Rwanda.  But is it still, would


you say, just irrelevant that most of the rest of the


world thinks that mentally retarded people -- because it's


inhuman to execute them? 


MS. RUMPZ:  This Court has said previously that


the notions of other countries and the notions of other


lands cannot play the deciding factor in what --


QUESTION:  Not deciding.  I asked you if it was


relevant. 


MS. RUMPZ:  Well, it is relevant in -- as


Justice Scalia said in one of his opinions, to determine


whether our practice is a historical accident or not.  But

it certainly is not relevant in deciding the Eighth

European Union? 


MS. RUMPZ:  Most of the --

penalty --

MS. RUMPZ:  It's not dispositive, and it is


relevant once the Eighth Amendment principle has already


been established.  It's not relevant in establishing


whether something is cruel and unusual. 


QUESTION:  Why do you need it after it's been


established? 


QUESTION:  You don't. 


MS. RUMPZ:  You don't.  You -- you look -- you


look after the fact to see whether -- I guess my answer I

guess is it's not relevant.

QUESTION:  I was going to -- I did not have a


chance to ask petitioner's counsel because his rebuttal


time was running up, but it's important to me.  Mentally


retarded people constitute about 1 percent of the general


population.  I've looked through the briefs and just could


not find -- are there any statistics that you know that


tell us what the prison population percentage of mentally


retarded people are?  What is the mentally retarded


population of the criminal system generally?  Do you know?


MS. RUMPZ:  I don't know, and it -- there --


QUESTION:  Would it be the same as the general


population or higher?

know and it's not in this record what the -- what the


prison population of mentally retarded people --


QUESTION:  What is the status of the legislation


in Virginia on this point now?

other?

Virginia.  Passed the Senate, didn't get out of the House.

as the earlier argument or the earlier comments were, the


Court needs to recognize as, Justice O'Connor, you


recognized in Thompson and, Justice Scalia, you mentioned


today, any decision this Court makes regarding this issue


is irreversible.  It is likely irreversible. 


These States who have enacted these laws, these


18 States that have enacted these laws, the longest one


has been on the books for 13 years.  Some of them have


been on the books for less than a year.  On average,


they've been on the books for an average of 5 years. 


Well, a national consensus has to be broad,


clear, and enduring.  Certainly statutes with an average


age of 5 years don't establish an enduring national


consensus against something.  That's a blip in the radar


screen of public opinion, or to borrow from Justice

Scalia, it's a pendulum swing in public opinion.  Now,


these State legislatures may decide in 2 years --


QUESTION:  How can you say it's a pendulum swing


when it's all in the same direction?  I thought a pendulum


went back and forth. 


(Laughter.)


MS. RUMPZ:  It's a pendulum swing one way. 


QUESTION:  It only goes in one direction at a


time, doesn't it? 


(Laughter.) 


MS. RUMPZ:  But -- but my point is this practice


has been allowed since the Bill of Rights was adopted in


1789, and we have 18 States, some of which can't decide in


between themselves whether the mentally retarded should or


shouldn't be executed, with an average age of 5 years. 


Now, certainly 5 years is insufficient to determine


whether there is an enduring national consensus against


something.  These States, as somebody recognized here


earlier, may determine in 2 or 3 years that this is an


experiment that just didn't work. 


QUESTION:  Well, do you accept that there's a


consensus and want to argue it's just not enduring?  Or


what is it you're arguing? 


MS. RUMPZ:  No.  I -- I think there's not a


consensus, first of all, and my backup position is if

there is a consensus, it certainly isn't one of an


enduring nature.  I don't think 18, even if you say all 18


of the States and ignore the retrospective/prospective --


I don't know 18 out of 38 is a consensus.  It's not even a


majority, let alone a consensus. 


But even putting aside that for the matter, you


-- even if you put that aside, we don't anything that's


enduring.  We don't have anything that shows that the


long-term public opinion is against execution of the


mentally retarded.  We have a blip in the radar screen of


public opinion which may change in 2 years.  It may change


in 3 years. 


If Osama bin Laden was brought back to the


United States tomorrow, found to be mentally retarded and


not being able to -- to be executed, public opinion would


change, and there would be -- the blip in the radar screen


would go away and the public opinion would be something


different.  But if this Court were to constitutionalize


the prohibition, the public wouldn't have any opportunity


to change their mind.


And as this Court has said before, the States


are laboratories.  The States are laboratories for novel


social experimentation.  Well, this experiment is just


beginning.  This Court -- this -- there's -- there's --


this Court should not call a halt to an experiment that

has been on average for 5 years, especially when, as


Justice O'Connor, you recognized in -- in Thompson, that


halt could be irreversible. 


And if there are no further questions. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Rumpz. 


Mr. Ellis, you have a little less than a minute


left. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. ELLIS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. ELLIS:  I'll endeavor to answer a couple of


the questions that this Court has raised.


First, with regard to Justice Kennedy's question


about prison population, we don't have a reliable


statistic.  There is some indication, especially for very


low level crimes, that there may be a higher level of


people with mental retardation than in the general


population. 


With regard to the States, Spaziano, it seems to


me is a very important case here because it says we're not


simply counting up States.  We're seeing whether the


States have reached a moral judgment, have reached a


conclusion that the -- in this case, the understanding of


people with mental retardation, their ability to control


their behavior, their understanding of the context in


which they behave, the maturity and responsibility with


53

which they reach moral judgments is -- makes the death


penalty unacceptable. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Ellis.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:28 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
