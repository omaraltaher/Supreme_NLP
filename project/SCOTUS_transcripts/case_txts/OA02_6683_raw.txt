CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-6683, Hernan O'Ryan Castro v. the United


States. 


Mr. Frick.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL G. FRICK


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. FRICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


In holding that Hernan O'Ryan Castro's first


titled 28 U.S.C., section 2255 petition was second or


successive under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death


Penalty Act of 1996, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals 

has placed itself in conflict with every other court of


appeals circuit in the United States, save the Fifth, in


how they view or treat the impact of a prior post-


conviction motion which has been sua sponte re-


characterized or treated as a 2255 petition by the


district court. 


QUESTION:  Is recharacterization pretty much of


a judge-made thing?  There's -- there's no statute that


provides for it, is there?


MR. FRICK:  That is absolutely correct.  It is a


judge-made -- it is a judge-made thing.  It is something

that has been -- that has grown up among the courts in an


attempt to save what would otherwise be generally in the


case of a pro se prisoner, a facially deficient or an


ineptly pleaded document, and by recharacterizing it, it's


trying to take substance and putting into form so that the


court can actually rule on the substance of the particular


motion that was pleaded.


QUESTION:  Well, what's the difference in the


two?  I'm -- I'm the trial judge and I receive a motion


under rule 33 that's within the time limits under rule 33.


MR. FRICK:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  When do I recharacterize it?


MR. FRICK:  Justice Kennedy, at the present time


recharacterization in our opinion should only be done at 

such time as the court determines that there is absolutely


no viable way that it's going to be able to take the


document as pleaded under the title that it's given to the


court and effectuate a remedy therefrom. 


Now, it is our contention that, as in the Adams


and Miller cases from the Second and Third Circuits, that


at the present time, under the restrictions of the AEDPA,


that a recharacterization should never take place by a


court unless there is concurrence on the part of the


petitioner himself and he's given the --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I understand that -- that

argument of yours.


MR. FRICK:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  But what I'm asking is what is --


what factors does the judge take into account or should


take into account when he or she is asked to


recharacterize the motion?  I -- I get -- I'm the trial


judge.  I get a rule 33 motion, which is within the time


limits, and then the Government or -- says, now you should


recharacterize.  What -- what are factors that I consider


when I recharacterize?  You -- you indicate that you


should never recharacterize unless you have to for some


reason?


MR. FRICK:  Yes, sir, and I do not believe that


it is the Government's part to ask the court to 

recharacterize something. 


QUESTION:  Is there any authority for that?  If


-- if I wanted to go look in -- in some manual or --


MR. FRICK:  No, Your Honor.  There --


QUESTION:  -- some practice book to know when I


can recharacterize, when I can't?


MR. FRICK:  No, Your Honor, but the D.C. Circuit


-- but first of all, all of the cases that we have cited


except for the Eleventh Circuit and the Fifth Circuit have


addressed issues, have addressed circumstances under which


recharacterization was done of certain motions that were

pleaded in order to help ostensibly the individual who


pled the motion.


QUESTION:  But here the Government and the trial


court the first time around just said they would have no


objection, didn't they, having treated it as a 2254?  They


didn't urge that it be recharacterized, the rule 33


motion.


MR. FRICK:  No, they did not ask that it be


recharacterized, Your Honor.  What they said is that they


had no objection to it being considered as also seeking


relief under 2255.  But my client, Mr. Castro, had


presented to the court, unlike in virtually all of the


other cases in the other circuits -- and this is one of


the points that makes this such a strong case for Mr. 

Castro -- his rule 33 motion was absolutely correct in all


respects insofar as seeking the remedy that he did.


The Eleventh Circuit's initial opinion in this


case, in fact, recognized the opinion that it later


vacated sua sponte -- actually recognized the fact that he


had brought a proper rule 33 motion under -- under Brady.


QUESTION:  And when you say a proper rule 33


motion, you don't necessarily mean one on which relief


will be granted I take it.


MR. FRICK:  No, Your Honor.  It is, nonetheless,


a motion that does not require recharacterization in order

for the court to get to the merits of the issue presented.


The district court --


QUESTION:  It was the Government who intruded


2255 into this case.  The district judge didn't suggest


it.  The prisoner, who never appeared before the court,


certainly didn't suggest it.  2255, as I understand, was


first uttered by the Government in -- in its pleading to


the court.


MR. FRICK:  That's absolutely correct, Justice


Ginsburg, and the court -- the district court's order,


interestingly enough, starts out by saying we have before


us Hernan O'Ryan Castro's motion for a new trial under


rule 33, and then it ends in conclusion by stating for the


above reasons, we deny Hernan O'Ryan Castro's rule 33 

motion for new trial.  It is only in the body of the


opinion itself that there is reference to the Government


having requested that it also be considered as requesting


relief under 2255 and that they would, therefore, take


that consideration. 


QUESTION:  Well, let's get exactly straight what


the Government said because I had thought the Government


said it have -- it would have no objection.  Now, you're


saying the Government requested.  Those are two different


things.


MR. FRICK:  Your Honor, if I stated that, I'm

incorrect.  The Government suggested -- the Government


stated that it had no objection, as Your -- as Your Honor


has stated.  It had no objection to it being so


characterized. 


QUESTION:  But no one had proposed it other than


the Government. 


MR. FRICK:  That's correct.  Not up until that


point in time, there had been no suggestion whatsoever of


2255 --


QUESTION:  And the Government was -- I take it,


was intending to be helpful.  They thought that 2255 was a


better rubric.  Why I don't know.  It isn't clear even


now.  The -- the district judge in the end I -- didn't he


say I'll treat it as both?


MR. FRICK:  Yes, Your Honor.  He -- he said that


he would treat it as seeking relief under both rule 33 and


2255.  Mr. Castro, in his brief in response to the


Government's brief, stated that I didn't file a -- a 2255


and I object to it being characterized or considered as


seeking relief under 2255.  But there was no argument on


the point, and it was never anything that -- where


argument was presented other than through the briefs on


that issue.


QUESTION:  And what -- at what point did Mr.


Castro get representation?  Not at this stage he didn't

have any lawyer.


MR. FRICK:  Absolutely not, Your Honor.  We --


we were not appointed by the court until this matter had


gone before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals who


vacated the opinion of the district court and remanded it


because the -- now we're talking about the subsequently


filed 2255.  The -- the first titled 2255 that was filed


several years later.  It was not until that was on appeal


that the Eleventh Circuit appointed counsel -- had the


district court appoint counsel.


QUESTION:  So throughout the original rule --


MR. FRICK:  Totally pro se.


QUESTION:  And even when he -- his first styled


2255, he was still pro se until that one went up on 

appeal.

MR. FRICK:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's


QUESTION:  And pro se, Castro filed an appeal


from the merits determination of the district court? 


MR. FRICK:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's


correct. 


QUESTION:  But didn't raise, as an issue, the


treatment of his -- the recharacterization --


MR. FRICK:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  -- to also consider --

 MR. FRICK:  That was not raised -- that was not


raised as an issue by him at that point in time.


QUESTION:  And what are we to make of that?


MR. FRICK:  Your Honor, I would suggest that we


make nothing of it.  The Government has suggested that


this places this case under one of three things.  It's law


of the case, or if the Court doesn't buy law of the case,


then look at either waiver or forfeiture to the extent


that there may be some difference between those two


particular things. 


QUESTION:  At the time Mr. Castro appealed, had


AEDPA been enacted?


MR. FRICK:  At the time that he appealed?


QUESTION:  Mm-hum.  We can find it out.


MR. FRICK:  I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  But --


MR. FRICK:  We -- we have two or three different


appeals.


QUESTION:  I thought, frankly, that he had


appealed in March of 1996 and AEDPA was enacted in April.


MR. FRICK:  Yes, Your Honor.  At page 147 of the


joint appendix there's a March 19th, 1996 Eleventh Circuit


affirmance of the district court denial of the rule 33


motion for new trial, and in that order the court states


that this is an appeal from the denial of relief in regard

to a combined motion to vacate, set aside, or correct


sentence, 2255, and motion for new trial. 


Of course, it is our contention that that


statement is not actually accurate because there had never


been a motion filed by anyone seeking relief under 2255. 


It had simply been a characterization. 


QUESTION:  Now, that -- that would mean that


when the district court decided to treat this as being


under either or both of those provisions, it was doing him


no harm, AEDPA not yet being in existence.  Is that right?


MR. FRICK:  I believe that that was the -- yes,


Your Honor.  I believe that is -- that is correct from the


standpoint --


QUESTION: 


It's only the subsequent enactment of 

AEDPA that caused the recharacterization to be harmful to


him.


MR. FRICK:  Yes, Your Honor, and not only that,


but not only was this a pre-AEDPA filing of the rule 33


plus recharacterization at that time, it was a denial of


the -- that relief, that joint relief, pre-AEDPA.


QUESTION:  What do you make of the argument on


the other side that although, of course, there was no


AEDPA at that point, we did have a -- a structure of -- of


rules governing abuse of the writ and second and


successive petitions and that he would have -- he would

have run afoul of those rules, or at least there was


reason to be concerned that he might run afoul of those


rules, and therefore, the enactment of AEDPA really


shouldn't make any difference in our analysis?


MR. FRICK:  Well, Your Honor, I -- the


Government's brief seems to pretty much equate abuse of


the writ with the restrictions placed under 2255.


QUESTION:  And I'll -- I'll stipulate here that


they're -- you know, they're not exactly identical.  But


the argument is your concern basically here with the


unfairness of tagging him with an earlier petition, and


it's unfair because of the -- the consequences under


AEDPA.  And they're saying it would have been just as


unfair or just as fair in the pre-AEDPA law.  It's a


fairness argument.  What do -- what do you say to that?


MR. FRICK:  Yes, sir.  I -- I believe that the


other circuits of this country, courts of appeals, have


addressed the difference between the abuse of the writ and


the impact of having filed an initial 2255 under AEDPA and


having that.


QUESTION:  Right.  What -- what do you say? 


What do you say?  What's your answer to the Government? 


MR. FRICK:  I say that there is a significant


difference as stated by those other circuits between the


difficulty in getting a second petition filed under abuse

of the writ.  It -- it wasn't as difficult to get a second


petition filed.


QUESTION:  Is -- is the -- is the basic


difference that you have to go to the court of appeals and


that's a tough standard, whereas under our prior law, you


-- you didn't have to go through that step?


MR. FRICK:  That would certainly be one of the


differences, Your Honor.  But the recharacterization


itself in Mr. Castro's case was not to his benefit.  There


-- there's no contention that the Government did it to


legally entrap him, but that's the circumstance that he


ultimately found himself in, having had the court


recharacterize it, so to speak. 


QUESTION: 


Well, but isn't -- isn't there 

another point that filing a legitimate -- maybe -- on the


merits motion for new trial on ground A and later -- and


-- and having it denied, then later filing a 2255 on


ground B under our abuse of the writ doctrine -- that


would not have been an abuse of the writ, would it?


MR. FRICK:  That's correct, Justice Stevens. 


It's also important, I believe, to -- to consider that


while Mr. Castro was -- while Mr. Castro was pro se,


that's not -- that's not a critical element in connection


with this case.  These same pitfalls would have befallen


attorneys representing him with a recharacterization

problem as -- as it was done at that time, although I'm


not so sure that the Government would have suggested that


it would not object to it being recharacterized as a 2255


if there had been counsel on the other side at that time.


QUESTION:  But as far as raising a question on


appeal, it's more likely, if he had counsel, that the pro


se prisoner gets to see a document that starts out by


saying you made a rule 33 motion, and the bottom line is,


as you pointed out, your motion is denied, and that 2255


comes up only in the body of the opinion.  That is


something that a lawyer is far more likely to spot than a


pro se prisoner who sees I made a motion under rule 33,


and the bottom line of this judgment is my motion is


denied.


MR. FRICK:  Yes, Your Honor.  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Would he have been able to appeal the


trial court's treatment of it as -- as under the habeas


provision?  Would he have been able to appeal?  I mean,


the Government says it's law of the case because he should


have appealed it.  He -- he was the --


MR. FRICK:  Your Honor, I don't know what point


he would have appealed.  The -- the district court's


consideration of the motion throughout the entire motion


used the analysis of -- of Brady and Giglio in reaching


the point that his motion for new trial should be denied.

There was one brief remark about 2255 and the


constitutional application in it, but it was not, in


effect, necessary to the decision that the court rendered. 


And therefore, I do not believe that law of the case


applied.


QUESTION:  Well, even -- even if it wasn't


necessary, he would have had to go to appeal saying I


agree with the judgment below.  I should have been denied


relief.  But I want you to write an opinion saying that it


was wrong for the court to treat this -- I mean, the


normal appellate judge would say, look it, you know, you


have nothing to complain about if you agree that you


should have been denied relief under the other one.


MR. FRICK:  Yes, Your Honor. 


Your Honor, the -- the question presented before


this Court is not quite as narrow in our view as looking


specifically at the facts of this case, with it being a


pre-AEDPA when most of the other circuit cases are post-


AEDPA, both in the recharacterization phase and in the


filing of a first titled 2255.  The question that we were


asked pertaining to this Court dealt with when a first


post-conviction motion is recharacterized sua sponte as a


2255, is a subsequent first titled 2255 rendered second or


successive under the AEDPA.  The -- the answer to that is


no in our opinion.

 But the significance and the point I wanted to


make there is that the Government's contention that we've


got a law of the case issue -- law of the case is very --


I'm not sure exactly what the law of the case is going to


ultimately result in other than the determination that


there had been a recharacterization sua sponte as a 2255. 


And under that circumstance that's what we're here arguing


about.


QUESTION:  One thing you might touch on, Mr.


Frick, during the course, the Government contends we don't


have jurisdiction over this petition.  Perhaps you might


want to discuss that --


MR. FRICK:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- at some point. 


MR. FRICK:  Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist.


Under Stillert -- excuse me -- Stewart v.


Martinez-Villareal and Slack v. McDaniel, this Court has


already made the determination that it has jurisdiction to


consider and review a circuit court of appeals' decision


pertaining to whether or not a first titled 2255 is second


or successive following recharacterization.  Both of those


cases dealt with that issue.  They were different fact


situations, but the bottom line was this Court took


jurisdiction under those cases to consider the issue of


successive or second petition under AEDPA.

 In addition, a -- an actual look at the statute,


28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(3)(E), which is in the appendix of the


Government's brief, appendix 2a, that is the statute that


the Government contends shows that this Court does not


have jurisdiction.  What that particular section deals


with is a proscription against this Court having


jurisdiction when a court of appeals has granted or denied


a request for authorization for a district court to


consider a second or successive petition.  That is a


recognition on the part -- the statute recognizes that


there has been a first 2255 so characterized as such, so


pleaded as such by the petitioner, and that he has then


come before them with what he recognizes is a second


motion, and he's going to the court of appeals and saying, 

under AEDPA there are restrictions that we have not had


before, and I am required to come before you and meet


certain gatekeeping requirements in order for the district


court to hear my second or successive petition.  There is


no first 2255 for a second -- for -- for the first titled


2255 to be successive to or to be second to.  And


therefore, section 2244(b)(3)(E) is not applicable.


Now, the Government's argument in that regard is


that because the Eleventh Circuit looked at the appeal and


said, you don't meet the gatekeeping requirements, that


that determination that it did not meet the gatekeeping

requirements was a further sua sponte determination and


recharacterization of his appeal into a request for


certificate of authorization, and that therefore, under


that scenario, 2244(b)(3)(E) should serve as a bar to


jurisdiction.  We strongly suggest, Your Honors, that that


is not the case.


The AEDPA and the -- changed jurisdiction.  It


-- it limited this Court's jurisdiction to review very


important habeas corpus -- habeas petitions, and in so, it


should be strictly construed.  The Government would have a


further sua sponte recharacterization in this chain and


prevent this Court from having jurisdiction to even hear


the matter.


QUESTION: 


As I understand your position, 

though, you don't even have to read strict construction. 


You -- I think it's your view, isn't it, that subsection


(E) just doesn't speak to the question whether we have


jurisdiction over a decision by a court of appeals as to


whether or not a particular petition is second or


successive? 


MR. FRICK:  That is correct, Your Honor.  I was


simply addressing the Government's position in trying to


craft a -- a way under 2244(b)(3)(E) to prevent this Court


from having jurisdiction of the matter.

other courts of appeals have given the district court


instructions about how they should deal with cases of


recharacterization. 


MR. FRICK:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Those tests are not identical.  Of


the array of instructions to district judges to deal with


this situation, which do you think is the soundest


approach?


MR. FRICK:  Your Honor, I believe that the --


the Second Circuit Adams case sets forth probably the best


bright line test, that being that the petitioner -- that


-- that when a court has a petition that it thinks would


better be served as recharacterized, that they should


inform the petitioner first that they believe it should be 

recharacterized in order for them to grant relief, that it


should be recharacterized as a 2255, obtain the consent of


the petitioner, and if they don't obtain the consent of


the petitioner, then offer the petitioner the opportunity


to withdraw the petition and file it at a later point in


time, assuming that it can be refiled at some point in


time, and not be -- not run into problems with the statute


of limitations, or at least tell the petitioner that it is


going to consider this recharacterized and they've got 5


days, 10 days to add any other constitutional claims that


would appropriately be brought under a 2255 before they

will rule on it so that --


QUESTION:  Is recharacterization done only with


pro se litigants?  If I were an attorney, I'm not sure I'd


be terribly happy to have a lawyer -- to have the judge


say, well, this is the wrong kind of writ, I'm going to


treat it thus.


MR. FRICK:  Chief Justice Rehnquist, there are


circumstances I understand, not from personal knowledge,


where recharacterization does take place in spite of the


fact that there is an attorney.  But the actual process


and -- and the recharacterizations that have taken place


over the years have been for the benefit of a pro se


prisoner.


Your Honor, I know --


QUESTION:  But -- but you -- you want us to


simply adopt a rule for what happens, what warnings have


to be given, what requirements have to be met, when


there's recharacterization.  You're not asking us to go


further and say when recharacterization is appropriate. 


MR. FRICK:  I think when recharacterization is


appropriate, it's appropriate.

QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Frick.


Mr. Himmelfarb, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This Court lacks jurisdiction to review the


court of appeals' decision because the court of appeals


denied authorization to file a second or successive 2255


motion.


QUESTION:  But that's only if you know that it's


a second or a successive petition.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Justice Stevens, the


interpretive question we think that's presented, as far as


the jurisdictional issue goes, is whether a denial of

authorization is simply a finding that the gatekeeping


requirements have not been satisfied or rather whether it


encompasses both that determination and the subsidiary


determination that the motion is in fact second or


successive.  It's our position that it is a single order


encompassing both.


QUESTION:  Is -- is it your view that the Court


would never have jurisdiction to review a determination by


a court of appeals that a petition was or was not a second


or successive?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  No.  There -- there are two


circumstances when it can.  One is the Martinez-Villareal


situation, and there this Court had jurisdiction because


the court of appeals found that the motion was not second 

or successive and so didn't grant or deny authorization. 


So it didn't fall within 2244(b)(3)(E).


The second situation will be one where the court


of appeals finds that the motion is second or successive


and doesn't go on to reach --


QUESTION:  So our jurisdiction depends on how


the court of appeals resolved the issue.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's right.  It depends upon,


as the statute makes clear, whether there was a grant or


denial of authorization. 


QUESTION:  I don't understand your second

instance.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  The second instance -- let me


back up to try to answer that as clearly as I can.


The ordinary case where a court of appeals is


able to address the question whether the district court


properly found that a motion was second or successive is a


case where a motion for authorization to file the motion


is filed in a court of appeals.  That's because in many


circuits, once a district court finds that a motion is


second or successive, it's obligated to transfer the case


to the court of appeals so it can make the gatekeeping


determination.  And even in cases where a district court


is permitted to dismiss and does rather than transfer, and


once it's found that the motion is second or successive, 

it's going to be a rare case where the defendant is able


to take an appeal from the dismissal because under this


Court's decision in Slack v. McDaniel, he'll only be able


to get a certificate of appealability if he makes two


showings:  first, that the procedural ruling that it was


second or successive is subject to debate among reasonable


jurists; and in addition to that, that there was some


underlying constitutional claim that has arguable merit.


So in a rare circumstance, when an appeal can be


taken on the issue of whether the motion is second or


successive, and in the rare circumstance where the court

of appeals, after affirming that finding, does not go on


to reach the gatekeeping issue, as courts of appeals often


do just to bring the case to a close, that will be the


rare case where there has been a court of appeals' finding


that the motion is second or successive, but yet no grant


or denial such that 2244(b)(3)(E) does not deprive this


Court of jurisdiction. 


That is not this case.


QUESTION:  So in any case, your view is no


matter how absurd, if a -- the court of appeals says a


60(b) motion is second or successive, if they say a


complaint in a 1983 action is a second or successive


habeas petition, no matter how absurd, once the court of


appeals says this is a second or successive application, 

nobody has any right to appeal here, even though that


isn't what the statute says.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  So long as there is a grant or


denial of authorization, the court of appeals' decision


cannot be second-guessed.


QUESTION:  Now, why would we -- why would we


interpret a statute that doesn't say that to -- what it


says is, it says that they shall not file a second or


successive application, in other words, if it is a second


or successive application.  It doesn't say if it isn't. 


It doesn't tell us what to do if it isn't.  So why would

we adopt this interpretation that you say where the


statute doesn't say it, which would perhaps deprive people


of all kinds of right to petition the Supreme Court in


cases where they might be right?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  The interpretive question is


whether a denial of authorization under 2244(b)(3)(E) is


simply a finding that the gatekeeping requirements haven't


been satisfied or whether it's both that and the


subsidiary finding that the motion is second or


successive.  Nobody would take the position I think that


if the court of appeals finds the gatekeeping requirements


not satisfied and therefore denies authorization, and yet


manifestly errs in so finding, this Court would,


nevertheless, have jurisdiction to review it.  There's no


manifest error exception to 2244(b)(3)(E).


QUESTION:  Well, but that's -- you -- you call


it a subsidiary question, whether or not it's second or


successive.  You want to reach the gatekeeping question


first.  That's not the way the statute reads.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, we think it is.


QUESTION:  And why isn't it -- why isn't it a


predicate?  You read the statute.  So it says the denial


or grant of an authorization by the court of appeals to


file what the court of appeals finds is a second or


successive petition, but that's not what the statute says.

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  We think the statute does say


that, Justice Kennedy, for two reasons.  The first is that


2244(b)(3)(E) speaks at -- speaks of a denial of


authorization.  If Congress had intended that to mean only


a finding that the gatekeeping requirements had -- had not


been satisfied, it could have used narrower language, as


indeed it did in 2244(b)(3)(C) which refers specifically


to the gatekeeping requirements.  We think that's the


first textual indication that our position is correct.


The second textual indication is that in


2244(b)(3)(A) and (b)(3)(B), Congress speaks of an order


authorizing the district court to consider the


application.  We think it's reasonable to view an order


granting or denying an authorization to be synonymous with 

2244(b)(3)(E)'s reference to a grant or denial of


authorization. 


QUESTION:  Well, at the very least, if the


statute is ambiguous, it seems to me you have to answer


Justice Breyer's concern that an erroneous determination


here can foreclose the petitioner from exercising some


very important rights.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Our view is that the statute is


not ambiguous.  After applying all the relevant tools of


statutory construction, the best reading of it is that


Congress intended to include the subsidiary determination

when it said that this Court may not review a denial of


authorization. 


QUESTION:  Sometimes there might be a


constitutional question.  I mean, where for example an


opinion appealed to this Court might be required as a


matter of due process and what the lower court does, the


court of appeals -- it -- it erroneously characterizes


that effort to come to the -- that effort to appeal, which


the Constitution would protect.  It erroneously


characterizes it as a second or successive petition, and


in your view Congress would have just said, even however


erroneous it is, it can't come here.  What do we do about


the constitutional requirement? 


MR. HIMMELFARB: 


Well, Justice Breyer, you could 

imagine a case where there is a very serious


constitutional claim raised, but there's absolutely no


dispute that it's being raised in a second or successive


motion, and the defendant can't satisfy at the substantive


gatekeeping requirements.  The court of appeals says it's


second or successive.  You don't satisfy the gatekeeping


requirements.  We deny authorization.  I don't think


anyone would take the view that under 2244(b)(3)(E) that


defendant would, nevertheless, be able to seek certiorari


from this Court.  So the whole point of 2244(b)(3)(E) is


to give the court of appeals the final say.

 QUESTION:  And one final thing.  You realize the


language, of course, says that you cannot ask for cert


from the denial of an authorization by a court of appeals


to file a second or successive application.  And your


opponents are saying we're not appealing the denial of the


request to file a second or successive application.  We


are appealing the determination that this is a second or


successive application, a matter that the statute is


silent about.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  What my opponent is appealing


is the court of appeals' decision, which is a single


order, which does two things.  It affirms the district


court's finding that the motion was second or successive,


and then goes on repeatedly to say that under AEDPA's 

gatekeeping requirements, he may not file it.  The court


of appeals denied authorization to file the motion under


2244(b)(3)(E).  This Court lacks jurisdiction. 


QUESTION:  But what do you say to his point that


he didn't even try to file a -- try to seek an


authorization to file a second or successive because he


never thought it was a second or successive?  He did not


seek authorization to file such a motion.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's true, Justice Stevens. 


QUESTION:  So how can you have denied such an


authorization?

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, it's -- as -- as I've


said, the ordinary way that a defendant is able to


challenge a district court's determination that his motion


is second or successive in the court of appeals is not via


appeal because ordinarily either the case has been


transferred or he can't get a certificate of


appealability.  So he does it in the context of an


authorization motion.  And in that case, the court of


appeals may find --


QUESTION:  But, of course, he didn't file an


authorization motion in this case.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's true.  That brings me to


my second point.  In many cases within the category of the


rare case where a defendant is able to take an appeal from 

a dismissal of a motion as second or successive, after the


court of appeals affirms the finding that the motion is


second or successive, it will often go on to treat the


appeal as an implied request for authorization to file the


motion because otherwise you've got a lingering question


of whether this motion found to be second or successive


can or cannot be filed, and it will reach that question


just to bring the matter to a close.


It's our position, of course, that if the Court


does have jurisdiction, the court of appeals' decision


should be affirmed.  The district court treated

petitioner's first post-conviction motion as one that


sought relief under two different provisions of Federal


law, rule 33 --


QUESTION:  Why didn't the U.S. attorney who


said, Your Honor, I don't object -- this is a rule 33


motion, but introduced 2255.  Why didn't the assistant


U.S. attorney advise the pro se litigant of the


consequences of that recharacterization?  If the U.S.


attorney is going to take a pleading that a prisoner puts


in and says this is my rule 33 motion and for whatever


benign purpose, the assistant U.S. attorney thinks it


would be in the interest of justice to treat it as a 2255,


didn't someone have an obligation to alert the prisoner of


the consequences of that?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Justice Ginsburg, we do not


defend what was done in the district court in connection


with the first post -- post-conviction motion.  We do not


take the position --


QUESTION:  Well, wasn't that all -- didn't that


occur before AEDPA had been passed?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Yes, it did, Justice O'Connor. 


QUESTION:  Were there the same consequences then


as there were post-AEDPA?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  In -- in some respects they


were the same; in some respects they were different.  We

think, for relevant purposes, they were the same.  This


Court has characterized the abuse of the writ doctrine,


which of course predated AEDPA, as a modified res judicata


rule.  A slightly less modified res judicata rule is


codified in AEDPA.  But at least since McCleskey v. Zant,


which is a 1991 decision, a prisoner was presumptively


entitled to file only one 2255 motion.  The showing he


would have to make to be able to file a second one was


slightly different and slightly easier to make than it is


post --


QUESTION:  Well, he -- he never -- he did not in


the district court file such a motion.  He filed this rule


33(b) thing, that the Government then volunteered it


wouldn't mind if the court treated as a 2255 and the


district court treated it as such.  It was not Castro's


urging.


and --


MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's true, Justice O'Connor,


QUESTION:  And there was no enactment at that


time of AEDPA.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  That -- that is true as well. 


We do not take the position that the motion was properly


characterized as a 2255 motion.  We take two positions. 


One is that the Court may not reach that question because


it lacks jurisdiction, and second, that if the Court does

have jurisdiction, it should not reach that question


because there was a forfeiture.  The characterization


could have been appealed, but wasn't. 


QUESTION:  Well, this -- this business of having


a court recharacterize a motion as a 2255 motion was a


doctrine that seems to have been developed before AEDPA


was enacted, and some circuits since the enactment of


AEDPA have decided that if they're going -- if the


district court is going to do that, that some notice


should be given, certainly to a pro se petitioner, about


the consequences of that recharacterization.  Now, should


we propose such a rule or adopt such a rule in our


supervisory capacity?


MR. HIMMELFARB: 


Justice O'Connor, we have no 

objection in principle to requiring that -- to -- to a


rule requiring that a district court provide a defendant


with notice before characterizing a post-conviction motion


as a 2255 motion.  Our position is that --


QUESTION:  If we were to do it, which -- which


version would be the best?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, I'll answer that


question.  Before I do, I just want to make clear that our


position is that this is not an appropriate case to do


that because our view is that any objection to notice,


either a lack of notice or an inadequate -- inadequacy of

notice has to be made in connection with a motion that's


characterized.  And once you get to a subsequent stage of


the litigation, it's too late for that to happen. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Himmelfarb, the -- the reality is


we have a pro se litigant who loses in the district court. 


He gets a piece of paper that says, your motion under rule


is now being disposed of, and then the bottom line


says, your motion is denied.  Do you really think that a


pro se litigant forfeits his rights to raise what may be a


very important substantive question on habeas because he


didn't know to look to the body of the opinion that said


something about 2255 and that that's a forfeiture?  I


mean, even a lawyer might have missed it when the thing


starts out, this is a rule 33 motion, motion denied. 

That's what you're urging, that that kind of


forfeiture be visited on a pro se prisoner who was


uncounseled and never appeared before any court to be told


anything.  That strikes me as the Government not turning


square corners.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Justice Ginsburg, we don't


think that's the case at all.  There is, of course, no


right to counsel in connection with post-conviction


litigation and the vast majority of --


QUESTION:  The right to know the consequences of


what you're doing.  You can -- a forfeiture is usually

knowing.  Here, this litigant had no reason to know about


anything other than he was appealing from the denial of


his rule 33 motion.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  The -- the defendant in this


case, petitioner, did litigate the question of


characterization.  When the Government in its opposition


to his rule 33 motion recommended that it be treated as


both a rule 33 motion and a 2255 motion, in his reply he


objected.  He took the position that it should not be


treated as a 2255 motion and should be treated only as a


rule 33 motion.  So he was aware of -- of what was being


done and he felt that it was a significant enough decision


that it should be litigated, and he objected. 

Our position is that he should have continued to


object.  AEDPA imposes all types of restrictions on post-


conviction litigation. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but my question to you is, did


he have any reason to know?  You say he put in his


objection, yes.  Then he gets a document that only in the


body refers to 2255.  Why couldn't he reasonably see that


piece of paper as saying, you filed a rule 33 motion, your


motion is denied?  I mean, you are loading a lot onto a


pro se litigant who has never appeared before any court.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  We don't think that the fact

that he is pro se should have any part in the analysis


because that would create all sorts of difficulties in


other AEDPA cases where you have difficult questions,


particularly difficult, perhaps byzantine, procedural


rules that a petitioner is obligated to follow. 


QUESTION:  Well, usually courts do their best


when they deal with pro se litigants to have them


understand what's going on.  I mean, we have all kinds of


procedures in our criminal justice system just to assure


that people will understand what the rules are and what


the pitfalls are.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's true, Justice Ginsburg. 


AEDPA is not one of those statutes.  Once a -- a defendant


who files a self --


QUESTION:  Yes, but you're not relying on AEDPA


on this branch of the case.  We're back before the days of


AEDPA.  You're saying because he didn't in his appeal from


the denial of the rule 33 motion say, and P.S., court of


appeals, there was a mischaracterization -- all of that


happened before AEDPA, and that's what you're holding him


to.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's true, Justice Ginsburg,


but even before AEDPA, the rules governing post-conviction


litigation could be quite difficult to navigate, and even

before AEDPA, most post-conviction litigation was carried


out pro se.  There are two different places in -- in the


district court --


QUESTION:  But you just -- you just agreed.  You


said you had no reservation about what these other courts


have said must go on in the district courts.  You just


don't think that this is a proper case because there's no


jurisdiction.  But you -- you are recognizing that courts,


wanting to do justice, do and should inform litigants of


the consequences.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Justice Ginsburg, I don't want


to leave the Court with that impression.  I think I


started to answer another Justice's question and in -- in 

answering it, I said that in principle we have no


objection to a rule requiring notice before


recharacterization. 


QUESTION:  In principle, you have no objection. 


What about in practice? 


MR. HIMMELFARB:  In practice as well.  It's the


nature of the notice that I wanted to say a little bit


more about.  Some of the decisions on which petitioner


relies have -- have language in them that not only --


suggesting that not only must the defendant be notified


that the district court plans to treat the motion as a

2255 motion, but also that he be warned of its


consequences.  We have no objection insofar as there's a


requirement that he be notified of how it would be


treated.


We don't think there should be warnings about


the consequences.  Once a defendant is notified that the


motion is going to be treated as a 2255 motion, he stands


in no different position from somebody who's filed a self-


styled 2255 motion, and the law has never required that


that --


QUESTION:  Is -- is there one of the circuits


that has taken the position that you, in principle and in


practice, would say is a sound one?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  I think if -- if we had to


choose, we would prefer the Third Circuit's rule under


which essentially there are three options when a post-


conviction motion, not styled a 2255 motion, is filed. 


The defendant has the option of having it ruled upon as


filed.  He can be given notice that it's going to be


recharacterized, and it will be recharacterized, or he can


withdraw it so that he will not be prevented from filing a


second --


QUESTION:  See, do you think on that -- that --


you're now answering Justice O'Connor's question which is

just what I was interested in.  On page 42 of your brief,


you basically say that on the substantive rule here, you


agree with the other side.  I mean, pretty much.  And


that's what all the circuits have done.  And then you


impose a couple of procedural obstacles.


Well, assume you don't win your procedural


obstacles.  All right.  Suppose I find and the Court finds


that this is appealable, and suppose this law of the case


thing is -- you say -- why shouldn't he have the advantage


of the rule, this particular person, the rule that we're


about to announce?


Now, at that point, I want to know what rule are


we about to announce under what power.  And here I'd like


your opinion on two approaches which are different. 


One is we announce a rule on our supervisory


authority, as most of the courts have done, and then we


have two difficulties.  One, we're in an area we know not


what.  You know, we're not involved in recharacterization


as a daily basis.  And moreover, we're not sure what rule


to pick or what exact formulation, which will make a huge


difference. 


Now, the other approach is the First Circuit's


approach, which is not the reason it commends itself to


me, but I just put it out there.  And that is to say we

interpret the words, second or successive petition, in


AEDPA not to include this.  You see, what they were


talking about in Congress was not this.  They didn't think


a second or successive petition was second or successive


where the first one took place under these no-warning


circumstances before AEDPA was even enacted.  Now, I think


they come to exactly the same place, but that second


approach, which they followed, doesn't get us into the


business of writing rules in some kind of supervisory


capacity in the dark. 


Now -- but I want the SG's view, i.e., your


view, on the comparative merits of those two ways of


getting to the same place.  And I'm really uncertain.  I


-- I'd be very interested in what you think. 


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Our view is that the First


Circuit's view, which does not require notice but simply


says that if there is no notice, the second motion is


deemed to be a first motion, should not be adopted because


we think it's inconsistent with the basic principle of


post-conviction litigation, which we're urging this Court


to adopt in this case, that you have to file your


challenges to rulings made against you at the earliest


possible opportunity.  The First Circuit's rule, in


effect, gives the defendant a right to file a later

appeal.


QUESTION:  Yes, but I think you're missing --


say -- say the same content.  Let's have equivalent


content to the rule.  Is it better for us to -- to say


we're reading AEDPA or is it better for us to say we are


-- which is open to the -- this kind of reading.  We have


to decide the scope of those words in the -- in the block


of AEDPA.  Or is it better for us to try to write a rule? 


That -- that's what I'm interested in.  I can work out the


rest of the content, and actually the First Circuit


approach needn't have a content.  I mean, it can really


have quite a minimal content, but -- but that's what I'm


interested in. 


MR. HIMMELFARB:  We don't --


QUESTION:  Am I being clear?  Do you understand


it? 


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Yes.  We don't AEDPA can


reasonably be read to say that a 2255 motion is one that


is characterized as not filed as one, but is characterized


one after notice, and that if there's no notice, it's not


a 2255 motion.  Our position on notice is that it's


essentially an adjunct of the prior decision to


recharacterize. 


And I want to be clear.  Recharacterization,

particularly in a post-AEDPA world, does not benefit only


the defendant, a defendant who might be able -- might not


be able to get his claim ruled upon if it's not


recharacterized. 


QUESTION:  I'm sure that's right, but you -- you


think we should go into the rule-writing business, say, in


our supervisory capacity.  These -- these rules -- this


kind -- this is the consequence that attaches to


recharacterization.  A recharacterization is not a


recharacterization that fits within AEDPA unless it gets


notice, et cetera, et cetera.  That's what you think we


ought to do.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  No. 


Our position --

QUESTION:  If we -- I know you don't really, but


I mean, if we get to that point and we've -- we reject


your other two.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  To the extent that the Court


wishes to impose a notice requirement, our view is that it


should go essentially like this.  It is important to


recharacterize a post-conviction motion not styled a 2255


motion if it seeks relief available only under 2255.  It's


important because it can help the defendant.  It's also


important because if it's not recharacterized, you run the


risk that Congress' clear purpose to prohibit second or

successive post-conviction motions could be evaded.


We -- that -- that is essentially a judge-made


rule, recharacterization.  We think, as a matter of


fairness and also as a matter of reducing potential


litigation, it is appropriate, once you've got the judge-


made rule that says you should recharacterize, to go


further and say, before you do, notice has to be given.


QUESTION:  Wouldn't it -- wouldn't it be much


simpler just to say if a district court recharacterizes,


it must do this without going into when or why you should


recharacterize? 


MR. HIMMELFARB:  It probably -- I think it


would, Mr. Chief Justice. 


Our only point is that if 

there's going to be a recharacterization and there's going


to be notice, the only notice should be I plan to


recharacterize.  We don't think that the district court


should give any kinds of warnings about the consequences


of recharacterization for the reasons I gave Justice


Ginsburg. 


QUESTION:  But didn't the -- doesn't that --


isn't that included in the Third Circuit formulation?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  I think it may well be.  I


think most of the courts of appeals take the view that you


should not only give notice of the intent to

recharacterize, you should also give some sort of warnings

QUESTION:  Why do you want --


QUESTION:  You should give an opportunity to --


to say I'll withdraw my petition or I'll amend my petition


to say everything that I could say under the heading of


2255.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Our view is that giving notice


of an intent to recharacterize puts the defendant in the


same position as one who filed a self-styled 2255, and


under the law of post-conviction litigation, such a


defendant is held responsible for the consequences of


filing that motion.


QUESTION:  That's not the position that any of


the circuits have taken.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  I think that -- I think that's


probably right.  I think they -- to the extent they


require notice, within that notice, they think there


should be some warning about the consequences of


characterization.  We think that that can't be reconciled


with the fact that there's a detailed procedural scheme


governing post-conviction motions and Congress said


nothing about warnings as it did, for example, in the


context --

 QUESTION:  Isn't there a difference between a


case in which a litigant makes up his mind to file a 2255


-- presumably he should have found out what's the


consequence of that -- and the situation in which he files


something else and the judge says, I'm going to change it? 


How does he know what the consequences are if he hasn't


had a chance to think it through?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Justice Stevens, the way we


envision the regime working is that the motion is filed


and the district court issues an order which it serves on


parties, giving notice that it intends to recharacterize


and some amount of time will elapse before the defendant


is obligated to come back to the court and tell the court 

whether it wishes for the court to go forward with


recharacterization or allow him to withdraw.  So within


that period of --


QUESTION:  But you would say the


recharacterization could not take place until after there


was that time -- notice and a time to accept or object to


it.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's right.  I think that's


reasonably encompassed --


QUESTION:  Which, of course, didn't happen here.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's true.  No notice was

given here.


QUESTION:  The -- the point of implausibility I


-- I have with your argument is that when the district --


your argument to the effect that no notice of consequence


needs to be given, merely a notice that recharacterization


will take place.  The -- the point is that when a point


does that, the court is understood to be trying to help


out the defendant.  Whether the court puts it in precisely


those words or not, that's -- that's the object.  The --


the court, in effect, is saying, look, I'm going to help


you here because you don't know how to plead this stuff,


and -- and I'm going to recharacterize this as under 2255.


It seems very odd for the court, in effect, to 

be in the position of saying, I'm going to help you out by


recharacterizing and at the same time keep its mouth shut


about the fact that when it does recharacterize, the


consequence is going to be that that fellow is going to be


out on his ear if he ever wants to walk in with another


claim that could have been made under 2255.  It seems to


me that if courts are going to help, they've got to help


in a -- in a way that does not mislead the defendant, and


your argument says they can help, as it were, in a way


that does mislead him.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Justice Souter, the -- the

vindicating Congress' purpose in enacting the bar on


second or successive motions in AEDPA.  It vindicates --
