 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you,

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

10
11
12  two plausible definitions of the phrase, "lawfully made 
13  under this title."  Our definition is the more 
14  consistent with the English language, and is the only 
definition that does not do mischief with the same use 
15
16  of that phrase each time it's repeated. 
17
18  400-year common law history, and 65-year-old right that 
19  was in the statute through 1976, and consistent with the 
20

24  provision, just not everything; whereas, Wiley's grants

 Ours is the only one consistent with a

 Ours --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But your reading -- your 

the copyright owner loses control of distribution 

 That is essentially your argument. 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That is correct, 

that "lawfully made under this title" means made 
wherever, in a way that satisfies U.S. copyright 
standards, made in accordance with --

1  imagined asking for back then. 
2
3
4  reading is essentially, once a copy is sold anywhere, 
5
6  everywhere. 
7
8
9  Your Honor.  And to put a finer point on it, ours is 
10
11 
12 
13
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So -- but -- so this 
14  notion of sold anywhere, end of distribution rights 
15
16  exhaustion principle. 
17
18  Yes, Your Honor. 
19
country has adopted that international exhaustion 
20
21  regime, that most countries adhere to the national 
22  exhaustion regime, which nobody is contesting here. 
23  That is, if it's manufactured in the United States and 
24  sold in the United States, that copy belongs to the 
25

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  International exhaustion. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And we are told that no 

everywhere, that has been called, I think, the universal 

person who purchased it, end of case.  But if the 

4

 But second, Wiley is making the point that 

1  exhaustion doctrine applies only nationally, then your 
2  argument is asking for something that runs against the 
3  regime that is accepted in most places. 
4
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I have a few 
answers to that.  The first is it is not true that no 
5
6  country adopts national exhaustion.  Congress adopted 
7  national exhaustion in sections 905 and 906 6 years 
8  after the statute was passed, as to microchips. 
9
there is now a norm.  They say most States -- most 
10
11  countries, that is.  Back in 1976 Wiley is not even 
12  arguing that there was any international norm, much less 
13  that the drafters of the statute were focused on 
14  international norms; and the truth is that there isn't 
an international consensus around national exhaustion. 
15
16  We know that for a fact.  In 1994 when 125 nations got 
17  together, they -- they agreed to disagree on 
18  international copyright exhaustion principles, and they 
19  codified that disagreement, to each his own, in the 
20
21
22  example, the European Union, the position in -- in those 
23  countries.  Suppose we -- we just transformed --
24  transferred this case to one of those countries, the 
25

exact same case; and my understanding is that they would 

TRIPS agreement. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, let's take, for

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor, not to
 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but not -- not 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Agreed, Your Honor, but it 

here is we've got to of course read what Congress wrote. 
What Congress wrote was "lawfully made under this 
title," not "lawfully made in the United States," or not 
"lawfully made under this title and made in the United 
States."  When Congress wants to say that, Congress says 
that very explicitly. 

1  follow the national exhaustion.
 
2
3  quibble; they don't follow national exhaustion.  They
 
4  follow regional exhaustion.  So --
5
6  exhaust -- you sell a copy in -- in Thailand; then it's 
7  home free all over the world. 
8
9  is regional, it's not national.  And -- and the point 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  made under this title," simply lawfully made in a manner 
18  that does not violate United States copyright law? 
19
I would say "lawfully made under this title" means 
20
21  lawfully made in a manner that does not violate the 
22  standards articulated. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The standards, okay.  So --
23
24  so it could be lawfully made in England, let's say; in a 
25

country that has compulsory licensing, it could be 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you mean by "lawfully 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor.  Just, I --

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor.  And the 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  Let me 
give a -- an example that actually is consistent with 

1  lawfully made there, but it would not be lawfully made 
2  under our -- under our copyright law, because we don't 
3  have that. 
4
5
6  what --
7
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so at least they are 
8  correct in contending that what you are arguing for is 
9  -- is not lawfully made under -- lawfully made if the 
United States copyright law had applied where it was 
10
11 
made; is that what you are saying? 
12
13  reason is --
14
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No?
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- that that statute that 
15
16  you just described would only do a third of the job of 
17  the first-sale doctrine.  Everyone agrees the first-sale 
18  doctrine applies at a minimum to products made in the 
19  United States.  And if you use that counterfactual, if 
20
21  first-sale doctrine, does not apply in situations where 
22  it was made in the United States.  So the 
23  counterfactual --
24
25

U.S. law had applied, it would indicate that it, the 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't follow 

that.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So the first-sale doctrine 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- and to goods made 

outside of the United States, is our argument. 

would not work, because this title does apply to the 
goods made in the United States, and that's the core of 
the first-sale doctrine. 

1
2  applies to goods made in the United States --
3
4
5
6
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay. 
7
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  If it applies in the United 
8  States, if we're talking about goods made in the United 
9  States, the counterfactual "if this title had applied" 
10
11 
12 
13
14  what -- is your theory of this statute essentially that 
15
16  defined by U.S. copyright law? 
17
18  just change one word, because "piratical" is a 
19  mischievous word.  Back in the day when the -- when the 
20

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  No. 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes.  So --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I said as defined by U.S. 

this language means non-piratical copies as that is 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Mr. Rosenkranz, is 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor, if I may 

1976 statute was passed, "piratical" meant unlawful 

copyright law. 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Absolutely.  And -- and the 

copyright law? 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That is right.  And Your 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that's, that's what the 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Counterfeit. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and other copies, and 

1
2  key --
3
4  statute means.  It's -- the statute in your view is 
setting up a distinction between piratical, pirated, 
5
6  whatever the term is -- copies --
7
8
9  saying that that distinction should be measured by U.S. 
10
11
12  Honor, the reason was -- what was driving copyright 
13  owners crazy was this notion that there were lawless 
14  states out there that had no significant copyright 
protection.  And we were applying their standards to 
15
16  products that were infiltrating the U.S. market.  And 
17  one of the most important things to underscore here, 
18  which I think got lost in the Costco argument, is that 
19  the space -- that 602 does an enormous amount of work 
even with 109, the first-sale doctrine, carved out of 
20
21  it. 
 Copyright owners wanted three things out of 
22
23  the 1976 Act with respect to importation, and they got 
24  two and a half of them.  The first was what we've just 
25

been talking about, Your Honor.  It was driving them 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Secondly, they got coverage for copies that 

were lawfully made, but stolen.  And this was the one 

1  crazy that there were lawless states out there; they
 
2  gave the example of Russia, which -- where an agency
 
3  approved the making and distribution within Russia of
 
4  classic English language works.  They got imported to
 
the U.S. and they were competing with U.S. works, U.S. 
5
6  copies within our domestic market.  And they got their 
7  wish to shut that down, to use U.S. law as the standard 
8  for those works. 
9
10
11  ask that the film industry had.  We see it in the 
12  colloquies.  They rented films abroad.  The films --
13  that was their business model.  The films would get 
14  stolen; and the U.S. market would be awash with stolen 
15
16  importation provision, those stolen goods coming into 
17  the U.S. market. 
 And the third thing that they wanted is --
18
19  is what's been dominating this debate.  But it's only 
the third thing, and that was help dividing geographic 
20
21  markets, so that they could go after the rogue 
22  distributors, yes, but also go after the downstream 
23  sales.  They got half of that.  They got a cause of 
24  action against the rogue distributors.  They did not get 
25

films.  And so they wanted to shut down, with the 

a cause of action that went downstream.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Rosenkranz, can I 

licensee to register the copyright abroad and 
distribute.  In your definition of "lawfully made under 
this title," does "lawfully made under this title" apply 
to all of those situations, i.e. --

1
2  ask you, just -- it is a practical question, but I think 
3  it has a theoretical impact.  A manufacturer can choose 
4  to contract or a copyright holder choose to contract 
with someone here to manufacture their goods.  They 
5
6  could contract with someone abroad, anywhere in the 
7  world, directly.  They can choose to license their 
8  trademark and permit a distributor abroad to manufacture 
9  under their U.S. copyright; or they can permit the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  the manufacturer who manufactures abroad --
17
18
19  manufacturer who licensed a distributor to do it for it. 
But does it also apply to the -- to the copyright owner 
20
21  who basically gives the copyright to a foreign 
22  distributor and lets the foreign distributor -- register 
23  it abroad? 
24
25

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  The only 
question under our definition is, was the making lawful, 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- I think clearly to 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- clearly to the 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That is -- that is 

is manufacturing under the English copyright, because 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  If --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the manufacturer who 

1  which is to say, was it authorized, whether it's by 
2  transfer of licensing or by transfer of copyright or in 
3  any other way?  Is it lawful as measured by U.S. 
4  standards?  And -- and the --
5
6  broader than I thought.  Then I'm not quite sure why you 
7  don't mean if this title applied.  Because if the --
8
9
10
11  the distributor has an English copyright, is not 
12  manufacturing under the U.S. copyright, they are 
13  manufacturing under the English copyright. 
14
15
16  described is because we are not focusing on whether the 
17  making was under this title; we're focusing on whether 
18  it was lawful under this title.  Does this -- would this 
19  title, when you apply it to wherever it happens to be, 
20
21  say that this is authorized? 
22
23  reason if this title had been applicable doesn't work is 
24  because there are enormous numbers of situations, 
25

whether in the United States or abroad, would this title 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Right.  And, Your Honor, 

the reason that the language works the way we've

case, it was manufactured in a way that satisfied the 
conditions of the American statute, even though, for 
technical reasons, it didn't apply. 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  And, in 

1  Doctrine applies to where this title does apply. 
2
3  this title had applied would work for foreign goods 
4  coming in, but not for U.S. goods, which is the core of

6
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But you don't have to
 
7  say -- you can say both, either it was manufactured
 
8  directly and received an American copyright and
 
9  satisfied all the conditions, or, if that wasn't the

13
14  fact, (a)(2) --

20
21  what Congress did was to find a much simpler, more 
22  efficient way to say all of that.

25

 In 2008, it figured that out and put --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I take it that the reason 
they wrote -- or changed the statute was just because 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes.  In 2008 --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So we are off on a kind of

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Correct. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Am I right; or, if I am 

1  they were worried about bailees or lessees or somebody 
2  under the old statutes not satisfying the first -- they 
3  were worried about that -- somebody -- a printer 
4  lawfully obtains a book, and he shouldn't have advantage 
5
6
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your --
7
 JUSTICE BREYER:  He's in the middle of 
8  printing it.  And therefore you have to change the 
9  language.  So they changed the language to "lawfully 
10
11
12
13  wrong, why did they change it? 
14
15
16
17  there also the question of allowing manufacturers to 
18  segment markets so we'd have the copyright by abroad, 
19  governed by foreign law, copyright in the United States 
governed by U.S. law?  Wasn't segmentation of the market 
20
21  allowing people to do just what these people are doing? 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So, Justice Ginsburg, my 
22
23  answer to Justice Breyer was about why the language in 
24  109 was changed, that is, from "obtained possession" to 
25

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, that is exactly 

right.  And just not to diminish it --

1
2  Your Honor, not a word was uttered about dividing 
3  distribution or divided markets.  It was all about this 
4  problem --
5
6  of the things that they wanted was the segmentation of 
7  markets.  They got half of it.  They got the rogue 
8  distributors' half. 
9

11  have gotten.  That's the kind that they don't need 
12  because they have a contractual remedy about -- against 
13  the distributors. 
14
15
16  with no contractual privity.  And what sense does that 
17  make? 
18
19  sense, Your Honor.  Obviously, you know, the industry, 
at least back in 1976, did not get everything that they 
20
21  wanted.  What they got was a much more powerful weapon 
22  than a contract.

that Costco submitted.  And here's what happened.  They 
got their importation provision.  And Karp says, now, 
wait a minute, I don't get it.  You have got this 
importation provision, and you've got this First Sale 
Doctrine.  They are at war with each other.  Which one 
wins? 

1
2  think it's an important one, when you go to the 
3  history -- and I think you are right, Your Honor, that 
4  there is exactly one spot in the drafting history where 
the relationship between 602 and 109 was discussed.  It 
5
6  was that conversation between Clark and Goldman, who was 
7  the general counsel of the copyright office. 
8
9  It's recited in extensive detail in the amicus brief 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  wins, but they realize that there is this problem.  And 
18  what they do, the general counsel of the copyright 
19  office says, we obviously haven't thought this through. 
We need to do more work on this, says the librarian of 
20
21  Congress.  And the next thing that happens, you see it 
22  in a red line on page 13 of our reply brief, is that for 
23  the first time in the drafting history, the two are 
24  reconciled by making 602 subordinate to 109, in exactly

 They seem to be agreeing that first sale

 So the copyright owners got half the loaf. 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  To put it bluntly, yes. 

1
2  It may not have been the half that was more important to 
3  them, but they got a lot more from the extension of the 
4  -- the importation provision.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Rosenkranz, there is
 
5
6  that passage in Quality King, which is, I think it's
 
7  fair to say, unfortunate to your position.  Is your
 
8  basic view of that passage that it was simply
 
9  ill-considered dicta that we should ignore?

10
11  That's my ultimate position.  But I do think it can be 
12  reconciled with our position. 
13
 Let's start with the question presented in 
14  Quality King is exactly the question that is presented 
15
16  imports -- is 109 applicable to imports.

 The whole driving logic of Quality King is 
18  about 109 trumping 602.  And it's only in that part IV, 
19  where the court is rebutting various attacks on its 
20
21  is in the third tier explanation to one of five 
22  rebuttals. 
 I believe it can be reconciled, certainly in 
23
24  result.  What you had there was the foreign distributor 
who had only British rights importing directly into the 
25

position, that it gets to that dictum, and that dictum 

here, and the Court answered it yes, that is, do

3  reasoning.  The passage specifically says this was 
4  presumably not to be lawfully made under this title.
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  And I have an -- I agree 
5
6  with you, Your Honor.  I have an explanation.  I offer 
7  it tentatively.  I'm not sure whether it's right or not, 
8  either as to what the Court intended or under the 
9  statute.
 My hunch is the Court was thinking about a 
10
11  scenario where the British publisher only needs 10,000 
12  copies to cover Britain; but, instead, what it does is 
13  to print 100,000 copies.  Everyone would know that that 
14  is not authorized, it's not lawfully made under this 
title, because the intent is to send it over to the 
15
16  United States.  So it's not lawfully made at that 
17  moment. 
18
19  undergirding to our position, which is that our position 
20
21  of every uses of the same phrase -- every use of the 
22  same phrase in the rest of the statute.  Wiley's reading 
23  makes almost all of them nonsensical. 
24
25

is the only one that does not make a complete hash out 

 Let me also just mention an important 

 So let me just give you an example.  Section

one past it to the next Beethoven record that happens to 

1  is the result, but doesn't explain why Congress would 
2  ever have wanted it.  The result is that a teacher can 
3  go and buy a Beethoven record and play it to her class 
4  if it was made in the United States.  But if she flips 
5
6  have been made in Asia, she can't play that for her 
7  class. 
 Or section 109(c), the public display, the 
8
9  Buffalo Cafe owner is allowed to purchase something in 
the United States and put it up on her walls, you know, 
10
11 
say, a picture of Niagara Falls.  That is permissible, 
if it was made in the United States.  But off the same 
12 
13 
retail rack, she flips one past; if it was made in Asia, 
it's not permissible.
14 
 Nor does Wiley explain why Congress would 
15
16  adopt an exception to the First Sale Doctrine that is 
17  not at all about sales, that is only about where copies 
18  were made. 
19
into the U.S. market has this incentive to go and send 
20
21  jobs overseas.  It's an irresistible incentive if the 
22  law is -- if this Court says the law is what Wiley says. 
23
24  I mean, the Ninth Circuit cases have been around for 
some time.  Has any manufacturer ever moved abroad? 
25

 So a U.S. manufacturer who wants to sell

been settled in Wiley's favor.  The courts were split. 
 The moment that a manufacturer learns that 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I'm sure it
 
1
2  has.  They haven't announced it.  Now, let me just be
 
3  clear.  The Ninth Circuit came out with its opinion,
 
4  this Court has intervened twice, so the law has never
 
5
6
7  this Court says you get what we've called the Holy Grail 
8  of manufacturing, endless eternal downstream control 
9  over sales and rentals, you can ruin secondary markets 
that are competing with you, the moment that happens, 
10
11 
that will be yet another reason for manufacturers 
silently to decide that they're headed -- that they're 
12 
13 
sending their manufacturing overseas. 
14
15
16  would -- would have it, am I correct that only one of 
17  them adopted the absolutist rule? 
18
19  only three courts of appeals that have weighed in, but 
yes, the Second Circuit is the only one that has adopted 
20
21  the absolutist rule, and that's yet another problem with 
22  Wiley's position.  Wiley urges its position as a matter 
23  of statutory interpretation, but is refusing to stand by 
24  it.  The moment it gets past the language of the 
25

statute, every argument it makes is an argument that is

6  effect for -- what we might call it -- a common law 
7  adaptation of Bobbs-Merrill. 
8
9  which is even -- creates even more mischief.  The 
government's position, as I understand it, is 109 
10
11 
doesn't have to do any work.  In service of giving more 
berth, you know, greater magnitude to 602, we're going 
12 
13 
to make 109 completely superfluous because Bobbs-Merrill 
does all of the work.
14 
 Now, 109 Congress said -- it put into the 
15
16  statute, it said it on every recodification to codify 
17  Bobbs-Merrill, and the government is now making 109 
18  completely irrelevant, but picking and choosing, 
19  deciding that it wants the limitation on us from 109,

1  as a matter of copyright theory, I had always understood 
2  copyright to -- a copyright holder has a kind of a 
3  bundle of rights.  It's not one right that applies 
4  everywhere in the world.  It's you have your U.S. rights 
5
6  under each jurisdiction's law. 
7
8  when I sell my Chinese rights to somebody, I'm also 
9  selling my U.S. rights to that same person, because the 
person who has the Chinese rights can just turn around 
10
11 
and import the goods.  I mean, that's the nature of your 
position, isn't it, that your U.S. rights are always 
12 
13 
attached when you sell more -- your rights under the 
jurisdiction of another country?
14 
15
16  Honor, back in 1976, this notion of geographic division 
17  was very, very new, so it's not at all clear what 
18  Congress was thinking with that -- with respect to that. 
19  But secondly, no, we're not -- we're not saying that 
20
21  to the Chinese company, it is selling all rights. 
22  Certainly, the Chinese company cannot sell everywhere, 
23  but after that first sale, all of the manufacturer's 
24  rights are cut off.

precisely what Section 602(a)(1) was enacted to address, 
10
11  an international gray market in copyrighted works.  This 
12  Court unanimously recognized in the Quality King case 
13  that 602(a)(1) encompasses copies of books that were 
14  lawfully made not under the United States' Copyright 
15
16
17  it encompasses copies not subject to the first-sale 
18  doctrine, for example copies made under the law of 
19  another country.  These are the words of every member of

21
 Now, referring to it as dicta misstates what 
22  was going on in the Quality King case.  The argument was 
23  that if you interpret 602(a) and 109(a) as allowing a 
24  defense, a first-sale defense, you emasculate Section 
25

602(a), and so the Court was explaining on page 147 and 

Act, but under the law of some other country. 

 602(a) is broader than 6 -- 109(a), because

lessees.  These are relatively small problems either 

1  148, I believe, why there were three reasons why 602(a) 
2  would have viability.  And one of those reasons had to 
3  do with direct action against someone that was engaged 
4  in pirating, and some of it had to do with bailees and 
5
6  otherwise dealt with by contract law or otherwise dealt 
7  with by the provisions of the statute. 
 But the third reason for the Court's

19  we could -- you know, I don't -- I don't feel I want to 
spend a lot of time arguing what the word "dicta" means,

millions of dollars' worth of items with copyrighted 
20
21  indications of some kind in them that we import every 
22  year; libraries with three hundred million books bought 
23  from foreign publishers that they might sell, resell, or

interpretation of the statute is to interpret it as --

2  statutes may not be perfect with respect to this, and
 
3  there may be horribles that occur under one set of
 
4  interpretations of the statute, and the other
 
5
6  as the petitioner --
7
8  the Karp exchange that the response was, this is 
9  something that we have to study with care, in 1976.
 The parade of horribles is now causing the 
10
11  Solicitor General and at least one, if not two, courts 
12  of appeals to write exceptions into the language to take 
13  care of what they perceive as horribles. 
14
15
16  than to try to give it a meaning and then fix it because 
17  we understand that the meaning doesn't make sense? 
 MR. OLSON:  I -- there -- there is a body of 
18
19  the government of the United States that is entitled and 
capable of fixing this.  These parade of horribles have 
20
21  been -- people have been arguing about these for years. 
22  For 30 years, the statute has been interpreted the way 
23  that we are suggesting that it should be under this 
24  title, which this Court earlier this year, in another

section 109(a), but under this title occurs in 602(a)

7  sections 602(a) --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rosenkranz told us 
8

 MR. OLSON:  Yes, and -- and in each case --
12  first of all, if the interpretation that my opponent is 
13  arguing for was the law, that -- those are the words 
14  that are in 602(b) and 602(a)(2).  So Congress could 
have used those words that our opponents are arguing 
15
16  for, and did use those words, one of which was written 
17  on the same time in the same -- passed in the same time, 
18  in 1976, that 602(a)(1) was.

10
11  sense that that was a round trip; this isn't a round 
12  trip. 
13
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I take you back to the 
14  words here, "lawfully made under this title," which you 
15
16
17  perplexing, and I can kind of see it both ways.  So what 
18  you say is made under this title, that must mean made in 
19  the United States, and "lawfully," just as this little 
word that's -- that modifies that basic phrase, "made 
20
21  under this title," which means made in the United 
22  States. 
23
24  he doesn't say it in these words, but he says, "The 
25

focus of this provision is on 'lawfully made.'"  That is 

say clearly means what you say it means. 

 So, I find this language a little bit 

 But what Mr. Rosenkranz essentially says --

lawfully made under the rules of this title.

3
4  know, we need something to measure, well, how do we know 
whether it's lawfully made?  Well, you look to the rules 
5
6  in the copyright law. 
7
 So if you just -- if you focus more on the 
8  lawfully word, lawfully made, and then under this title 
9  doesn't mean made in the United States, it means

11
 MR. OLSON:  Lawfully made under this title

3  who may or may not be Toyota itself.

 With respect to the museums, with respect to 
12  the person bringing books into the United States, there 
13  are other defenses, including fair use.  There are other 
14  defenses under the copyright law.  But -- and one of the 
things is that, to a certain extent, if you're going to 
15
16  use the product created by someone else in a way that's 
17  contemplated by the copyright laws, maybe it's required 
18  that you actually comply with the copyright laws by 
19  going to the owner of the copyright and saying, look, 
20
21  this?  It's a nonprofit.  It's a museum.  And I'm --

 MR. OLSON:  No.  And some of -- but -- but 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, which ones 

 MR. OLSON:  It may be a fair use.  It may be 

copyrighted items or trademarked items that appear in a 
product that was licensed abroad.  The government has 
offered another alternative interpretation of the word 
"made," as putting it in the flow of commerce.  That 
might deal with some of these situations.

1
2  they're --
3
4  are -- I mean, I'm -- it seems unlikely to me that, if 
your position is right, that a court would say, it's a

15

17  intending to talk about the vast gray market problem. 
18  This provision --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, intending where?  I 
19
mean, I -- you spend a lot of time talking about the 
20
21  legislative history and the purposes behind 602.  But 
22  the language that we're supposed to be interpreting is 
23  the language in section 109.  And the language in 
24  section 109, as far as I can see, there's really nothing 
to support your argument that that language was intended 
25

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you know, section 109 is 

1  to address this gray market problem. 
 Isn't that correct? 
2
 MR. OLSON:  Well, no.  I think that section 
3
4  109 and 602(a) were adopted in the same statute.  They 
were put in the draft of the statute at the same time, 
5
6  in 1964. 
7
8  just a rewording of a prior provision that you would 
9  clearly lose under, where the prior wording had nothing 
to do with where any product was manufactured.  And what 
10
11 
you're suggesting is that we should read this change in 
wording -- which actually, there's a real theory behind 
12 
13 
what the change in wording meant that has nothing to do 
with the place of manufacture, that we should read it as 
14 
incorporating a place of manufacture requirement, 
15
because there was a separate debate going on in section 
16 
17 
602 about that question. 
18
19  what I'm -- I guess what I'm trying to explain is that 
the two were enacted at the same time.  They were out 
20
21  there and available to the public for 12 years before 
22  they were finally adopted.  These parade of horribles 
23  could have been addressed by Congress in a different way 
24  at the time, and the interpretation -- this is a -- 109 
is a defense -- is offered as a defense to section -- to

 MR. OLSON:  But the -- but the two pro --

 So what does it mean?  What provide -- what 

this title."  What does that mean? 

 And you have done that in the Quality King 

1  section 602(a)(1). 
2
3  is the defense that's provided?  And you then have to 
4  interpret, "made under this" -- "lawfully made under 
5
6
7  case.  You explained in the Quality King unanimously 
8  that it makes a difference because you are exhausting --
9  Congress intended to allow segmentation of the market. 
It only makes sense to interpret this way if you allow 
10
11 
segmentation of the market pursuant to these provisions, 
because it is exhausting the copyright under the laws of 
12 
13 
the United States once you make a sale of a product 
produced in the United States subject to the United 
14 
States' copyright laws. 
15
16
 You are not exhausting your U.S. copyright 
17  when you make something, or allow something to be made 
18  abroad.  You are not exhausting that copyright.  You 
19  have not done that yet.  So the first sale is not

22  the United States. 
23
24  perfect sense.  And it makes -- there is not going to be

a perfect solution in every case.  The Court has dealt

6  every single permutation of a problem that someone

answer to the outsourcing problem and the charges that

16  if you read the statute as you are urging, then you are

18
19  that.  One, that's Congress's concern.  And -- and there 
is no evidence that that would really actually happen. 
20
21  And Congress was concerned with creating a segmentation 
22  of the market.  But it's entirely speculative as to 
23  whether or not people are going to start manufacturing 
24  books or other items outside the United States.

3
4  objective was to offer a reading of section 109(a) that 
would not supersede, or would not effectively negate the 
5
6  importation prohibition in section 602(a)(1), because 
7  from the Copyright Office's perspective, we agree with 
8  Mr. Olson that the primary reason for the enactment of 
9  602(a)(1) was to facilitate market segmentation.  And 
10
11 
12
13  something in the legislative history to support that? 
14
15
16  was issued in 1965, in which the Copyright Office 
17  identified as one of the circumstances that would be 
18  covered by the importation ban, the situation in which,

1  here. 
2

4  understand your argument, both here and in Quality King 
you want the copyright holder to have some control over 
5
6  importation, but at the same time you don't want the 
7  copyright holder to have control over all downstream 
8  sales.

11  Bobbs-Merrill argument is designed to do.  It's designed 
12  to prevent that.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, we lost that case 9-0, 
20
21  and so I am not arguing too vociferously that the Court 
22  should change its opinion.  But yes, we think that we 
23  still would adhere to our view that section 109(a)

6  wanted anyway?  That's really the bottom line.  We undo 
7  Quality King, except that the price is that people have 
8  to ship their manufacturing abroad. 
9
10
11  one way to accomplish the same objective.  And so --
12
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you are essentially 
13  saying that the appropriate way to read this statute, to 
14  make sense of all of its provisions, is to give the 
15
16  Wiley the ability to go after this importer, Mr. 
17  Kirtsaeng, but to find a way to stop it there? 
18
19  think our Bobbs-Merrill argument does provide a very 
principled way to stop it there without going back on 
20
21  what the Court said in Quality King.  That is, 
22  Bobbs-Merrill was a 1908 case in which the publisher 
23  sold books to retailers on the proviso that they not be 
24  sold at retail for less than a specified amount.  One of

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But you're saying
 

 And this Court in Bobbs-Merrill said --

the meaning of the earlier law.  So I don't know how --
Bobbs-Merrill wasn't a constitutional decision, it was a 
question of statutory interpretation.

7  Bobbs-Merrill means something beyond section 109, but

17  If I buy a piratical copy of a book, one that was 
18  illegally made without the consent of the copyright 
19  owner, and all I do is read it and put it on my shelf, I 
20
21  made under this title.  But I still couldn't be held 
22  liable for copyright infringement because there is no 
23  exclusive right to read the book or to own it.  I 
24  wouldn't have been infringing any of the copyright

 And so in order to have a valid claim for

13  infringement.  And I think the first argument the 
14  defendant would make is that is exactly the conduct that

18  restrictions on resale.  How can you now say it's now an 
19  infringement of the exclusive right to distribute?  And 
it would be a particularly difficult argument for the 
20
21  copyright owner to make because what the House Report 
22  said in 1909, it didn't say exactly that it was 
23  codifying the holding of Bobbs-Merrill; it said that it 
24  was amending the statute in other respects, and it 
25

wanted to make clear that there was no intent to enlarge

 And if the goods were resold in violation of

3  hypothetical, would in effect be arguing that by
 
4  codifying section 109(a), Congress had implicitly
 
expanded the scope of the implicit -- of the exclusive 
5
6  right to vend or distribute, even though it said it was 
7  doing the various opposite. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's an awfully 
8
9  difficult maze for somebody to -- to get through.  You 
have to start with the difficulty of the language here, 
10
11 
and then you have to proceed and put the Quality King 
gloss over it; and, when you finally get to that point, 
12 
13 
you say, well, now you've got to read Bobbs-Merrill and 
figure out how the common law governs all that.
14 
15
16  under anybody's reading.  That is, once a court in a 
17  case determined for whatever reason that section 109(a) 
18  was inapplicable, it didn't provide a safe harbor, the 
19  next step could never be simply to proceed to judgment 
20
21  would always have to be to look at what the defendant 
22  had done --
23
24  complicated under the Petitioner's approach.  It says 
25

and say that there was infringement.  The next step 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's not that 

 MR. STEWART:  But I think that would be true

if the manufacturer of the books had shipped them 

says that if a man be possessed of a chattel and give or 
sell his whole interest upon a condition, that condition 
is no good.  And Coke says, and that's how it should be. 

 MR. STEWART:  The other point I would make 
1
2  about the Petitioner's approach is that it -- it really 
3  has no grounding in the statutory text.  That is, the 
4  Petitioner is arguing that if the publisher in Thailand, 
5
6  directly into this country, that person could have been 
7  sued for infringement for the importation and --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the word has 
8
9  grounding.  It is Coke upon Littleton, 1628, where it

14  it's picked up in Dr. Miles.  It's been the law.
15
16  interpreting the statute, and one is consistent with 
17  that basic principle of commercial law, and the other 
18  produces some of the complexities that you have just 
19  mentioned, isn't it better to go with the common law and 
20
21  commercial law almost forever? 
 MR. STEWART:  I -- I give two answers for 
22
23  that.  And the first is that Coke was saying that, in 
24  most circumstances at least, a sale is sufficient in 
25

order to divest the owner of his prior right to control

2  necessary. 
3
4  says the hypothetical foreign publisher who makes copies 
5
6  the United States without could be held liable for 
7  infringement, there is nothing in section 109(a) that 
8  would allow a court to draw that distinction; that is, 
9  although 109(a) is sometimes referred to as a 
10
11 
12
13  owner of the books at the type -- time they were 
14  manufactured, if those books were lawfully made under 
this title, under Petitioner's reading they could be 
15
16  imported and distributed.

imported into the United States with the authorization

 I just want to step back and take a look at 

 If Bobbs-Merrill provides the content for 

1
2  what the government's doing here.  After eloquently 
3  arguing in Quality King in the last two pages of its 
4  brief that our position on the meaning of this language 
is right, it's saying our position is wrong.  And then, 
5
6  it's trying to come up with a middle ground that has 
7  absolutely no basis in the statute. 
8
9  the First Sale Doctrine, then what does section 109 do? 
And so the government is creating a scenario in which, 
10
11 
in order to save 602 from being superfluous in the way 
it is described, although we believe it's not 
12 
13 
superfluous at all, it is making 109 superfluous. 
 Justice Kagan asked a question about 
14
essentially sentence diagramming.  Our view is that 
15
16  'under this title' modifies 'lawfully.'  You use the 
17  U.S. metric of U.S. law to figure out whether it's 
18  lawful.  The government's and Wiley's position is that 
19  'under this title' modifies both 'made' and 'lawfully.' 
20
21  the same phrase to modify both terms.
