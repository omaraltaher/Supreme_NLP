SCHMIDT                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 MR. SCHMIDT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               These sentences do not offend the Eighth       Amendment. Each of these jurors was able to give          meaningful effect to anything and everything they heard        and presented in mitigation. The verdicts reflect the         reasoned moral response of these jurors to the        aggravated brutality of these crimes, the weak claims        for mitigation, and the individual assessment of each        Respondent's moral culpability.               JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree ­­ do you         agree, whatever the Eighth Amendment does not require,        that it would be better practice for the trial judge to           tell the jury what the burden is on mitigators, just to           ward off any possibility of confusion?                  MR. SCHMIDT: And, in fact, Justice       Ginsburg, that now happens in Kansas. Subsequent to         Alderson Reporting Company Official this case, the State made a decision to alter its           pattern instructions, but that'd not required by the        Eighth Amendment. In fact, the Kansas ­­                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't we presume        it's required by the State law, not the Constitution? I           mean, as I'm reading the decision below, the court is          saying that the principles of the Eighth Amendment give         voice to or support for the use of this burden and           Kansas is commanding it.                MR. SCHMIDT: Well, I think not,         Your Honor.  This decision ­­ these decisions were plainly        based on  the Kansas Supreme Court's interpretation not       of State  law, but of the Eighth Amendment. And I ­­ I              would point out a couple of reasons I believe that            conclusion is inescapable.              First, the court's conclusion, which is      indicated at page in our application, the summary of          what it did, the court indicated very plainly that it          was talking about mitigating evidence as required by the         Eighth Amendment with no reference to State law or State          practice whatsoever.              Second, this argument has been presented      previously when Kansas has been before this Court. This          Court rejected a similar argument in Kansas v. Marsh; it           rejected a similar argument in Kansas v. Cheever two          Alderson Reporting Company Official terms ago. It presumably rejected or at least not          embraced the similar argument made at the cert stage in          these cases.                          And in fact, in the Kansas v. Marsh case ­­         JUSTICE SCALIA: Did the Kansas Supreme       Court read these cases?                MR. SCHMIDT: Perhaps I ought not answer         that, Justice Scalia, but ­­                JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you explain it        if ­­ if indeed our prior cases are so clear on the            point?             don't ­­             penalty.             MR. SCHMIDT: Justice Scalia, I, of course,        JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't like the death        MR. SCHMIDT: ­­ know how to answer that         question. I can only say that this decision ­­ these            decisions clearly are based on that court's       interpretation of the Eighth Amendment.                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that can't be.       Already we know and the Kansas court knew the dissent          pointed out that a burden for mitigating circumstances         of a preponderance of the evidence is okay, so they           can't believe that no burden is required by the         Constitution. They know that there is no requirement         Alderson Reporting Company Official because the cases mentioned by you and Justice Scalia         say that. So it has to be their view of State law.                         MR. SCHMIDT: No, Your Honor, I believe it's          error, and that's why we're in front of this Court. And            if there's any question about that ­­                  JUSTICE SCALIA: I ­­ I suppose the issue is            not what they believe, but what they said.                                MR. SCHMIDT: They did in fact ­­       JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we ­­ we ­­ we           don't psychoanalyze the lower courts; we ­­ we look at          what they said. And if they said that it's the Eighth            Amendment, it's the Eighth Amendment.                 MR. SCHMIDT: In the pages of the         majority opinion on this subject in the Gleason case,         Your Honor, there are references to the Eighth          Amendment; in the dissent slightly fewer pages in total,         but references to the Eighth Amendment. And in the           Gleason decision, it's in our reply at page , the          Kansas Supreme Court rejected the notion that the        subject matter at issue here wasn't required by the         Eighth Amendment, instead, wrote both recommended      statements from the prior case, the one at issue.                     JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you prevail here on        your position, is it necessary for us to remand to the           Kansas Supreme Court to determine ­­ for them to         Alderson Reporting Company Official determine whether State law would require a different         result on this issue? I know there are some other            issues in the case, but on this issue or ­­                                 MR. SCHMIDT: Not on this issue, Your Honor.         JUSTICE KENNEDY: ­­ or are we permitted        simply to reverse outright?                MR. SCHMIDT: I believe you're permitted to         reverse outright.              JUSTICE KENNEDY: Certainly remand on some       on other issues, I understand.                  MR. SCHMIDT: Correct. We presume there        would be further proceedings below on other issues that         weren't decided in the case.                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why couldn't ­­ why       couldn't the Kansas Supreme Court say on remand, thank         you for enlightening us about the Eighth Amendment, but         we still think that Kansas law, independent of any         Federal constitutional requirement, requires juries to      be told what the burden is? They could do that on            remand.             MR. SCHMIDT: Justice Ginsburg, that would,       of course, be an issue that we would argue on remand if            it were briefed. That's not what they did here. And,            in fact, if this Court does not correct the Eighth          Amendment error, I would respectfully submit we'll never         Alderson Reporting Company Official get to that question on remand because the Eighth         Amendment, that court's interpretation of it, will       dispose of this case.                JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the other?       Didn't they say something about inadmissible hearsay       having prejudice ­­ cause prejudice in the Carr case?                     MR. SCHMIDT: In the Carr case, there was an          issue with respect to that, Justice Ginsburg. It is not           part of the questions that were presented or being         argued in front of this Court. It was, as you know, a             voluminous record with many, many issues discussed.                   The Kansas Supreme Court's decision below      should be reversed by this Court because it made two          errors. First, the Kansas Supreme Court incorrectly        found in the Eighth Amendment what the dissent called a          per se requirement. They found that there was a          requirement in the Eighth Amendment for an affirmative        instruction that mitigation need not be proven beyond a         reasonable doubt.              JUSTICE BREYER: Is there ­­ to go back to          the question that Justice Ginsburg has asked, as we say,          this Court has never held that there is an absolute          requirement that you give the reasonable doubt ­­ don't         say it's no reasonable doubt in a mitigating case, just           what you said.   Alderson Reporting Company Official MR. SCHMIDT: Correct.    JUSTICE BREYER: We send it back because, as                                 you said, they just ­­ if the law in the State is            different, they've changed it. When they changed it,         did they apply the change retroactively?                                                      MR. SCHMIDT: No, Your Honor.      And, in fact, if this Court ­­      JUSTICE BREYER: What did they say?       MR. SCHMIDT: The pattern instructions in       Kansas that would be applicable in a circumstance like          this on this subject have been changed prospectively.        And we now use them.                 JUSTICE BREYER: But that court's held it's        only prospective?                          MR. SCHMIDT: I don't believe that's been ­­         JUSTICE SCALIA: You ­­ how can you        retroactively give an instruction? Right?                  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you very simply say,        yes, have a new trial, that's how. I mean, you simply              set a new sentencing hearing ­­                  MR. SCHMIDT: But, Your Honor, of course,        there would be no need for a new trial if this Court             will correct the Eighth Amendment error, which is what         we're trying for ­­               JUSTICE BREYER: There would be a need if          Alderson Reporting Company Official Kansas law, as is now revealed by their pattern         instructions, suggests that you do have to give the         instruction that's required, that the ­­ that the        defendant wants, and you'd have to have a new sentencing           proceeding, wouldn't you?                                       MR. SCHMIDT: No, Your Honor, not ­­       JUSTICE BREYER: Why not?     MR. SCHMIDT: Not unless that instruction       were to apply retroactively in the case ­­                               JUSTICE BREYER: Yes ­­    MR. SCHMIDT: ­­ and that question, of        course, is not presented.                In fact, there are currently persons under         sentence of death in Kansas and this issue, this Eighth          Amendment issue, as our court has expressed it, is         present in of them. So two­thirds of the death            penalty cases in our State are negatively affected in         the event this Court were to decline to correct the          Eighth Amendment error and allow the Kansas court to         continue to misapply the Eighth Amendment in the manner         that it's done.               JUSTICE KAGAN: How ­­ how was the change to          the pattern instructions made? Who made it?                    MR. SCHMIDT: There's a pattern instruction        committee, Your Honor, that develops these pattern       Alderson Reporting Company Official instructions.             JUSTICE KAGAN: Is it approved by the        Supreme Court or is it divorced from the Supreme Court?                      MR. SCHMIDT: I believe that's correct, but         I ­­ I don't want to swear to that, Your Honor.                        JUSTICE KAGAN: You believe it's correct,       that it is approved by the Court.                   MR. SCHMIDT: I want to double­check on that          point, Your Honor.                                       JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay.    MR. SCHMIDT: Yes.    JUSTICE BREYER: My thinking is the       following, so you'll understand why I ask this question.          It, I think, could be the case that you're right, that            this Court has never held that the Eighth Amendment         requires giving such an instruction.                 Next question: Should it now hold it?        Well, the answer to that question could be this is not a            good case to decide that. Because it may be that the            Kansas court has held it as to the future and may apply            the future rule as to the people who are involved in             the past. Therefore, send it back.                                           What do you think of that reasoning?       MR. SCHMIDT: Well ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: Probably not much, but I'd        Alderson Reporting Company Official like to know your reasons.                 (Laughter.)             MR. SCHMIDT: Respectfully, I ­­ I share          your conclusion on that point, Justice Breyer.                   JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it true, General       Schmidt, that it makes a big difference whether this is           done under the Federal Constitution or under Kansas law?         And presumably, the Kansas Supreme Court understood that        it had the capability of basing its decision on Kansas          law. But if ­­ if it did that, it would have to take              responsibility for the decisions in these cases, which        involve some of the most horrendous murders that I have           seen in my years here. And we see practically every            death penalty case that comes up anywhere in the         country.    These have to rank as among the worst. So it           didn't take responsibility for that. It said it's the          Eighth Amendment, and we have to apply the Federal         Constitution.             Now, it may be they will say, well, we're         going to say that Kansas law requires this, but then          it's their responsibility; isn't that true?                  MR. SCHMIDT: Justice Alito, I, of course,        won't speculate on what the Kansas court was ­­ might          do. I ­­               JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I wasn't speculating        Alderson Reporting Company Official on why they did what they did, but the consequences of           basing it on the Federal Constitution. One of the          consequences of basing it on the Federal Constitution is         that they don't have to take responsibility for it.                     that ­­             MR. SCHMIDT: I have no ability to dispute          JUSTICE SCALIA: Do ­­ do you have retention         elections in Kansas?                           MR. SCHMIDT: We do, Your Honor.       JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. And the fact ­­        how ­­ how many people are there on death row in Kansas?                        MR. SCHMIDT: There are currently under         sentence, with a tenth ­­                 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which would suggest that ­­       that Kansans, unlike our Justice Breyer, do not think         the death penalty is unconstitutional and indeed very        much favor it, which might suggest that a retention          election that goes before such people would not come out          favorably for those justices who create Kansas law        that ­­ that would reverse these convictions.                               I'm just speculating, of course.     MR. SCHMIDT: Justice Scalia, all I can say          is that in these cases, it's certainly apparent to us,          and I think to any fair reading, that the Kansas court            relied on the Federal Eighth Amendment in making these         Alderson Reporting Company Official decisions, and absent correction of those occurred by        this Court will continue to do so.                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is this Court       supposed to do when it's told its own lower courts three           times before this case, or two, you must give this          instruction? What ­­ what ­­ what's the Court supposed          to do?              MR. SCHMIDT: Are you asking about what the         Kansas Supreme Court is supposed to do in that case,          Your Honor?              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. Whether the       Constitution requires it or not, it has said the better          practice is to give this instruction.                  What's a court supposed to do? Say,         willy­nilly, my lower courts can disagree with me and         not do it?               MR. SCHMIDT: Justice Sotomayor, no. And I         would leave it to the Kansas court under Kansas law and           practice. It is, of course, the supreme court of the           State to determine what the appropriate step would be         under State law. But what the Kansas court is not           supposed to do in that circumstance is pivot to the          Eighth Amendment and make a Federal decision that is          incorrect under this Court's practices.                 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. And it can't ­­        Alderson Reporting Company Official and it can't, by doing so, immunize itself from ­­ from           review in this Court. And that's Michigan v. Long,          which ­­ which ­­ which I don't know if were cited in             the brief, but Michigan v. Long, to Justice Alito's         point, made it very clear that a ­­ a State court can't              hide behind a ­­ a Federal law and ­­ and ­­ and be               immune because there might be a State law to predicate.           We have to see what they wrote. And this ­­ I assume              that Kansas would pride itself on ­­ on being cited in           other jurisdictions. And if it's wrong and it uses a           Federal calculus that's incorrect, it's ­­ it's this        Court's duty to reverse.                MR. SCHMIDT: Yes, Justice Kennedy, I       certainly agree. And to that last point on other          jurisdictions, we've identified, and they're in our       briefs, at least states that we believe are similarly           situated, where they actually impose no burden, but        don't require an affirmative instruction.                 And we believe, notwithstanding the     back­and­forth in the briefs, that the Uniform Code of         Military Justice looks much more like the Kansas system         on this point than on what the Kansas Supreme Court says           is constitutionally required.               JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose ­­ I suppose          that it is true that if you're a juror and you're            Alderson Reporting Company Official considering whether or not to grant mercy, that's not         something that's easily subject to a burden­of­proof        analysis one way or the other. If a juror thinks I have               sympathy for this person or I want to grant mercy,           that ­­ that's not really the ­­ the kind of fact like            you're ­­ you're or you're or your father did or            didn't abandon you that can be proven in ­­ with a           burden of proof of any sort.                  MR. SCHMIDT: Certainly correct,     Justice Kennedy. And, of course, a mercy instruction          was given in each of these cases. And in addition,           separate and apart from the mercy instruction issue,        this Court has in the past looked at what you've called           catch­all instructions, like the Factor K instructions        from California, has looked on them favorably. And in          these cases there was a catch­all instruction given as          well. It's an instruction on Gleason and with               respect to the Carr cases. So there was both a           belt­and­suspenders alternate option.               JUSTICE KAGAN: Sorry. What does that mean,         a "catch­all instruction"?               MR. SCHMIDT: It's the language in ­­ it's         the last paragraph of Section . It reads this way, if            I may, Justice Kagan: "You may further consider as a           mitigating circumstance any other aspect of the       Alderson Reporting Company Official defendant's character, background, or record, and any       other aspect of the offense which was presented" ­­ not          proven, presented ­­ "in either the guilt or penalty         phase which you find may serve as a basis for imposing a             sentence less than death.                And to Justice Kennedy's point, that's      clearly not a finding subject to some burden of proof.           It's an open­ended invitation to consider and weigh and         give effect to anything else these jurors think        appropriate in rendering a reasoned, moral judgment.                    JUSTICE KAGAN: Didn't the Court ­­                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm reading that from       Gleason, and that's also in Carr?                  MR. SCHMIDT: Yes, Your Honor. It's        Instruction and in Carr. Similar language. It may              not be exactly identical, but it's substantively       identical.             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Didn't the Kansas Court       say, yes, we have that, but the only burden of proof in            any of the instructions was in aggravating circumstances        and that the State bore that burden?                   And it pointed to the fact that aggravating        and mitigating were mentioned in the same clause or            times with no explanation of what the burden was for          mitigating. The Kansas Court thought that the jurors         Alderson Reporting Company Official could be confused or would be confused by what burden of           proof was needed.               MR. SCHMIDT: Justice Sotomayor, and that's       the second reason we would respectfully ask this Court         to reverse the Kansas Court, in addition to the         bright­line per se rule.                The Kansas Court reported it said it was        applying this Court's instruction from Boyde v.       California to test whether or not the Eighth Amendment         is offended by instructions that are alleged to be         ambiguous or confusing, which I think is what's         happening there.              The Kansas Court said it was applying Boyde,        but then it went on to conduct no actual Boyde analysis           other than what Your Honor points to, which is simply          the State said repeatedly, in both cases, that there is          a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the           State must prove with respect to aggravators, and also         with respect to the weighing factor.                  And the mere silence on the other side        somehow led the Kansas Court to conclude that Boyde was          violated because jurors would have inferred what was        imposed on the State must also have been imposed on the           Respondent. I just don't think that follows either          logic or natural language.    Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­ I think what          they're saying is that some jurors would be confused.         And certainly, there have been jury ­­ jury studies to          indicate that jurors are often confused, generally,       about burdens of proof.                MR. SCHMIDT: Justice Sotomayor, I certainly        agree that is what they seem to be saying, but the test            this Court has adopted and applied repeatedly since        Boyde is not that there is some speculative possibility         in a hypothetical circumstance somebody might have been         confused. It is there is a showing, that there is a             reasonable likelihood that these jurors applied their       instructions in a way that prevented them from         considering constitutionally relevant mitigation    evidence. There's no showing of it.                   JUSTICE SCALIA: It is such common sense        that there is a maxim of interpretation that invokes it.           When ­­ when somebody says interest­free loans for        people with good credit, it implies that there are not          interest­free loans for people who don't have good        credit. Inclusio unius, exclusio alterius.                  And if one says there are aggravating       factors and mitigating factors, and you must prove the         aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, the        normal understanding is you don't have to prove it         Alderson Reporting Company Official beyond a reasonable doubt for the mitigating factors.                     That's such ­­ such common reasoning that ­­       that any juror who doesn't follow it is ­­ is certainly           not the typical juror, and not the person for whom the           jury instructions have to be devised.                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the jury      instructions don't have to be devised necessarily for        the Court. They should be understandable to jurors.         And I doubt very much that any juror has heard of that             maxim.             But putting that aside, the Kansas Court,       which has much more experience than we do with trial          court decisions, has determined that confusion exists or        can exist. Why isn't that enough for us?                     MR. SCHMIDT: Your Honor, I would point you          back again to the concluding paragraph, because I think          it illustrates my response that ­­ there's suggestion of         the response throughout the record, but it illustrates        it well.              Again, back on page of the Gleason        appendix, this is what our court said: "The district          court's instruction on mitigating circumstances failed      to affirmatively inform the jury that mitigating       circumstances need not be proven beyond a reasonable         doubt." So there was silence on that point.         Alderson Reporting Company Official             Next sentence: "And the penalty phrase" ­­       "phase instructions as a whole exacerbated the error         because they referred only to the State's burden of         beyond a reasonable doubt," which, of course, will         always be true because it's constitutionally required       that the jurors be informed the State, the government         bears that burden beyond a reasonable doubt.                    The Kansas Court then concluded in the next        sentence ­­ I won't read it because I've cited it before            ­­ but under these circumstances, in other words, when         there is an instruction that the State must prove beyond          a reasonable doubt and there is silence on the other          side, we conclude there is a reasonable likelihood that          ­­ the Boyde is violated ­­ I'm summarizing, of         course ­­ it is conclusory and nothing else.                    In other words, it is back to that per se          application that was novel in the Kansas Supreme Court's         holding. They gave it the gloss of Boyde. They said            they were applying Boyde. But they misapplied this         Court's instruction from Boyde and instead merely said        here's our Boyde analysis. There's a per se violation           because there is a beyond­a­reasonable­doubt instruction       correctly for the State and silence on the other side.          No other indication of juror misapplication or       confusion. Alderson Reporting Company Official             Justice Scalia, back on the point that you        were raising. I would just say that it is ­­ perhaps             ironic is the correct word, but frustrating from the         standpoint of the government in this case ­­ the State          in this case, that we bent over backwards to make clear           to these jurors the heavy burden borne by the State.                      We did repeatedly tell them, at multiple       places, the State bears a burden to prove aggravation          beyond a reasonable doubt and to prove on the weighing           factor, and that the death penalty should be imposed.         The phrasing's in there; it's a normative phrase. It's           obviously not subject directly to a burden of proof.                      And because we told them that repeatedly to        make clear how heavy the State's burden was, that now          has turned into an argument that we somehow misled the          jury.             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the prosecutor in       Carr did tell the jury, I'm going to create reasonable          doubt as to the defendants' mitigating evidence. So         that prosecutor didn't do what you said.                   MR. SCHMIDT: Well, Justice Sotomayor, the       Carr records are very thick. And I would say on            Gleason, I think it's bright line, very clear. We           conceded the existence of all but two of those         mitigating factors that were asserted in Gleason. And         Alderson Reporting Company Official the other two merely asked was anything produced; was         there any evidence on that, which this Court has said at           least since Marsh is permissible. So I think Gleason is            a clean example on behalf of the State.                    Carr, I'd admit, is a much longer record and          has a lot more back and forth in it. You had expert              testimony and some back and forth on that.                    But even in the Carr case, this Court has         instructed since Boyde, and has done so repeatedly, that         in determining whether or not there's a reasonable         likelihood of unconstitutional juror confusion, if the       jurors thought they couldn't consider something, you       look at the context of the entire trial.                    And if you look at the overall instructions        that were given in the Carr case, you'll also see that           the Carr prosecutors ­­ and I'd refer the Court to pages            and of the Joint Appendix, as well as and             of the same ­­ the prosecutor told the Carr juries           that the jury's task is, quote, "to research and to          analyze and to distribute the information and to weigh         it and measure it and turn it upside down and look at it             backwards and to have a healthy discussion about the          relative merits of that which you have heard in this          courtroom."             And then went on at the secondary cite I         Alderson Reporting Company Official gave you to ask the jury in the Carr cases to render a             death verdict, and I quote, "Because you have looked and           listened to all the evidence, and the evidence warrants         that kind of punishment. Anything that would reduce         culpability has not been presented here."                    I offer those as examples,    Justice Sotomayor, to make the point that it is, of          course, always possible, particularly when dealing with       the transcription of oral statements made during trial,        to find a phrase here or there that, in hindsight,           perhaps was inartfully crafted.                But the overall thrust of these      instructions, the arguments of counsel, the nature of        the evidence that was put on, to Justice Kennedy's         point, was these jurors were told to consider and weigh          everything. In fact, they were literally told that         phrase in Instruction , to consider and weigh        everything admitted into evidence that would weigh on        aggravation or mitigation. It was clear they were given          an open­ended instruction, and ­­                JUSTICE KAGAN: But General, if I can         understand your argument, you're saying not only that        that analysis would come out the State's way, but you're          saying this ­­ the lower court really never did that          analysis at all, right?    Alderson Reporting Company Official             It didn't think that it was doing that        analysis. It didn't think that that analysis was         necessary because it thought that there was just a per           se rule that one had to give this instruction; is that           correct?             MR. SCHMIDT: No, Justice Kagan, that's not.        What I'm saying is that the lower court correctly         identified Boyde as the proper analysis, said that was         what it was doing, but then wholly misapplied Boyde and,          instead, conjured this per se rule.                  Their misapplication of this Court's     precedent in Boyde is what resulted in their incorrect         conclusion that the Eighth Amendment requires this sort        of per se instruction.                So it's not just that they didn't get to         what they should have done and they did something         different. It's that they tried to do what they should           have done under this Court's precedent; they just did it          wrong. And that's why we asked ­­                   JUSTICE KAGAN: I find that a little bit           confusing. It just ­­ it sounds like they just sort of            cited Boyde but failed to pay attention to anything         Boyde said about what the analysis ought to be and          instead substituted their own analysis, which was a per          se rule deriving from the Eighth Amendment.       Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. SCHMIDT: Well, except, Your Honor, to        your point about citing Boyde, they did more than cite          Boyde. They also recited some of the concepts from          Boyde. I mean, for example, the Court said ­­ and I             believe I already mentioned this passage to you ­­ our           court said that they looked at the context of the trial,           which is something that Boyde says must be done in a           proper Boyde analysis. But in their conclusion, the         prosecutor's statements made matters worse,     notwithstanding the fact it was already discussed with,        Justice Sotomayor. I just don't believe that is a fair             conclusion or an accurate conclusion.                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What a ­­ what a         wonderful system we've created. We give ­­ even when a           State court is wrong in convicting somebody, so long as          they're reasonably wrong, we uphold them. And when         they're wrong on a legal conclusion applying our test,          we jump in and reverse them, right?                   MR. SCHMIDT: Justice Sotomayor, all I can         say is on this case, our court was wrong under the           Eighth Amendment. We would ask for reversal.                    Mr. Chief Justice, with permission, I'd like       to reserve the balance of my time.                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.                   Mr. Green.  Alderson Reporting Company Official            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS IN                      NOS. ­ AND ­                MR. GREEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               I'd like to first address Justice      Sotomayor's questions, briefly.               Justice Sotomayor, you were correct, the      Kansas Supreme Court has times addressed this issue          before, not times. There was a case cited in the              submission that we made to the Court on Monday. That           submission was the objection to the jury instructions        offered by counsel for Jonathan Carr and Reginald Carr.                     In that ­­ in that objection to the ­­ or          excuse me ­­ the affirmative jury instructions offered        by those attorneys. In those affirmative instructions,        they explained that one of the reasons why they wanted          an instruction that the jury should be told no beyond a           reasonable doubt standard applies to mitigating      circumstances is ­­ is a case called Harman, and that is            cited at­­ and, again, it's in our submission ­­           Kansas from . Kansas ­­                  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that true of the        Gleason case? There was no ­­ am I right, that there             was no objection to these instructions given on        Alderson Reporting Company Official mitigators in Gleason? You pointed out in your letter          there was in Carr.                MR. GREEN: That's correct, Your Honor.       That's correct. But I submit for this ­­                     JUSTICE GINSBURG: And did you ­­ did you         ask ­­ oh, it was the court in Gleason. Was the            sentencing court asked to charge that mitigators need        not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt? Was there any            request to charge that was turned down?                   MR. GREEN: No, there was not in Gleason,         Your Honor. But, again, these cases are consolidated         for this purpose. And my friend on the other side of            the podium here has conceded that these instructions are         identical for purposes of the Eighth Amendment analysis        that ­­ that we're going to do. So we do have a             preserved objection, but it doesn't matter anyway. We         would submit, Justice Ginsburg, because Kansas has a        no­waiver rule for such failures to object in the         Gleason case, and in any event, the Kansas Supreme Court          passed on it.               But I want to get back to what Kansas said           about ­­ in the Harman case. It said that the jury            instructions were ­­ and these are the same jury         instructions here in a mandatory minimum case. Kansas          has a bifurcated proceeding in mandatory minimum cases.         Alderson Reporting Company Official These same jury instructions were confusing, and for        precisely the reason that we have here.                   Then we have the Kleypas case that comes        later. In the Kleypas case, the courts ­­ the Kansas           Supreme Court's ­­ Kansas Supreme Court's analysis is        exactly this: The instruction is okay on the unanimity          principle for Mills and McKoy purposes. So it's okay.          It's okay. But for purposes of understanding how         mitigation evidence is to work, it's confusing. No         citation to Federal authority. None whatsoever. And so          they say there should be an instruction given to every          penalty phase juror in Kansas ­­ jury in Kansas, and          that is, first, let's have the non­unanimity       instruction, then let's have the instruction that says        no beyond a reasonable doubt.                  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand the        point you're getting to. What ­­ what is your point?           That this was ­­ this decision was based on State law?                       MR. GREEN: Yes, Your Honor, that it was         based on State law.                And, in fact, if you go to Scott, the next          decision in the proceeding, Your Honor ­­ Your Honor         invited us to look at the cases. If you go to Scott,             the court says the same thing. We're reiterating what          we said in Kleypas, and by the way, we think that           Alderson Reporting Company Official implicates Federal law.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the whole         point of our decision in Michigan v. Long was to make it            clear to State courts that we weren't going to do this           kind of thing. We weren't going to try to look, well,            how many Federal cites, how many State cites. Unless          it's clear that it's based solely on State law, then we           assume it's the Federal question and Federal basis in         that case. And ­­ and I assume your friend was correct             about how many times the Eighth Amendment was ­­ was          cited in the opinion.                MR. GREEN: I think that's probably true         with respect to this decision. I would call the Court's            attention to ­­ to the Gleason Pet. App. , in which           the ­­ the core statement of the Kansas Supreme Court          there is an interpretation of Kansas State law.                                With respect to your question ­­     JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't matter under       Michigan v. Long. It's debatable whether that's a good           rule or not, but it is the rule. It says if there's any              doubt, this Court will assume that the State court was          going on the Federal ground, not the State ground.                     MR. GREEN: I understand that, Your Honor,         and I would submit that, if you look at the history of             this jury instruction rule that the Kansas Supreme Court         Alderson Reporting Company Official has announced, which originally ­­ or which ultimately        was enshrined in the Kansas pattern jury instructions,        that does rely solely on State law and solely on the           Kansas Supreme Court's decision or interpretation of its        own State law, but ­­ please.                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I was just going to          add, are you asking us to dismiss the case because          there's an adequate and independent State ground?                   MR. GREEN: I am asking you, first, to issue           an opinion that would say the origins of this rule are           not Eighth Amendment. They're in fact Kansas State law,          the Kansas Supreme Court's interpretation of its own        statute. And second, the Court might consider dismissal         of the case.               But to answer your earlier question to my        friend on the other side of the podium, Justice Kennedy,          it would be difficult to imagine a circumstance in which           this Court wouldn't say, well, you were wrong, Kansas,         about the Eighth Amendment here, and therefore we're        going to remand so you can resolve this issue about          whether or not this is in fact a Kansas Supreme Court            reading of the Kansas State law.                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if ­­ if ­­ if this          Court determines that this instruction is not confusing        as a matter of Eighth Amendment law, that surely has a            Alderson Reporting Company Official significance ­­ I would think it would have a          significance on any remand proceedings that might take        place. And plus ­­ and it has additional significance          for the other jurisdictions that use this ­­ and other          States that use this instruction. So surely we have          something significant and necessary to decide under the        Eighth Amendment.              MR. GREEN: Well, it may be that ­­ and that           is why my first alternative suggestion was that the         Court take a look at ­­ at this. And maybe this is the               case that's bracketed with Michigan v. Long. There's a          sufficient history of Kansas Supreme Court      interpretation of Kansas law that would allow the Court         to say this isn't a Michigan v. Long case. If a State               supreme court simply says, look, we have a decision          here. We think it's confusing. The history is it's an            interpretation of State law. And by the way, we have           support under Federal law that's ­­ that is not a          Michigan v. Long case.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, presumably,      the Kansas Supreme Court is familiar with Michigan v.         Long, as we are, and they're on notice that if they           start putting the Federal authorities mentioning the       Eighth Amendment times, that the court is going to           look at it as a decision based on Federal law.           Alderson Reporting Company Official             The whole point of Michigan v. Long was        that ­­ so that we wouldn't have to do what we've been            doing for the last minutes, which is to debate          whether a decision that mentions both State and Federal          law is based on State or Federal law.                    more time ­­              MR. GREEN: Well, I won't ­­ I won't waste            JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you know, if        they didn't read our Eighth Amendment cases, maybe they         also didn't read Michigan v. Long. I mean, that's           entirely understandable.              MR. GREEN: I'm going to ­­ I'm going to          demonstrate to you in a minute that they did read your            Eighth Amendment cases and that they got it right,         Justice Scalia.              JUSTICE ALITO: But would it not be true         that the Kansas issue ­­ the Kansas law issue could be           raised in a State collateral proceeding? Why is a           remand necessary?              MR. GREEN: Well, in part because if it's a          Kansas collateral proceeding, the presumption of      legality and finality would attach on direct review.        This case is still on direct review. And so I would             submit, Justice Alito, that the Kansas Supreme Court        ought to have the opportunity in the first instance to          Alderson Reporting Company Official sort this out.               JUSTICE ALITO: In the ordinary case, let's        say a State Supreme Court decides an issue. They make            no ­­ they make no reference whatsoever to State law.          They based it on the Federal Constitution. It comes up           here; we reverse. We would not remand and say, well,           you didn't say anything about State law, but it's         possible that you might want to find that the same rule           applies under State law. We wouldn't do it in that           situation, would we? In every case like that we would           remand?             MR. GREEN: I don't know about every case,          but I can imagine that the Court would want to go back             and say, well, look, Federal law doesn't work this way,          but it ­­ but, you know, Kansas Supreme Court or State           supreme court, if you think it works another way, fine.                      JUSTICE ALITO: Well, is that what we have         done in such cases? We've remanded all of those for           them to say, well, you didn't mention State law, but          maybe you want to think about State law?                    MR. GREEN: I haven't seen a case like that.            But to go to the Chief Justice's question, Michigan v.          Long was ­­ was kind of the reverse of this case. It             wasn't using Eighth Amendment jurisprudence to support       or Federal jurisprudence just to support to add        Alderson Reporting Company Official additional weight to the decision. It was the basis of           the decision.              JUSTICE ALITO: All right. If we assume for          the sake of argument that we would not do that in every            case, then what you are proposing is that we do it here            because you think there's a sufficient ­­ there's         sufficient uncertainty about the basis for the decision.        And then we're going to get into the situation in all of            these cases of deciding, is there enough? Well, they          cited some State cases, they might ­­ we're going to          have to be making these decisions in every one of these           cases.             MR. GREEN: Well, I would submit that this          would be such a case, especially given the history of ­­           of the Kansas Supreme Court's decisions on this issue         interpreting its own statue.                            But if I might, Your Honor ­­       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The other States that       have no mitigating burden, do you know how many of them           require an instruction just like this one?                   MR. GREEN: Yes. We cited in our brief          at ­­ our Gleason brief at pages, I think, and ,             Your Honor, that ­­ that there are States that          expressly require a statement to the jury about what the           burden of proof is with respect to mitigating        Alderson Reporting Company Official circumstances. That is out of states remaining in          the United States that have the death penalty, Your         Honor.             JUSTICE KAGAN: You're not saying that       that's required by the Eighth Amendment; is that right?         You're not advocating a per se rule that such          instructions are necessary.               MR. GREEN: No. That's right, Justice        Kagan. We're not ­­ we're not advocating that kind of           per se rule. In fact, one could imagine a set of             circumstances ­­ a set of instructions that are silent          with respect to mitigation, but nonetheless would pass        muster under the Eighth Amendment.                 JUSTICE KAGAN: So could I ­­ could I talk            about the circumstances of this case?                              MR. GREEN: Please.    JUSTICE KAGAN: Which is, you know, you have         an instruction here that is unfortunate in its        juxtaposition of the reasonable doubt standard and the        reference to mitigating circumstances. And, you know,        it is unfortunate, and I can see why they changed their            pattern instructions.              But ­­ but we've said that the analysis is a          holistic one. We look at everything. You also have           this mercy instruction. You have a catch­all         Alderson Reporting Company Official instruction. You have, in both cases, arguments by the          prosecutors that indicate fairly clearly that this is        really all up to the jurors in Gleason. It says,           "Mitigating circumstances are every juror's individual      choice." In ­­ in Carr, the prosecutor says, "Anything          in fairness may be considered as extenuating."                   So I guess the question is, even if this is           a really unfortunate wording in the reasonable       doubt/mitigating circumstances juxtaposition, why    doesn't all of this other stuff indicate that no juror          was likely to be confused?                 MR. GREEN: Because the unfortunate wording       that Your Honor refers to is repeated throughout these         instructions. Please let me demonstrate here. With ­­         with respect to the findings of ­­ findings of         aggravating circumstances, every time the Court is told        that it must find aggravating circumstances beyond a        reasonable doubt, the same sentence says, "And any        mitigating circumstances found to exist."                 There is repeated parallelism in these ­­ in        these instructions with respect to the use of the verbs.          Let's go to Justice Scalia's point earlier with respect         to what a reasonable juror would have known. The           juror ­­ if you look at Instruction No. , Instruction          No. says that ­­ reminds the jury that the ­­           Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which ­­ which case? In         which case, Gleason?               MR. GREEN: Yes. I'm sorry, Your Honor.         This would be in our Gleason app, Appendix (a).         Instruction No. says that when a Defendant ­­ excuse            me. "The laws of Kansas provide that a separate           sentencing proceeding shall be conducted when a       Defendant has been found guilty."                 Now, the verb "find" or "finding" appears        times in the ­­ throughout the instructions saying that         the jury must find mitigating circumstances. Three        times in the instructions, at crucial points in ­­ in          Instruction No. , which I'll ask us to look at in a            minute, and Instruction No. , which is the verdict,         the jury is referred to ­­ or the jury is asked to make             findings with respect to aggravating circumstances. So        it's the same exercise throughout.                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the jury was also        aware that there was a big difference between         aggravators and mitigators. They were told they had to          be unanimous on the ­­ on the aggravators. But on           mitigators, each jury ­­ each juror was to make the          determination for herself and, moreover, that the same        mitigator need not be found by all the jurors. So           the ­­ the aggravators, unanimous, they all have to         Alderson Reporting Company Official agree on the aggravated. Mitigator, one could say this          one, the other could say that one, and that would be           okay.             MR. GREEN: Well, I might agree with that,          Your Honor, except for the jury was expressly told in          Instruction No. that ­­ that with respect to          mitigators, it didn't have to be unanimous. However,         the jury ­­ the instructions went on. It continued to           draw parallels with respect to the burden of proof         between finding mitigators and finding aggravators.                  JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you ­­ don't you        think it's ­­ it's sort of hard to contemplate each          juror ­­ each juror's ability to find mitigators on his          or her own without regard to whether others find the          same mitigator? Isn't that somewhat incompatible       with ­­ with the juror's belief that the juror had to           find it beyond a reasonable doubt? My goodness, if it's            beyond a reasonable doubt, you would think every other          juror would find the same mitigator, and they were         expressly told that they don't have to find the same          mitigator.             MR. GREEN: Beyond a reasonable doubt is the          only ­­ the only standard that the jury is offered, Your           Honor. It's the only one that they know. It's the one             that they've sat through the guilt phase with. It's now           Alderson Reporting Company Official the one that they're trying to apply in the sentencing          phase, executing a moral ­­ pardon the pun ­­ executing           a moral judgment as to whether a defendant should live           or die.              So with respect to what jurors might say to         one another in the jury room, one can imagine a          situation where one juror says, mercy, I'm not ­­ you          know, maybe there should be mercy. Another ­­ another          juror says to that juror, well, I didn't ­­ I didn't see              enough evidence for that. I mean, are you certain mercy            should be applied here? No. You know, you have to be             certain that mercy applies here.                   I don't think that's a farfetched notion at        all, especially when you look at an instruction like No.          , which is on page A of the Joint Appendix. And            Instruction draws an express parallel and uses the         verb "to find," Your Honor. "If you find unanimously          beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more aggravating          circumstances exist and that they are not outweighed by         any mitigating circumstances found to exist, then you        shall impose a sentence of death."                   Let's jump down to the next paragraph. The         next paragraph says, "However" ­­                JUSTICE SCALIA: Where are you quoting from?                    MR. GREEN: I'm sorry. Page A of the          Alderson Reporting Company Official Gleason Appendix ­­                          JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, the Gleason.      MR. GREEN: ­­ red ­­ red brief. My          apologies, Your Honor.                           The next paragraph says ­­    JUSTICE KENNEDY: You put it in the red         brief. It's also in the petition for writ of certiorari           appendix, the white appendix. Gleason , page of          the white.              MR. GREEN: The second paragraph of       Instruction No. says, "However, if one or more juries          is not" ­­ "jurors is not persuaded beyond a reasonable           doubt on the burden of proof in the paragraph above."                      So, again, the jury is called to look at the          beyond the reasonable doubt standard when assessing both        aggravating and mitigating circumstances in parallel.      And, again, this is the only ­­ this is the only           standard that the jury has been exposed to throughout         the trial.              JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your proposal is that ­­       is that the floor was not telling them, mitigators don't          have to be shown beyond a reasonable doubt. But that            still doesn't tell the jury what the burden of proof is           on mitigators.              Why are you urging beyond ­­ you don't have         Alderson Reporting Company Official to find beyond a reasonable doubt. Okay. So what do             you have to find in order to accept a mitigator?                       MR. GREEN: It doesn't expressly say that        and ­­ Justice Ginsburg. That's the whole problem, is          that I ­­ I respectfully disagree with Justice Scalia.           A lawyer might look at these instructions and say, aha,          the fact that there is an absence or a silence with            respect to what the burden of proof is as to mitigating           instructions creates a negative implication.                  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I have the same         question. Suppose the jury is instructed you ­­        mitigators do not have to be proved beyond a reasonable           doubt. And then the jury sends a question, well, what            is the burden of proof on mitigators? How should the           trial judge answer that?                MR. GREEN: In Kansas, the answer is, it's a          burden of production and a burden of production only.          And all that means is ­­                 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're asking under the       Eighth Amendment ­­ or at least that's my interest ­­         under the Eighth Amendment, what is required in response         to Justice Alito's question? I didn't mean to          interrupt.             MR. GREEN: Well, it may be just the         negative, that there is no ­­ that there is no burden           Alderson Reporting Company Official of ­­ there is no burden of proof, and each of you as             individual jurors should consider all of the evidence.        I mean, it's about weighing and ­­ and maybe the judge           could say to the jury, you should ­­ you should consider           and you should weigh all of the evidence that the          defendant ­­             JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. It's not a matter ­­          we're asking the factual finding of whether the        mitigator existed, not weighing the mitigators against       the aggravators, the factual finding of whether the        mitigator existed, whether indeed this defendant had a        troubled childhood or whatever else. What is the burden          that the juror has to sustain in order to come to that            judgment?             MR. GREEN: Well, consistent with ­­ with        Woodson and Lockett and that ­­ that entire line of          cases, that ­­ that ­­ the exact language is, is the           jury can't be precluded from considering any relevant        mitigating circumstances.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So anything ­­      anything that was presented to them. I think you said            earlier burden of production.                            MR. GREEN: Any ­­ any ­­      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what       the instruction said. When you're considering       Alderson Reporting Company Official mitigating circumstance, you ­­ back on any aspect of         the offense which was presented in either the guilt or          penalty phase. If it was presented to the jury, they           should consider it. I don't ­­                   MR. GREEN: Well, but that ­­ that        doesn't ­­ I mean, that doesn't speak to the burden of            proof. It ­­ and it does relate to both aggravating and            mitigating circumstances.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it says they        have to consider anything that was presented, not things         they found beyond a reasonable doubt. If it was           presented, they need ­­ they can consider it.                    MR. GREEN: If the ­­ if the instruction         said that alone, then the instructions might be okay.         And that's precisely why we're answering Justice Kagan's        question that we're not saying that the Eighth Amendment         commands that juries be instructed ­­                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the instruction       said something that you think is okay, and consider         evidence that's presented. But you say, well, we have          to draw a negative inference from what it said about           aggravating circumstances to outweigh what would have       been an acceptable instruction on its own.                   MR. GREEN: I ­­ I'm saying that ­­ that           consistent drawing of parallels between the two without        Alderson Reporting Company Official stating exactly what the burden of proof is with respect          to mitigating circumstance creates a reasonable       likelihood that there would be confusion.                                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       MR. GREEN: Thank you.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Katyal.                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL          ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN CASE NO. ­                     MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,        and may it please the Court:                    A man is being put to death under jury        instructions that are so confusing that there is a         reasonable likelihood that some juries would interpret       those instructions to bar consideration of the       mitigating evidence and others would not. That        ambiguity and inequity is impermissible under the Eighth        Amendment.             Now, the State's answer is the instructions       allowed the jury in a catch­all provision to consider          everything as mitigating. That's irrelevant. There are         two fundamentally different questions. The first is the         "what." What kinds of circumstances count as        mitigating? And second is the "how." How does a jury             determine if those circumstances exist in a given case.          So ­­ Alderson Reporting Company Official             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The circumstances ­­      the circumstances that count as ­­ as mitigating, (a)         of the ­­ the Gleason brief, "any other aspect of the           defendant's character, background or record, and any       other aspect of the offense which was presented."                    MR. KATYAL: Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice. We         agree that, for example, the jury was instructed that         Reginald Carr's child abuse, if it existed, could be a          mitigating factor. The question is: How was a jury to             determine whether Reginald Carr was abused in the first         place as a child?                 So the catch­all provision doesn't answer      that question.              Now, General Schmidt's answer is, well, look       at the language of instruction . And, Mr. Chief          Justice, I think you were referring to that. This is            what they say ­­ what he says in their reply brief at            page ­­             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I was          quoting from .                           as .              MR. KATYAL: Okay.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe it's the same        MR. KATYAL: In ­­ in ­­ in , I don't                see quite the same thing. But ­­ but I ­­ I think               Alderson Reporting Company Official our ­­ out general point here is that this Court has           said repeatedly in Abdul­Kabir and in Braverman that the         mere presentation of evidence is enough. The evidence         has to be given full effect as a mitigating          circumstance.             And I understand that different people can        look at this ­­ these set of instructions as a whole and             come up with different ways of interpreting them. But          this Court's decision in Boyde says as long as there is           a reasonable likelihood that a jury could read them in a            confusing way and bar the consideration of mitigating        evidence, that is enough.                Now, Justice Scalia, you said, well, that       doesn't square with common sense. What about an example          like, quote, "interest­free loans for people with good        credit"?             Now, our argument is not simply that the        jury instruction said beyond a reasonable doubt, though         they did times. It's that they coupled the beyond a             reasonable doubt with the language found to exist, that         mitigating circumstances must be found to exist times.          And so, Justice Scalia ­­                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you say       something ­­ if you're considering whether to retire,        you said you should be absolutely sure you have enough          Alderson Reporting Company Official money to live on and you ought to think about whether           you're going to be bored.                             MR. GREEN: Well ­­    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You wouldn't think       you had to be absolutely sure you were going to be           bored.             MR. GREEN: Well, let me just do it,         Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to the ­­ the         hypothetical that Justice Scalia said. If ­­ if the          hypo was interest­free loans should be given to those         found to have good credit, found to have good credit,          which mirrors these instructions, and then the language        used found with a certain standard beyond a reasonable           doubt, or whatever, I think it's absolutely plausible         that people would read that instruction and say that         applies just as much to people without good credit.         They'd apply the same standard. And that squares not          just with the experience in the States. At least           States are using this, if ­­ if not every State. They            can't point to a single State that says found to exist            occurs in the jury instructions times. It's not just            the absence of an affirmative instruction, it's that        these instructions are injecting confusion and      uncertainty.             And the distinction here is that you can        Alderson Reporting Company Official have two men going to ­­ having committed virtually the          same crime with the same aggravating and mitigating        circumstances; one will be sentenced to death, one to         life, simply because of a legal interpretation of what          the jury instructions say. That is not ­­                     JUSTICE ALITO: If were on a ­­ I'm sorry.          Finish the sentence.               MR. KATYAL: I was just going to say, that           is not death for the worst offender, Mr. ­­ Justice          Alito, that's ­­ that's ­­ that's the death penalty to          be imposed for the worst interpretation of jury        instructions.             JUSTICE ALITO: If ­­ if I were on a jury             and I were told that the burden ­­ that mitigators do            not have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, I would             find that confusing because then I would ask what is           the ­­ the burden of proof on mitigators? And I don't             think there's any way, really, to answer that question.         So maybe this is a situation like trying to define           reasonable doubt where less is more. It's better not to           get into the question of burden of proof at all.                      And let me ­­ just to finish this ­­ this          suggestion, and maybe it's misdirected, but you       mentioned the mitigator of ­­ of child abuse. What          would ­­ if there is any burden of proof, what would be            Alderson Reporting Company Official the fact as to which it would apply? The overall           category that this person had a bad childhood or that           the ­­ the individual was beaten by his mother or beaten           by his father or subjected to sexual abuse or was around           people who were using drugs? Unless you define what the           mitigators are, which can't be done, I don't see how you            can apply any kind of burden of proof.                    MR. KATYAL: Well, Justice Alito, I think         this Court has never said that if jury instructions are,          by silence, confusing, that that silence alone is enough         to rise to an Eighth Amendment violation. Here, our          point is that the instructions themselves injected the        confusion. And so I don't think this Court is going to             police every possible thing that the jury might thought         in their heads. The point is here they mentioned only           one standard, beyond a reasonable doubt. They mentioned          it times. And they said that the mitigating           circumstances had to be found to exist.                   If the jury interpreted it this way, then        this Court ­­ then the Court would be blessing a jury            instruction on beyond a reasonable doubt for the first          time ever in its history that said that a jury, all             of them, might have believed mitigating circumstances       actually existed and could not give it effect. That is           what the effect of ­­    Alderson Reporting Company Official             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What ­­ what burden        of proof do you think the jury applied with respect to           the showing of mercy?                            MR. KATYAL: Well ­­    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They were clearly       instructed that they can show mercy. So what ­­ they           didn't say anything about the burden of proof.                    MR. KATYAL: And Mr. Chief Justice, they        were clearly instructed that mercy was a, quote, "a         mitigating factor." And so they were then told times            that they had to find a mitigating factor.                     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think they        had ­­ they would have interpreted that I have to           determine whether to extend mercy beyond a reasonable         doubt?             MR. KATYAL: Absolutely, Your Honor. I        think this Court has said many times that we presume a           jury follows its instructions, and this is a perfect          example of that ­­               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know. But         you're ­­ you're begging the question to say the         instruction was this and the jury didn't follow it.                     MR. KATYAL: I don't ­­ I don't think so,            Mr. Chief Justice. I think this is a perfect example of              how mercy would have been applied beyond a reasonable          Alderson Reporting Company Official doubt. If there was case for mercy after reading all of            the ­­ all the sentencing proceedings, it was that         Reginald Carr had been abused badly as a child. And            that's why mercy should have extended. We are ­­ we're           talking about death­qualified jurors here who already       can't extend mercy just simply because death is on the          line. There had to be something additional. That          something additional, in the context of this case, was         all about the child abuse of Reginald Carr.                    And, Justice Kagan, that's exactly what the       State, time and again, Joint Appendix pages to ,          said that ­­ that Reginald Carr did not meet his burden           of proof on. And so this was front and center at the             mitigating phase of the trial. This was extremely         confusing, I think, to a jury. And, of course, this             Court's decision in Boyde has a far lower standard than           that. It's simply just was there something more than a           possibility, it doesn't even have to be percent, that          the jury interpreted the instructions the wrong way.                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, Kansas has       already answered this question, hasn't it? Its        requirement is that a jury be instructed both that          mitigation need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,          and, second, that the jury be told it has no ­­ that            there is no burden of proof.      Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. KATYAL: Exactly. And just like in         Maryland v. Mills where this Court, under the Eighth         Amendment, looked to that, here it's significant that        not even Kansas is defending the rule that these jury          instructions left the jury with the impression of. I          mean, indeed, I'm not aware of a single State that does            so. There's no amici on the State's side saying that           this is going to impose any sort of harm to them. This             is the most modest fix in the world. It could be done             not just with an affirmative instruction, it could be         done by just striking out the words "found to exist" out           of the jury instructions.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you think        the jury ­­ if you ­­ are they supposed to consider           things they didn't find to exist?                              MR. KATYAL: Oh, no.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it's a bit           of a stretch to say found to exist implies a particular             standard of proof.               MR. KATYAL: I don't think so at all, Your           Honor. I think found to exist, that's the most natural            way of reading it. And if there's any doubt, just look            at Instruction No. . The first thing the jury was told            ­­ this is at Petition Appendix page of the Reginald           Carr petition. "The laws of Kansas provide a separate           Alderson Reporting Company Official sentencing proceeding shall be conducted when a       defendant has been found guilty of capital murder."                    That's what they're told after hearing      months of testimony about whether or not the Carrs         committed the crime under what standard? The        beyond­a­reasonable­doubt standard.              That was the only thing the jury was told,         time and again, both at the guilt phases, the times in             the mitigating phase of this trial. It thinks ­­ it's           absolutely reasonable for a jury to have interpreted the          jury instructions to say that's the standard that        applies here.              And boy, if that's the standard that applied        in this case, that is unlike any proceeding in         Anglo­American jurisprudence to my knowledge.                 JUSTICE ALITO: What does it mean to say         there's no burden of proof?                 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think it means that ­­          that ­­             JUSTICE ALITO: Every juror decides      individually?             MR. KATYAL: I think that ­­ in Kansas, I           think that's right. Now, of course you could have          minimum thresholds, evidence, and relevance, and so on,        as this Court's decision in Tennard said.       Alderson Reporting Company Official             This is the opposite. This is the highest         standard in all of law, beyond a reasonable doubt. It's            never been done. And these jury instructions did so.                      And look, I understand that we could read         these facts and say these are horrific crimes, as you          said, Justice Alito. But so, too, Reginald Carr had a           horrific upbringing. And I think the jury was entitled,           and this Court's decision in Stringer says, that it is          ­­ when ­­ when the injection of an arbitrary factor is           put in and two juries could reach different results on          the same facts, that violates the Eighth Amendment.                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Case ­ is ­­ oh, I'm sorry. You have          rebuttal time.              (Laughter.)             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have, in fact,        four minutes of it.              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEREK L. SCHMIDT                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 MR. SCHMIDT: Mr. Chief Justice, I'm anxious        on the point. Thank you.                  Two or three points as time allows,       Mr. Chief Justice.               First on Mr. Katyal's point that the issue        here is the how and not the what. I would come back to               Alderson Reporting Company Official the point that there was both a catch­all and a mercy             instruction here. And I would further point this Court           to what this Court has suggested in the past.                     This Court has fairly consistently suggested      that the cure to a Lockett type of error, that there was             something presented that might not have been able to be          given effect, would be catch­all or mercy types of         instructions.             And I would refer you to pages and of            Penry where it wasn't the Court, but it was defense            who requested a mercy instruction that was not granted.          And as a result, the case wound up in front of this             Court.             But also suggest that you look at page         on Penry where this Court suggested ­­        Justice O'Connor writing ­­ that a catch­all instruction         well­crafted would have been the cure for the error this          Court found in Penry .                   A similar implication at page in      Abdul­Kabir, and a similar implication in page of          Blystone. So I think Kansas has done here precisely           what the Court has repeatedly suggested ­­                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is the ­­ I know it's           your rebuttal. What's the catch­all instruction you        rely on?  Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. SCHMIDT: The catch­all instruction is       the last paragraph of Instruction No. .                               JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of . Of . Thank you.           MR. SCHMIDT: Yes. Correct. And the mercy          instruction is earlier. I believe it's the second          paragraph in Gleason.               Secondly, with respect to Justice Ginsburg's      observation that there ­­ a juror would have noticed          that there's a different between the use of finding with           respect to unanimity, or finding in another context,        suggesting that this argument's not very persuasive,       that the mere use of the word "find" repeatedly somehow          created confusion, I think that's correct. And I think            there's other contrast in this record that shows it.                     For example, with respect to the verdict       forms. In those cases where the beyond a reasonable           doubt language is included, finding is included with        respect to both aggravation and mitigation, but the        jurors were asked to check the box on what aggravators          they had found. They weren't asked to do anything like           that with respect to mitigators.                 Now, a lay juror, being asked to do one task           for one purpose and a different task for a different            purpose, is not likely to conclude that the two tasks          are in some way equivalent.     Alderson Reporting Company Official             Likewise, to the point that was suggested       earlier, Mr. Katyal correctly points out that the mercy         instruction is described as a mitigating circumstance.        That's absolutely true, but it certainly doesn't follow        that the jury would have thought that they have to apply           some burden of proof to mercy. It's an act of grace.            That's the entire point of mercy. And that further          suggests that it wasn't reasonable to conclude that        reading these words "find" time and again somehow led         them to an equivocal ­­ an equivalent understanding of         how they ought to be used.                  Third, with respect to the Kleypas decision,       I am well on it, but this is back to the point that was              referenced by Mr. Green on the Kansas Supreme Court's         referencing of Kansas case law. I would merely point           this Court to what this Court itself said in rejecting          precisely the same argument in the Marsh case ­­ it's at           page ­­ where the Court ultimately concluded Kleypas         itself ­­ State law case that they draw upon ­­ Kleypas           itself rested on Federal law. And the same is true           here.             The Kansas ­­              JUSTICE BREYER: Harman didn't.                 MR. SCHMIDT: I'm sorry?                 JUSTICE BREYER: Harman didn't.     Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. SCHMIDT: That's correct. Harman was        not a death penalty case. It was a pre­death penalty             case ­­             JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But they say just          what they said here.                MR. SCHMIDT: And beyond that, Harman was a          case, barely after this Court ­­                  JUSTICE BREYER: But then as a succession of          references back.              MR. SCHMIDT: No. But the point, Your         Honor, is that when the Kansas Supreme Court talked         about Harman, this Court only three years previously had         laid down the rule that governs this case.                    It is now well developed what the Eighth        Amendment rule is. Harman doesn't say anything about         what this Court has been asked to decide.                    And finally, I would urge the Court to end,          I suppose, where we began, which is there's Eighth         Amendment error here. And absent correction of that         Eighth Amendment error by this Court, it will be the          Eighth Amendment interpretation given by the Kansas       Supreme Court that disposes of this case, disposes of         the other similarly situated cases in Kansas ­­                   JUSTICE BREYER: As we said this ­­ so as we           said, just that. Four sentences you quote, they're         Alderson Reporting Company Official wrong.             Now, as to whether the ­­ the instruction in         content here was too confusing because of the placement         all the arguments you heard, they didn't really go into          that. Nor did they really go into the question of State            law. Nor did they get into the question of whether the            new State law is retroactive.                 All those remain open on remand for the        parties to ask the Court to consider it, and if the           Court decides it's appropriate to raise it at that time,          to consider it. Is that satisfactory to you?                     MR. SCHMIDT: No, Justice Breyer.      Obviously, we'll deal with whatever State law questions        may arise subsequently. But this was ­­                   JUSTICE BREYER: Not just State law, it's        the confusion. Sorry. Go ahead. Forget it.                        I wanted to know if it's satisfactory. The        answer is no.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Case ­ is submitted, and we will hear        the second question in the other two cases in a moment.
