(10:03 a.m.) 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
this morning in Case 11-204, Christopher v. SmithKline 
Beecham. 

Mr. Goldstein. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court: 

In the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress 

directed the Secretary of Labor to quote/unquote "define 
and delimit" the statute's outside salesman exemption. 
By regulation, the Secretary provided that an outside 
salesman is one who makes sales rather than promoting 
sales by others.  In further guidance, the Secretary 
elaborated that nonexempt promotion includes either, 
one, a conversation where there can be no commitment or, 
two, one where there will be no exchange with the 
employer. 

Now, everyone agrees that a pharmaceutical 

detailer engages in promotion.  They tout drugs to 
doctors.  Everyone agrees that there can't be a 
commitment to issue a prescription.  Everyone agrees 
that a prescription is not an exchange with a

pharmaceutical company.  But nonetheless, the Respondent 
argues that pharmaceutical detailers sell drugs directly 
to doctors as a matter of law.  They say that follows 
from the fact that the Secretary's regulation 
incorporates the definition of "sale" in the FLSA, which 
is in the blue brief in the appendix at page 1. 

That definition, which is section 203(k), 

provides -- it's the second provision on the page --
"'sale' or 'sell' includes any sale, exchange, contract 
to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or 
other disposition."  And what you will not find in that 
language is anything that contradicts the two points the 
Secretary has made, which is that there has to be a 
commitment or that, at the very least, there has to be 
an exchange with the employer. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, is that consistent 

with the Government's argument?  They argue, quote, "an 
employee does not make a 'sale' for purposes of the 
'outside salesman' exemption unless he actually 
transfers title to the property at issue."  The statute 
refers to a consignment for sale.  When that occurs, 
does -- does the consignor actually transfer title to 
the property at issue? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is an arrangement for 

transfer of title, and that's why it's critical that it

says a consignment for sale, the sale being the transfer 
of title.  But in all events, this case is not a fight 
about transferring title or some lesser form of 
exchange, because there's no exchange between the doctor 
and the --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I understand that, but I 

would appreciate an answer --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- to my question. 
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Is the Government's position 

consistent with the reference to consignment for sale? 
When a consignment for sale occurs, is there a transfer 
of title? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  There is an agreement for a 

transfer of title, and I believe there --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there a -- a transfer of 

title? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize.  There is not a 

transfer of title, but there is an agreement for a 
transfer of title.  They -- just to be clear, the 
Government says the definition of "sale" includes a 
transfer of title.  And so, all I'm pointing out, if I 
could just go back to the definition -- I apologize for 
not answering --

about -- about their position.

I've created some --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  I -- I don't 
agree that there's an agreement for transfer of title. 
Where there's a consignment, you give the property to 
somebody, and he says I will sell it to somebody if 
somebody will buy it. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is no agreement to 

transfer title. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  There is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's purely a future 
contingency.  If someone will buy it, I will sell 
them -- sell it to that person on your account.

allow you -- I apologize saying "I will allow you."

The Government can explain it --
JUSTICE ALITO:  No, not really, but 

anyway, go ahead. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  All right.  It is --

the statute refers to a consignment for sale.  I believe 
they're defining a sale in that phrase.  But in all 
events, the debate over whether it includes or is 
limited to a transfer of title is not at issue in this 
case, because what the -- because all the statute 
requires is that there, at the very least, be some 
exchange of some part.  There's going to be an -- a 
binding agreement, a commitment, and that commitment 
will involve an exchange with the employer.  What 
happens in pharmaceutical detailing is that there can't 
be any commitment to issue a prescription at all --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because -- because the 

limitation on sale is they can't sell -- by Federal law, 
they can't sell.  And you -- you are debating about 
exchange, sale.  What strikes one about this case is 
that these are workers -- they work autonomously.  They 
don't clock in and out.  They work outside the 
workplace.  After they're trained, they have minimal 
supervision. 

Is there any other category of exempt

workers that have that kind of autonomy and yet come 
under the wage and hours law? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I'm sorry.  So, your premise 

is that they are exempt to begin with?  There -- I can 
tell you that there are a large number of employees who 
do work outside the workplace and are substantially more 
autonomous than are pharmaceutical detailers, who have 
to operate from very strict scripts.  There are -- it's 
literally --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  For example, what are 

the -- that's what I wanted to know.  What are the 
categories of people that seem to be autonomous, not the 
type that clocks in and out? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.  Well, you can have 

emergency service workers that are working outside. 
There are lots of people -- so, for example, you may 
well --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't 

understand what that is. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's an emergency service 

worker? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  A police officer or a 
fireman, an ambulance driver.  They are constantly 
outside the office.  You can also have lots of different

kinds of promotion --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  They're not on 
duty all the time.  Aren't -- don't they have hours of 
duty?  My goodness.  Some of them make enormous overtime 
wages because they've put in hours beyond their regular 
hours of duty --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, that -- my --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  These people have no hours 

of duty. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is not quite right, 

Justice Scalia.  They are expected -- the joint appendix 
explains -- to be in the doctors' offices between 8:30 
and 5:00 p.m.  They work additional time.  The fact 
that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, doesn't that 

just -- I mean, that's when the doctors are there. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's -- but that is when 

they are supposed to be in the doctors' offices.  That's 
dictated by the company. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about -- what about 
the extras?  I mean, we're told that part of this job is 
to have a good relationship with the doctors.  It 
includes dinners.  It may be conventions. 
Entertainment, maybe golf.  If -- if you're right, would 
the time on the golf course get time and a half?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, a couple things about 

that, Justice Ginsburg. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  There actually are very 

strict restrictions.  That kind of activity is under the 
PhRMA Code, which is trying to interpret Federal law, is 
actually very heavily restricted.  But whatever it is 
that the employee is doing to further the employment 
relationship is going to be hours on duty.  It is really 
important I think that while it is true that a 
pharmaceutical detailer has many of the characteristics 
of an outside salesman, the one they don't have is 
selling. 

And that is the line that Congress drew. 

It --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You were -- you were 

giving examples, and we just stopped at --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- emergency service 

worker.  But you said there are many examples --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- of people who are 

highly autonomous and still come under the hours 
regulation. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.  Another example would

be insurance adjusters.  There are people who are 
outside cleaning people that are not -- that don't have 
any --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And these are all -- these 

are all within the Fair Labor Standards Act? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  Yes, Justice Kennedy, 

they absolutely are. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there any occupations 

or pursuits that are not covered by the Fair Labor 
Standards Act because -- on the rationale that they are 
out, that they are unsupervised, and so forth.  In other 
words, if you were arguing the case of the Respondent, 
would you -- would you have any close analogies to areas 
that are not -- that are exempt; in other words, they 
wouldn't be salesmen, but there'd be some other 
classifications to fit them in? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I would, but they would all 
be one of two things.  They would either fall within the 
administrative exemption, which is, Justice Ginsburg, 
what is -- Congress was talking about when it talked about 
people who have a lot of autonomy, and which is not true 
of detailers -- or some other exemption.  So, to give an 
example, certain outside buyers are exempt under the 
Fair Labor Standards Act.  A good -- that's a good 
example, because if you're an outside buyer of poultry,

then you are exempt, but if you are an outside buyer of 
meat, you aren't. 

It is one of a lot of different places --

there are 50-some exemptions from the Fair Labor 
Standards Act.  And Congress drew incredibly fine lines. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Congress can draw -- draw 

even silly lines. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If Congress draws it, it's 

a line.  But the line you're suggesting here -- both 
your brief and the Government's, as I recall, say, my 
goodness, if we find for the Respondent here, there'll 
be so much uncertainty in the future.  I'm not sure 
there isn't a lot of uncertainty if we -- if we find in 
your direction. 

Now, let me give you an example.  One of my 

law clerks -- my law clerks supplement my sparse life 
experience. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  One of my law clerks is 

familiar with the -- the framing business.  Okay?  Now, 
salesmen of frames do not sell the frames at the time 
that they visit the -- the framing company or the 
framing store.  They get a commitment that in the 
future, that person will order from the framing company.

Now, is that a sale? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is a sale, but the 

difference here is that there's neither a commitment --
remember, the commitment is illegal as a matter of law. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but there is a 

commitment.  There is a commitment to -- what they're 
trying to get is a commitment to consider this drug if 
it's appropriate for prescription to patients in the 
future.  That's a commitment. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Scalia, if that is 
the commitment, then all of promotion I think is going 
to be a sale, because every promoter who walks up to you 
on the street saying will you try my product, will you 
go into the store, is trying to get you to say I'll go 
in.  And that is much more of a direct commitment than 
you saying I'll consider it in an appropriate 
circumstance. 

The commitment by a doctor is precatory at 
most.  They do not make any commitment in any instance 
that can be binding in any way that they will prescribe 
a drug for anyone. 

And remember, there is the second -- the 

second distinction.  So, that's one.  But the second is 
that -- remember, there is a purchase in your 
hypothetical of framing, a purchase from the framing

store.  But the second part of the Secretary's guidance 
is that when the doctor decides to issue a prescription, 
they're not exchanging anything with the drug company. 
There -- nothing is acquired from the drug company. 
That is a very significant difference. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a peculiar line of 

commerce.  And -- and you're saying that what 
constitutes a sale -- a salesman cannot take account of 
the fact that this is a weird line of commerce, where 
you're selling to people who cannot make a commitment. 
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, there are two things. 

The first is the commitment, and they are not selling 
anything to the doctor.  Remember, just to frame this 
industry, the pharmaceutical company sells its products; 
it sells them to pharmaceutical wholesalers, which sell 
them to pharmacies -- pardon me -- which sell them to 
customers, which have a relationship with a doctor, who 
may or may not have met with a detailer. 

There is a sale here in this industry, but 
it is to a pharmaceutical detailer, and that is a very 
significant difference.  The critical point as well for 
purposes of --

up on other -- other categories of employee?  You gave 
me cleaning workers, emergency service workers.  Are any 
of those categories people who get paid commissions? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Those are not, but the 

example that I gave to Justice Kennedy would be, which 
is that there are outside buyers who do receive 
commissions.  And remember, of course, that there are 
outside salesmen who do not receive commissions but are 
nonetheless exempt.  Congress didn't write an exemption 
about commissions; it wrote them about whether it's an 
outside person who engages in sales. 

And the other point I was trying to make is 

that -- and Justice Scalia echoed it to some extent --
and that is that the FLSA draws very fine lines.  If you 
work for a movie theater you are exempt, but not a 
playhouse.  If you work for a small newspaper but not a 
small magazine, you're exempt.  If you care for the 
elderly but not the young, you're exempt. 

And what Congress said is that there has to 
be -- you are an outside salesman and that -- it is true 
that this is a peculiar industry, but the peculiarity of 
it is that you don't make sales. 

If I could reserve the remainder of my time. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

It's common ground in this case that in 

order to be an outside salesman, an employee must make 
sales.  And in theory there are two different ways in 
which Respondent could have attempted to establish that 
the PSRs in this case fit that criteria. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you answer 

Justice Alito's question?  Your brief to the Second 
Circuit and the Ninth Circuit suggested that a sale is 
a -- is a transaction, a transfer of some sort, or at 
least a promise to purchase.  But your brief here calls 
it a much more rigid test, that there has to be a 
transfer of title.  And he pointed to the language of 
3(x) -- 3(k), that says "consignment for sale," which 
doesn't have a transfer of the title.  So, what is the 
Government's position? 

MR. STEWART:  Well, the DOL regulations have 

since 19 -- I believe it's since 1949, have said that 
"make a sale" within the meaning of 203(k), the term 
"making a sale" within the meaning of 3(k) includes a 
transfer of title.  And in theory, the verb "includes"

could leave open the possibility that other things could 
be included as well.  We've never encountered a 
situation in which DOL has found a sale of goods without 
a transfer of title.  But in direct answer to your 
question, Justice Alito, about --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, excuse me. 

Consignment salesmen are -- are not exempt? 

MR. STEWART:  It would be -- with specific 

respect to consignments for sale, it would have been 
more precise to say that there has to be a transfer of 
possession in contemplation of a transfer of title. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  And what about salesmen 

who -- whose objective is to obtain a rental?  The lower 
courts have said that they qualify.  Does the Government 
disagree with that? 

MR. STEWART:  DOL believes that they 

qualify, but not as sales of goods.  And if the -- the 
Court could look at the appendix to the blue brief on 
page 4.  This is the pertinent regulation that refers to 
making sales or obtaining orders. 

And it says:  "Section 541.500 requires that 

the employee be engaged in making sales within the 
meaning of section 3(k) of the Act or obtaining orders 
or contracts for services or for the use of facilities." 
And DOL's view is that a rental agreement would be a

contract for services or for the use of facilities. 

And the way --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  How can they 
put in number (2)?  I -- I thought that 3(k) is 3(k). 
Can -- can they supplement 3(k)? 

MR. STEWART:  They have supplemented 3(k), 

and they did that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the authority to do 

that? 

MR. STEWART:  The -- this is discussed in 

the Stein Report, which was issued in 1940, and what had 
happened was that the question had arisen -- and the 
Stein report lays this out in a fair amount of detail. 
The question had arisen whether individuals who 
negotiate for contracts to buy time on the radio or sell 
time -- sell advertising space in newspapers or sell --
negotiate contracts for carriage of freight by rail or 
truck -- the question arose whether they were outside 
salesmen within the meaning of the statute. 

And the Stein Report explained that the Wage 
and Hour Division had taken the position that they were 
not because it interpreted "sales" -- it appears to have 
interpreted "sales" to refer only to sales of goods, and 
people who were engaged in those sorts of businesses 
were not selling goods.  But the Stein Report said:

However, these people are commonly regarded as salesmen; 
the contracts they negotiate are treated as sales. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's wonderful. 

Then if you can go beyond 3(k), I guess really the 
question before us is whether it's arbitrary or 
capricious for the agency not to extend their -- their 
power to supplement 3(k) to this situation, which these 
people look like salesmen to me. 

And so, if they can do number (2) there, I 
don't know why -- why the agency couldn't say, oh, and 
by the way, detailers are also included. 

MR. STEWART:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the issue would be 
whether it's unreasonable for them not to say that. 
MR. STEWART:  The agency has taken the 
position that, even though it has construed 3(k) to 
refer only to sales of goods, that sales of services or 
contracts for the use of facilities can be covered. 
However, there's a big difference between the 
interaction between a detailer and a physician and the 
interaction between the -- the person who sells time on 
the radio.  The person --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure there is; sure there 
is.  But once you -- once you concede that it doesn't 
have to be within 3(k) and that it's within the power of

the agency to grant the exemption anyway, then we really 
have a different -- a different argument before us here. 

MR. STEWART:  Well, the -- the theory on 

which the Stein Report proceeded was that, even though 
sales of time on the radio were not sales of goods, they 
were still customarily regarded as sales, and they had 
the essential attributes of sales; namely, an exchange 
of something valuable that the seller possessed in 
return for consideration from the buyer.  And you don't 
have any of that when the detailer deals with the --
with the --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stewart, there's this 

other regulation which is I guess in the coverage 
section, 779.241, which says that if an employee 
performs any work that in a practical sense is an 
essential part of consummating the sale of the goods, 
he'll be considered to be selling the goods. 

So, I guess this question is a two-part 

question.  Do you agree that that regulation does cover 
the -- these detailers?  And the second part is, if you 
do, you know, how does it work that we should understand 
"sale" one way for purposes of coverage and another way 
for purposes of exemption? 

MR. STEWART:  Well, the first thing I would 

say is that we wouldn't agree that this would cover

detailers.  That is, if the relevant sales are, as we 
believe, GSK's sales to -- the transfer of drugs to 
wholesalers and pharmacies in return for consideration, 
the detailers don't play an essential role in the 
consummation of those sales.  They don't participate in 
those sales.  It's true that their mission is to engage 
in activities which set in motion a chain of events that 
will make those sales more likely to occur, but we 
wouldn't regard them as --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that seems a little bit 
blind to the way the industry actually works.  The way 
this industry actually works is the real work is done by 
the detailer getting the doctor to say, yes, I'm going 
to start prescribing this where it's medically 
appropriate.  The actual sales from the company to the 
pharmacy just follows from however successful the 
detailer is. 

MR. STEWART:  But I think much the same 
thing could have been said about all the promotional 
workers that DOL has done with -- has dealt with in the 
past.  That is, the premise, the justification for a 
company to hire a promotional worker, is that the 
promotional activities will increase the overall sales 
of the company, will either directly or indirectly set 
in motion a chain of events that leads people to buy the

product.  But DOL has historically regarded those 
activities as distinct from selling the product. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, do those employees 

work on commissions? 

MR. STEWART:  Some employees may work on 

commission.  Some --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Promotional workers do work 

on commissions? 

MR. STEWART:  It's -- I don't think there is 

necessarily a uniform rule one way or the other.  The 
Stein Report did say in 1940 that, although it was 
characteristic for outside salesmen to receive 
commissions, that was not the test, that that was a 
quirk of compensation.  The other thing I would say --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did we have detailers in 

1940?  Gee, that's a long time ago.  Did we have 
detailers in 1940?  That's almost a century ago. 

MR. STEWART:  There were detailers in that 

era, and --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's my point, actually. 

That's where I'm sort of bothered, just exactly what 
Justice Scalia said, that if you look through what I've 
seen so far by the materials, they're pretty evenly 
balanced, and there are tens of thousands of people who 
work in this industry, and there's a history of 75 years

of nobody said anything. 

So you would think -- and it isn't the only 

problem that has just been recognized in other 
industries, too.  If the agency is going to reverse, not 
reverse, but suddenly do something it hasn't done for 
75 years, the right way to do it is to have notice and 
comment, hearings, allow people to present their point 
of view, and then make some rules or determine what 
should happen.  Perhaps they'd say for the future let's 
do this, but not let's give people a windfall for the 
past.  Perhaps they'd say some and not others.  Okay? 

That's my instinctive reaction, not 

necessarily legal, but informed by administrative law. 
But why shouldn't I try to get there? 

MR. STEWART:  I guess I'd say two things, 

one general and one specific to detailers.  The general 
thing is that DOL has consistently drawn a distinction 
between promotional work --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I've read those. 
MR. STEWART:  Okay. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  I've read those, and I find 

them beautifully ambiguous. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll go back and read them 
again, and if they're absolutely clear, you win, fine,

that's the end of it. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it's gone on for 

70 years, and you're -- and instead of doing a 
regulation, amended regulation, as Justice Breyer 
indicates, you're filing amicus briefs quietly in 
different -- different courts.  It seems to me that's 
not nearly as fair or straightforward or as candid as --
as an agency ought to be. 

MR. STEWART:  Well, with respect to where 
the industry expectation arose, we have only one data 
point or at least only one data point that has been 
identified in the briefs.  That is the National 
Federation of Independent Small Business Legal Center 
has filed an amicus brief on Respondent's side, and then 
they -- they identify one DOL opinion letter, of which 
we were previously unaware, that dates from 1945.  And 
in the opinion letter, the employer of the detailer 
asked for an opinion to the effect that its detailers 
were covered by the administrative exemption.  That 
employer didn't request a ruling that these were outside 
salesmen.  And DOL --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You're right about that, 
and so, they're at fault, too.  But on the other hand, 
their employees might have been satisfied, and this is 
done to protect the employees.

So, I'm asking, not saying, but what is the 
process here?  How do you know -- at what level was this 
agency decision made to suddenly go ahead with this? 
Who made it?  What was the input?  How do you know 
they're on your side?  You do know; you're right.  But I 
mean, what's the process internally? 

MR. STEWART:  Internally, the -- the 

Solicitor's Office at the Department of Labor would 
consult with the Wage and Hour Division.  The 
Solicitor's name went on the briefs both that were filed 
in the Ninth Circuit and the brief -- I mean, the Ninth 
Circuit and also the Novartis brief in the Second 
Circuit.  And the Solicitor's name is on the 
Government's brief in this Court.  The Solicitor is the 
third-highest-ranking individual within the Department 
of Labor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you -- I'm sorry 

to interrupt your answer, but does your office review 
the amicus filings in the courts of appeals by the 
agencies? 

MR. STEWART:  There was SG authorization for 

the amicus brief to be filed. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that the normal 

procedure? 

MR. STEWART:  Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But this is part of a 

regular program that the agency has now instituted, to 
run around the country and file amicus briefs; is that 
it? 

MR. STEWART:  To clarify -- well, to clarify 

the agency's view of what the proper understanding of 
the law is.  And in terms of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, right, to get --

instead of doing rulemaking, instead of doing 
adjudication, we're going to file amicus briefs, and the 
court will accept our view in that amicus brief and, 
hey, presto, we have -- we have made law. 

MR. STEWART:  Well, maybe yes, maybe no --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's extraordinary. 
MR. STEWART:  Well, in comparison to the 
alternative step of filing enforcement actions, it's 
both --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the alternative step 
..-- well, did the Secretary of Labor herself or himself, 

depending on when it was, consider this matter? 

MR. STEWART:  I don't know whether the 

Secretary --

So --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, we don't.  All right.

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, the alternative is not 

enforcement actions, necessarily.  The alternative is 
for the agency to focus on the question and decide what 
it actually wants to do. 

MR. STEWART:  And the agency has regarded 
the application of its promotion sales regulations to 
the facts of this case as clear.  That is, if you asked 
GSK's highest level management why does it make sense to 
employ detailers, they wouldn't say because they get 
these commitments from physicians which are of value to 
the company.  The commitments or the quasi-commitments 
from physicians in and of themselves are of no value. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are 90,000 of these 
people, and you have not -- the agency has not brought 
any action for these -- lo, these many years.  Ninety 
thousand of them.  And all of a sudden, you say -- you 
come in and say, oh, you have been in violation of the 
law in the past, and you're going to have to pay a lot 
of money for all these people that you didn't give 
overtime to in the past. 

I just think that's extraordinary. 
MR. STEWART:  Well, to the extent that there 

was an industry expectation that was based on anything 
DOL had said, it was based on, as far as we know, based 
on the 1945 opinion letter, which said not --

didn't even know about that. 

MR. STEWART:  Right. 
(Laughter.) 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And yet, you expect 
the industry to know all about it; and yet, it escaped 
your attention. 

MR. STEWART:  Again, our argument is not 

that they should have known from the -- about the 
opinion letter.  Our argument is that the proper 
application of the promotion sales regulation to the 
facts of this case is pretty clear, and that if GSK's 
top-level management was asked to defend the use of 
detailers, they would say these people are important 
because if they persuade physicians to write more 
prescriptions and those are filled with GSK products, 
then pharmacies will reorder the drug and our 
wholesalers will reorder it from us. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, can I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, you have been guilty of 

malfeasance for 70 years, right?  These 90,000 people 
out there who have been in violation of the law and the 
agency has done not a blessed thing? 

MR. STEWART:  To return to the 1945 opinion 
letter, the opinion letter was based on the premise that

the employees exercised discretion and independent 
judgment in the performance of their duties.  That's 
what the -- what DOL said in concluding --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I thought that 

this whole system was set up on giving industries the 
opportunity to ask the government for an opinion letter, 
correct? 

MR. STEWART:  Right. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I saw in the briefing 
hundreds of opinion letters by hundreds of different 
industries.  Outside of this 1945 letter, did anybody 
else, any other pharmaceutical company, ever set out for 
the government or seek an opinion letter that you're 
aware of? 

MR. STEWART:  I'm aware of only one 

instance.  I think this is not a matter of public 
record, but there was one request in, I believe, 
December of 2007 for an opinion to the effect that the 
detailers were covered by the outside salesman 
exemption.  DOL never responded one way or the other. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't suggest -- you're 
not arguing for a rule that if -- if an individual does 
not seek an opinion letter, he's guilty?  Is that --

MR. STEWART:  No, I'm not arguing for that 

rule.  The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Malcolm -- Mr. 

Stewart, is it -- is it true that that option is no 
longer available, that the Department of Labor no longer 
gives opinion letters? 

MR. STEWART:  It does -- it has phased out 

the opinion letter program and gives other forms of 
administrative guidance.  That is, DOL's rationale was 
that the opinion letter program had not been cost 
effective because often the bottom line -- may I --
often the bottom-line answer to the question would turn 
on factual nuances of a particular employer and wouldn't 
provide much guidance to others.  And so, it's tried to 
provide forms of guidance that are -- speak to the 
industry or a class of employees as a whole.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Petitioners are two pharmaceutical sales 

representatives.  They were hired for a sales job.  They 
were given sales training.  They attend sales 
conferences.  They are assigned a sales territory, and

they are evaluated and compensated as sales people.

sales. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's --
MR. CLEMENT:  With respect --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your long list sort 

of stopped one step short.  They don't make sales. 

MR. CLEMENT:  With respect, 

Mr. Chief Justice, we disagree.  We think they do make 
sales in the way that is relevant in this industry, and 
we do think they make sales in some sense, which is the 
practical construction that the agency has always put on 
the sales requirement in the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you give me what 

your regulation is going to be? 

MR. CLEMENT:  What's that? 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And would it exempt 

everybody from coverage?  Meaning, you seem to be saying 
if in some sense they make sales, it seems that every 
promotional person will be a salesman, that all 
industries have to do is put one or two forms of sales 
activities involved in the work of their worker, and 
they're exempt.  Give me your definition?  As long as 
it's in some sense, that covers everybody's exempt?

if I could, there's two important qualifications that 
avoid the slippery slope concerns you're talking about. 
One is it's, I think, common ground among everybody that 
you -- to qualify for any exemption or certainly all of 
these relevant exemptions here, it has to be your 
primary duty.  So, you can't just slip in a little sales 
activity for something and get that person qualified. 
The other thing, and I think this is very --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it seems like the 
sale here is not the primary duty.  The sale here is to 
schmooze the doctor and give him information.  That's 
what you said in one of your briefs -- your company said 
in one of its briefs in -- in a products liability 
litigation. 

MR. CLEMENT:  With respect, Your Honor, the 

commitment is very important in this industry.  It is 
the objective of the sales call.  It's to get a 
commitment to prescribe when medically necessary. 

Now, it is true that there is prologue to 
that, and there is efforts to promote before you get 
that particular sale.  But the regulations address that 
particularly, and they say, as long as you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Primary duty is one of 

the limiting, and what was the second limiting 
principle?

MR. CLEMENT:  The second limiting principle 
is actually what I'm talking about now, which is if you 
look at 503, which are the regulations that draw the 
distinction between promotion and between being outside 
sales, they do not say that promotion is nonexempt 
activity.  What they say is it depends who does the 
promotion.  And as long as the outside salesperson does 
the promotion in conjunction with his or her own sales 
or solicitations, then that is exempt activity.  And 
what they're trying to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it also says -- it 
also says promotional work incidental to sales made by 
someone else. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Is not covered. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- is nonexempt. 
MR. CLEMENT:  You're right, but --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And these sales -- I 
mean, eventually there is a sale to a hospital, to a 
pharmacy, and that sale is not made by the detailer. 

MR. CLEMENT:  But, Justice Ginsburg, I think 

it's important to recognize that the reason that 503 
draws a distinction between promotional activity in 
conjunction with the salesperson's own sales or 
promotional activity with respect to somebody else's 
sales is they're concerned about the consideration where

somebody else is going to follow up with the same 
customer to close the deal. 

And if you look at the regulatory 

commentary, that's what they're concerned -- they don't 
want to sort of have double counting, where somebody 
promotes with a sales target and then somebody else 
follows up to close the sale.  And --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that might be one 

thing that they are concerned about, but it may not be 
the only thing.  I mean, if you look at these 
regulations, it seems as though what they're trying to 
do is draw a distinction between people who actually 
consummate transactions, transactional people, and 
people who are pitchmen.  And -- and what the Department 
of Labor here is saying is detailers are people who make 
pitches; they're not people who consummate the 
transactions. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, I really 
think if you look at the regulations as a whole and the 
commentary in the Stein Report and the Weiss Report, 
they're not worried about sorting out the pitchmen 
because they understand that that classic outside 
salesperson is a pitchman who then tries to get a 
commitment to buy or some other commitment from the 
sales target.

So, what they're trying to do is really 

distinguishing not between pitchmen and sales people, 
but between what they refer to as missionary men or 
people who pave the way for somebody else to make the 
sale.  And I really think that's the focus of the 503 
regulation. 

And so, the Government's argument really 
boils down to the notion that there's nobody in this 
industry that makes enough of a commitment with the 
doctor for anybody to be involved in anything but 
promotion with the doctor.  And that seems --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why isn't that possible? 

I mean, your brief seemed to suggest that in every 
industry there needs to be some group of people who 
would be classified as outside salesmen.  And that's not 
necessarily the case.  There may be some industries, and 
here it's a result of regulation, or it may be because 
of other business practices, where there just isn't 
anybody who's an outside salesman. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Kagan, it's 

theoretically possible, but it would be odd, especially 
in an industry that employs 90,000 people, in order to 
get a commitment to prescribe from the doctor.  And I 
think if you look across --

commitment?  Is the commitment in writing? 

MR. CLEMENT:  The commitment is generally 

not in writing, Justice Kennedy. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would it be lawful to make 

it -- put it in writing? 

MR. CLEMENT:  I don't know that anything 

would turn on whether it was in writing or not because 
what --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would it be lawful to put 

it in writing? 

MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I think the answer is 

yes.  It's important for the commitment not to be 
binding because of the nature of the doctor's role. 
Nobody wants to go into a doctor's office, let alone 
these sales people, and say, look, whoever is the next 
person who walks in the door, prescribe them the 
product. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That sounds to me it's not 

a commitment, unless the doctor says:  Well, I'll look 
at this, this is interesting; I'll go home and read your 
material, I'll think about it. 

Is that -- is that a --
MR. CLEMENT:  That's not the kind of 
commitment they're looking for, Justice Kennedy. 
They're looking for a commitment that -- sometimes it's

the next patient that presents the condition for which 
the medicine is medically appropriate, that they will 
prescribe.  And if you think just practically --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's got to be non-

binding. 

MR. CLEMENT:  It has to be non-binding.  I 

agree.  But I don't think that the Government --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's why -- and 

that's why it's not in writing. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, but you can have a 
non-binding commitment in writing.  You can have a 
binding commitment that's oral, as long as it's -- you 
know, I don't want to get into the statute of frauds 
here.  But it seems to me that the binding nature is not 
dispositive either.  You can have a situation -- look, 
if I agree as -- that I'm going to buy something, I can 
often return it.  Sometimes there is a cooling-off 
period, things like that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let me ask you this, 

and I'm not well versed in all -- in all of the 
specifics, but my understanding is that the Federal 
Government has expressed new concerns, has new 
regulations, new rules about these outside sales. 

Does that mean that the nature of the work 

has changed in the last 5 or 10 years, so that the

70 years we are talking about is not relevant?  Would 
you comment on that? 

MR. CLEMENT:  I'd love to, Justice Kennedy. 

I think, to the contrary, I think that -- I mean, the 
Government actually ironically says that the 2004 
rulemaking, which was the last time there was any 
rulemaking, didn't change anything substantively.  We 
think that's wrong.  We actually think there was an 
important substantive change to the 503(c) regulations 
and others which addressed the following problem, which 
is not that the basic role of the outside salesperson 
has changed, but the technology has changed in such a 
way that it would be silly to draw a distinction between 
whether the salesperson actually takes the order and 
writes it down or gets a form in triplicate, or rather 
gets a commitment to buy from the sales target who then 
actually enters the order on a computer on their own. 
And that I think is the specific situation 
that the agency was confronted with.  And in 2004 they 
said:  We don't want things to turn on who enters the 
order, whether it's the customer on their own computer 
or the outside salesperson. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Clement, I thought 
that in 2004 there were two proposals, really, and one 
was the proposal that was changed, and the other was the

proposal to get rid of this promotional stuff and to 
allow people who promoted products to qualify as outside 
salesmen, and the agency specifically rejected that 
suggestion. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely, Justice Kagan, but 

there has always been an effort to try to get all 
promotional people treated as being exempt.  But that's 
different from what's being asked for here, which is the 
last person who makes a visit to the person who places 
the relevant order in the industry and gets the 
commitment from that person.  That, in contrast to 
general promotion, often directed at the world at large, 
has always been the hallmark of a sale in the 
Department's own flexible approach.  And I think that's 
really important because if --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that seems to be 
inconsistent with this -- this opinion letter.  The 
request is put in by the pharmaceutical company, and 
they want an exemption under administrative employee. 
In the Department of Labor's response allowing that 
exemption, it says that these detailers, and they use 
the word "detailers," medical detailers, are engaged in 
a form of promotional or missionary work. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I 

want to say two things about that.  One is to say,

obviously, that may depend a little bit on how the 
particular role was described.  If you're reading from 
the 1945 opinion letter, I mean, that may be somewhat 
different.  But I do think that what's important here is 
that promotional activity itself is not problematic. 
Promotional activity is exempt as long as it's in 
conjunction with the person's own sales or 
solicitations, is the word of the regulation.  So, I 
don't think that's dispositive. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This goes -- the letter 

goes on to say that these detailers are engaged in a 
form of promotion not having for its object the making 
of specific transactions. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, and again, Justice 

Ginsburg, we would take issue with that and say, no, 
there is an interest in getting a specific commitment. 
It is commitment to prescribe.  It may be somewhat -- it 
is non-binding, and it may be somewhat forward-looking, 
but I don't think that distinguishes this industry from 
many industries.  It's not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But as far as your 

70 years, it's suspect for two reasons.  One is we're 
told that in the early years, at least, before there 
were regulations restricting the sale of prescription 
drugs, that these detailers did two things.  They did

have their informational function, but they also did 
direct sales to pharmaceutical companies, to hospitals. 
So, for at least 20 years of those 70 years, these 
people were engaged in what the department would call 
sales.  So, that's suspect. 

And then when we have the commitment, the 
opinion letter that says we have a category for these 
people; they are engaged in instruction, in information; 
they are not engaged in sales; but because they're so 
independent, we rank them as administrative -- in the 
particular case we rank them as administrative people. 

So -- so, it's not so that there was a 

sudden about-face as you suggest.  We have a 
categorization as -- as administrative employees, but 
not sales employees, and we have a history of these 
detailers at one time actually selling. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me 

say -- I mean, certainly as the regulatory environment 
has changed, the nature of how the sales are transacted 
in this industry have changed, but I think the focus is 
very much on the doctors appropriately because they're 
the ones that place the order.  But I also want to be 
responsive to the administrative exemption. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You wouldn't -- you 

wouldn't mind being exempt as administrative, would you?

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they've changed their 

-- their view. 

MR. CLEMENT:  They've changed their view on 

that, too.  And I certainly don't want this Court to 
think that the industry somehow has the administrative 
exemption as an ace up their sleeve or in their back 
pocket.  And it's really the same exact issue, because, 
once again, the agency has changed their view.  And once 
again, their view is not based on anything that has to 
do with label --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did you claim -- did you 

claim exemption as administrative employee? 

MR. CLEMENT:  We did, Your Honor, in the 

district court.  It's not before this Court because we 
got summary judgment in our favor on the outside sales 
exemption. 

But I really would think it would be a -- a 

mistake for this Court to say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, that would -- then 

that would be still open if you lose on the outside 
sales? 

MR. CLEMENT:  It would, Justice Ginsburg.

But you're just deferring the same inquiry, because the 
Government's position once again is after 70 years of 
having the industry proceed on the assumption that these 
individuals were exempt, they now have changed their 
mind.  And, again, their view has everything to do with 
FDA regulation --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Clement --
MR. CLEMENT:  -- and nothing to do --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry. 
MR. CLEMENT:  -- and nothing to do with 

labor policy, because what they say is that now because 
of the government's own off-label prosecutions, these 
outside salespeople have to stick to a script and -- in 
order to avoid off-label liability.  And because they 
have to stick to the script, they are told they don't 
exercise sufficient discretion to come within the 
administrative exemption. 

And the problem here is the Labor 

Department, instead of looking at this and making a 
rational judgment about labor policy and whether these 
individuals who make $93,000 on -- for the median should 
rationally be the kind of workers that are protected by 
the Fair Labor Standards Act, instead they're looking at 
things that have everything to do with FDA regulation 
and nothing to do with labor policy.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Are they paid commissions? 
If they're -- if the salesman or the promotion agent, as 
the case may be, is successful in his territory in 
getting doctors to prescribe the drug, does he receive 
extra pay? 

MR. CLEMENT:  He receives incentive 

compensation. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What does that mean?  Does 
he -- I mean, an outside salesman -- in one document, it 
says is a person who often obtains a commission on his 
sales. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Right. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  And now what I'm trying to 

figure out -- I might not have the right words to ask 
the question -- are these people, people who in some 
sense or other receive commissions on their sales? 

MR. CLEMENT:  And the answer is -- for the 
Petitioners on this record, the answer is yes.  They're 
not the commissions that are a one-to-one 
correspondence, but what they do is they receive 
substantial incentive compensation, about 25 percent of 
the total, and it's based on the sales of the product in

their sales territory.  So, if the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How's that different 

from a bonus that an employee gets?  How is it any 
different than what most companies do in -- in giving a 
bonus at the end of the year? 

MR. CLEMENT:  Certainly, based on the facts 

in this record, it -- at the time of this case, it's 
much more tied to the performance of the product in the 
sales territory.  And I don't think that's -- you know, 
it's not based on the company's overall performance --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Clement, you give me 

one definition of "outside salesmen," the one that you 
prefer for us to apply here.  The Department of Labor 
gives another, and the one they're giving according to 
them is a bright-line rule.  It's easy to apply.  You 
have to do some sort of transfer of title.  That's as --
their rule. 

Tell me what the -- your argument is that --
why your rule has to win.  Meaning, aren't we supposed 
to give deference to the expertise of the agency, 
especially when Congress lets them define --

MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Sotomayor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the scope of the --
MR. CLEMENT:  -- two responses to that.  One 

is you can't defer to the Labor Department's preferred

construction, because it's flatly inconsistent with the 
statute.  This idea that you have to have a transfer of 
title cannot be squared with 3(k); it cannot be squared, 
at least as I understand it, with some of the -- the own 
advice they've given, which is all you need is a 
commitment to buy.  That's what they've told people 
since 1949. 

There's an example in that Weiss Report from 
1949 involving a jobber where you have a situation where 
somebody's treated as an outside salesperson even though 
they never have title over the product.  So, they get 
the commitment to buy from the sales target, and then a 
jobber who works for a different employer is the one 
that transfers title.  That's at page 11 of the NFIB 
brief, if you want to look at it.  So --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, I guess I'm not 

sure I understand what you just said. 

If -- forget the transfer of title business, 
but if it's just -- we're requiring a transaction here. 
And we're drawing a line between people who do 
transactions and people who just advertise or make 
pitches or whatever you want to do it.  That's perfectly 
consistent with the statute, isn't it?  I mean, you can 
argue about is it the only possible reading; you can 
even argue about whether it's the best possible reading.

But it's surely a -- a possible reading. 

MR. CLEMENT:  It is a possible reading, 
Justice Kagan.  But it's not the one that the Labor 
Department has advanced in their amicus brief.  So, you 
can't defer to that.  I mean, you can decide that it's 
the best reading of the statute if you want, but --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I suppose that that's 
a question for them.  I read their amicus briefs to sort 
of suggest two things.  Sometimes they just talk about 
transactions, and sometimes they talk about transfer of 
title. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, and with respect, 

Justice Kagan, that's one of the many problems with 
deferring to amicus briefs.  Because when an agency 
gives guidance in an interpretative rule or something, 
there's one place, and they provide "the" answer.  Now, 
I don't know if the Government wants you to defer to the 
-- defer to the argument on page 12 or the argument on 
page 20 or the argument on page 24. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I think that they 

would say that it doesn't make any difference, because 
they've never really seen a person who makes 
transactions without transferring title.  So, I think 
that --

have --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- they would think the --

the difference is --

MR. CLEMENT:  No, with respect, they have 

seen that person. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Consignment, for one, which 

is legitimate business. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, consignment is in the 
statute, but this jobber example is right out of the 
Weiss Report in 1949, and the outside salesperson in 
that case never had title.  The title comes from the 
jobber who works for somebody else.  So, the salesperson 
in that instance never had title, not even in the chain 
of distribution.  Yet, they say that is a clear case 
where the person is an outside salesperson and exempt. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did -- did the 

pharmaceutical companies request -- ever in this period, 
request a ruling, a rulemaking on the status of these 
PSRs? 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I understand from the 

Government that there was a request in 2007 and that the 
Labor --

letter, they said.  I thought they said that was an

MR. CLEMENT:  It was a request for an

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  I asked if there 
was a request from the pharmaceutical companies for a 
rulemaking on the proper classification in this case. 

MR. CLEMENT:  No, there wasn't, Justice 

Ginsburg, but I think that actually cuts in our favor, 
because in 2004, a lot of companies were coming in with 
things where they thought it was unclear, where they 
thought there was some doubt, and asking for 
clarification.  This was so well understood that the 
outside sales exemption, or perhaps the administrative 
exemption, covered the outside sales force of this 
industry --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's the case that I 

cite if this opinion is written the way you -- you 
propose, and the -- this Court says, well, this has been 
70 years, or maybe in 10 years if you take the new 
regulations as setting a new regime, and the Department 
has never made an objection.  And, therefore, it follows 
that the Department's interpretation is implausible or 
improper, and then I cite some case from our Court. 

What -- how do I write this? 
MR. CLEMENT:  I would -- I would ask you not 

to be bound by having to cite a case.  I would ask you

to just use the following reasoning, though, which I 
think is 100 percent -- and there's plenty of cases you 
could cite as perhaps Cf. cites. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'd like one. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  Well, here's -- let's 
start -- let's start with Fox and just the basic notion 
that in administrative law, if you're going to change 
your position, you have to acknowledge that you're 
making a change.  I think at a minimum here, if they're 
going to impose this kind of massive retroactive 
liability on this industry --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Clement, this isn't 
a change.  You've referred to it as a change in a lot of 
ways -- in a lot of times, but what we have here is an 
agency that, for some number of years, thought that this 
was not the most urgent problem on their plate.  Indeed, 
one would think this is a pretty peculiar Department of 
Labor if they thought that this was the most urgent 
problem on their plate.  So, they didn't enforce it. 

But now the question has come up.  And so, 
they say we'll look to our regulations.  This falls on 
one side of the regulation.  Now, you've been given a 
gift for all these years is one way of looking at it, 
because -- because you were not their most urgent

problem; and so, they didn't enforce their own 
regulations against you. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Kagan, here's the 

thing.  We can quibble about whether or not there is a 
change in their position or whether they just didn't 
have a position before, but I think the important thing 
is they've imposed, by taking this position in an amicus 
brief and asking for deference to it, massive liability 
on this industry.  The PhRMA brief estimates it's 
billions of dollars. 
Now, I --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why must you -- why must 
you look to an amicus brief?  Why not just look to the 
regulation that defines -- the regulations that define 
"sale" and that define "promotion"?  The 541.503 says 
promotion work incidental to a sale made by somebody 
else is not exempt. 

Why do we get into the amicus brief when we 
have in these 541 regulations a definition of sales on 
the one hand, promotion on the other, and then this 
statement that promotion work incidental to sale made by 
somebody else is not exempt? 

Why doesn't -- why isn't that the answer to 

this case? 

MR. CLEMENT:  Here's the answer as to why

that's not the answer, and then let me circle back and 
say why, if you're going to err on one side or the 
other, you shouldn't err on the side of imposing massive 
retroactive liability.  The reason that that's not a 
simple matter of deferring to that is because that same 
regulation earlier says that promotional work is exempt 
if it's in conjunction with the individual's own sales 
or solicitations. 

Now, I happen to think it's pretty clear 

that these -- by getting this commitment, which is the 
functional equivalent of a commitment to buy, which is 
what the regulations and the regulatory interpretations 
have always said is a sale in some sense, I think these 
are sales.  Certainly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does the -- does the 

pharmaceutical company have a sales force?  I mean, who 
sells to the wholesalers, the pharmacies, and the 
hospitals? 

MR. CLEMENT:  It's not this kind of outside 

sales force.  It's a much less sales-oriented 
transaction.  The PhRMA amicus brief, for example, gives 
the example of a company that has 2,000 outside sales 
reps and 10 people that handle the movement of transfer 
of product to the wholesalers and the distributors. 

If you look at district court's opinion at

the page 42a of the petition appendix, the district 
court addresses this issue and I think gets it exactly 
right, which is the reason there isn't a sales effort 
focused on the wholesalers and distributors is because 
their job is to have on stock the kind of medicines that 
physicians are prescribing. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there are -- there 
are people who sell to them.  There may be only a few, 
but --

MR. CLEMENT:  There's a handful of people, 
Justice Ginsburg, but that's -- I mean, there's nothing 
anomalous about that.  Most industries have some sales 
force that operates on the wholesale --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there -- are they 

exempt, too? 

MR. CLEMENT:  What's that? 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- the actual sellers 
from the -- the people on the staff of a pharmaceutical 
company who sell to the wholesalers, pharmacies, and 
hospitals, are they exempt? 

MR. CLEMENT:  I don't believe so, Your 

Honor, at least not under the outside sales exemption, 
in part because they're not outside, in part because 
they're not really engaged in a sales effort.  It does 
them no good -- if they can convince some wholesaler or

distributor that the GSK product is far superior to a 
competitor's product and it doesn't make any difference 
at all because as a result of that -- I mean, they need 
to have product that actual doctors are writing 
prescriptions for.  That's what drives sales in this 
industry. 

There's nothing anomalous about that.  If 
you think about any industry, sales activity is always 
directed at the people who place orders.  In this 
industry, because of the learned intermediary doctrine, 
the person who places the order is the doctor, not the 
ultimate end user. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there -- let's 

say the doctor hears the spiel and the doctor says, 
okay, yours is the first thing I'll think of, you know, 
when I have a patient with this and this.  I mean, is 
that a sale? 

MR. CLEMENT:  We think it is, Your Honor, 
but if you have any doubt about that, certainly at the 
point that the doctor then, when he sees the next 
patient, writes the prescription, at that point I think 
there's a sale, because, again, what the regulations and 
regulatory history looks for is a -- is a commitment to 
buy.  That's the relevant commitment to buy.  That's the 
order in this industry --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, what if the 

doctor, as I suspect a lot of doctors do, they listen to 
this guy, and they say, okay, I'll think of -- you know, 
when it comes up, I'll think of your product; and the 
next guy comes in from the other company, and he says, 
okay, when it comes up I'll think of your product -- are 
those two sales or no sale? 

MR. CLEMENT:  I think they're probably two 

sales, Your Honor.  But, you know, it's the same 
thing -- imagine somebody who's, you know, just sitting 
in their house, and they get an encyclopedia 
salesperson.  And they say, you know, I'll -- maybe I'll 
buy that.  That looks good, I'll buy it.  And they say, 
but you know, maybe the State law has a law that says 
you've got to wait 24 hours before you put the order in, 
in the computer. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's a firmer 
commitment when they say I'll buy it.  The physician is 
just saying I'll think of your product when it -- when 
the need comes up. 

MR. CLEMENT:  But -- well, if -- I mean, 
what I was suggesting is maybe you're talking about a 
State that has a 24-hour waiting rule or something like 
that.  So, it's a commitment that, sure, I'm going to 
enter the order in 24 hours.  Well, maybe another

encyclopedia salesmen comes in, in 12 hours, and he 
gives another commitment.  One of the two people he's 
going to put the order in, and one of the two people 
will certainly have finally had a sale.  I think, 
again --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But don't you think that the 
way this works -- I mean, the way we should all hope it 
works is that the detailer comes in, the detailer 
provides information, the doctor says that's very 
interesting, I want to think about it, I'm going to 
think about it.  Then the doctor reads some medical 
journals; then maybe the doctor goes to a convention and 
talks to other doctors about the product. 

I mean, that's what you would hope that a 
doctor would do before a doctor decided I'm going to 
start prescribing this medicine.  And the detail work is 
a part of that, but so are many other things before the 
doctor actually decides to do something. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Sure, Justice Kagan.  But you 

don't want to look at this like it's an isolated, 
one-time, you know, sort of interaction.  I mean, one of 
the things that -- that happens in this industry, like 
other sales industry, is there are multiple trips.  The 
detailer goes there maybe the first time and lays the 
ground work.  Then maybe the doctor reads some other

information.  Then maybe on the final visit, after all 
that information is there, finally the detailer gets the 
commitment to prescribe to appropriate patients. 

I think one way to think about the absurdity 
of making the difference turn on the prescription is to 
compare this salesperson to another salesperson of 
medical devices who goes in, but these are medical 
supplies that the doctor uses in the doctor's office. 
Now, they're both hired for their sales experience. 
They both get sales training.  They both have a sales 
territory.  They're sitting in the same doctor's waiting 
room, waiting for the same doctor; they have samples in 
their bags, and they both get a commitment from the 
doctor. 

Now, what sense does it make as a matter of 

the FLSA and its labor policies to say one of those 
people is exempt and the other one is not exempt, 
because for perfectly sensible reasons, we say that one 
of those products is a prescription where the doctor 
writes the order and then with that order, the end user, 
the ultimate end user, can make the purchase at the 
pharmacy, whereas the other one --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Clement, I wanted to 
ask you about section 501 of the regulations, which --
which is on page 4 of the appendix in the blue brief,

and was mentioned in the -- in the Government's 
presentation.  It says -- requires that the employee be 
engaged in (i) making sales within the meaning of 3(k); 
or (ii) obtaining orders or contracts for services or 
for the use of facilities. 

What authorization is there for the agency 

to invent number (ii)? 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Scalia, you 

heard the Government's explanation; and, as you suggest, 
if the Government's explanation is right, then this 
shouldn't be a matter of just trying to limit things to 
3 -- to the 3(k) definition.  I think, even though -- at 
the 3(k) definition, though, if you look at that 
definition, it has every hallmark of being broad and 
functional and flexible. 

I would want to make one very important 

point, though, about the ultimate question here, because 
ultimately the decision whether to go one way or another 
on this issue has remarkable significance for 
retroactive imposition of liability. 

We all know that retroactive rulemaking is 
disfavored.  Well, think about the consequences here. 
You have massive liability, between 4 and 6 years of 
effective time and a half, because of the way that the 
statute works.  It has time and a half plus liquidated

damages.  You are talking about people who are very well 
paid, close to six figures.  So, unlike the classic 
worker who you might think is covered by the FLSA, who 
is a relatively low hourly worker, the amounts of 
damages here are quite significant. 

Of course, the effort to try to reconstruct 

these people's hours, given that they were told they 
were exempt and they were outside the office, trying to 
reconstruct how many overtime hours they actually worked 
is going to be a crapshoot at best.  So, if you think 
about all of that, and then you think about, as 
Justice Breyer indicated, the other option, which is 
to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's pursue this for a 

second. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Sure. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because I'd like to go back 

to Justice Kennedy's question, and this is only me 
speaking.  I don't know how anybody else feels.  If this 
had come up in 1941, you wouldn't have had a chance.  I 
would have said look at the statute; it says the 
Secretary defines it.  You'd say, well, can you define 
it in a brief?  Yes, you have to be careful of briefs, 
but, yes.  And that's the end of the case.  It's not a 
question for judges; it's a question for administrators.

All right.  But now it's difficult for me 

because of the passage of 75 years.  And we can blame it 
in part on the industry or in part on the Secretary. 
There is blame to go around.  So, the question is, what 
do I do as a judge? 

And partly my instinct is get somebody to 
decide this other than a lawyer in the Department of 
Labor, because this is a hard question.  And that's 
where we come to Justice Kennedy's question, which is he 
says all right, fine, let's write that, and -- and what 
case do we cite? 

And I don't agree with you, overturn Auer. 
I think amicus briefs are often helpful, but use them 
with care.  And then I have the statute here, which 
talks about the Secretary doing the definition of 
"outside salesman," and I have lots of rules and 
regulations and reports, which are fairly ambiguous in 
my opinion.  So, you tell me what to say. 

MR. CLEMENT:  I -- may I answer? 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Certainly. 
MR. CLEMENT:  I would start by citing -- I 

know it's not always in fashion to cite lower court 
opinions, but I'd start by citing Judge Posner's opinion 
in Yi, because the Seventh Circuit -- they're a very 
distinguished panel, Judge Posner, Judge Wood, and one

other judge.  The three of them considered this 
question -- Judge Sykes.  I'm sorry; it slipped my mind. 
A very distinguished judge. 

(Laughter.) 
MR. CLEMENT:  The -- it's -- the point being 

that he said along these lines that the 70 years of 
history makes a significant difference.  And here's the 
thing.  Just like you expect an agency to confront a 
change in position, you'd at least expect an agency to 
confront the retroactive consequences and in that sense 
address them and make sense of it. 

And I would just simply say this, which is 
if you had a rulemaking, you could bring in all of the 
affected parties, including the current sales 
representatives, who are not the ones bringing these 
lawsuits, whose jobs are going to be changed, and you 
could make a comprehensive view, as opposed to just 
getting one side of an ongoing litigation and then 
making a decision about an amicus brief.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

Three quick points.  First, if you read the 

transcript, you will see that my friend says that the 
nature of this job has changed.  And that is an 
essential part of understanding this case.  And there is 
an entire amicus brief in addition to our submission on 
behalf of pharmaceutical representatives, which explains 
how very much the requirements of pharmaceutical 
detailers and the restrictions on them have changed 
dramatically over the last couple of decades in 
particular.  And that's why the continued references to 
70 years are wrong. 

The other important point about the FLSA in 
particular is that there is a statute on this issue, and 
it says that an employer can request guidance from the 
agency; and if it doesn't do that, it is not -- it has 
no defense.  Its job is to ask for guidance.  And there 
are 50 different exemptions from the FLSA that cover 
hundreds of different categories of employees.  And if 
the rule you are going to announce -- because Mr. 
Clement's view is you shouldn't be bound by any 
precedent.  If the rule you are going to now announce is

that there has to be rulemaking with respect to all of 
those, it's going to be an administrative nightmare. 

Two quick further points.  The Department of 

Labor's position is that there has to be an actual 
commitment, not a precatory commitment.  And Mr. Clement 
says, well, that's contrary to the definition of "sale" 
in 3(k).  Please read the definition again, and if you 
find something in there, something that is not a 
commitment -- it can be an exchange; it can be a 
commitment that is even a consignment; it can be a 
traditional sale.  Every one of those things is 
commitment.  It is impossible to find in the definition 
of "commitment" a rule that says -- excuse me, in the 
definition of "sale" --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Where do they say that 
that's -- that that's their test?  Where does the 
Department of Labor say that's their test, that it has 
to be a commitment?  I thought what they said in their 
brief was there has to be a transfer of title. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  There are two different 

parts to it.  One is that they -- as explained by Mr. 
Stewart, their view of transfer of title, but the Weiss 
Report says repeatedly that there has to be a commitment 
to buy.  That is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, which is it?  I mean,

you say, yes, yes, it's both. 

64

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  You have to agree --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Pick one. 
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  You have to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it the transfer of title 

or a commitment? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is the agreement to 

transfer title.  There are two parts to it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ah.  Okay. 
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  But there has to be the 

agreement, a firm agreement.  It's repeated in the 2004 
preamble to the regulations as well. 

Now, the last critical point I want to make 
is that Mr. Clement says there are commissions on sales 
in the sales territory.  And what he is not talking 
about is any commitment by a physician.  When you go 
look at the transcript and he talks about sales in the 
sales territory, he is talking about the sales by the 
pharmacy.  That's where the sale occurs in this 
industry.  It's to the wholesaler and to the pharmacy 
and to the customer. 

He is not talking about a sale in the sense 

of getting a commitment to have --

for the Petitioners:  "Sales volume is directly and 
exclusively driven by the number of prescriptions 
written by physicians, and plaintiffs' job was to 
encourage such prescriptions." 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That -- Mr. Justice Kennedy, 

I don't believe that you can fairly describe that as a 
finding of fact.  That is the judge -- his view of the 
summary judgment record.  It is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a finding of logic, 

for Pete's sake.  These are prescriptions.  You can only 
get a prescription from a doctor.  Obviously, the number 
of prescriptions, drugs sold, depends upon the number of 
prescriptions given by doctors. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Two -- two things about 

that.  First is that a detailer doesn't get a commitment 
to a prescription.  And then in addition, it's clear 
that there are numerous influences on what a doctor 
does.  There's all the advertising --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a different point. 
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is an important point. 

It is a different point, but it is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not the point you were 

making. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Scalia, the point 
that I will make at bottom is that you have to have a

firm commitment.  That's what the Department says.  And

contradicts that.
