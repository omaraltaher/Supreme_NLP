 (11:15 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-1223, Bell versus Kelly.

 Mr. Bress.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. BRESS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BRESS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The problem at the heart of this case is 
construing subsections (d) and (e) of 28 U.S.C. 2254 
together in a way that makes sense.  The last time that 
this Court construed those two provisions together was 
in Michael Williams.  Michael Williams presented a 
different issue.

 But we believe that looking at how Michael 

Williams would play out with a small change in the facts 
will help frame the issue that's before the court today.

 Now, as the Court recalls, in Michael 

Williams the Virginia Supreme Court denied Williams the 
investigative assistance he needed in order to help 
develop a claim based on his suspicions of jury 
misconduct.  He, therefore, didn't make the claim in 
State court.

 On -- in Federal court he got investigative

assistance; and, in speaking with the investigator, two 
of the jurors referred to the foreperson, Bonnie 
Stinette, as Bonnie Minehart.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Bress, before we get 
into that, could I just ask you a threshold question? 
We took this case to decide a question, and one of the 
factual predicates of the question is that the State 
court refused to consider certain evidence.  And I'm 
puzzled about that.

 What was the evidence that the State court 
-- do you say that the State court refused to consider 
evidence that was proffered to it?

 MR. BRESS:  No, Your Honor.  The State court 

did not refuse to consider evidence proffered to it. 
The State court refused to permit the full development 
of the evidence.  And it -- I mean it misled the court 
--

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I didn't hear the -- the 

last part.

 MR. BRESS:  The State court refused to 

permit the evidence to be fully developed, Your Honor. 
They didn't refuse to consider evidence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  What do you mean by that? 

What specifically did they --

MR. BRESS:  Specifically, Your Honor, the

State provided 120 days to develop the State habeas 
petition.  The Petitioners during that time developed 14 
different claims, including the claim that's at issue 
here today.

 In the course of that they interviewed, I 

think, 11 different witnesses.  For the ineffective-
assistance-of-counsel claim they got affidavits.  They 
also interviewed all 12 jurors for five different claims 
of juror misconduct.  They interviewed five different 
witnesses for Brady claims, et cetera.

 They ran out of time, Your Honor, and they 

asked the court for more time on repeated occasions. 
They asked the court to investigate --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But that really does not 

present the question that you asked the Court to decide.
 MR. BRESS:  Well, Your Honor, if you read it 

that way, it would not, but I don't read the question 
presented that way.  I read the question presented to 
present the question of when the district court properly 
hears evidence after a finding of diligence by the 
prisoner and holds that the State court didn't provide a 
full and fair opportunity to that prisoner to develop 
the facts in State court, that where the evidence is 
important the -- the district court may consider that 
evidence, rather than giving deference to the State

court.

 And giving deference to the State court is 
not even on the table any longer in this case.  It was 
-- what the Fourth Circuit did, the Fourth Circuit took 
the new evidence into account and deferred to the State 
court nonetheless.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why wouldn't he have 

brought that new evidence to the attention of the State 
court first?  Why wasn't he obliged to bring it to the 
attention of the State court?

 MR. BRESS:  He didn't have the new evidence, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, he could have a 

post-conviction proceeding in the State court.

 MR. BRESS:  Actually, no, he couldn't, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  A State habeas.
 MR. BRESS:  I'm sorry.  The -- as the 
Virginia Commonwealth attorneys point out in their 
amicus brief, there is a rule in the Virginia State 
court that any facts not set out in the habeas petition 
at the State level can't be brought in later.  He wasn't 
able to bring the facts in afterwards.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, weren't the 
facts merely cumulative evidence of his claim that was

before the State court?

 MR. BRESS:  No, they weren't, Your Honor. 

There were three categories of new facts or new evidence 
that came in on Federal habeas.

 And if I may, the first -- the first of them 

had to do with facts that undermined the State's claim 
of aggravation.  The State relied on only one 
aggravating factor.  That was future dangerousness.  And 
in the course of that, in developing it, their number 
one emphasis was on one adjudicated -- unadjudicated bad 
act, and this was a story told by Billy Jo Swartz about 
an alleged horrific assault on her and of Tracy 
Nicholson, who was a girlfriend of the Petitioner.

 What the jury didn't know at the time was 
that both Tracy and her mother, who were there, said 
that the incident did not occur, that there was no 
assault there, and Billy Jo Swartz was a liar.

 Now, on State habeas, Joanne did submit an 

affidavit and, in that affidavit, said that Billy Jo 
Swartz had lied.  That created a dispute of fact at the 
State level, but unfortunately rather than hear the 
witnesses to determine the credibility and -- the 
Virginia Supreme Court instead decided against 
Petitioner.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think that

supports my suggestion, which is that the evidence was 
cumulative.  There was a dispute on that issue.  There 
was evidence on both sides.  And now you say, hey, we've 
got more evidence.

 MR. BRESS:  Well, it's not more evidence, 

Your Honor; it's just that a dispute over the facts 
where credibility is at issue shouldn't be decided on 
the papers.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the Virginia Supreme 

Court, on habeas, said we are going to accept as true 
all the facts as the Petitioner alleged them.  They said 
specifically "all facts alleged in the petition will be 
taken as true."

 MR. BRESS:  And if they had done that, Your 

Honor, I think that we'd be in a different position.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They said they did.
 MR. BRESS:  They said, on the one hand, they 
did, and yet, on the other hand, when they were looking, 
for example, at Joanne Nicholson's testimony, they said 
she could have been effectively impeached by other 
statements that she had made, that in their household, 
she had never seen Bell be physically abusive to her 
daughter.  Now, Joanne Nicholson and Tracy Nicholson 
have said throughout that he was never physically 
abusive to Tracy.  The supposed impeachment would have

come from police court records that have never been 
introduced in this case.  So the Virginia Supreme Court, 
without a hearing, just said, on the one hand, we accept 
these facts as true and, on the other hand, even though 
Joanne Nicholson would testify that this event never 
occurred that way, she would have been impeached so the 
jury wouldn't have believed it.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, your argument is 

dependent on the proposition that the claim that was 
advanced in the Federal habeas proceeding is a different 
claim from a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in 
the State court?

 MR. BRESS:  That's right, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  And if that's the case, I 

don't understand why your adversary is not correct that 
it will always be possible in capital cases for an 
ineffective assistance of counsel claim that has been 
adjudicated on the merits in the State court to be 
advanced and get de novo review in Federal habeas, where 
every aspect of the defendant's life that is potentially 
favorable can be advanced as a basis for mitigation. 
You know, when your firm with all of its expertise and 
resources comes into the case at the Federal habeas 
level, will it not always be the case that you will be 
able to find some additional mitigation evidence and

then, under your theory, that will be a new claim and it 
well get de novo review?

 MR. BRESS:  I'd like to answer that 
question, Justice Alito, in two ways:  One very 
practical, which is that the Ninth and Tenth Circuits 
have adopted the rule that we advocated for years.  The 
Sixth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit have adopted that 
rule for Brady claims, and we haven't seen the flood 
that supposedly is going to come through the gates.

 Secondly, on a more theoretical level, for 

someone to be able to introduce this new evidence on 
Federal habeas, they have to first be able to 
demonstrate that they were diligent in attempting 
formulate it in the State court.  Second, they've got to 
be able to demonstrate that it's important and 
importantly changes the overall factual mix.  Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't get the diligence 
part because the whole ineffective assistance of counsel 
is the client isn't expected to do any of this; it's 
counsel that's been ineffective.

 MR. BRESS:  Your Honor, I'm referring to 
Michael Williams, which talks about diligence by the 
State habeas counsel.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, it doesn't translate 

into ineffective assistance of counsel because the

client is not the one -- the lawyer has been -- has not 
been diligent, but there is nothing that the client 
could do.  I just don't see how --

MR. BRESS:  Well --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- how you could talk 
about the diligent -- the diligent client bringing up 
the ineffectiveness of his lawyer.

 MR. BRESS:  Your Honor, we understand and 
appreciate the diligence of habeas counsel is not any 
kind of excuse and can't be -- statutorily it can't be, 
actually under 2554, but what we are talking about is 
whether the prisoner and his counsel were diligent in 
seeking to develop the facts for their claim when they 
were on State habeas.  That's what Michael Williams had 
to do with it.  Michael Williams equated diligence with 
reasonable efforts and said that the contrary would be 
negligence.

 In this case we've got a finding by the 

district court that Bell and his lawyers were diligent 
in seeking to develop their ineffective assistance of 
counsel claim at State habeas.  And that's what allows 
them under (e), that's what says that they didn't fail 
to develop the evidence under (e)(2) and allows them to 
go through the gate of (e).

demonstrate that diligence.  You also have to 
demonstrate that you're able to develop new facts that 
matter, that are important, that are significant.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you use the -- to say 
that it's a new claim, because that's what it has to be, 
right, but it's such an extraordinary use of "claim."  I 
mean, we have exhibit cases, the notion is a claim, is a 
tort claim or a contract claim, but not additional 
evidence in support of the basic claim.  The basic claim 
is ineffective assistance of counsel.

 MR. BRESS:  Your Honor, I appreciate that 

it's not "claim" as it's used ordinarily in the Rules of 
Civil Procedure or when you're talking about making 
claims in that sort of a complaint.  However, this 
Court, including an opinion -- Banks v. Dretke, for 
example, talked about the two different Brady claims in 
that case as separate claims, even though they were 
withholdings by the same prosecutor.  More closely even, 
in Michael Williams, there were two separate 
withholdings of evidence to impeach the same witness.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So I'm trying 

to figure out how the statute works.

 MR. BRESS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And it seems to me that the 
way it's supposed to work -- have you read, by the way,

the facts of the case for December in Bell v. Cohen? 
No?  Okay.  Forget that.  I was going to shorthand that 
because it's similar to the hypothetical I'm thinking 
of.

 What happens is that the -- the State court 
now says, okay, I assume all the facts in your favor and 
you don't prevail.  All right.  Now, he goes into 
Federal court and he has some new facts.  Now, either 
they are such that they transform the claim and it's a 
new claim.  I mean, in that case there is an argument 
for that, maybe not in yours, or they aren't.  Now, if 
they aren't, then what he is supposed to do, the judge, 
is go look and decide on the basis of what they 
presented to the State.  That's the end of it.

 Now, if they are, he is supposed to exhaust. 

You go back, you exhaust this new claim like any other 
new claim, and if the State bars it, then you go and see 
if there was cause and prejudice.  And that's how it's 
supposed to work.  And if there was cause and prejudice, 
then you have the hearing.  Okay?  That's how it's 
supposed to work factually.

 I have no idea if that's what went on here, 

but if it -- it didn't seem to me -- there was some 
confusion about whether the procedures are adequate in 
the State.  Then there is some other thing that this

might be the same claim.  I mean, I don't see how we get 
to the question we took this case to decide, frankly, 
without knowing what the basis was and whether it was 
correct for the district court to give him any hearing 
at all.

 MR. BRESS:  Okay, Your Honor.  I'd like to 
address that.  I think that that's essentially how this 
works in this case.  What the district -- what the 
district court did here is it first made a finding of 
was there diligence?  Because it has to do that under 
Michael Williams to even take the next step.  Did the 
Petitioner --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the first step.  The 

first step, I'd go and see -- but at any rate, you go 
ahead.

 MR. BRESS:  Right.  But it had to take that 

step.  And it had to take that step, by the way, of 
course, with (d) in mind as well, because this Court in 
Schriro said there is no reason to have hearing if it is 
separately precluded by another predicate.  In Schriro, 
obviously, it was the refusal to -- to allow mitigating 
evidence.  So it does that.  Then it determines 
separately under Townsend, was there a problem in State 
court that -- did you have a full and fair hearing, and 
if you can prove the facts that you state, would you

win, and so those allowed the court the discretion to 
hold a hearing.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why wouldn't you say 
right off the bat, new claim, go present it to the State 
court, and exhausts it?

 MR. BRESS:  Well this couldn't have been 

presented in the State court.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?
 MR. BRESS:  Well as the State argued below, 

it would have been procedurally deficient.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  Suppose we 

have -- that's what I want, not these facts, but I want 
the facts where really, he couldn't have discovered 
this, because the first time that the district attorney 
opened his files for the Brady claim was 140 days after. 
So we now have some totally new, which he couldn't have 
gotten; no one disputes it.  Where, that kind of 
thing -- I think he would have to present it to the 
State court, wouldn't he?

 MR. BRESS:  Well, Your Honor, according to 
the warden at least, in this case if you took let's say 
the facts of Banks v Dretke, which this Court decided, 
where when you were in front of the State court, what 
you knew was that the girlfriend of the prisoner had 
said that one of the witnesses was particularly close to

law enforcement, and on that basis they made a claim, a 
Brady claim in State court.  It was denied because it 
wasn't factually developed enough, all right?

 So they went to Federal court and in Federal 

court they got a lot more evidence that supported that 
claim.  They actually found out that in fact this person 
was a Government informant, and on that basis this Court 
found cause and prejudice and addressed that that 
claim --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you must have been 

assuming then that the State would not give that person 
a -- a new opportunity to consider the new evidence.

 MR. BRESS:  Well, that's absolutely true --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose it were really new.
 MR. BRESS:  The State statute is 

unequivocal.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but so is it in 

Tennessee, and in Tennessee there is an exception where 
you could bring the thing up because you couldn't 
possibly have gotten over it.

 MR. BRESS:  Your Honor, there is no 

exception here in Virginia.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So in Virginia a person 
discovers for the first time, 140 days later looks at 
the D.A.'s files, and discovers something that shows the

whole trial was a farce -- I mean, something 
unbelievable, and there is no way for the person under 
Virginia law to bring that up in a State court?

 MR. BRESS:  Not in this sort of a claim. 

No, Your Honor, there isn't.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Bress, your --
you're argument that this can't be brought up assumes 
that it is a new claim rather than the same claim, 
right?  Because if it were just the same claim then the 
question would be it is simply cumulative rather than 
new?

 MR. BRESS:  If it's the same claim for 

2254(d) purposes, yes, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  And I guess 
it gets back to Justice Ginsburg's question.  We usually 
don't consider claims different if there is just new 
evidence, but here didn't the Fourth Circuit necessarily 
determine that this was the same claim in deciding to 
defer to the State court findings?

 MR. BRESS:  Yes, it did, Your Honor.  The 

Fourth Circuit viewed this as the same claim and that's 
the root of some of our disagreement with them.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And if fact you got 
more than you were entitled to, because it did look at 
the new evidence, albeit through the guise of deference,

but it shouldn't have even looked at that at all.

 MR. BRESS:  Your Honor.  We would agree that 

that -- that interim solution is not a plausible 
solution, so we would agree with that, on the new 
evidence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if we think that 

they were right -- and we are, I think we are getting 
away from the question presented -- if we agree that 
they are right, that this is the same claim and it's 
just additional evidence, then you lose.

 MR. BRESS:  No, not necessarily, Your Honor. 

We also argued on separate grounds where the State's 
procedure is inadequate, then the -- the State's 
application of -- of Federal law would have been 
unreasonable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Bress, may I ask you a 

question --

MR. BRESS:  And if that's true --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I ask you a question 

which sort of goes to the utility of raising that issue 
here, and it's a preliminary, not a doctrinal question. 
But --

MR. BRESS:  Sure.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- my understanding is that 
in the United States District Court on the Federal habe

-- the district court made a -- drew a conclusion based 
on the evidence before it, no deference to the State 
court, that in fact your client did not demonstrate 
prejudice.  And my understanding is that that --
although the Fourth Circuit did not rely upon that, my 
understanding is that that -- that finding remains 
undisturbed.  Is that correct?

 MR. BRESS:  Your Honor, what the district 

court found, as the Fourth Circuit saw it and as we see 
it, was that the State court's finding of prejudice was 
not unreasonable.  Now, I acknowledge that when you read 
the district court's oral ruling you won't see a 
reference to 2254(d).

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.
 MR. BRESS:  However, when you look at what 

the State court wrote in its written ruling, what it 
says is there is a colorable claim that the State court 
was unreasonable, on -- in application of law to the 
facts and development of the facts, and then it said 
that they will -- that the court would not decide this 
issue yet, until it has a hearing; and so the Fourth 
Circuit looked at what the district court wrote and 
presumed that consistent with what it had written, it 
then confronted this issue, the issue of reasonability, 
orally; and it didn't require that when a judge is

saying something orally, as opposed to putting it in a 
written opinion, that it dot every i and cross every t. 
It assumed that it meant what it had said earlier.  If 
this Court has any doubt about that, however, it could 
certainly remand with instructions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I that what it was saying 
is there is legitimate -- this is a Strickland question. 
Strickland has two parts.  Part A is were counsel 
inadequate; and Part B is did it make any difference? 
It seemed to me the district court was just making a 
straight out Strickland determination and not deferring 
to anything else.  It was just saying no, I've looked at 
all the evidence, and yes -- they certainly were -- they 
were not effective.  On the other hand, there is no 
prejudice because using the strict Strickland test, 
there was no reasonable likelihood that a jury would 
have come out differently.

 MR. BRESS:  Your Honor, consistent with the 
Fourth Circuit, we don't read him to say that.  But even 
if he meant that, the Fourth Circuit certainly on --
looked at this from a reasonableness standpoint, and not 
from a de novo standpoint.  So even had the district 
court meant a de novo review and engaged in it, we still 
didn't get the correct standard or review on appeal.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh, that may be.  I didn't

mean to imply you didn't have a Fourth Circuit question. 
I -- I guess I was raising a question to whether it is 
wise to make this the case to decide the Fourth Circuit 
issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Bress, this case 
involves Section 2254(d), right?  Does that appear 
somewhere in the briefs?  It would be nice to have it in 
front of me.

 MR. BRESS:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, it's a central 

thing the case is about.  I cannot find it in any of the 
briefs.  Appendix to the petition for cert; I got -- I 
got to go back to that.  Don't you think it's important 
enough to be in your brief?

 MR. BRESS:  If I may return to the Chief 

Judge's -- Chief Justice's question from earlier, there 
are other new claims, new facts here that are equally 
important in deciding whether this is a new claim.  For 
example, physical child abuse first came into this case, 
and really was first discovered --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know, but they're 

-- your underlying theory is that if you get a lot of 
new evidence, that somehow changes the claim.  And 
again, I think Justice Ginsburg -- I'm having trouble 
getting my arms around that, and particularly since it's

problematic in this area where there is always new 
evidence.

 You're looking at someone's childhood.  You 

can always find a new anecdote, a new concern going 
either way, that you know, this was unusual because he 
was a good child, or this is excused because he had such 
a bad upbringing.

 MR. BRESS:  Mr. Chief Justice, two responses 

to this.  Number one -- and you know, as I've said 
before, this Court has used claim I think in similar 
ways.  It may have been colloquial but it at least 
demonstrates that it can use it.

 I'm not saying it's the most normal, or the 

ordinary course definition, but I am saying that it's 
the definition that's necessary to read (d) and (e) 
together in a way that makes sense; and if I can just 
explain why I think that's true.

 If you look at (e), (e) says that you can 

get a hearing even if you weren't diligent in State 
court, if the facts that you need to develop were not 
reasonably available in State court and if they would 
prove by clear and convincing evidence that you are 
innocent.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right, well 

just -- we've got two but just to stop you on one.  The

fact that they excuse your failure to raise and present 
the evidence in State court doesn't mean that when you 
get the evidence you have a new claim.  It just means 
that they are going to let you raise a claim you could 
have raised before.

 MR. BRESS:  Well, if what they are talking 

about is -- if that includes the ability when you are in 
State court -- assume, for instance, House versus Bell, 
just if can take that as an example.

 I'm sorry, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I've gotten over it.
 MR. BRESS:  I don't know, but if we can --
if we can just look at the facts of that case briefly: 
Assume that in State court, despite diligent a effort, 
they were able to come up with some of the evidence but 
not all of the evidence that they later came up with in 
terms of the blood spattering, the DNA, and such.

 Their claim is denied on the -- on the 
merits because they weren't able to get much of the 
evidence in and denied in State courts.  They couldn't 
go to Federal courts where they were able to bring in 
all of that evidence, and let's say even more, enough to 
prove by clear and convincing evidence that they were 
innocent.

 Under the warden's view, you'd still go back

to the State court opinion and decide whether it was 
intrinsically reasonable.  And so long as it is, you 
wouldn't -- the State court gets affirmed, and none of 
that new evidence of innocence comes in.

 Now, I guess it's a possible solution, but 
the question is:  Is that what Congress really intended 
here?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I might say the new claim 

-- okay, so it's a new claim.  I don't know if yours is, 
by the way, but suppose it's a new claim.  Then what you 
ought to do is go back to the State court and exhaust. 
So now what you show is that that's futile.

 Now we get to your question before us. 

Okay.  So it's an imaginary case.  It's less imaginary 
in December than here.  But, anyway, the -- the -- you 
get back to the State court.  Now, what is supposed to 
happen?

 At that point I guess the statute leaves the 

judge free to develop the facts.  It doesn't say you 
can't.  Okay.  So then you do it.

 Now we have the question, which when we took 

this we thought we could reach, but I don't know if we 
can -- now we have the question:  When the judge makes 
the decision on the basis of those facts, if they have 
never developed any of this in State court, fine.  Then

have -- then just do it.  If it is a regular case, don't 
defer it.

 But suppose some of the things have been in 
State court related to this but not others.  Now what do 
we do?

 MR. BRESS:  Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean that's not an 

obvious answer to that one.

 MR. BRESS:  I -- I think that in -- in that 
case, by the way, you still have to defer to the State 
factfinding.  I think you always have to when the State 
determines particular facts.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What it's going to do is 
it's going to be finding facts on the basis of certain 
evidence.  And what you will have gotten your new claim 
granted on is the fact that you found some new evidence 
that's very significant, and you couldn't possibly have 
found it before.

 Now what do we do?  Do we defer in part; do 
we defer -- I mean now what does the district judge do?
 MR. BRESS:  Well, I think that, again, you 

have to defer under (e)(1) presumably to particular fact 
findings and find that by clear and convincing evidence 
you've disproved those facts.  But, otherwise, I don't 
think you could find the application of law to fact.  I

don't think you can under Holland, et cetera.

 Now, you know, just to make this a little 

bit clearer, hopefully, in -- in Keeney, upon which this 
Court drew in Michael Williams, the Court looked -- the 
Court did -- looked at a potential distinction between 
the failure properly to make a claim in State court and 
the failure properly to develop the facts for that 
claim.

 Now, the Court looked at that distinction in 
the context of seeing whether cause and prejudice, which 
applied to certainly the major claim in the State court, 
should apply to the failure to fully develop it.  And 
what it said is that distinguishing between those two 
circumstances is irrational.

 Now, I would submit that it's similarly 

irrational to attribute to Congress the intent to 
distinguish between the circumstances, or because of 
these limitations you have in State court, despite your 
effort, you weren't able to fully develop the record.

 And the State decided the case on an 

inadequate record.  It comes to Federal court.  Do you 
simply defer?  I mean do you simply stop when you say 
the State court reasonably decided this case based on an 
inadequate State court record, or do you allow that 
record to be fully developed and decide it on its

merits?

 That's, I think, the issue that we are 

presenting today.  I'd like to reserve --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I just ask one quick 

question?  The -- the answer, I take it, on -- based on 
what you just said, the answer to the -- the need-
to-exhaust point is you don't have to exhaust because 
you already tried to exhaust in the State court, and 
they didn't give you enough time to get your evidence 
in.  That is --

MR. BRESS:  That's precisely it, Your Honor. 

Thank you.

Mr. Bress.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

 Ms. Burnett.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE BURNETT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. BURNETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The claim in Bell's case is the textbook 
example of a claim that the effective death penalty 
intended for 2254(d) to apply to.  In the Virginia 
Supreme Court, Bell presented his claim with his 
allegations of what he says counsel didn't present and 
didn't find at trial.  And the Virginia Supreme Court

assumed the truth of all of those allegations and did 
not contest any of them.  There were never any facts in 
dispute.  The State never contested any facts.

 The State court assumed them all true, and 

then applied -- faithfully applied this Court's 
established precedent under Strickland and Wiggins, in 
particular, and weighed that evidence that he had 
claimed had not been found by his counsel against the 
aggravating evidence in this case of a drug dealer who 
killed premeditatedly a police officer in a small town 
and upon weighing that found as a -- as a matter -- as a 
de novo matter on the merits that he could not show 
prejudice.  Because there was no reasonable probability 
that a jury would have found a life sentence giving --
assuming the truth of everything he alleged.

 Now, when he went to Federal court, the 

Fourth Circuit faithfully applied 2254(d) to that after 
addressing all of the same evidence and also agreeing 
that there was no prejudice, and then said that the 
State court decision was not unreasonable under 2254(d).
 Now, Bell comes to this Court and says for 

the first time that I have a new claim, and that was not 
made below, and this is not a new claim.  Everything 
that he presented in Federal court was presented to the 
State court.  There is absolutely no difference.  In

fact, to the effect that there was some difference in 
the district court and the State alleged -- we pleaded 
default because he presented a few new affidavits.

 The district court resolved that and said: 
I'm not even going to look at those because they aren't 
critical to my decision.  I am only going to look at --
and he described in particular the exact same record 
that the Virginia Supreme Court had found.  And then the 
district court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what about the 

point that Mr. Bress made that there wasn't enough time 
in the Virginia Supreme Court on habeas to develop 
everything that was later put before the district court; 
that there was a very short time to get the petition in, 
and there were many issues other than ineffective 
assistance of counsel?

 MS. BURNETT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, there 

were approximately 12 issues in this case that the 
district court disposed of in a very lengthy opinion. 
It was only this one issue that the district court found 
-- believed that he needed to have a hearing on, we 
believe erroneously.  But, nevertheless, he had the 
hearing and -- and listened to all the same evidence.

 Nothing, Justice Ginsburg -- in our opinion 
nothing prevented Bell from presenting the allegations

that were presented to the Federal court and all the 
allegations that he presented to the State court.  There 
was no State court procedure or denial of anything.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Did he make any request 

from the State court for more time?

 MS. BURNETT:  Your Honor, I don't -- I don't 

--

yes.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Your brother is nodding 

 MS. BURNETT:  He may very well have, but the 
point is that there was nothing that he presented to the 
Federal court that he didn't also present to the State 
court.  So he was not prevented from -- that -- that's a 
red herring in this case.

 Now, he had some very strong arguments that 

he made in both the State court and in the district 
court on other claims; not on this claim but on other 
claims, that he believed that he should have been able 
to develop certain evidence.  And the district court 
actually on those other claims -- some of them, it found 
faulted and some not.  But not on this claim.  On this 
claim --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  If we had -- if we had --
and I -- I emphasize I'm -- I'm not suggesting this is 
your case.  But if we had a case in which with respect 

30 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

to the disputed issue he had asked for more time -- I'll 
make it easy.  He had asked for more time and -- and had 
-- had indicated that there were leads that needed to be 
followed that couldn't be followed unless he got more 
time and so on, and the State court refused.  Could he 
then come into the Federal court and say:  My claim here 
is not only ineffective assistance, but ineffective 
assistance with the overlay of the refusal of the State 
courts to give me an adequate opportunity to develop my 
-- my ineffective assistance claim?  And if he made a 
colorable showing on those two issues, would he then 
have an opportunity for a Federal evidentiary issue, and 
would the findings that eventuated from that be subject 
to -- in effect, to -- to being short- circuited by 
deference to the State court findings?

 MS. BURNETT:  I think my answer to that has 

to be that it depends because the statute before the 
effective Death Penalty Act in 1996 had clearly had what 
we would call the Chandler v. Dane factors in which 
would you look at the adequacy of a State court process. 
Those were removed after 1996, so the statute does not 
provide authority for a Federal court to go in and 
determine was the process adequate if the decision, 
itself, was reasonable.  Now if we are talking -- this 
is why this case --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if you don't -- I guess 
what I'm getting at is if we don't in that circumstance 
recognize that there is a legitimately different claim 
which is not, for the reason I suggested to Mr. Bress, 
not subject to further exhaustion requirements because 
they tried and the State court wouldn't let them do 
it -- if we don't in that case recognize that there is a 
claim that can be litigated in the Federal court, which 
will not be subject to deference to State court 
findings, then there is a very clear hole in the law, 
and I assume Congress didn't mean to leave it.  I 
understand you're saying that is not this case.  But 
isn't that a legitimate problem to-- to face at some 
point.

 MS. BURNETT:  Justice Souter, we don't 

believe so and here's why:  Because it is true, Congress 
did not change the procedural default doctrine.  In the 
Effective Death Penalty Act Congress left that alone. 
In fact, this Court recognized that in House v. Bell. 
So when we are talking about new facts or new claims, 
either one, you're talking about unexhausted or 
defaulted matters, which the district courts are very 
familiar how to handle that.  Has he shown cause and 
prejudice?  Has he shown diligence?

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I think you're right in the

main.  I think that's generally correct.  The case that 
I'm concerned with is the case of the -- of the Brady 
claim, because if we are proceeding under (e) then as I 
understand the cause and prejudice can only be 
established in the case we are talking about if there 
can be shown a probability of a different verdict.
 The Brady standard, however, does not 

require the probability of a different verdict.  Brady 
uses the term "reasonable probability that there would 
have been a different result," but that has been clearly 
defined in the cases to mean reasonable possibility.  So 
that in fact with respect to Brady claims subsection (e) 
is imposing a higher requirement than Brady did and a 
higher requirement than would have been applied before 
Brady.  And that is the case, it seems to me, that we --
it may not be this case, but that's the case that we've 
got to be concerned about in coming up with doctrine 
here.  Isn't that a legitimate concern?

 MS. BURNETT:  Justice Souter -- and I agree 
that's not this case.  But this Court's already crossed 
that bridge.  That was Michael Williams.  Michael 
Williams was where the individual comes to Federal court 
with brand new evidence and he has no remedy left in 
State court.  It is defaulted, and what do we do with 
that?  And this Court very clearly -- now, as the issue

was presented to this Court in that case it was whether 
he gets a hearing or not, so that's what was addressed. 
But this Court also addressed the fact that it most 
likely was and was a defaulted claim and that it --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But I don't, I don't think 
this Court understood the implication of it when you get 
into the Brady issue.  And my only concern is we've got 
to leave that door open because I don't think Williams 
confronted that.

 MS. BURNETT:  And I -- I agree with Your 

Honor that it's not this case.  I think Michael Williams 
addresses it and I think that the current existing in 
place cause and prejudice and actual innocence 
exceptions to default answer all of that.  And I believe 
that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I understand your position.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm still trying to 

understand the statute.  I think their point is we get 
around (d), (d) doesn't bar us because the district 
court here, the Federal district court, found that it 
was an unreasonable determination of the facts, not 
unreasonable on the substance, but unreasonable because 
of the procedure.  In other words, the State that barred 
this evidence was having an unreasonable procedure and 
therefore the determination of the facts is

unreasonable.  So you're saying that isn't what those 
words "unreasonable determination of the facts" mean.

 MS. BURNETT:  Well, what I'm saying --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You mean you're saying that 
(d)(2), "unreasonable determination of the facts," means 
the factual outcome.  In other words, if the factual 
outcome is reasonable it doesn't matter if the 
procedures are inadequate; is that your claim.

 MS. BURNETT:  Well, no.  I believe that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No?  I thought you just 

said that in answer to Justice Souter.

 MS. BURNETT:  I believe that (d)(2) very 

clearly -- yes, I think I'm agreeing with you that

State court decision.

procedures are correct?

 MS. BURNETT:  Correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
 MS. BURNETT:  Correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So that's the first 
thing we have to decide to get to the question.  If your 
wrong on that -- and I doesn't know the answer to it --
if you're wrong on that, then they're rid of (d).  So 
they say then, we're rid of (e) because it falls within

(a)(2), the factual predicate and due diligence, okay. 
They say we are rid of (e) because of that.  Now, how 
they get around capital (B) I'm not sure, but that isn't 
in the case.

 MS. BURNETT:  Justice Breyer, I'm not sure 
they they've argued those exceptions (a)(2) at (i) and 
(ii).  I believe they're simply arguing --

JUSTICE BREYER:  They're arguing due 

diligence.

 MS. BURNETT:  My reading of their brief is 

they are saying:  We are Michael Williams and all 
Michael Williams dealt with was the opening sentence of 
(e)(2).

 JUSTICE BREYER:  (I).  You mean of (e)(2) --
MS. BURNETT:  Of (e)(2).
 JUSTICE BREYER:  (E)(2).
 MS. BURNETT:  "If the applicant has failed 
to develop," and Michael Williams interpreted that as 
someone who has not been diligent in developing the 
record.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So we also get --

they get around that because they say the due diligence. 
You also have an argument about how (2) applies.  And if 
you're wrong about both of those then we get to the 
question, which would be:  If the -- if the hearing's

properly before us and it's a new claim -- it's also 
saying it's a new claim -- if it's a new claim it has to 
be exhausted.  So under Virginia law, under Virginia 
law, is it really true that -- suppose, not this case, 
but suppose a Defendant 140 days after discovers the DA 
says, makes some remark.  He couldn't have known about 
it.  He goes to a special file.  He couldn't have found 
out about.  And lo and behold, it's the worst thing you 
can imagine, and you can imagine some pretty bad ones 
but this is even worse.  Now under Virginia law are 
you -- is it your view that Virginia courts would say 
you're out of luck, good-bye?

 MS. BURNETT:  Yes, Your Honor, and this 

Court has recognized that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No matter what, it's 

goodbye?

 MS. BURNETT:  Yes, and here's why:  Because 

Virginia has twin statutes that would bar any further 
applications to State court.  One is the statute of 
limitations that is strictly applied and the other is a 
statute which says in essence --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No excuse?  Even if --
MS. BURNETT:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
 MS. BURNETT:  And this Court has --

37 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So they are right about, 

they are right about the exhaustion being futile.

 MS. BURNETT:  It is defaulted, yes, Your 

Honor.  In Virginia those are defaulted claims, and now 
we are in Federal court with those claims.  The Federal 
court judges are very familiar with how to do with them. 
Has he shown cause and prejudice?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The first time he discovers 

DNA evidence in the DA's file that shows he couldn't 
have done it, there is no way to get relief under 
Virginia law?

 MS. BURNETT:  Not in State court.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Not in State court.
 MS. BURNETT:  No, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, then they're right 

about that.

 MS. BURNETT:  That's correct.  So now he is 
in Federal court and he has -- he has the thresholds of 
cause and prejudice or actual innocence.  And that's a 
very familiar thing, is what I'm saying, is that the 
district courts are familiar with.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, then let me ask you 
on the merits.  If he's right there and it's exhaustion 
and it really was a new claim, then wouldn't we apply a 
decision that does not defer to the State court, because

after all the State court never heard this issue?

 MS. BURNETT:  That's not this case.  But in 

a hypothetical case where there are new facts, 
unexhausted defaulted claims or facts that are presented 
to a Federal court --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  There is no real 

argument between the two of you as to the -- as to the 
issue that we thought was presented.

 MS. BURNETT:  Well, I think not.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But there's certainly an 

argument --

MS. BURNETT:  The argument is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If it's really a new claim, 

you're going to say they applied --

MS. BURNETT:  Well, our argument is that, 
Court, don't use this case to say that, because if the 
Court uses this case to say that it will be putting its 
imprimatur on what the district court did in holding a 
hearing when we don't think it was appropriate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Fourth Circuit 
-- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but the Fourth Circuit 
didn't decide that question either.

presented to them, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do you want us to 

dispose of the case that doesn't, that doesn't do that? 
What do you want us to do?

 MS. BURNETT:  I think the Court could 

dismiss this as improvidently granted.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's it?
 MS. BURNETT:  I think the Court could do 

that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you, so I 

understand your position on the underlying question if 
we don't dismiss.  Am I correct that the granting of an 
evidentiary hearing was based on a showing by the 
Petitioner that he failed to develop facts which might 
change the result?

 MS. BURNETT:  Justice Stevens, there was 

never any showing, there was never any showing of 
diligence.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why did the -- why did the 

Federal court grant a hearing?

 MS. BURNETT:  The Federal court simply 

announced that he was going to hold a hearing on this 
claim and decide later --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Wasn't he only entitled to 

do that on the basis of a showing that there was more 
evidence that the State court did not consider?

MS. BURNETT:  Yes, Your Honor.  I believe 

first he had --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So maybe the district 

court was dead wrong, but the assumption I think we made 
when we took the case was that there was a body of 
evidence that had not been available in the State 
proceeding that might be available in the Federal 
proceeding.

 MS. BURNETT:  I think that was the 

misunderstanding.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And if that were true -- I 

know you disagree with that and I understand your 
argument.  Maybe we shouldn't have taken the case.  But 
if that were true and the Federal court then had to 
decide on the basis of all the evidence, do you read the 
statute to say at that time he may only rely on the 
evidence presented to the State court?

 MS. BURNETT:  The way I read the statute is 
that that is the first thing that the judge was required 
to do.  He had to first determine whether the State 
court's decision was reasonable.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  All right.  Suppose he 

looked at the State court evidence and he says, that was 
not enough.  The State court's decision on the merits 
was reasonable based on that record.  I have a different

record before me.  May he look at the different record?
 MS. BURNETT:  He can -- I think -- I think 
then we are talking about what I was just saying, new 
facts, new claims.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's what we're talking 

about.  May he look at it?

 MS. BURNETT:  And then the judge has to go 
through the determination, before he can decide whether 
he can look at it, of whether these new facts or new 
claims meet cause and prejudice or actual innocence.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  All right.  Forget the 

cause and prejudice for just a moment.  But if he looks 
at that new evidence and he decides that any neutral 
judge would have reached a different result from the 
State judge on that evidence, may he reach that result?

 MS. BURNETT:  I don't think just -- I do not 

believe the judge can do that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then what's the point --
MS. BURNETT:  -- just simply to say I'm 

going to look at just the correctness of the decision 
first, and then decide whether it's correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  What you're saying is the 
correctness of decision based on the State court record. 
And if he decides there was a sound decision on that 
record, that's the end of the ball game; is that your

position?

 MS. BURNETT:  Well, I think it is, unless --
unless there are actually new matters that are presented 
to the Federal court that the Federal court now is going 
to --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  It's the same claim.  It's 

the same claim.

 MS. BURNETT:  Yes.  Even on the same claim.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then it seems to me the 

statute has constructed a pointless procedure.

 MS. BURNETT:  Your Honor, I -- I don't see 

that at all.  It seems to me it's a very orderly 
progression, that the -- that the -- the Effective Death 
Penalty Act is now telling district court judges, and 
has made clear that it's doing this for judicial -- for 
purposes of judicial economy, for finality, for --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why shouldn't the district 

judge in light of the new evidence decide whether the 
judgment of the State court was -- would have been 
reasonable if it came out the same way, including this 
new evidence in the -- in the consideration?  Why 
shouldn't he do it that way.

 MS. BURNETT:  It could do that, Justice 

Scalia.

asking whether it should.

 MS. BURNETT:  I think -- I think that 

doesn't really fit with the statute -- with the 
statutory language.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it seems to me the 

statute certainly contemplates that the States have the 
first --

MS. BURNETT:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the first cut at this 
thing, right?  How else do you give them the first cut?
 MS. BURNETT:  Yes.  Absolutely.  And that's 
what I'm saying, and I think that -- to -- if the claim 
is going to in any way differ, it's going to change from 
what was presented to the State court.  On one level, 
that is all new matters that are defaulted, and in a 
very literal sense how can -- and I don't believe 
Congress intended for Federal courts to look at new 
matters, however they got to them, that were not 
presented to the State court, and on that basis 
determine whether the State court's decision was 
reached.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the Federal court is 

supposed to do what?

State court, under 2254(d), and the claimants before it. 
If it's the same claim, if it's the same matters that 
were adjudicated on the merits in the State court, it 
has to make the decision up front, was it reasonable or 
not?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
 MS. BURNETT:  Okay.  Now it makes that 

decision, and then after that, if the Petitioner says 
well, I have new matters, that I never presented to the 
State court, the Federal court has a -- a road map.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Now -- but the road map 
that you are now saying could be followed is the same 
road map implied by -- in your earlier answer to Justice 
Scalia, your reference to the new claim as being a 
defaulted claim.

 MS. BURNETT:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But we are concerned -- I 

think we are all concerned with the -- with the claim in 
which it is not defaulted, in the sense that he is at 
fault in any way for failing to get it into the Federal 
court -- I'm sorry -- get his entire presentation now 
into the State court then.  So that it is not a 
defaulted claim in the classic sense.  It is not a claim 
in which he is at fault by having failed to present it 
in the State court.

And in that case, if it cannot go back, if 
the State court will not take it back, don't we have to 
find at least implicit in the totality of subsections 
(d) and (e) the possibility of litigating the -- the 
fully developed claim in the Federal court without a 
need to defer to the State court findings?

 MS. BURNETT:  If implicit in your question 

is -- yes, implicit in your question is that the 
Petitioner has demonstrated cause; and he may or may not 
have depending on the facts.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, he -- I agree with 
you on the -- on the cause part; but the -- up to this 
point.  He has got to demonstrate cause and prejudice or 
at least he has got to develop cause.  Let me put it --
ask you this question.  If he simply says look, I tried 
to get this in to the State court, and he shows that, 
but the State court for whatever reason just would not 
take the evidence that he wanted to put in, is that 
enough for him to have --

MS. BURNETT:  It may be.  It may be.  And 

once again, that's certainly not this case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm -- I'm not asking to 

you stipulate --

But it's the case we are worried about around the 
corner.

 MS. BURNETT:  It may be.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  If that is -- this Court --
that's why I'm saying it's a very established law as to 
what cause is, and external impediments.  I mean, this 
Court has many cases that describe that.  The lower 
courts are very familiar with determining that, and so 
they can -- they are capable to making that 
determination as to whether the Federal court can now 
look at a new matter whether it's a new claim or --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But all we are -- I think 

all we are really getting at is that there are different 
kinds of new matters.  There are some new matters of 
which he absolutely knew nothing at the State court 
stage, and he is now saying don't hold that against me: 
i.e., I'm showing cause and I'll show prejudice.  This 
is new matter that he did or potentially know about and 
tried to get into, and under our hypothesis, the State 
court says no, I'm not going to hear it, or I won't give 
you the time, whatever the case may be.

 In that case, isn't it -- don't we have to 

say under the statute all he has got to show is cause in 
the sense that he tried and the State court wouldn't let 
him?  In order to --

very well constitute an external impediment --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MS. BURNETT:  -- to him being able to 

present it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Having established cause, 
he would then in your view not have the Federal court 
decide the matter de novo.  But the only question before 
the Federal court was whether there was in addition 
prejudice.

 MS. BURNETT:  Correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is to say, whether --
but for the error, any reasonable factfinder would find 
by clear and convincing evidence that he was innocent --

MS. BURNETT:  Correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- right?
 MS. BURNETT:  Correct.  And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In that instance is there 

room for the district court to hold an evidentiary 
hearing?

 MS. BURNETT:  Well, I think then you get --
that's -- I think it's actually a separate matter.  We 
first have to get to whether the Federal court can look 
at a new matter de novo.  If it can look at it de novo 
then I think we go to the pre-Effective Death Penalty

Act law about when you have a hearing.  Are there 
disputed facts?  Are they --
that make a difference? 
Is it something that actually, you know, needs to have 
resolution in a hearing?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you envisage 
circumstances in which an ineffective counsel 
assistance, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
was presented in the State court and then there is a 
second ineffective assistance in counsel's claims or a 
further supplemental ineffective assistance of counsel 
claim based on new evidence that the district court 
might hear?  Does that ever happen?

 MS. BURNETT:  I think it can happen, 

certainly.  I don't think it's restricted just to Brady. 
I mean, I think that it -- it is -- it is the same 
analysis, no matter what the claim is, it's the same 
analysis that the Federal court needs to go through to 
look -- to see whether it can consider new matter.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you think there could 
be instances, we might imagine, in which there could be 
two ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the second 
of which could be heard in the district court with 
evidentiary -- with an evidentiary hearing?

possible.  I think that the statutory setup and this

Court's established habeas procedures that it had in 
place for decades permits that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess the State court can 

say, you know, 60 days after the trial is -- is 
doomsday.  No more new evidence.  We are not going to 
consider anything new after that, even if you find Brady 
stuff or anything else.  Suppose that's 
unconstitutional -- but it isn't.  I mean, is that 
unconstitutional?

 MS. BURNETT:  Well, no, Your Honor, I don't 

believe it is.  In fact, the State court -- we don't 
have to provide for direct appeals.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  So if it's not 

unconstitutional, then you just provide what you say, 
that the district court sees whether by clear and 
convincing evidence the case would have come out the 
other way.

 If it were unconstitutional, and I guess 

this is what is sticking in our craw -- my craw, 
anyway -- if it were unconstitutional, it seems to me 
there ought to be a way to make the State take the first 
cut at it.  Make the State say oh, yes, even with this 
new evidence we would still find this person guilty; and 
then in Federal habeas you would -- you would apply the 
deference that 2254(d) requires.  You'd ask whether that

was a reasonable determination.

 MS. BURNETT:  Right.  And all I can say to 
that, Justice Scalia, is this Court has never held that 
the Constitution applies anywhere after the direct 
appeal, and that's only the right to cancel.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the fallacy in my --

in my reasoning.  Or you're saying I shouldn't be 
troubled by what has been troubling me, namely that he 
had no way to get this before the State court.  They are 
entitled to close -- close the gates?

 MS. BURNETT:  Yes, Your Honor.  And as a 
collateral review; that's where they are closing the 
gate, not on direct review.

 If there are no further questions, I simply 

ask to affirm.

General left off.  In McNeal and Claudy, this Court did 
hold that, in certain instances, a State habeas court 
must hold a hearing if there are facts in dispute and 
they are not willing to assume them.  I agree that a 
State doesn't have to have a proceeding at all, but if 
it has one, it has to be fair.

 I know that my time is short.  I'd like to 

go through some of the questions you've asked.

 The State did deny us additional time, 

expert assistance discovery, and a hearing in this case. 
The Federal court specifically found that we were 
diligent.  That's at 84a.  And in Michael Williams, this 
court said that the finding of diligence also 
constituted a finding of cause for purposes of cause and 
prejudice, which makes sense because you've got a 
prisoner who has done the most they can and yet hasn't 
been able to fully develop the record.  There was no 
external impediment.  As you'll recall, in Michael 
Williams, the information was there; it was just very 
hard to find.

 Finally, we presented very substantial new 

evidence on the Federal level here.  It's simply not 
true that there is no new evidence.  The new evidence 
included evidence undermining the sole aggravating 
factor, both the live testimony of Joanne Nicholson,

which allowed the court actually to determine whether 
she would have been a credible person to undermine the 
testimony.  The State had held on the papers she wasn't 
credible, which the State can't do on the papers.

 Secondly, the evidence said he was 

physically abused as a child.  He was beaten with 
electrical cords, with planks, with a belt, leaving the 
scars on his body that he bears today.  He saw his 
father knock his mother's teeth out for trying to 
protect him.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the test for 

determining whether the addition of new evidence is 
sufficient to make it a new claim?

 MR. BRESS:  Your Honor, I think the test 
really ought to be whether an objectively reasonable 
jurist could find it important in the overall mix of 
information.  And it just strikes me that, if you're the 
judge in that kind of a case, what you're going to go 
through is -- if I accept that the State court was right 
with the evidence that it had and I sort of put myself 
in that frame, would I, nonetheless, if I were that 
State court, have found this evidence important when I'm 
making this decision?

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  It's a materiality 

standard, really.

MR. BRESS:  Exactly, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, it's a new claim 
if it is one on which you would have prevailed, but it's 
the same claim if the result would be the same.

 MR. BRESS:  I don't -- I don't think it 

necessarily has to be that way, Your Honor.  I think you 
can have a case where the evidence that was before them 
was absolutely nil; now they're offering a good bit of 
evidence that you would at least want to weigh as an 
objective jurist, even though you decide against them. 
I think that's possible.

 I think the reason you've got to adopt this 
position, however, is that there is no DNA -- I mean, no 
innocence exception that the General has put forward. 
If the General is right, it isn't a new claim just 
because you now have DNA evidence that proves you're 
innocent.  You made that claim of innocence earlier in 
the proceeding, in your earlier ineffective assistance 
of counsel claim.  What you have new now is you've got 
the DNA evidence.  In her view, it's the same claim.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you know, it does 
read -- 2254(e) -- it does read, "a factual predicate 
that could not have been previously discovered through 
the exercise of due diligence."  That sounds like 
exactly what you're describing, the discovery of DNA

evidence you didn't know about.

 MR. BRESS:  And I agree completely, Your 

Honor, that (e) says you can hear it, but the Attorney 
General says you can't because under (d), she'd say, 
you'd already be foreclose because the State court has 
already adjudicated your claim on the merits --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think she said --
MR. BRESS:  -- and these new facts don't 

count.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- she answered -- the 
answer that I wrote is the same thing that you could 
have on the Brady claim you could also have for 
ineffective assistance of counsel.  It's a wholly new 
matter.  I thought that's what she said.

 MR. BRESS:  Your Honor, I think she said 

that what you would have to look for, I think, is 
whether "wholly new matter" means "new evidence."  If 
she says it's new evidence, such as new DNA evidence, we 
agree completely.  That's not what she said previously 
in this case.  Previously, she had said that new 
evidence in that sense, like DNA evidence, can't make 
that claim a new claim and, therefore, you're foreclosed 
under 2254(d), so long as the State court's opinion is 
intrinsically reasonable based on its inadequate record.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Bress, I want to

apologize to you for accusing you of not printing

 MR. BRESS:  Well, thank you, Your Honor.  I 

thought --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm grateful for your not 

throwing it in my teeth.
 (Laughter.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
