[10:08 a.m.]


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now on number 01-521, The Republican Party of Minnesota,


et al., versus Verna Kelly.  Mr. Bopp.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,


ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER


MR. BOPP:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:  Like most states, Minnesota selects its judges


through periodic popular elections.  And when candidates'


speech is severely restricted, the people are denied


access to the information they need to make an informed


choice.  While state court judges are different from other


elected officials, Minnesota's Announce Clause, as now


interpreted by its supreme court, goes too far resulting


in elections without campaigns.


QUESTION:  Could we find out from you just what


the Announce Clause prohibits that isn't already


prohibited by the Pledges and Promises Clause, as it's


been interpreted?


MR. BOPP:  Yes, Justice O'Connor.  The Announce


Clause prohibits, according the decision of the Eighth


Circuit, any general -- allows general discussions of the


law, while it prohibits any implying of how a person would


rule -- a candidate would rule, on an issue or case before

 the Court.


QUESTION:  How does that differ, then, from the


Pledges or Promises Clause?


MR. BOPP:  The Pledges and Promises Clause


prohibits any pledge or promise that -- other than


faithful performance of duties in office.  The difference


between "announce," the plain language of the clause, and


"pledge or promise" -- "announce" is simply making known,


is one of the formulations of the Eighth Circuit, or


implying; while "pledging or promising" is making a


commitment on how you would rule in a future case.


QUESTION:  But you think the Announce Clause,


even as interpreted by the Eighth Circuit to be the same


as the ABA canon, goes beyond that?


MR. BOPP:  Well, Your Honor, there is one aspect


of the current 1990 ABA canon that has -- was not


discussed by the Ninth Circuit or by the ABA brief.  And


that --


QUESTION:  And where does that appear in your


brief?  Where is the ABA canon we're talking about?  Where


is it?  I want to look at it while you're talking about


it.


MR. BOPP:  I do not have a reference to the ABA


canon, Your Honor.  I apologize.  The ABA canon states


that a -- the 1990 ABA canon states that a candidate may

 not make statements to commit, or appears to commit in


deciding cases, controversies, or issues likely to come


before the Court.  While the ABA and the Eighth Circuit


seem to imply that the 1990 canon was similar, if not the


same, as the 1972 canon, they did not discuss the


difference between the words "announce" and "commit."


"Commit," if you look in the dictionary, says


"pledge."  And, thus, the 1990 canon appears to be more


narrow under plain --


QUESTION:  Well, the Eighth Circuit did say that


it was -- that Minnesota's provision is the same as the


ABA canon, right?


MR. BOPP:  It did, Your -- it did, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And the ABA canon prohibits


candidates, judicial candidates, from making statements


that commit or appear to commit a candidate.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And that looks very much like the


Pledge or Promise language.  I -- I don't know how we


should interpret this.


MR. BOPP:  Well, one of the problems, Your


Honor, is that the January 29th opinion of the Minnesota


Supreme Court interpreting the Announce Clause adopted the


Eighth Circuit opinion and its interpretations.


QUESTION:  Right.

 MR. BOPP:  Unfortunately, the Eighth Circuit had


conflicting statements about the scope of the


interpretation that it was announcing.


QUESTION:  Well, you were -- you appear to be


arguing, in your brief at least, that the Announce Clause


is unconstitutionally vague.


MR. BOPP:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Is that your argument you're making?


MR. BOPP:  Yes, we are.


QUESTION:  But did you make that argument below?


MR. BOPP:  Yes, we did, as to the interpretation


proffered in the district court, adding the words "likely


to come before the Court."  But where we are now, Your


Honor, is that the Eighth Circuit sua sponte added other


glosses to this canon, even though it was not advocated by


any of the parties.


QUESTION:  You didn't include a vagueness


challenge in your petition for certiorari, did you?


MR. BOPP:  Yes, we did.


QUESTION:  Is it in the question on which we


granted cert, do you think?


MR. BOPP:  No, but it is encompassed within the


violation of the First Amendment that we allege.


QUESTION:  But I wouldn't have thought vagueness


was a First Amendment issue.

 MR. BOPP:  Well, in the context of First


Amendment protected speech, a -- something that chills


First Amendment speech, because of -- it is a vague rule,


and therefore does not provide a bright line necessary for


the exercise of that speech, that it constitutes a First


Amendment violation.


QUESTION:  One of the statements of the Eighth


Circuit -- and I don't have the citation to the brief; I


have the citation to the Federal Third -- 247 F.3d 881. 


It says that the Announce Clause applies only to


discussion of a candidate's predisposition on issues


likely to come before the candidate if elected to office.


MR. BOPP:  That is one of the three


constructions.


QUESTION:  If we could -- would you agree that


that's perhaps the narrowest of the three constructions? 


I want to find what might be the most likely statement to


survive review and then have you discuss that, because I


take it that you would not be  -- you would not agree that


even that is constitutional.


MR. BOPP:  It is not the narrowest, Your Honor,


because it uses the word "issue."  There are other


formulations --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. BOPP:  -- in the Eighth Circuit case where

 they use the word "decide a case," such as on page 45a of


the petition -- the petition appendix.  It prevents


candidates from, quote, "implying how they would decide


cases," end of quote.  And they also, on page 52a of the


appendix to the petition, say that, quote -- that the


canon, quote, "applies only to discussions of a


candidate's predisposition on issues," as you've quoted,


and then finally concludes on page 53 with the statement


that it prohibits candidates, quote, "only from publicly


making known how they would decide issues."  So we have


conflicting interpretations of --


QUESTION:  Well, let's take the -- let's take


the last one.  I take it, if that were the authoritative


narrowing constructing that were before us, you would


disagree with its constitutionality.


MR. BOPP:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Would you agree that that would be a


constitutional standard if it were part of a code of


judicial ethics that applied to the judge after the judge


was on the bench?


MR. BOPP:  No, and -- but I believe that this


canon does apply to judges once they are elected and on


the bench.


QUESTION:  Well, are judges, after they are on


the bench, subject to, all of the same rights that they

 have before they go on the bench, insofar as making public


comments?


MR. BOPP:  No, they may be limited in a number


of different ways, Your Honor, that are necessary to


advance compelling interests.


QUESTION:  Well, why is it that, if an election


is in July, the State can, under your view, not prohibit


statements in June before he's elected, but they can


prohibit the statements in August, after he's elected?


MR. BOPP:  Well, Your Honor, the First Amendment


applies -- has its most urgent application in campaigns


for election, and it is -- and while both judges and


judicial candidates may be limited in their speech, it has


never been held that simply announcing your views on a


disputed legal or political issue constitutes an


indication of partiality such that would justify, for


instance, recusal or disqualification.


QUESTION:  But I thought you said it would be


okay.  Then maybe I didn't understand your answer.  I


thought you said that the kind of limitation that Justice


Kennedy referred to would be all right for sitting judges,


that you could prohibit sitting judges from letting their


views be known on any controversial issues.


MR. BOPP:  Well, then I misspoke, if that was


your understanding.

 QUESTION:  Like the incorporation doctrine or


substantive due process and so forth --


MR. BOPP:  Canon 4 --


QUESTION:  -- you think you could prohibit


judges from discussing those matters.


MR. BOPP:  No.  Canon 4 -- and in fact, Canon


4(b) of the Minnesota canons encourages judges to propose


changes in the substantive and procedural law, even


individually.


QUESTION:  Sitting judges -- sitting judges run


for election.  So whatever rights the contender would have


in an election, I assume that the sitting judge who was


running for reelection would have those same rights, in


your view.


MR. BOPP:  We believe that they should.


QUESTION:  Because the sitting judge could not


be restricted, could he or she, in a way?


MR. BOPP:  Well, sitting judges are restricted,


for instance, from commenting on pending cases that are


pending before them, quite properly.  But here we are


talking about stating general views about the law.


QUESTION:  So sitting --


QUESTION:  You wouldn't object to candidates


being prohibited from commenting about particular cases


either, would you?

 MR. BOPP:  No, I would not.


QUESTION:  I didn't take your objection to be


that you say, you know, that there's a case pending in the


courts, if I were appointed, I'll tell you how I would


decide that case.  You --


MR. BOPP:  We --


QUESTION:  -- wouldn't permit that, would you?


MR. BOPP:  We believe that that can properly 


be --


QUESTION:  I thought you gave examples, or your


-- one of the briefs gave examples of commenting on


specific decisions that had been rendered by the Minnesota


Supreme Court, and you said that restraint on that comment


was impermissible.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Am I not right?


MR. BOPP:  Yes.  That is our position.


QUESTION:  So you're making --


QUESTION:  That was a past case.  That was a


distinction you're making between past cases and pending


cases in the court that are likely to come before you if


you're elected.


MR. BOPP:  Yes, I -- the First Amendment


protects discussion of past cases.  However, the Eighth


Circuit opinion only allows discussion of past cases while

 the enforcement authorities, specifically the Office of


Lawyers Professional Responsibility, had previously said


that you could criticize those opinions.


QUESTION:  Well, supposing that -- supposing


that Minnesota -- the Minnesota Supreme Court had


announced that its Fourth Amendment was more protective


than the federal Fourth Amendment and a candidate running


for that court saw that several cases, the evidence had


been suppressed in Minnesota courts, the defendant was


acquitted, so he said, "I think we should go back to the


idea that our Fourth Amendment is the same as the federal


Fourth Amendment."  Would that be permitted under this


rule?


MR. BOPP:  Under the Announce Clause?


QUESTION:  Under the Announce Clause.


MR. BOPP:  Not if it's considered implying how


you would rule in a future case.


QUESTION:  But do we know that -- do we -- is


there any mechanism for getting a clarification?  And the


big problem in this case is this is a frontal attack, and


so we have no specific examples.  And you can say, "I


think this would fit, and I think that wouldn't fit."  Is


there any mechanism in Minnesota for seeking


clarification?  For example, whether the Minnesota Supreme


Court's current rule is, indeed, the ABA's 1990 rule?

 MR. BOPP:  You can seek a private advisory


opinion that is not binding on either the office or the


board.  And petitioner Wersal sought such an opinion after


suit was filed regarding other matters, and they declined


to provide that advice.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bopp, I would assume your answer


would be that if it's too fuzzy for us to understand what


it means in order to rule upon its constitutionality, it's


also too fuzzy for a judicial candidate to know what it


means in order to conform his conduct to it and,


therefore, unconstitutional.


MR. BOPP:  Yes, sir, Your Honor, not only to


candidates, but this canon binds the family members, the


supporters of the candidate.  If they say anything that is


viewed to violate this construction -- this new


construction of this rule, then the candidate, him or


herself, is subject to discipline or removal from office.


QUESTION:  Well, I still want to make clear your


position.  Your position is -- is that the judge can,


after the judge's election, be disciplined, sanctioned for


certain remarks that he could not be sanctioned for before


the election.  Is that correct?


MR. BOPP:  No, Your Honor, and if I gave you


that impression, I apologize. 


QUESTION:  In other words, the rule --

QUESTION:  -- post and pre-election, the 


rights --


MR. BOPP:  The rule --


QUESTION:  -- to speak are the same.


MR. BOPP:  The rule is the same.  But I think


the point I was making was that once a judge assumes


office, there are restrictions on, for instance, his


ability to discuss a pending case that is not imposed upon


a lawyer that is not involved in the case in any way.


QUESTION:  Well, do you claim --


MR. BOPP:  So then --


QUESTION:  All right.  Then your position is


that there is a difference as it applies to pending cases


as to which a sitting judge has to -- to which a sitting


judge has been assigned.


MR. BOPP:  Yes, there are specific ethical 


--

QUESTION:  And --


MR. BOPP:  -- canons that apply in that.


QUESTION:  And that's all.


MR. BOPP:  And that's appropriate --


QUESTION:  Now --


MR. BOPP:  -- an appropriate limit.


QUESTION:  -- are there limits on what the


candidate can say?

 MR. BOPP:  Yes.  I --


QUESTION:  And those are what?


MR. BOPP:  It's in the realm of Pledges and


Promises.  It would apply to candidates whether they're


sitting judges or not, and that is that a candidate for


judicial office shall not pledge or promise certain


results in deciding a particular case or issue in a case


without regard to the law or facts of the case.


QUESTION:  Suppose he said, "There are a lot of


criminal cases pending," and, to take the Chief Justice's


hypothetical, "we've gone too far in interpreting the


Fourth Amendment, and I'm going to be more strict."  In


your view --


MR. BOPP:  I think that's a --


QUESTION:  -- that could be prohibited.


MR. BOPP:  No, that is allowed, Your Honor,


because he's not promising certain results in a particular


case.  That is, again --


QUESTION:  He says, "I promise when these cases


come before me, this is what I'll do."


MR. BOPP:  Then that is a pledge or promise of


an outcome.


QUESTION:  And in your view, that can be


prohibited.


MR. BOPP:  Yes, because there is a --

 QUESTION:  Well, I'm surprised you take that


view.


MR. BOPP:  Well, Your Honor, there is a public


perception of the impartiality of the judiciary that I


think properly can be taken into account.


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. BOPP:  And I think this rule announces a


rule that is consistent with the judge's obligation to


decide cases in accordance with his or her role.


QUESTION:  Well, that's an extremely fine line


you're drawing, it seems to me, because I think a moment


ago, in response to my question, you said that a candidate


would be prohibited, and wrongly prohibited, under your


view -- on your view of it and from saying that Minnesota


should adopt the federal Fourth Amendment standard rather


than the more liberal Fourth Amendment standard that the


Supreme Court of Minnesota hypothetically had it.  You say


that a candidate ought to be allowed to do that, but he


isn't under the Minnesota rule?


MR. BOPP:  He is not, under the -- well, to the


extent that we know what the Announce Clause means --


QUESTION:  Yeah.


MR. BOPP:  -- with this conflicting formulations


under the Eighth Circuit opinion, talking about cases or


issues -- talking about, implying, or making known -- to

 the extent that we know the rule, it would appear that


such a statement would be prohibited --


QUESTION:  And you --


MR. BOPP:  -- because it would imply what he


would rule in the future.


QUESTION:  And you say that the First Amendment


prohibits that?


MR. BOPP:  No, I'd say the First Amendment


protects talking about prior decisions.


QUESTION:  What about --


MR. BOPP:  And one of the problems is we're


talking about the rule -- the Minnesota rule versus --


QUESTION:  Yeah.


MR. BOPP:  -- other proposed rules.


QUESTION:  But if --


QUESTION:  What about comment on a -- by a


candidate who is not yet a judge on a case which is then


pending before the court?  In your view, can the State


prohibit the candidate from saying, "I've been reading


about this case.  I know what the evidence is, and I


believe so and so should be convicted, and I think the


sentence ought to be the following."  Could the State,


consistently with the First Amendment, prohibit that kind


of a comment?


MR. BOPP:  Well, there would seem to be, under

 Gentile, more leeway for a lawyer not in a pending case to

QUESTION:  What's the answer to my question?


MR. BOPP:  I think -- I think it could not be


prohibited.


QUESTION:  In the question that the Chief


Justice asked, suppose the judge said, "I pledge and


promise that if you elect me, I will vote in every Fourth


Amendment case to restore the law to what it was."  That's


a pledge and a promise, which I thought your argument


started out saying you accept that the pledge or promise


is a valid restriction --


MR. BOPP:  I do, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- that you can't go on that to the


Announce.  So suppose that instead of -- the Chief Justice


suggested, "I think it would be a good idea if the court


went back there" -- but if he said, "I pledge and promise


that I will vote that way" --


MR. BOPP:  That is a classic pledge and promise


that I think can be appropriated prohibited under the


First Amendment.


QUESTION:  As to issues and not as to particular


cases.


MR. BOPP:  As both to issues and cases.


QUESTION:  So that you -- you can't disable

 yourself from being --


MR. BOPP:  Open minded.


QUESTION:  -- persuaded by counsel that the


views you've held your whole life over the incorporation


doctrine, turn out to be wrong.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.  And while judges certainly have


views, and they announce these views in numerous different


ways, if they are binding themselves not to have an open


mind and to decide a case in advance, then that is a


violation of the oath, and that type of pledge or promise


should be and can be prohibited under the First Amendment.


QUESTION:  Is this different from that?  That


is, I read through the Minnesota Bar Association's brief,


the ABA's brief, and portions of the Brennen brief.  All


right?  They all suggested to me that this ethical rule,


like all ethical rules, is vague, interpreted by


interpretive opinions, of which there are many.  I mean,


there are two pages of them in these briefs.


Now, as I understood it, it comes down to an


effort to do just what I did in my own Senate confirmation


hearing, to say, "I will try to reveal my judicial


philosophy.  I will try to stay away from anything that is


going to commit myself or appear to commit myself about


how to decide a future case."  All right.


MR. BOPP:  And I agree.

 QUESTION:  Now, if that's what they're trying to


do -- do you agree that is what this is trying to do? 


And, second, if that is what they're trying to do, why is


that unconstitutional?


MR. BOPP:  If it amounts to a pledge or a


promise --


QUESTION:  No, it doesn't.  I used the words


that -- of the ABA brief.  I've used the words -- I'm


referring to the briefs to call those arguments to your


mind.


What they say this comes down to is you cannot


commit yourself or appear to commit yourself as to how you


will decide a particular case or issue if it arises.  But


you can, and there are two pages of this in the Minnesota


Bar brief.  I'm just trying to call that to your mind --


MR. BOPP:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  -- of all the things you can discuss:


judicial philosophy, character, this and that.  There were


two pages of them, and they're all quotes -- in quotes. 


All right.  So, one, am I correct in my interpretation? 


MR. BOPP:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Two, if I am, why does the


Constitution forbid it?


MR. BOPP:  If the word "commit" means "pledge,"


then I think you're correct in --

 QUESTION:  No, I told you what it means. 


"Commit" means "commit."  We can't go more than the words


"commit" or "appear to commit," other than to illustrate


them by example.  And the Bar Association brief contains


18 examples that have been given.  They're all in quotes. 


They come from an authoritative source.  So that's where I


am in what this means.  Am I right?  And if I am right,


what's wrong with it?


MR. BOPP:  Well, Your Honor, what is wrong with


it --


opinion?


QUESTION:  But first, am I right, in your


MR. BOPP:  you're not right.  And what is wrong


with it is that the ABA suggested that "commit" means the


same thing as "announce."  And what I -- my course of my


argument is that "commit" means "pledge," and that, to


that extent, the ABA canon is different than the current


Announce Clause.  In fact, it's --


QUESTION:  All right, so if you're saying the


word is "announce," and all these briefs and the bar


association are wrong when they say that means commit or


appear to commit, on that view, what should I do with this


case?


MR. BOPP:  You should strike down the Announce


Clause, because it is impossible -- hopelessly impossible

 to know what is included within the rule and what is


outside the rule.  That, and not only did the Eighth


Circuit use different formulations of the rule that mean


different things, in terms of its scope and application,


but it also had exceptions to the rule, discussion -- a


general discussion of case law or a candidate's judicial


philosophy, but with the proviso that if you imply how you


will rule in a particular case, then you have violated the


rule.


QUESTION:  And on an issue on a particular case.


MR. BOPP:  An issue, including --


QUESTION:  Can I just follow that up for one


second?  All right, now take the other assumption.  Let's


assume that it does mean, as the ABA says, "appear" or


"appear to commit."  On that view of it -- and assume that


I'm right.  I know you think I'm wrong on that.  Assuming


that I'm right --


MR. BOPP:  With all due respect.


QUESTION:  -- then is it constitutional, in your


opinion?


language.


MR. BOPP:  No, because of the "appear to commit"


QUESTION:  So you think the ABA can and is,


itself, unconstitutional.


MR. BOPP:  As I interpret it, yes, because the

 "appear to commit" takes us back away from a bright line


of a pledge or a promise into the realm of implying what


you are saying.  And there --


QUESTION:  What is the ABA's position on


judicial elections?


MR. BOPP:  They are not in favor of judicial --


QUESTION:  I didn't think they were.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  But you're submitting this case to us


on the proposition that, under the First Amendment, a


judicial candidate can be subjected to restraints on


speech that other -- that are inapplicable to other


candidates.


MR. BOPP:  I believe that they can, Your Honor,


because judges have a dual role.  One role is to make law,


and particularly state court judges making common law, but


they also have a duty to decide cases impartially.  So


while they are running for office, in order to respect


judicial impartiality, they should not be pledging to


violate the oath.  That is promising now how to decide a


case in the future when it comes before --


QUESTION:  Well, how does this play out with


sitting judges who write opinions saying, "In my view, for


example, I think the death penalty is unconstitutional"? 


There it is for everybody to see.  And presumably in a

 state like Minnesota, that judge will come up for election


again or in another state for retention election.  You


don't think it's -- can that be prohibited --


MR. BOPP:  No.


QUESTION:  -- somehow?


MR. BOPP:  No.  No, it may not.


QUESTION:  And that judge has expressed a view


that presumably the judge will follow in a future case.


MR. BOPP:  But that is -- but that is different


from declaring or announcing that you have a closed mind


as to any future --


QUESTION:  No.  I don't know, if it's thoroughly


expressed.  Now, if the next case comes along involving


that very issue, can the judge be changed for bias?


MR. BOPP:  No.  No, you may not be recused, and


due process is not violated.


QUESTION:  But what if a candidate says not, "I


pledge that in every case I will say vote against the


death penalty," but, "I have real doubts about the death


penalty jurisprudence."  I mean, I don't think Minnesota


has a death penalty, but --


MR. BOPP:  No, it doesn't.


QUESTION:  -- let's assume it does.  "And I


think it probably should change."  Is that permissible


under this rule?  And if the rule says it's not

Amendment?

or my rule?


QUESTION:  Under the Minnesota rule.


MR. BOPP:  It -- well, it's very difficult to


know, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Okay, well, under your rule.


MR. BOPP:  Under our rule, it would be allowed. 


And, in fact, judges are encouraged to do -- make


proposals just like that under these canons.


QUESTION:  Now I don't understand what you say


the Minnesota rule is.  I would have thought your answer


would be, "That's probably okay under the Minnesota


rules," because he only says probably -- "I think it's


probably, you know, unconstitutional."


MR. BOPP:  Under the Minnesota rule if you


simply imply how you might rule --


QUESTION:  Well, it doesn't.  It says, "I have


doubts about it," according to the Chief Justice, "I have


doubts about it."  I think that doesn't necessarily imply


-- but I thought --


MR. BOPP:  Well, it's --


QUESTION:  I thought --


MR. BOPP:  It's hard to know.

 QUESTION:  But I thought that your position with


regard to judicial opinions is -- is that it is perfectly


okay for a sitting judge to make known to the public his


view on something like the death penalty when he does it


in an opinion and, therefore, that can be out there.


MR. BOPP:  Yes, it is --


QUESTION:  Subject to criticism, indeed.


MR. BOPP:  Yes --


QUESTION:  But somebody who's running against


him in an election cannot let be known what his view is on


the death penalty.


MR. BOPP:  It is perfectly appropriate for a


judge to do that in an opinion or in speeches or a law


review article.


QUESTION:  In speeches?  You mean the judge


could go out and -- a sitting judge can go out and make a


speech and say, "In the next death penalty case to come


before me, I'm going to vacate.  I'm going to vote to


vacate the death penalty.  I don't care what the argument


is."


MR. BOPP:  Then not that statement.  If he made


that statement, he'd be subject to recusal and a proper


application of --


QUESTION:  Okay, well --


MR. BOPP:  -- the pledge rule.

 QUESTION:  Okay.  Well, then what he can say in


speeches certainly is less than what he can say in a


judicial opinion in which he says, "I vote to vacate the


death penalty because I believe it's unconstitutional."  I


mean, there's some line between them.


MR. BOPP:  Yes, I would think he would.  He


does, Your Honor.  And may I reserve the balance of my


time?


from you.


QUESTION:  Very well.  Mr. Gilbert, we'll hear


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. GILBERT


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. GILBERT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:  I would like to take the opportunity to


try to clarify some of the questions and answers that have


been provided as to what the construed rule in Minnesota


means.  And I refer the Court to page 53a, of the cert


petition appendix, where the Eighth Circuit stated the


definitive narrow construction of this rule which says


that the rule only prohibits candidates from --


QUESTION:  Whereabouts on the page?


MR. GILBERT:  The beginning of the second


paragraph, Your Honor.  It only restricts judicial


candidates from publicly making known how they would


decide issues likely to come before them as judges.  That

 is the narrow construction of this Eighth Circuit opinion. 


That is the construction that's being applied by the two


boards that I represent, and that is the construction that


has been incorporated in an authoritative order by the


Minnesota Supreme Court.


QUESTION:  What about the example I posed to


your opponent?  Someone says, "I think the Minnesota


Supreme Court's ruling on the Fourth Amendment, the state


Fourth Amendment being broader, is wrong, and I -- if you


will elect me as a judge, I would try to change that


around."


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, this is where the


record is very clear as to what Mr. Wersal has done.  And


in response to your question, the candidate could


criticize a prior decision of a judge, but could not say


as to a future case how that candidate would decide the


case.  And that's precisely --


QUESTION:  So let me put that to the test.  If I


say, "I think the decision of the Supreme Court of


Minnesota two years ago saying that the Fourth Amendment 


-- state Fourth Amendment protected more than the federal


Fourth Amendment is wrong," he could do that, but he


couldn't say, "If you elect me to the Supreme Court, I


would carry out my view."


MR. GILBERT:  Well, that would be a future case.

 And there's other considerations --


QUESTION:  Well, he told me he couldn't even


say, "I think that opinion is wrong.  And that is not my


position concerning the meaning of the Fourth 


Amendment" --


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  -- "in Minnesota."


MR. GILBERT:  That's not correct, Your Honor. 


I 

refer you to the record in this case and what Mr. Wersal


has said in his literature.  If you look at the first


volume of the Joint Appendix, pages 34 to 38, as well as


pages 86 to 91, they contain the actual statements that


Mr. Wersal made as part of his campaign.


QUESTION:  What pages?


MR. GILBERT:  30 -- let's see -- 34 to 38, and


86 to 91.  And look what he said.  First of all, he talked


about his judicial philosophy.  He has said that he can't


talk about his judicial philosophy.  He did.  He said,


"I'm a strict constructionist," and he criticized the


Minnesota Supreme Court for being a judicial activist. 


But more --


QUESTION:  What does that mean?  I mean, that's


so fuzzy, that doesn't mean --


MR. GILBERT:  Well, but --


QUESTION:  -- that doesn't mean anything.  It

 doesn't say whether you're going adopt the incorporation


doctrine, whether you believe in substantive due process. 


It is totally imprecise.  It's just nothing but fluff.


MR. GILBERT:  And candidates can say that.  And


that's the point.


QUESTION:  Can they say anything more than


fluff?


meaning?


QUESTION:  Can they say anything that has any


MR. GILBERT:  Absolutely.  And what they can do


-- look at what Mr. Wersal --


QUESTION:  But what about my example?


MR. GILBERT:  Your example, Your Honor, the


candidate can, as Mr. Wersal did, criticize a prior


decision of the Court.  And that's very clear from what


has happened in the Wersal case.  What the candidate


cannot do is say that, "If I'm elected, I'm going to


overturn that decision."


QUESTION:  Does that dichotomy make any sense at


all?


MR. GILBERT:  Well, it does in the sense, Your


Honor, that there's different dynamics involved once a


judge is elected and has to overturn a decision that's


already precedent in the State of Minnesota.


QUESTION:  So a candidate says, "This is the

 worst decision that's come down since Dred Scott, it's a


plague on our people, it's an insult to the system, but


I'm not telling you how I'll vote."


(Laughter.)


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, that's the point.


QUESTION:  It's more than that.  You assert that


that does not, within the language that the Supreme Court


has adopted, it does not imply how he will vote on that


issue at a future date.  He says, "It's the worst case


we've ever done."  That doesn't imply how he's going to


vote on it?


MR. GILBERT:  Well, that might well imply


whether he's going to overturn it.  But what the candidate


can say and what Mr. Wersal said -- if you look at the


criticism that he leveled at these decisions of the


Minnesota Supreme Court, he said just as you indicated,


Justice, that, "These decisions are" --


QUESTION:  What are you reading?  Where are you


reading from?


MR. GILBERT:  If you look at pages -- page 36,


for example, of the -- this is of the Joint Appendix -- he


says, on abortion, "The Court ordered the State must use


welfare funds to pay for abortion despite state law to the


contrary.  The dissenting judge remarked," et cetera. 


This is under the topic of "Examples of Judicial

 Activism."  But then he goes into greater detail on page


38.


QUESTION:  But is the statement at page 36 that


you read -- is that proscribable under the State's rule?


MR. GILBERT:  No.  And that's the point.  What


has happened here, Your Honor, is that there was a


complaint filed against Mr. Wersal for all of this


campaign material.  And the then-director of the Lawyers


Board, Marcia Johnson, in an opinion, on pages 20 and 21


of this appendix, said that the statements made by Mr.


Wersal are not proscribable.  And that's even before the


rule is narrowed.


And if you look at page 21, the executive


director said specifically that Mr. Wersal can criticize


prior decisions of the Court.  And that's consistent with


what the Board on Judicial Standards did in --


QUESTION:  What do you say --


QUESTION:  May he also, at the same time as they


criticized the decision, say, "I do not believe in stare


decisis"?


is --


MR. GILBERT:  Yes.  He can't, because that 


QUESTION:  Well, then isn't he saying how he's


going to rule on the case then?


MR. GILBERT:  Well, Your Honor -- it might be,

 Your Honor.  People might be able to imply from it, but


it's still -- the distinction is --


QUESTION:  Might be able to imply that I don't


believe in stare decisis and I think this case is wrong.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Pretty clear, I think.


MR. GILBERT:  No, and I understand what you're


saying, Your Honor.  The distinction that's made, if you


look at all the cases that have dealt with this issue, is


a distinction between past cases on one hand and then


pending and future cases on another.


QUESTION:  As long as you're silent on your


views on stare decisis, that's a fine distinction.  But if


you do reveal your views on stare decisis, that


distinction is meaningless.


MR. GILBERT:  Perhaps.  There could be other


issues that come up in terms of a case that would be a


vehicle to overturn particular decisions -- standing,


things of that kind.


QUESTION:  So now you're saying there's a


distinction between issues and cases.  And I'm saying


you're categorically stating your view about a particular


issue, as the Chief Justice's example states, and you also


categorically state, "I think stare decisis has no place


in constitutional adjudication."  Can he do that?

 MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, again, the -- no,


under the State's interpretation of the rule.  And I


understand your point.  It is a fine distinction.  But


what the State is trying to do is protect the integrity of


the judiciary at that point.  And to the extent --


QUESTION:  This protects its integrity?


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, we think so.  And the


reason for that is that --


QUESTION:  I mean, it's just a game.  It's just


a dance, you know --


MR. GILBERT:  Well, this is --


QUESTION:  -- I don't say anything about stare


decisis and it's okay.  If I say something about stare


decisis, it's not okay?


MR. GILBERT:  Well, again, Your Honor, I


understand the hypothetical.  This is a hypothetical that


is kind of on the fringe.  I would agree with you.  But at


the same time, most of the situations are going to be


clear, are going to be --


QUESTION:  Well, it is such a problem to know


exactly what the provision covers now.  It isn't clear to


me.  And what we end up with at the end of the day is a


system where an incumbent judge can express views in


written opinions, and perhaps otherwise, as well, and yet


a candidate for that office is somehow restricted from

 discussing the very same thing in the election campaign. 


That's kind of an odd system, designed to what?  Maintain


incumbent judges, or what?


MR. GILBERT:  No, it's not, Your Honor.  In


fact, that is not correct in terms of the effect of that


situation.  Again, if you look at page 20 of the Joint


Appendix, what the executive director of the Lawyers Board


has said is that an incumbent judge can criticize the


prior decision of that sitting judge.  So that the


challenger actually has greater opportunity than an


incumbent judge, because an incumbent judge has a record


of decisions.


QUESTION:  Do you -- you misspoke, I think.  You


meant the challenger --


QUESTION:  You did --


MR. GILBERT:  The challenger.  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  -- the challenger, who is not a


judge, can criticize the specific decision of the judge


who wrote it.


MR. GILBERT:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So they're equally free at the least


to discuss the specific past cases.


MR. GILBERT:  At the least.  And I would submit


that the challenger is in a better situation because of


the --

 QUESTION:  All right.  Can I ask you this


question --


MR. GILBERT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- because I understand that -- I


have two questions, really.  One is the line that's being


-- that you're trying to draw, everyone would concede is a


very difficult one to draw, but it is the line that I


tried to draw.


MR. GILBERT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Now, what would happen if, instead of


my being in the Senate, I had been in an election


campaign, and I was trying to draw this very line between


commitments to future cases, specific ones, and general


judicial philosophy.  And suppose my opponent, after,


said, "Breyer made a mistake.  He didn't get it right,"


but I was in good faith.  What could happen, or would


likely happen, to me under this rule?


MR. GILBERT:  As a -- I'm sorry, as a sitting


judge, Your Honor?


QUESTION:  Well, I then -- suppose I won.  Fine. 


I've won the election.  My opponent -- what I'm trying to


understand is what are the consequences?  It is, after


all, an ethical rule, and ethical rules are often blurry.


MR. GILBERT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And I want to know what would likely

 happen to a person who makes a mistake in drawing this


very fine line, assuming that it's in good faith.


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, the Board on Judicial


Standards or the Lawyers Board would have jurisdiction


with respect to a violation which sounds like a technical


violation, as you describe it, and could impose some


discipline, but I would suspect that discipline would be


very minute, if at all --


QUESTION:  Could a state --


MR. GILBERT:  -- under those circumstances.


QUESTION:  -- make a violation of the provisions


you described a criminal offense?


MR. GILBERT:  No, Your Honor.  These are not


criminal statues.


QUESTION:  But could a state do it under the


First Amendment?  Is there any authority you have for the


proposition, that can -- a state can impose a civil


sanction, but not a criminal sanction?


MR. GILBERT:  I'm not aware of any authority


that would allow a criminal sanction for such a thing.


QUESTION:  Can I ask you one other question?


QUESTION:  That's not my question.  Is there any


authority that a state, under the First Amendment, is free


to impose a civil sanction but not a criminal sanction on


particular speech?

 MR. GILBERT:  I'm not aware of authority to that


effect either, no.


QUESTION:  This is a technical question, but the


sentence you started out reading from the Eighth Circuit's


opinion is not identical to the ABA canon.  And obviously


if this rule differs from the ABA canon and is stricter,


one could say there's a less restrictive alternative,


namely the ABA canon.  And so I'm quite concerned about


how to deal with that problem.  Do I assume that, in fact,


Minnesota does mean it's indistinguishable from ABA canon,


which is what the ABA says?  Or what your opponent says? 


How do I deal with that?


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, our position is, just


as the ABA indicated, that our rule is the functional


equivalent of a commitment clause.


QUESTION:  The Minnesota Supreme Court turned


down the ABA rule, the ABA rule -- we're talking --


they're both ABA rules.  Minnesota now has on its books


the 1972 rule.  The 1990 rule is the one that you said is


the functional equivalent of the current rule.  And yet


the Minnesota Supreme Court considered and turned down


that rule.  So that's one of the aspects of this case that


makes it very fuzzy.  The court that turned it down now


says, "We agree with the Eighth Circuit."  And you're


telling us that the Eighth Circuit has adopted,

 essentially, the ABA's current rule.


MR. GILBERT:  Yes, Your Honor, and that is the


case, and you are right.  Back in 1995, there was


discussion of adoption of the commit clause by the


Minnesota Supreme Court.  It did not occur at that time. 


There has been a lot that has evolved over the last seven


years, Your Honor, and the Minnesota Supreme Court has


made the decision in its January 29th, 2002, order that


this construction by the Eighth Circuit is the


construction that they are going to place on their clause.


QUESTION:  Whatever that is.


MR. GILBERT:  Well, this construction, Your


Honor, is, for all practical purposes, identical to the


commitment clause.  And --


QUESTION:  Mr. Gilbert, may I ask --


MR. GILBERT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- a question based on what you said


about stare decisis?  You say -- have said consistently


you can discuss your judicial philosophy.  Well, why


wouldn't one's position on stare decisis fall under


judicial philosophy?


MR. GILBERT:  I think it would, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So that -- so you're changing back


then, because you said a while ago that stare decisis --


if you said, "I think that decision about the Fourth

 Amendment was wrong, and I don't believe in stare


decisis," you said you couldn't put those two together.


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, you can put them


together.  I think the question was, could someone then


conclude from that what the ramifications would be if that


particular candidate came to the Supreme Court, for


example, on what the candidate would do with respect to


that decision -- whether the candidate would overturn or


not.


QUESTION:  And your answer was it would imply


how he's going to vote and, therefore, would not be --


MR. GILBERT:  Again --


QUESTION:  -- would not be acceptable, right?


MR. GILBERT:  Yes, Your Honor, with the


distinction being to protect the integrity of the


judiciary.


QUESTION:  Well, let me ask about that.  You


know, in evaluating whether a state has demonstrated the


kind of significant interest necessary to abridge speech,


it seems to me we have to look at the entirety of the


state law to see what interest it's pursuing.


I, frankly, am absolutely befuddled by the fact


that Minnesota wants its judges elected -- that's its


constitutional provision -- and then enacts statutory


provisions that are intended to prevent the electorate

 from knowing, even by implication, how these candidates


are going to behave when they get on the bench.  It seems


to me a total contradiction.  And, indeed, it looks to me


like a legislative attempt to simply repeal Minnesota's


constitutional provision providing for the election of


judges, which is a neat and easy way to get rid of it if


you can't do it by plebiscite.


Why does it make any sense to vote for a judge


in an election, a judge who is not able, even by


implication, to tell the electorate what kind of a judge


he would be?


MR. GILBERT:  Well, but, Your Honor, that's the


fallacy in that statement, is that a candidate can tell


the electorate what kind of candidate they are.  The only


thing that the candidate cannot say -- it's a very limited


restriction -- and that is, how I am going to decide a


future case.


QUESTION:  Not a particular -- well, no, not


just a future case, a future issue -- any, not a


particular case, but any issue --


MR. GILBERT:  And --


QUESTION:  -- how I will vote on the Fourth


Amendment situation, how I will vote on the incorporation


doctrine.  I can understand your saying, he shall not


commit himself, "I promise to vote this way."  No judge

 should do that.  He should be able to be persuaded that


he's been wrong.  But to say that my current view is that


the Fourth Amendment should be just like the federal


Fourth Amendment, and stare decisis in constitutional


matters is not a doctrine that I think is very strong --


it seems to me you ought to be able to say that.


MR. GILBERT:  And they can say that.  I think


the difference of opinion we have here is whether they can


go the extra step and just say, "And I would try to


overturn the decision if I'm elected."


QUESTION:  Well, if that --


MR. GILBERT:  I have to --


QUESTION:  -- if that indicates a


disqualification or a lack of temperament for the bench,


the voters can decide that.  The bar association and the


judges can come out and say, "We have a candidate running


who doesn't have the right judicial temperament," and the


voters decide.  That's the way elections work.


MR. GILBERT:  They can do that, but I submit to


you, what happens if that judge wins?  What happens if


that judge wins and the litigants come before that judge


who has prejudged that case?


QUESTION:  Well, I suppose the people have said


what kind of judges they want.


MR. GILBERT:  Oh, and it's all of a sudden

 majority opinion?


QUESTION:  Why is that any worse than litigants


who come before a judge who's already sitting and who has


said in a prior opinion that he thinks the Fourth


Amendment in Minnesota should be interpreted the same way


the federal Fourth Amendment is?  Why --


MR. GILBERT:  Because in --


QUESTION:  -- is that any different?


MR. GILBERT:  Because in a prior opinion, due


process was accorded, because the judge actually heard the


argument of the litigants, heard the facts and the


applicable law.


QUESTION:  You mean a judge can't have an


opinion without hearing from all sides and going in briefs


and so forth?


MR. GILBERT:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  Well, what if -- even if he gives a


speech, does he have to first have this sort of vetting?


MR. GILBERT:  Not at all, Your Honor.  The only


-- again, the limited restriction here is that the -- a


judge cannot -- I'm sorry -- a judicial candidate cannot


prejudge a future case, cannot say, "I think this statute


over here is unconstitutional," or, "I think, in consumer


fraud cases, that anybody who wins is entitled to punitive


damages."

 QUESTION:  So you don't trust the electorate in


Minnesota to decide whether a judge has a judicial


temperament.  You wish us to depart from the usual


philosophy --


MR. GILBERT:  Again --


QUESTION:  -- that we do not allow the State to


presume that the public is better off not having complete


information.


MR. GILBERT:  Well --


QUESTION:  Maybe we should know about this


judge's temperament.  And if he spouts off on all sorts of


issues, we say, this is not the kind of judge we want.


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, again, this is a


balance that's being struck.  There's competing interests


here.  There's the First Amendment interest that we're all


familiar with.  There's the due process interest of


individual litigants.  There's the compelling governmental


interests that the State has in ensuring the integrity of


the judiciary, both in terms of the actual integrity and


the perception of it.  And that's why this limited


restriction is appropriate.


QUESTION:  Maybe you shouldn't have judicial


elections if the last is a significant State interest.


MR. GILBERT:  Well, Your Honor, that's --


QUESTION:  To the degree that you're making it a

 significant State interest here.  See, I just question


whether it is a significant State interest, because you


have a constitution that says, "We're going to have


judicial elections."  Now, that may be a very bad idea,


but as long as that's in your constitution, I find it hard


to believe that it is a significant State interest of


Minnesota to prevent elections from being informed.


MR. GILBERT:  Well, again, Your Honor, we're


trying to weigh the different interests.  I am sure you


wouldn't suggest that the State doesn't have a compelling


interest in the integrity of the judiciary, and that is a


competing interest that is being weighed here, and that


results in the commitment clause that the ABA has adopted


and the parallel provision that has been construed


narrowly by the Eighth Circuit, which, again, only forbids


or prohibits a judge saying, "I'm going to decide this


particular issue this way in the future."


QUESTION:  So you're saying the public doesn't


know enough in order to determine whether a judge has the


requisite qualifications for office.


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, I'm not saying that


the public knows or doesn't know.  The concern is what


happens if that candidate is elected, and then you or any


other litigant comes before that candidate, who is now a


judge, and tries to litigate the issue that the judge has

QUESTION:  My goodness, we -- I think we have 


-- I will say present company excluded -- I know we have


had judges on this Court who have answered questions about


particular legal issues to the Senate confirmation


hearing.  Are you saying that those judges were


disqualified from sitting in cases in which that issue


would later come up?


MR. GILBERT:  No, Your Honor, I'm not.  And


actually, I'm surprised to hear that.


QUESTION:  Is it -- oh.  It's --


MR. GILBERT:  I am surprised to hear that, in


light of the testimony that is in our brief and other


briefs --


QUESTION:  You should go before the Senate 


--

(Laughter.)


MR. GILBERT:  But, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  I actually found that when they


approached a particular case about how you were going to


decide in the future, both the senators -- in my


experience, since it only concerns me -- would not press


the issue of how you would decide a particular case.

 QUESTION:  And that's why -- a particular case.


QUESTION:  I was -- my reference was to a


particular issue. 

A particular issue.


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, cases are made up of


issues.  And sometimes a case only has one issue.  Issues


are important in and of themselves.


QUESTION:  Mr. Gilbert, do you think we should


draw any distinction, or whether it would be reasonable


for us to draw any distinction, between the application of


the rule to the candidates themselves and the application


of the rule to all of these ancillary individuals around


them -- their associates, their families?  Let's assume


that we say that the rule passes muster with respect to


the candidate.  What's the justification for muzzling the


candidate's spouse?  I mean, I know, in fact, what --


MR. GILBERT:  Yeah.


QUESTION:  -- it is, because we figure, you


know, that's how you get the message out.  But do we have


a more difficult First Amendment hurdle?


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, I don't think so, not


at all.  I think it's really a misnomer to talk about


muzzling, which is what the petitioners have indicated.


QUESTION:  Let's say "limiting."


MR. GILBERT:  Well, it's not even that.  What


the rule does is ask the judicial candidate to encourage

 close family members not to effectively circumvent the


rule by announcing views that they might be aware of that


the judicial candidate would support.


QUESTION:  But if the family member says, "Well,


I'm going to tell anyway."


MR. GILBERT:  "I'm going to tell anyway" --


there's no penalty.


QUESTION:  But the --


MR. GILBERT:  There's no --


QUESTION:  But there could be.  Do I understand


that there would be an inquiry in that event as to whether


the candidate had, indeed, encouraged the family member to


be quiet?


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, the standard is


"knowingly permit."  So, in other words, some -- the


judicial candidate would actually have to be the actor


behind those actions.


QUESTION:  All right, but I want to know, in


practical terms, what happens.  The spouse makes a


statement -- any one of the statements that have been


mentioned here, except as suggesting prejudgment of a


case.  The candidate stays mute.  I presume that a


complaint would be filed against the candidate, and I


presume the candidate would have to answer to the


commission as to whether the candidate had, indeed,

 knowingly encouraged this.


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, I'd assume a complaint


would not be filed under those circumstances.


QUESTION:  Why not?  I mean --


MR. GILBERT:  Well, I don't --


QUESTION:  Are your opponents forgiving in your


state?


MR. GILBERT:  Pardon me?


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  I mean, are opponents just forgiving


of their opponents in your state?


MR. GILBERT:  Well, Your Honor, it's a very


difficult standard to satisfy, "knowingly permit."


QUESTION:  Well, maybe it's difficult to


satisfy.  I'm just trying to get a sense of what the


burden on the individuals involved is.


MR. GILBERT:  Well --


QUESTION:  And I assume that there could be a


complaint, simply based on the emphatic statement of the


spouse.  And my question is, does the candidate have to


show, in that event, that he did not knowingly encourage,


or does the State have to show -- or the prosecutor or


whoever it is -- that he knowingly did encourage.  What's


the drill?


MR. GILBERT:  Yes, of course, the burden's on

would have to show by clear and convincing evidence.

QUESTION:  But the candidate would have to

QUESTION:  Why not?


MR. GILBERT:  -- sometimes doesn't investigate


complaints where they don't have sufficient evidence to


think there's even a basis for the complaint.


QUESTION:  Well, would they have sufficient


evidence in the event that a spouse made an emphatic


statement saying, "His view is," or "Her view is"?


MR. GILBERT:  Yeah, it's conceivable, Your


Honor, but, again --


QUESTION:  Counsel, is that -- is that part of


the canon part of the question in this case?  I know it's


part of the canon.  I didn't understand that it was


presented to us in the petition.  What's your view?


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, it's kind of oblique. 


The focus is on Mr. Wersal's comments.  And then there are


other comments.  And I think one of the justices mentioned


a vagueness challenge.  To the extent there's any

these third parties and the phase "knowingly permit."  And


the issue --


QUESTION:  Because we didn't have the


interpretation that was later adopted --


MR. GILBERT:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- by the Eighth Circuit.  What


Counsel says is that the new vagueness issues that he's


raising are a consequence of the opinion which your


Supreme Court has adopted, the Eighth Circuit's opinion.


MR. GILBERT:  Well, we -- Your Honor, you're


correct.  However, the Eighth Circuit opinion is the


opinion that's being appealed here.  And what the


petitioners have done is, they have refused to acknowledge


that narrow construction.  And the fact of the matter is


that the Minnesota Supreme Court has now authoritatively


adopted that as a state court construction.  But the fact


of the matter is, as well, that the Eighth Circuit already


opined on what the standard is, and that issue was not


raised by them, in terms of vagueness.  It simply was not


raised.


QUESTION:  Was not raised where?


MR. GILBERT:  In the petition.


QUESTION:  In the petition.  The petition is

 whether it's, it unconstitutionally impinges on the


freedom of speech.  And one of the principles of freedom


of speech is that you cannot -- you cannot chill speech by


having a prohibition that is not clear.  I don't think


that this is a separate issue from the First Amendment


issue at all.


MR. GILBERT:  Well, they have not --


QUESTION:  We have lots of cases like that,


about chilling speech because it's not clear what the


coverage of the prohibition is.


MR. GILBERT:  Your Honor, in their petition,


though, they have not made those kinds of arguments


specifically as to --


QUESTION:  They certainly did in the reply


brief.


MR. GILBERT:  They have in the reply brief, but


not in the petition, which was the question that was asked


previously.  And as to vagueness, I should say that this


court has been really clear in the Broadrick v. Oklahoma


case, for example, and the Colton v. Kentucky case, that


sometimes rules and statutes -- and, frankly, all the


time, rules and statutes are not conducive to mathematical


precision, that there are going to be, as the Court has


said, germs of uncertainty in how these laws are applied. 


And these laws are going to be applied based upon facts

 and circumstances.  And in this particular case, I think


it's really significant that we don't have any facts and


circumstances as to what Mr. Wersal wants to say.


QUESTION:  Well, I think you could set up a


system where you get advisory opinions, but I don't know


that we've ever allowed that to be done in the First


Amendment area.


MR. GILBERT:  Oh --


QUESTION:  "Please may I say this?"  You know,


you submit what you want to say, and somebody tells you,


"Yeah, okay.  You can say that."  That's certainly


contrary to our approach to the First Amendment.


MR. GILBERT:  Well, Your Honor, I don't -- Your


Honor, first of all, I'm not a proponent of what  -- of


that.  But in Letter Carriers, that was a critical


consideration in upholding the Hatch Act against


constitutional attack, because there was the ability of


people who had questions about the application of the


statute to actually go to an advisory board and get an


opinion.


Similarly here, both of the boards that are


parties to this case do provide advisory opinions, and


they provide them on short notice, as well.  So there is


that mechanism.  I'm not suggesting it's a substitute, but


it is a consideration in terms of if there is a close

 question on an issue and someone wants some assurance as


to how that particular situation would be interpreted,


they can go to the boards and ask that question.


QUESTION:  Well, how soon can you get something


from the board?  If somebody wants to give a speech in a


political campaign, I assume you can't get a 12-hour


ruling from the board.


MR. GILBERT:  Well, they actually do advisory


opinions over the phone, Your Honor, on very short order,


and they could do it in a matter of hours or days,


depending upon what the needs are.


QUESTION:  Mr. Gilbert, you brought out that


this is not just a question of the candidate informing the


voter, that behind all of this is a litigant who's going


to be in a future case.  How does it work in Minnesota? 


Suppose, to take an example that Mr. Bopp provided in his


brief, the judge -- or the candidate is campaigning "Tough


on Drunk Driving."  And then I'm a drunk driver, and I


come before this judge, now elected, and I say, I want him


to recuse, he said he's tough on drunk driving.


MR. GILBERT:  Are you asking in the --


QUESTION:  Would there be, under Minnesota law,


a grounds to say, "I don't want that judge, because he's


announced in the election that he's tough on drunk


driving"?

 MR. GILBERT:  No, I don't think so, Your Honor,


not under those circumstances.


One distinction I would like to make here -- oh,


I'm sorry, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gilbert.  Mr. Bopp,


you have three minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. BOPP:  Your Honor, I don't think this is a


matter of mathematical precision.  The State brief,


itself, states two different formulations of the rule. 


They say, quote, "It is clear that the clause applies to


statements about how they would decide, quote, issues, end


of quote, on pages 1 and 47.  And then they say it is,


quote, "clear," end of quote, that the announced clause


applies to statements about cases.  And that is on pages


12 and 37.  The rule is not even clear in terms of the


State's own formulation of its scope.


Secondly, as the Joint Appendix indicates on


pages 111 through 123, announcing your views also includes


simply answering questions on radio interviews or after


speeches.  It is hardly a remedy for a candidate to call


up the board or the office for an oral opinion which is


not binding on them about whether or not they can answer a


question on the radio.

 And, finally, it is undisputed that the people


of Minnesota want an impartial judiciary.  Governor Arnie


Carlson, at Joint Appendix page 247, said -- who's a


State's witness -- that people do not want judges who are


pre-committed.  Thus, candidates who would make excessive


statements, who would appear to be partial, risk defeat at


the polls in Minnesota.  Thus, the people can be trusted


to make the decisions that they, themselves, have


conferred upon themselves, as long as they have the


information they need to make that choice.  The First


Amendment guarantees that they should receive that


information, which the Announce Clause both prohibits and


chills.  It is, therefore, unconstitutional.


QUESTION:  Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Bopp. 


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
