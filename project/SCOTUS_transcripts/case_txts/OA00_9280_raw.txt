CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 00-9280, William Arthur Kelly v. South


Carolina.


Mr. Bruck. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BRUCK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


For the second time this year, the Court


considers today South Carolina's compliance with your


decision in Simmons v. South Carolina.  The issue this


time is -- is the interpretation, if you will, the South


Carolina Supreme Court has placed upon the future


dangerousness requirement of the Simmons decision,


specifically whether, as the South Carolina Supreme Court


put it, future dangerousness was neither a logical


inference from the evidence nor was it injected into this


case through the State's closing argument. 


QUESTION:  Well, in -- in some sense -- and this


is what concerns me about your argument -- I -- I suppose


at some level future dangerousness is -- is always


inferable from the fact of -- of a horrible crime.


MR. BRUCK:  I -- I think it is true that -- that

when a person is convicted beyond a reasonable doubt of an


aggravated, death-eligible murder, it is -- it does not


take very much more to put the issue of future


dangerousness at issue.  You can conceive of crimes -- I


particularly suggest the example of an intrafamilial --


that is, the murder of children by their mother where the


person with no prior record and no likelihood that the


situation will recur, where future dangerousness simply


does not sound from the evidence. 


However, in -- there are also --


QUESTION:  We -- we are the ones that -- that


gave you this -- this category of future dangerousness. 


And it either makes sense or it doesn't.  If -- if there's


something defensible about the category, it -- it seems to


me that there would be a significant number of cases in


which it doesn't apply.  I -- I just don't see that from


your argument.  Now, maybe the category is unworkable. 


That's another point. 


MR. BRUCK:  Well, I should say that future


dangerousness is not likely to be at issue in -- in cases


where State law does not provide the jury the freedom to


consider it.  If aggravation was clearly limited in a


weighing statute in which the jury has clearly said these


are the -- or is clearly told, these are the factors that


go on death side of the scale and nothing more -- only you

can think of a way in which the prosecution could try a


case in a way that clearly conveyed the message to the


jury that --


QUESTION:  Well, how many States that use the


death penalty allow future dangerousness as a factor in


sentencing? 


MR. BRUCK:  You know, I don't have an exact


number.  My sense is that a small minority have it as a


statutory aggravating factor, such as Texas, Virginia, and


Oregon, and a much larger number like Georgia, South


Carolina allow it along with a myriad of other sentencing


factors without it ever needing to be explicitly


mentioned.  These are the so-called non-weighing States. 


I would guess --


QUESTION:  Well, that is the concern, of course,


is if -- whether this concept is something that is going


to have to be applied in every capital sentencing case or


whether there's some limitation. 


MR. BRUCK:  Well --


QUESTION:  And it's hard to know from your


argument the answer to that.  Can you draw a line?


MR. BRUCK:  Yes.  I would say where the evidence


does not sound in future dangerousness and where the


prosecution does not advance the jury's consideration of


future dangerousness.  For example, in this case, you

know, on these facts, of course, none of this is


implicated.  This is simply Simmons.  This is within


Simmons.  Even if we were to limit Simmons to its facts,


it would include this case because you have an onslaught


of future dangerousness argument.  You have an onslaught


of classic future dangerousness evidence presented --


QUESTION:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You


say evidence sounds in future dangerousness.  What -- what


evidence that -- that is introduced at -- you know, at the


-- at the sentencing phase that this is a horrible person


would -- would not sound in future dangerousness?  You're


trying to show that this is a horrible person, that he


deserves the death penalty.  What kind of evidence


wouldn't sound in future dangerousness? 


MR. BRUCK:  Well, for example, the prosecutor


here took on the issue of the fact that this young man was


only 17 years old, and his -- and had no prior record,


both very substantial mitigating factors.  And the


response was that actually the very fact that he had no


prior record, the prosecutor said, makes him more


frightening than a serial killer, more frightening than a


career criminal, which is all future dangerousness


rhetoric.  Frightening means looking toward the future. 


One is not frightened by things that have already


happened, but things that might happen in the future.

 QUESTION:  Now -- now, you're relying on the


statement of -- of the prosecutor --


MR. BRUCK:  Yes, in part. 


QUESTION:  -- on his use of the word


frightening.  And in another place, he does use the term


dangerousness.


MR. BRUCK:  Yes, he does. 


QUESTION:  Now, that's one thing if you want to


-- and -- and we -- we can discuss that.  But -- but I'm


more concerned about your broader point that when the


evidence, as you put it, sounds -- I'm not sure it's the


proper use of sounds, but when the evidence, as you put


it, sounds in future dangerousness, we have to -- it -- it


is constitutionally required that you -- you have the


instruction about no parole. 


MR. BRUCK:  Well, I mean, we should recall that


-- that -- I mean, one can say, well, these are just the


facts of the crime.  The State has enormous discretion


about what evidence it wants to present, and when it


presents evidence that is reasonably likely or, in this


case, virtually certain to cause the jury to consider the


-- the elemental sentencing issue that a judge considers


in almost every case, will he do it again, then --


QUESTION:  That will always be the case.  You --


you are asking for a rule that -- that will cover every

capital case.  I cannot imagine a capital case where --


where the prosecution does not, at the sentencing phase,


put in evidence that makes this look like a horrible


person, hence, a dangerous person.  And -- and I -- you


know, I just don't know that we're prepared to go that


far. 


Which leads me to what words -- what are the


magic words that you want the prosecution not to be able


to use.  Frightening is one magic word.  Right?  Dangerous


is another magic word. 


MR. BRUCK:  It most certainly is. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  I mean, we can just have a


list of magic words that prosecutors shouldn't use from


now on.


MR. BRUCK:  I think there would be no harm,


although this case provides absolutely no occasion to


consider the issue, in dispensing with the future


dangerousness requirement for precisely that reason, that


when -- that it is -- there are so few cases in which the


jury is not likely, in the privacy of the jury room, to


ask the question, what if he gets out and does it again? 


This comes up in case after case.  And there's a -- in


weighing the -- the State -- I mean, is there a danger


that the Simmons rule might then be applied in cases where


it truly does not rebut something that the jury --

occasionally in the rare case, yes. 


But in considering the equities, I think it's


worth keeping in mind that there is unfairness not only on


the issue of future dangerousness from this situation. 


There is also unfairness in the retributive function that


the jury must suffer, and this is not in this case.  It


may be more of an Eighth Amendment claim, but I think in


weighing the risk of unfairness to the two sides, it's


worth keeping in mind that life without parole is a much


more severe punishment.  It is much more retributive than


is life with parole.  And it is -- it is more severe from


the moment it is imposed, not only 30 or 40 years hence.


And the reason is that life without parole means life


without hope. 


And anyone -- I -- I try these cases and -- and


negotiate plea bargains in these cases at the trial level,


and I can tell you that there is nothing that cuts the ice


faster with the victim's family, with the prosecutor in


settling a case than life without parole not because of


the dangerousness, but because of its retributive effect. 


And there's something terribly unfair at -- when everyone


in the courtroom knows how crushing this penalty is, this


penalty of life without hope, except the jury, and they


are left to think that their option is to let this man


hope that some day he'll be out raising a family and

working at a job and -- and pretending to be a respectable


member of the community when it isn't so.


QUESTION:  You're asking us to overrule Simmons.


MR. BRUCK:  No, by no means.  This case -- all I


am saying is that if it is true, as my friend claims, that


our category of cases in these non-weighing jurisdictions,


where the jury is given free rein to consider everything,


that our category of non-dangerousness cases is actually


so small as to be nonexistent, then in those States at


least I think it would be fair.  And there is no harm in


saying --


QUESTION:  But that isn't the question you


presented in your petition.  All you presented in your


petition was, was the ruling of the Supreme Court of South


Carolina in this case contrary to Simmons?


MR. BRUCK:  Well, that's right because I


represent a client and all my client requires is that


Simmons be applied.  We have something that I think can


fairly be described as something approaching defiance of


your -- of your decision in Simmons when a record like


this is -- is found not to raise future dangerousness. 


The only thing that State can come up with that they


didn't do is to call Dr. Grigson, some psychiatrist, to


say --


QUESTION:  Well, for the reasons that we've

indicated in our questions, I -- I don't think it's


defiance.  I -- I do think the prosecution is being pretty


careful not to raise future dangerous explicitly because


it doesn't want the jury to know this.


MR. BRUCK:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And it makes it a little troublesome


But given the state of our law, future


dangerousness has to be put in issue, and as we -- as


we've indicated, I -- I think under -- under your rule


that would be an issue in almost every case. 


Let me ask you this.  You've heard me ask it


here before.  I -- I take it that if this instruction were


given, either the trial judge relented or future


dangerousness was at issue, it's perfectly open to the


State to say, now -- now, you may think this prisoner has


no hope, but the legislature can change this tomorrow


morning.  Tomorrow morning the legislature can change the


parole rule, and this prisoner -- this defendant can be


out in the community, once again a danger.


MR. BRUCK:  Well, I think that --


QUESTION:  I take it that would be a fair


argument? 


MR. BRUCK:  I don't think it would be for a


separate reason, which is it invites the -- the jury to


treat the law under which this person is being sentenced

as in effect nonexistent.  The only thing that's real is


death because that can't be changed. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but -- but the certainty that


life without parole will confine him indefinitely is much


less than that execution will kill him. 


MR. BRUCK:  That's true.  That's true.  But when


-- when a court -- I mean, a jury doesn't need to be told


that all manmade law is subject to being changed by man. 


That is something that we all know.  Jurors know that,


that this law was enacted by the legislature and can be


changed --


QUESTION:  Well, would you allow the prosecutor


to argue it if you were the trial judge? 


MR. BRUCK:  No, I would not because to invite


the jury to --


QUESTION:  So, you're saying that the jury


doesn't need to be told what it already knows, but that's


inconsistent with your whole position. 


MR. BRUCK:  No.  All I'm -- all I'm saying is


that the jury should not be invited to speculate that all


the law that it is being told to apply will melt away and


cannot be relied on and thus should be ignored.  And then


the jury ceases really to become a jury that applies the


law of the State and becomes just a pack of --


QUESTION:  I thought your position -- I thought

your position was that this -- that the judge or the


lawyer reads the text of what it says in the South


Carolina law.


MR. BRUCK:  Exactly.


QUESTION:  Reads word for word what the


legislature enacted. 


MR. BRUCK:  That is exactly correct. 


QUESTION:  And that's all you're asking.


MR. BRUCK:  That's all we're asking.  And, you


know, my -- my submission --


QUESTION:  Wait.  Whether -- whether we should


allow that to happen depends on, you know, how fair it is


to the prosecution and why shouldn't the prosecution be


able to point out the reality that that's what the


legislature has said today and it can change that


tomorrow?  So, if you really want future dangerousness to


be -- to be treated openly and honestly, I don't see how


you can just -- just say put in the one side and not the


other. 


MR. BRUCK:  Well, I have to say my case does not


turn on the answer to that question.  That could be


decided either way, as this case is reversed, because


that's not an issue in this case.  It certainly would


become the stuff of future appeals to this Court from the


only two States that see any issue left here, Pennsylvania

and South Carolina. 


QUESTION:  In all the other States, in -- in


every other State that has capital punishment --


MR. BRUCK:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- this instruction is given as a


matter of course? 


MR. BRUCK:  Regardless of any absence or


presence or alleged absence of future dangerousness.  In


other words, every State but South Carolina and


Pennsylvania already go beyond Simmons, and these are the


only two outliers in which the record is combed for


whether or not future dangerousness is at issue. 


Now, as I say --


QUESTION:  When you say it's outliers, but once


again that's the -- that's the dichotomy that this Court


set forth in -- in Simmons and in our past opinions. 


MR. BRUCK:  Well, yes.  The -- it's true that --


that Simmons set a constitutional minimum rule and it


required future dangerousness to be at issue.  And there


are a great many -- in a -- in a non-weighing


jurisdiction, there are a great many ways of putting


future dangerousness at issue.  It can be done, as the


Court has held in Simmons itself, by argument.  It can be


done, as is never done in South Carolina, by instruction


to the Court, because it's not a statutory factor.  Or it

can -- as the State agrees and as the South Carolina


Supreme Court acknowledges, it can be done solely by


evidence without argument by the solicitor. 


QUESTION:  But what about the argument that


everything that goes to future dangerousness also goes to


something else?  The prosecutor said, yes, I showed that


this was a terrible person because he had no prior record,


and I used the Billy the Kid remark because -- to rebut


the age.  So, I can give you a reason, other than future


dangerousness, for everything that I put in. 


MR. BRUCK:  Well, it's -- it's -- there's very


little evidence of future dangerousness and very little


argument that cannot also be given a retributive


interpretation, which is what the State has labored to do


in their brief. 


And if all that -- it's striking that the State


is not at all satisfied with the test stated by the South


Carolina Supreme Court, which is whether the issue was


argued or whether future dangerousness is a logical


inference from the evidence.  The State's test for whether


evidence is -- raises an issue of future dangerousness is


that the evidence must only raise future dangerousness and


must raise nothing but future dangerousness. 


Now, it's rather hard.  The only example, as I


say, they can think of is a psychiatric opinion that the

man will kill again.  Apparently that's the only evidence


that triggers Simmons under the Attorney General's view. 


QUESTION:  So what?  What's so -- what's so


absurd about that? 


MR. BRUCK:  Because it ain't so. 


QUESTION:  What is so absurd about that?  If


Simmons meant anything, it seems to me that's what Simmons


meant, or otherwise it -- it -- you know, it's virtually


worthless. 


MR. BRUCK:  Well, there was no psychiatric


opinion introduced by the State in Simmons itself.  There


was nothing but a metaphorical argument that two members


of the Court didn't think raised future dangerousness at


all. 


But it was this idea of self-defense in response


to someone who was a threat.  That -- that was also an


argument about retribution, and as the dissenting opinion


in -- in Simmons pointed out, that -- you could certainly


see the retributive meaning, significance, that the


prosecutor meant there. 


But it also -- it also raised the issue of


future dangerousness, and that was all in Simmons.  And


that was enough.  And that's why I say that to affirm this


case would require -- would require reversing Simmons. 


One has to weigh, too -- I mean, you know, the

State argues this issue as if we are keeping them from


introducing evidence, and we are doing something unfair or


we're saying they can't do this, they can't do that.  We


don't say the State can't do anything.  All we say is that


when they make an argument like they made in this case --


he's quick-witted, doesn't that make someone a little more


dangerous, calling the defendant Billy the Kid, Bloody


Billy, the Butcher of Batesburg, and on and on and on and


on and on -- that we be able to answer it by saying how


the legislature has defined life imprisonment for the


people of South Carolina. 


These jurors are the same voters that demanded


that life imprisonment be -- be enacted, and now that it


has been enacted, what can be fair about keeping the


defendant from telling the jury, even if all this that the


prosecutor says about me is true, I will never be released


again? 


Now, the -- the State also acknowledges, both


the State Supreme Court and the Attorney General, that


future dangerousness was raised in this case.  They make


no bones about that.  But they say, well, we raised it in


a special way that does not implicate Simmons.  What we


did was we introduced evidence that not even the Lexington


County jail could keep this man from being nonviolent, and

instruction that we offered, telling the jury that future


dangerousness was not in the case, was denied. 


But the -- but the State says, in defiance of


all common sense, that evidence that this young man would


be dangerous, even behind bars and concrete and steel, did


not implicate the notion that if you notion that if you


let him out, he would be even more dangerous.  That is why


the State says that prison dangerousness does not --


QUESTION:  He just didn't like being confined. 


MR. BRUCK:  I'm sorry? 


QUESTION:  Maybe he just didn't like being


confined.  I mean, you can imagine a situation like that.


MR. BRUCK:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, anything is


possible, but that does not commend itself to our common


sense.  I think what the jury is much more likely to infer


from that is that if even jail and prison can't keep this


guy from being dangerous, if he ever gets let out, let out


on parole, Katie, bar the door.  He's going to be a


disaster.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm not sure about that


inference.  If I were a juror and I heard about this


evidence, I'd say my principal focus would be on the


safety of the guards and the inmates.  I'd say this man is


dangerous in prison and that's the reason for capital


punishment.  It seems to me perfectly logical.

 MR. BRUCK:  That -- as I say, the -- the


evidence has two meanings and that is one of them.  We


don't quarrel with that.  But at the same time, if -- if


he is --


QUESTION:  Well, then you can't say it defies


all logic, et cetera, et cetera.  It seems to me that


that's the -- the most direct conclusion that -- that


should follow from the prosecution's evidence on this


point.  He's dangerous in prison. 


MR. BRUCK:  Even if it is the most direct, how


can we say that it does not also prove that if you let him


out on parole, he'll be even more dangerous?


QUESTION:  But that isn't what Simmons said.  I


thought the rule of Simmons was -- was a rule of fairness. 


Look, prosecution, if you're going to argue that this man


should be executed because it -- he will be dangerous to


society if he's -- if he's let out, then, for Pete's sake,


you have to let the jury know that he won't be let out. 


It's an unfair argument for the prosecution to say he'll


be dangerous to society unless you execute him, when the


prosecution knows that he'll never get out. 


MR. BRUCK:  Right. 


QUESTION:  But this is far beyond that.  This


has nothing to do with such an unfair argument by the


prosecution.  He's not saying don't let this person go

because he'll be praying on society.  There's -- there's


nothing approaching that argument. 


MR. BRUCK:  Well, I think it -- it -- what we


have here is a prosecutor who has Simmons and who knows


that if he wants to hide from the jury -- you see, the


prosecution agrees with us about -- and this is, in a way,


what is most disturbing and troubling about this case.  If


the prosecution did not believe, based on their evidence


and their argument, that this jury was thinking about


future dangerousness to society, why would they care? 


What possible harm could there be from a Simmons


instruction? 


I think the prosecution entirely agrees with us


on the importance of this and on the dynamics of jury


deliberation in a case where a -- where the -- where the


State's evidence and the argument is of this nature.  They


know perfectly well what any practicing lawyer who tries


these cases on either side knows, which is that this jury


goes back in the jury room, after having seen and heard


all of this, and thinks one thing for sure:  We got to


make sure he doesn't do it again.  And it is a


constitutional fact, established by the Simmons case,


that's -- that part of that is parole, the jury's


misconception about parole, because we've had parole for


so many generations and life without parole is a new

phenomenon in this country. 


QUESTION:  But this -- this is not a case, is


it, in -- where the trial judge put any limitation on the


defense attorney's arguing this point or where the jury


came back with a question.  This is not one of those


cases.


MR. BRUCK:  Right.  For all we know, the jury


knew there was parole, wrongly.  And no limitation. 


But I have to say -- and the State has not


claimed that in the face of this argument on instructions,


that the lawyer -- the defense attorney should have picked


up a statute book and read to the jury the instruction


that the judge had just refused to give.  She would have


had her head handed to her on a plate if she had done


that.  That is not permitted in South Carolina.  When a


legal principle has been ruled out of a case, a lawyer


cannot then attempt to charge the jury anyway.  And that


is not an argument you'll find in the State's case.


They do say that her -- her rhetorical claim or


-- or co-counsel's claim that you'll never see the light


of day should be deemed as the equivalent of a no-parole


instruction, but you dealt with that and disposed of that


argument in Shafer, where a much more explicit argument


was held not to be the equivalent of an instruction on --


on State law concerning parole.  So, I think that -- that

argument has absolutely nothing to commend it and is -- is


directly controlled, I would submit, by -- by Shafer. 


QUESTION:  But Shafer was explicit that counsel


would not be allowed to read the statute, which is what I


think counsel wanted to do.


MR. BRUCK:  Well, that's right.  But you know,


it -- a lawyer doesn't, under South Carolina practice,


need to ask the court whether an instruction that has been


ruled out of the case -- whether it's okay for her to read


it to the jury.  We know that that is not permissible.


I should add, too, that -- that the trial judge


instructed the jury in this case that he is the sole


instructor on the facts.  At page 618 of the record, he


said, as -- I am as judge the sole -- made the sole and


only instructor in the law.  And so -- and that's, you


know, how trials in South Carolina are conducted.  Lawyers


do not instruct. 


I realize as a matter of constitutional law, if


it were -- if there were a way for defense counsel to have


done that, despite the -- the court's ruling, it would


have sufficed under Simmons, but there was no such way,


and that's why the State makes no such argument in their


-- in their brief.  This is not where an opportunity was


passed up by defense counsel to instruct on the law.  This


-- there wasn't any such -- any such opportunity, and

that's why the -- the argument is so vague and so


unsatisfactory under -- under Shafer v. -- v. South


Carolina.


If this is enough to get around Simmons and to


allow prosecutors to keep juries from knowing what the


South Carolina legislature has done with respect to the


abolition of parole, then you will see, as you already are


seeing, case after case from South Carolina in which the


envelope is constantly being pushed further and further


back in what, I have to submit, is a somewhat manipulative


effort to get the advantage of the jury's misconceptions,


to get the advantage of the false dilemma that Simmons


correctly identified in order to get more death sentences


than are actually merited by the law and the evidence in


each case. 


As I say, this is the second time that -- that


South Carolina has -- South Carolina's compliance with


Simmons has been before this Court in this calendar year. 


There probably won't be another one this calendar year,


but there will be a continuing procession.  And, indeed,


the first case in line will be Shafer v. South Carolina,


which was remanded for reconsideration of the -- for


consideration -- for a ruling on the issue of future


dangerousness.  If --

your brief that for the future the South Carolina

MR. BRUCK:  Prospectively, yes.  It will -- it

the petitioner in this case whose cases have already been


tried.  But, yes, the House of Representatives has already


voted overwhelmingly to, in effect, require a Simmons

QUESTION:  1986. 


MR. BRUCK:  And thereafter, the South Carolina

and then reversed itself just before Simmons, and Simmons


was the first case tried under the new regime.


If there are no further questions, I'd like to


reserve my time for rebuttal.

 Mr. Waters, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF S. CREIGHTON WATERS


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. WATERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In Simmons v. South Carolina, a limited due


process exception was crafted to the general rule in


California v. Ramos that it was for the States to decide


whether to inform the juries on matters of parole or other


early release.  And the issue in this case is what


argument and evidentiary submissions are sufficient to --


for the prosecution to have been deemed to raise future


dangerousness such that due process overcomes that State


law rule. 


And petitioner in this case contends that future


dangerousness can be raised simply by the gruesome facts


of the crime, by misbehavior in jail, by a prior criminal


record.  And, of course, that would create, as has already


been discussed, a virtually standardless test and would


conflict with this Court's statements of the Simmons rule,


as well as the subsequent interpretation of the rule by


many other courts.  And that is, of course, that a


prosecutor must specifically rely on future dangerousness


to society as a basis for death. 


And, of course, that -- the reason for that is

the rationale of Simmons itself, which is a due process


right of rebuttal.  Future dangerousness -- a future


dangerousness requirement is necessary to that due process


right of rebuttal, and obviously, in order to have the


right to rebut something, the other party must have first


done something to affirmatively raise that issue.


Now, admittedly some --


QUESTION:  Mr. Waters, in -- in your view has


any South Carolina prosecutor since Simmons used words


that would invoke that case? 


MR. WATERS:  Invoke Simmons itself? 


QUESTION:  Yes.  It seems to me that any


prosecutor, if your argument is right, can easily get


around Simmons simply by not using the words future


dangerousness and saying, well, this is relevant to


something else. 


MR. WATERS:  Well, I think, you know, our State


Supreme Court has on two occasions ruled that Simmons was


violated, and in that case, the -- the prosecutor argued


that, you know, he's shown that he cannot live inside or


outside of prison.  So, clearly that crosses the line.


I think, you know, the -- the fundamental --


QUESTION:  I thought your position was if he


couldn't live in prison, then Simmons was out.


MR. WATERS:  Well, in that particular case, he

said both outside of society and inside prison in that


particular case.  That's State v. Timothy Rogers, a State


court case.  So, our court has on -- on a couple of


occasions ruled that.  I mean, obviously --


QUESTION:  You -- you then concede that if the


-- if the argument that counsel for the -- the prosecutor


makes is this man is dangerous in or out of prison, in


that case a Simmons instruction is warranted.


MR. WATERS:  I think that by incorporating the


outside society aspect of the argument, our State Supreme


Court has already ruled that and I'm not here to -- to


challenge that. 


QUESTION:  I understood Justice Ginsburg's


question -- and I'm interested in it too -- as can you


tell us, as a matter of practice, are there instances in


where the Simmons rule is followed in South Carolina and


the jury is instructed about parole because of future


dangerous being an issue, or as Justice Ginsburg


suggested, is it the common pattern and practice for


prosecution -- for the prosecutor to stay away from this?


MR. WATERS:  No.  There are plenty of instances


where -- where solicitors argue future dangerousness to


society, and a life without parole instruction is given. 


There -- it -- it ultimately boils down to what the


prosecutor does in his argument and how the trial judge

rules on -- on what was raised in -- in that trial.  But


it does happen. 


QUESTION:  Don't you have that here?  I mean,


the argument here was not only the -- the Bloody Billy,


the Butcher of whatever it was, but the words dangerous


were used I think -- I think twice to describe him in the


argument, once at least.  And -- and the argument included


the -- the statement to the jurors, I hope you never have


to be in the position again of being 30 -- 30 feet away


from this kind of -- of a killer.  Well, the jurors aren't


going to be spending time in prison, and I -- I don't know


why that argument means anything other than I hope this


guy is not going to be out where you are going to be and


find you as close to him again.  So, hasn't -- hasn't he


raised it even on -- on your criteria? 


MR. WATERS:  I don't believe so in this case.  I


think if you focus on the prosecutor's argument as a


whole, it's clear that the majority of his argument was


retributive.  And we would assert --


QUESTION:  Well, I'm not talking about -- I


mean, you -- the majority of the argument isn't even the


criterion that you are arguing for.  You said, look, he's


got to raise it on my theory.  He's got to raise it as an


argument that this person will be dangerous on the


outside.  And I assume if he does that once, that's

sufficient on your theory.  And my question is, didn't --


even on your theory, didn't he do it here?


MR. WATERS:  Well, with regard to the dangerous


comment, what the solicitor said in that particular case


was -- he said, well, the evidence here is that he's


quick-witted, he's not retarded.  And of course, the


evidence in this case also was that petitioner was a close


friend of -- or the petitioner's family was a close friend


of this victim.  He used to work with the victim, and that


he used that familiarity with the victim to make her more


vulnerable.


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what about the 30 feet? 


I hope you're never in this position again.  What about


that argument?  I mean, isn't that an argument that makes


no sense except on the assumption that this person might


-- the defendant might be outside?


MR. WATERS:  That -- that particular argument


was -- was made at -- at the beginning of the sentencing


phase in opening statement.  It was a brief reference.  I


don't think that that --


QUESTION:  I mean, it was made to the jurors.


They heard it, didn't they? 


MR. WATERS:  They did hear that, but I think if


you read it in context, it was more of the case of you


just committed -- convicted this guy of a horrible crime.

You have a tough job ahead of you, and I hope you never


have to do this again.  I -- I think that -- that brief,


isolated passage, when read in the context of what the


solicitor was saying there, would not have such -- been


such as to necessarily flag the future dangerousness issue


in the mind.


QUESTION:  So, if -- if the prosecutor had


closed his argument with that, that would have sufficed.


MR. WATERS:  I'm not -- I don't know if I would


say that much.  I just point out that it was very early


and it was just a brief reference in opening statement,


and I don't think that that -- that can be pointed to as


to have crossed that line because I don't really think he


used it for that inference, that you know, this -- you


know, this guy is going to be dangerous to you.  He was


more saying, you know, you just convicted this guy of the


most horrible, bloodiest crime you can imagine, and he's a


horrible person, and now you've got one more tough job to


do.  And I hope you never have to go through this again. 


I think that was the point of his argument, not that this


guy --


QUESTION:  He didn't -- my -- my -- you correct


me if I'm wrong, because I don't have the transcript in


front of me, but my recollection is he didn't say, I hope


you don't have to go through this again.  He said, I hope

you're -- you know, you're not in this position of being


30 feet away from this kind of a person again, which is I


think quite different. 


MR. WATERS:  Well, he -- he did not say, I hope


you don't have to go through that, but I think if you read


his argument, that was the point of it, and I think in


context, that's the obvious point of it rather than future


dangerousness.


QUESTION:  May I ask this?  You gave us a couple


of examples of the South Carolina Supreme Court itself


setting aside the conviction -- or executions because they


had failed to give the instruction.  And you -- you've


just quoted the example he mentioned both inside and


outside prison. 


Now, did they consider the -- your argument that


if read in the context of the entire argument, it -- it


was a featured part of the argument, or did they -- could


the -- could one reasonably think that from those


opinions, just that mere mention was enough?


MR. WATERS:  In that -- in that particular case,


the solicitor focused much of his argument on that.  He


said, this -- this defendant has shown by his prior


record, because the defendant had had prior incarcerations


and prior releases -- he's shown by his prior record that


he cannot exist safely both inside prison and outside

society.  So, I would concede that crosses the line.  I


think it was focused on in that case, and it was a direct


statement of outside society.


And I -- I don't want to get into magic words,


but I think when you say outside society, when he clearly


focuses, that -- that would be a magic word triggering


Simmons. 


QUESTION:  But you would draw a line depending


in part on how much the issue was emphasized in the


argument.  Not just an isolated comment, for example,


would not be enough. 


MR. WATERS:  What I'm saying is that if there's


an isolated comment in the context of an -- of an argument


that focuses on retribution, that -- it's kind of a


Donnelly v. DeChristoforo principle, that you shouldn't


assume that the prosecutor intended to worst meaning from


that, and you shouldn't assume that the jury necessarily


took the worst meaning from that.  And -- and so, I'm not


saying -- I'm just saying that the context does matter,


and -- and that's essentially what we have here. 


In Simmons, you know, we had a -- the more


egregious situation.  We had the prosecutor say, jury, you


know, the death penalty is going to be society's response


to a threat, society's response.  The prosecutor said,


jury, you know, this will be your act of self-defense to

this particular defendant.  The death penalty will be an


act of self-defense.  The prosecutor even went on -- so


far as to say his own expert calls him dangerous and had


brought that out in cross examination.  There's none of


that here.  All they can do in this case is -- is go


through a technical parsing of the argument. 


QUESTION:  Well, why shouldn't -- why shouldn't


it be?  Why isn't it fundamentally unfair in every capital


case, after all, not to give the instruction that the


alternative is life without parole?  After all, you have a


jury who knows it has a murderer in front of it.  It's


trying to decide among all alternative punishments.  Death


is the worst, and then the State won't tell them what the


alternative is.  Apparently every State but two have


decided that is unfair.  And why, to go back to basics,


isn't it as unfair a thing just about as one can imagine


to tell the jury you have to give life or something else


and then not tell them what the something else is,


particularly when they're likely to think he'll be out


after a few years? 


MR. WATERS:  Well, I think the jury in this case


-- you know, they are told life imprisonment, and they're


never told that there's any possibility of --


QUESTION:  But sitting -- in your experience,


wouldn't you say most jurors are sitting there thinking

that life doesn't mean life? 


MR. WATERS:  Well, I -- I'm not sure that that's


necessarily true.  I mean, in State v. Patterson, which


was a 1986 case in South Carolina, there was a voir dire


of the jury on that, and most of the jurors said, we


thought it meant, you know, he'll never get out.  So, I


mean, there's conflicting evidence on that.  I know this


Court has repeatedly referred to the fact that it -- it is


new event and many jurors may not know, but I don't know


if that's necessarily the case. 


As a matter of fundamental fairness, we're


still talking about, to some degree, deference to the


States.  And -- and so --


QUESTION:  What does deference to the State got


to do with fundamental fairness?  It seems to me that's an


entirely different argument. 


The fundamental fairness question that Justice


Breyer is raising is in a context in which it may or may


not be debated as to whether jurors know instinctively


that life really means life, doesn't fundamental fairness


require that they be instructed unequivocally so that they


know the terms within which they must act in coming to a


verdict.  That's the fundamental fairness question. 


MR. WATERS:  Well, I think that the -- the


ineligibility of parole, as this Court held in Simmons, is


34

only directly relevant to future dangerousness to society


argument, and that, of course, was the due process


rationale followed in Simmons. 


As far as whether under an Eighth Amendment


context or even under a due process that life without


parole is an effective rebuttal to retribution arguments


and that sort of thing, that's not presented by this case. 


But I -- I think that the -- the relevance, again, of --


of ineligibility for parole is to rebut future


dangerousness to society.  That's what --


QUESTION:  Well, in -- in Simmons, there's no


question that the future dangerousness issue, together


with the jury's question and so on, presented an egregious


case of -- of a need for instruction.


MR. WATERS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  But let's -- let's assume -- and I


don't believe this is this case, even remotely, but let's


assume we had a case in which somehow future dangerousness


were not an issue.  And let's assume we -- we had a -- a


straight retribution case.  Given the fact that there is


enough history to put in -- in doubt, to put into question


what really is meant by life imprisonment, in the absence


of a further instruction, why doesn't fundamental fairness


require that the jury know for sure what the terms mean,


which it must select from in sentencing this person?

 MR. WATERS:  Well, again, the jury is told we're


dealing with death or life imprisonment.


QUESTION:  No, but that simply begs the


question.  That -- that is changing my question to you. 


My question to you says we're operating in a context in


which historical practice leads one to -- to question


whether jurors really do understand that life means life


in this case in this State now.  On that assumption, why


doesn't fundamental fairness require that the juries be


given a clear instruction so that they're not sitting


there wondering what it means if they come back with a


life sentence? 


MR. WATERS:  I think that that depends that --


that be all to end all is the without parole context of


life.  I mean, life is still a very severe penalty, and --


and in order to get to your point, I think that you have


to assume that adding without parole to it makes it so


far --


QUESTION:  You bet I assume that.  There is a


big difference between life imprisonment, in which a


person never walks out of the prison, and life


imprisonment in which the person walks out 15 years later. 


Yes, I make that assumption and I want you to make that


assumption in answering my question.  Why doesn't


fundamental fairness require that the juries understand

that? 


MR. WATERS:  Well, again, I would have to fall


back to the fact of is the only aspect of the State's case


that it rebuts is future dangerousness to society.  And --


and so that --


QUESTION:  And my question to you is let's


assume a case in which that is not the issue, a case in


which we're talking about retribution.  I want to narrow


the issue down here.  Why doesn't fundamental fairness


require that the jurors understand what the words mean?


MR. WATERS:  Because if it is a purely


retributive case and -- and future dangerousness was not


an issue, then there is nothing fundamentally unfair.  The


State has not made any arguments that the defendant did


not have an opportunity to rebut.  And -- and that's the


holding of Simmons. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but the -- the argument to the


contrary would be if you were sitting there thinking that


this terrible murderer is in front of you and you are


asked what is the appropriate punishment, and on the one


hand you were told it's death, and on the other hand you


were told -- well, you're not told because a person who


wants to retribute, wants vengeance, would surely like to


know that the alternative to death, which is surely


vengeance, is life in prison forever, not just life in

prison for 10 or 15 years.  I mean, can you think -- in a


death case punishment stage, surely that would be on


anyone's list of top five of the relevant factors. 


MR. WATERS:  I don't know if you can necessarily


assume that's the case when the jury hears evidence and


they're instructed on what to consider and the focus of


the evidence is his adaptability in prison, which is the


case in this case and many other cases. 


And I think with regard to life without parole


being a response to purely retributive arguments, it's not


such an obvious be all and end all response to -- to


retribution that due process steps in, as opposed to the


situation in Simmons where future dangerousness to society


does respond to that.  I think that there is still a


distinction there that -- that retribution is not


necessarily directly responded to by a life without parole


sentence, and so --


QUESTION:  I assume that the reason for these


rules were just -- just State principles that the law says


what it says, and we don't want to get into the


refinements of -- of how long a life sentence may be.  In


those States that do allow the fact that a life sentence


does mean a life sentence to be introduced, do those


jurisdictions also permit or do other jurisdictions permit


the prosecution to show that a life sentence does not mean

a life sentence? 


MR. WATERS:  There -- there are a number of --


of jurisdictions that have wrestled with that.  I think


California v. Ramos is an example of that.  Illinois has


had -- has wrestled with that.  So, some do allow charges


on the possibility of commutation, on the possibility of


pardon, on the possibility of change in the law and -- and


add argument on that as well. 


And, of course, South Carolina's policy has


always been that we want a simple either/or choice, death


or life, and -- and we don't want to bring in these


collateral concerns.  Now, whether the members of this


Court disagree with that as a matter of policy, this


Court, of course, has stated in many contexts that, you


know, the -- the wisdom of policy decisions, as long as


they have a certain modicum of -- of reasonableness, are


for the States. 


QUESTION:  Is the prosecution allowed to argue


in South Carolina when -- when the choice is -- is life or


death, is the prosecution allowed to argue the possibility


of commutation? 


MR. WATERS:  No, no.  Parole and early release


is off-limits on both sides of the coin, and there's never


been a State case yet to rule that, well, to be fair, the


prosecution needs to have that, at least as --

 QUESTION:  Well, that's not really very fair, is


it?  When -- when the jury, you know -- if you instruct


the jury that life means life, it really doesn't mean


life.  You'd have to let the prosecution come in and say


it could be commuted. 


MR. WATERS:  Absolutely, absolutely, and I would


agree with that. 


QUESTION:  Or the -- all the law can be changed?


MR. WATERS:  Or it could be changed. 


QUESTION:  The South Carolina Supreme Court


hasn't dealt with that issue, though, has it?  Because --


because Simmons is relatively new.  Has there been a case


where the prosecutor says, okay, judge, I said future


dangerousness, but I want to tell them that the law can


change, that there's a pardon, that there's a clemency


power?  That hasn't come up, has it? 


MR. WATERS:  Not of which I'm aware.  In fact,


this rule developed initially when there was parole


eligibility, and it was really a rule initially created to


-- to benefit defendants, frankly, in -- in that they


didn't want the jury to know -- the defense didn't want


the jury to know that there was parole eligibility.  So,


the South Carolina Supreme Court said, okay, we're going


to charge life.  Life means life imprisonment.  That's


what it means.

 QUESTION:  Well, then the South Carolina Supreme


Court itself changed its rule on that?


MR. WATERS:  It had.  There was a period of time


where their -- they did sanction charging on parole


eligibility.  This was prior to life without parole on --


on either 20- or 30-year parole eligibility, depending on


the jury's finding of aggravators.  That existed, I


believe, for about 4 years, and was overturned in 1991 I


think.  So, there was a period of time. 


But the policy -- the rule has always stayed the


same, though, and that is that we don't want the jury to


be legislating a plan of punishment.  We don't want to be


-- them to be concerned about these possible future


events.  We want them to make an either/or choice. 


And South Carolina will remain true to Simmons,


but beyond that, unless the policy is considered to be so


unreasonable as to not pass the laugh test, then I think


that they can potentially -- they can have that policy. 


And I want to bring up another point, especially


with regard to this and -- and what the prosecution did in


this case.  I don't think the -- the Court should -- or I


don't -- I don't think it would be wise to -- to assume


that prosecutors are going to be dishonest or to assume


that the State court is going to be dishonest and is going


to circumvent this rule.

 And in fact, what the prosecution was doing in


this case, yes, he was trying to avoid Simmons, but he was


doing that to obey the law.  And -- and clearly in -- in


Justice O'Connor's concurrence, it said that if the


prosecution does not argue future dangerousness, then the


charge does not have to be given, and -- and that's what


the prosecutor was doing here.  So, he wasn't trying to


circumvent the law.  He wasn't trying to be sneaky.  He


was trying to obey the law, and -- and --


QUESTION:  Yes, but he was trying to get the --


prevent the jury from getting this information. 


MR. WATERS:  That's true.  That's true.  He made


a tactical decision that he -- and I don't know if it's


necessarily tactical -- he was not going to rely on future


dangerousness, and since that would not trigger Simmons,


then the State law rule would apply.  And that's --


QUESTION:  And -- and he also kind of snuck in


the word dangerousness there in the -- in the 30-foot


example, but they don't count because they weren't


prominent in his argument. 


MR. WATERS:  Well, I'd -- I'd like to -- to


address that specifically.  At that point in the argument,


he was talking about the particular crime in this --


QUESTION:  What -- what passage are we -- are we


talking about a passage?  I don't have it in my -- where

the -- the prosecutor expressly says future dangerous?


MR. WATERS:  No, not at all. 


QUESTION:  I thought perhaps from his question


that's what we were talking about. 


MR. WATERS:  What he -- what he was doing was he


said, okay, this defendant is quick-witted.  This


defendant -- the evidence says this defendant is not


retarded.  Now, doesn't that make him more dangerous for


Shirley Shealy, for this crime on this January the 5th,


for this particular lady?  And what he was saying, if --


if you read his argument in context, was again that the


petitioner in this case was a close family friend of the


victim and also used to work at that very same Kentucky


Fried Chicken.


QUESTION:  Mr. Waters, it wasn't quite like


that.  He said dangerousness, and then counsel for the


defense stopped him at that point, and then he came back


with, well, I meant dangerous for her. 


MR. WATERS:  Well, I don't know if you can


necessarily read that that was at a protracted period.  It


may have been he just cut off before he finished his


sentence.  But what he was trying to say was is that he


was more dangerous for her because she would have trusted


him.  She would not have expect to be cut to ribbons by


this person because he was her friend.  And that's what

the prosecution was saying.  He was saying that makes this


crime more aggravated.  It's more premeditated.  It's more


callous.  He preyed on the vulnerability of the victim.


QUESTION:  And she was outside prison when this


happened. 


MR. WATERS:  She was outside prison, but this is


retribution.  This is, you know, jury, sentence this


defendant to death for all the bad things that he has done


culminating in this capital crime.  This was such a


horrible crime.  And if you read the prosecution, there's


at least five or six examples where he says, what's the


punishment that fits the crime?  It doesn't matter if he


doesn't have a prior record.  This case is bad enough on


its own.  This is a case for the death penalty.  And that


was a recurrent theme from the beginning, the middle, and


the end of his argument, from start to finish.


So, I would assert then that, you know, when


read as a whole -- and -- and again, if you look at the


evidence of dangerousness -- and there's been some raised


of whether -- the issue raised of whether dangerousness


within prison counts.  And obviously, as a matter of


logic, it doesn't because, you know, whether or not the


defendant is going to get out of prison has nothing to do


with whether he will be a danger inside. 


But more -- more --

 QUESTION:  But if he is a danger inside, it


follows that he will be a danger outside if he gets out. 


Isn't that the kind of common sense inference that anyone


would draw? 


MR. WATERS:  I -- I don't think the link is --


is so readily made.  I mean, it's common knowledge that --


that prison --


QUESTION:  Well, the -- the evidence of -- of


his dangerousness included things that he used to like to


torture small animals, psychiatric evidence to the effect


that he wants to -- to take action, homicidal action,


against anybody who annoys him.  The -- the word was a


little bit more flamboyant in the psychiatrist's


testimony, but that was the point.  These -- these don't


go to conditions that would only come into play inside of


a prison. 


MR. WATERS:  Well, in that particular instance,


number one, the prosecution never used any of that in his


closing argument.  But I don't --


QUESTION:  Well, it brought out in its cross


examination. 


MR. WATERS:  Absolutely. 


But -- but number two, if you -- that there was


their adaptability expert, and all of this went to focus


on what the jury had before it, which was adaptability to

prison, and that's the issue that they were focused upon. 


And -- and what -- and the expert said, well, you know --


QUESTION:  Let's -- let's assume that.  Let's


assume that was the -- was the point.  The fact is the


evidence came out, and there's -- there's no common sense


basis that I can think of to say that this evidence would


not indicate that if the individual got out of prison, he


would be very dangerous to the people he came in contact


with.  And I thought you were arguing that you couldn't


make such an inference. 


MR. WATERS:  I think that that -- that evidence


is very close, but I would -- I would assert that -- that


the way it was used in this particular case to respond to


adaptability, which is dangerousness within prison, which


was the specific issue that was focused before this jury. 


If the prosecution --


QUESTION:  But what started all of this, I


thought, was -- was the point that you were making that


the evidence that went to dangerousness in prison did not


ground in inference of dangerousness outside.  Maybe I


misunderstood your point. 


MR. WATERS:  No.  I -- I agree that that


particular -- those particular instances are a bit broader


than the majority of evidence of dangerousness within


prison, but I think that the -- his expert said, look,

he's not a violent person.  He hasn't had a violent past. 


He -- he's -- he's not mentally ill.  He's -- he's going


to be great in prison.  He's not the type of individual


that poses a risk in prison.  He's not a predatorial,


institutional violent individual, which their witnesses


were noting a distinction between society in prison and


society outside of prison. 


And I think all the State was doing was cross


examining on that, saying, wait a minute.  You're saying


he's going to be adaptable?  Well, he says, you know, he


has violent fantasies.  Well, that was brought out on


direct by the defense.  They -- they brought that out, of


these violent fantasies, and the State was merely cross


examining on a point that already had been made by the


defense and saying, your opinion here is that he's


adaptable.  Well, what about this -- this violent fantasy?


So, it was only used in the context of -- even


though it -- I agree, it has a broader context -- a


broader -- you know, it wasn't just his misbehavior in


prison, but it was only used by the State here to


challenge the adaptability prison in -- or the


adaptability issue of -- of what he would do in -- within


prison.


QUESTION:  And it is important to the State, I


suppose, to show that he will be dangerous in prison.

 MR. WATERS:  Oh, absolutely.  This is the --


QUESTION:  The jury presumably would not want to


give a life sentence to someone who's going to continue to


kill in prison. 


MR. WATERS:  Absolutely.  And this is -- this,


of course, is the state of -- of Skipper, and -- and it's


an inevitability that -- that you're going to see an


adaptability case.  But --


QUESTION:  The argument is made whenever the


State makes that point, that perfectly valid point, to the


jury.  It automatically triggers Simmons.


MR. WATERS:  I'm sorry?  The -- the point?


QUESTION:  The argument made is that when the


State makes that perfectly valid point about dangerousness


in prison, it automatically triggers Simmons.  And you say


it should not unless -- unless the prosecutor specifically


argues violence, dangerousness outside of prison.


MR. WATERS:  Correct.  As a matter of logic


that --


QUESTION:  But that really doesn't help you here


because here you further had evidence of his escape risk.


MR. WATERS:  And --


QUESTION:  So that this wasn't a guy who was


just going to sit quietly and -- and enjoy his time in


prison.  This is someone who presented an escape risk and

hence raised a risk of -- of acting out his dangerous


propensity if he succeeds in escaping. 


MR. WATERS:  And I think that that's -- I would


agree with that wholeheartedly.  I think the majority of


the -- of the prosecution's dangerousness within prison


evidence went to him being an escape risk, and -- but the


fact of the matter is, is whether or not you buy there's a


distinction between -- or accept there's a distinction


between inside prison and outside society, whether or not


-- whatever you think about Simmons, the fact of the


matter is that ineligibility for parole does absolutely


nothing to respond to the fact that he's an escape risk. 


He's saying he's going to bust out.  It -- the fact that


he can't get parole does nothing to respond that he's


going to bust out -- that he might bust out of prison.


QUESTION:  So, you should have been happy with


the instruction is what that proves. 


MR. WATERS:  I'm sorry? 


QUESTION:  You should have been happy with the


instruction.


MR. WATERS:  With the? 


QUESTION:  Because you're concentrating on what


would happen in prison.  So, the instruction wouldn't help


you -- it wouldn't hurt you.  It would actually help you.


MR. WATERS:  What?  The --

 QUESTION:  This fellow is going to be kept where


he'll be the most dangerous.  Therefore, you should kill


him.  That's your argument. 


MR. WATERS:  No.  That's -- that's not


necessarily my argument.  I think the argument, again,


goes to adaptability.  I certainly -- certainly wouldn't


-- wouldn't assert that. 


But, you know, as far as to his contention that,


well, why does the State care, you know, about giving this


charge if they're saying they're not raising future


dangerousness, again it raises these collateral concerns


down the road of pardon, which he's eligible for pardon. 


It raises the -- the issues of change in the law, and --


and the State seeks to avoid those.  And so, that's why it


cares.  It doesn't want to have to get into that.


And if that issue is given, I don't know if a


trial judge, without direction from the Supreme Court, the


State Supreme Court, would allow a prosecutor to then


respond with -- with, you know, arguments about change in


the law.  And -- and I guess, you know, depending on -- on


what happens, we'll have to see guidance on that. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Waters, you didn't really mean --


your brief could be read to say that -- that the lawyer


was effectively allowed to tell the jury that life means


life.  You said something in your -- the jury -- that

because the line was about defendant would never see the


light of day. 


MR. WATERS:  Right. 


QUESTION:  It's no different than -- from what


it was in Shafer in that respect. 


MR. WATERS:  I -- I fully understand what Shafer


held, and my only point with that was, was that the


reasons that -- that this Court relied upon in Shafer were


not present in this case, to why those were not


sufficient, and that was, number one, the jury asked.  So,


obviously, it didn't work.  And number two, that the judge


told the jury, well, parole eligibility is not for your


consideration, which raised the concern in Simmons that,


well, parole is available but for some --


QUESTION:  But you -- but you don't dispute that


if the -- if the lawyer then -- if she had tried to say in


open court, now, jurors, I'm going to read you from the


South Carolina, that she would have her head cut off by


the judge. 


MR. WATERS:  I think it's very unlikely the


trial judge would have allowed her to do that. 


Absolutely. 


And -- and we would just assert, though, that --


that this is a case -- there's no indication whatsoever


that the jury was confused or concerned with his possible

release.  They didn't ask the question.  They weren't --


it wasn't interjected by the trial judge.  And so, all I'm


saying is -- is that makes this case materially different


from what happened in Shafer when it said that that was


insufficient. 


And this -- this lawyer argued natural life in


prison -- imprisonment extensively, said, you have two


choices, jury.  You have death, a quick, painless death,


or you have a long, slow death, and that a wife -- and he


asserted earlier, that well, you know, the -- but the jury


might think he's going to get out of prison and have a


wife and a car.  Well, no.  The defense argued in this


case just the opposite.  They -- they argued that a wife


is never ever going to happen for Billy Kelly.  A car is


never ever going to happen for Billy Kelly, and -- and


concluded by saying, I think life imprisonment is the


right punishment in this case because he'll never see the


daylight -- the light of daylight again.  So, I think it


was clearly made to the jury, and there's no indication


that there was confused -- they were confused.  There's no


indication of a fundamental unfairness in this case.


Finally, I think again this Court has stated in


-- thank you very much. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Waters.


Mr. Bruck, you have 4 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BRUCK:  Thank you, Your Honor.


The question has come up again concerning the


history of South Carolina's handling of this matter.  I


should say that a very detailed accounting of the whole


history, legislative and judicial, is provided in the cert


petition in Simmons itself, and it's not a very edifying


tale.  It really shows that the legislature, when they


first considered a limited life without parole, was


deadlocked because of a fear that it would reduce the


number of death sentences, and the legislative compromise


that finally came out was we can go ahead and have life


without parole because you don't have to tell the jury


anyway.  So, it won't have any effect.  And that was


the --


QUESTION:  The Supreme Court of South Carolina,


I gather from your opponent, shifted its position too.


MR. BRUCK:  Yes, it did. 


QUESTION:  And what was the reason for that? 


MR. BRUCK:  It's not entirely clear.  The


membership of the court changed, and indeed, the -- the


legislative leader of this proposal to stop telling the


jury or not to tell the jury about parole joined the


court, and then the membership -- and then the court's

position changed.  If there was a connection, I don't


know.  But it -- it -- it's an odd history.


The -- my friend says that, well, South Carolina


doesn't want the jury to know about commutation.  For a


very good reason.  There is no such thing as commutation


of a life sentence under South Carolina law.  We're one of


only two life without parole jurisdictions that do not


allow the Governor to commute a life without parole or any


prison sentence.  The commutation power only extends to


the death penalty.  So, there is a pardon power which --


QUESTION:  When you say commutation, that's all


synonymous with --


MR. BRUCK:  Clemency. 


QUESTION:  -- clemency?


MR. BRUCK:  That's right. 


There is a pardon power which, according to the


record in Simmons, has never been exercised, and by its


terms requires a showing of the most extraordinary


circumstances. 


And there -- so, South Carolina's life without


parole is as locked down as any State's.  The idea that,


well, there's lots of play is simply not so, and -- and so


there's very little that the State could come back with.


But as a constitutional matter, if there was any


play at the joints, absolutely, if the jury is told the

truth that there's no parole, the jury can also be told


the truth about any possibility of release that might


exist.  We don't deny that for a moment.  But the State


recognizes that the -- that the real issue is the


unavailability of parole, and that's why they fight this


tooth and nail. 


Justice Ginsburg inquired about prior cases in


which the State Supreme Court has reversed under Simmons. 


And it's important to keep in mind there are only two, and


they both involved cases that were tried before Simmons


came down.  And that is why in one case the verbatim same


argument about what to do with him when he is in our midst


was made by the prosecutor because they didn't have


Simmons as the script about what not to say. 


But since Simmons came down and since


prosecutors who are of a mind to defeat the rule in


Simmons have had the -- the facts of Simmons to go by, not


one case by the South Carolina -- the South Carolina


Supreme Court has not reversed under Simmons in a single


case, in every instance. 


Now, it's true that occasionally trial judges


have given a life without parole instruction under


Simmons.  Oftentimes it's because a prosecutor, out of a


basic sense of fairness, does not take the position that


the prosecutor took in this case.  We're really dealing


55 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

with a due process rule where you sort of feel it in your


heart that there's something wrong, and that applies to


prosecutors and judges too.  But when a prosecutor decides


to -- to use the Simmons script, they've had very good


success in having this instruction not given. 


And I should say that if this -- if these facts


are now held by this high Court to be not to trigger the


rule in Simmons, you will see that as being -- as being


the rule.  Now, it's possible that the legislature will


step in.  It's equally possible, after such a large


loophole in Simmons, a loophole that will swallow the


entire case, is decided by this Court --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Bruck. 


MR. BRUCK:  Thank you. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
