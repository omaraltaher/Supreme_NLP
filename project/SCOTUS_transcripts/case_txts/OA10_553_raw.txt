 Mr. Laycock. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK

5

7

10
11  please the Court: 
12
 The churches do not set the criteria for 
13  selecting or removing the officers of government, and 
14  government does not set the criteria for selecting or 
15
16  principle, and these Respondents would repudiate it. 
17  They no longer seriously argue that Cheryl Perich was 
18  not a minister.  Instead, they argue that even people 
19  who are indisputably ministers can sue their churches on 
20
21  performance, and the rules of ministry.  They would --
22
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Laycock, would you 
23  clarify one point?  You say the church decides who's 
24  qualified to be a minister, but, as I understand the 
25

facts here, she was never decommissioned as a minister, 

claims that turn on their qualifications, their job 

removing officers of the church.  That's a bedrock

because the church was holding her out as being 

synod.  And if you look at that recommendation -- it's 
in the joint appendix -- it is not much of a 
recommendation.  There's excellent, commendable, 
proficient, and in ministry qualities, she gets 
proficient.  We all know if there's a 5, a 4, and a 3, a 
3 isn't very good. 

1  and, beyond that, she was even recommended by the
 
2  officials to other parishes to be a commissioned
 
3  minister.  So, it's -- it's odd to say there's any
 
4  interferences with who is qualified to be a minister,
 
5
6  qualified. 
7
 MR. LAYCOCK:  Well, she was removed from her 
8  ministry at Hosanna-Tabor.  They do not have to indulge 
9  in a vendetta against her and file charges with the

11

14 
15
16
17  simply weren't pursuing formal charges against her 
18  before the -- before the Missouri Synod.  And -- and the 
19  problems they had were most severe at Hosanna-Tabor.  In 
another congregation that didn't know this history, she 
20
21  might have been able to be effective again.  That was 
22  for them to decide.  They make their own calls. 
23
24  was where the problem was.
25

 So, they were not recommending her; they 

 But she was removed at Hosanna-Tabor, which

children.  Regardless of whether it's a religious belief 
or not, doesn't society have a right at some point to 
say certain conduct is unacceptable, even if religious 
-- smoking peyote?  And once we say that's unacceptable, 
can and why shouldn't we protect the people who are 
doing what the law requires, i.e., reporting it? 

1  circuits have recognized a ministerial exception.  But 
2  they've, in one form or another, created a pretext 
3  exception.  The reason for that is the situation that 
4  troubles me.  How about a teacher who reports sexual 
abuse to the government and is fired because of that 
5
6  reporting? 
7
 Now, we know from the news recently that 
8  there was a church whose religious beliefs centered 
9  around sexually exploiting women and, I believe, 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 So, how do we deal with that situation under 
17  your theory?  Under your theory, nothing survives if the 
18  individual is a minister, no claim, private claim. 
19
20
21  pretext inquiries for ministers.  The case you present 
22  is obviously a difficult case, and I would say two 
23  things:  We think the appropriate rule should be the 
24  government could do many things to force reporting, to 
penalize people who don't report, but a discharge claim 
25

 MR. LAYCOCK:  I think if you look at the 

court of appeals cases, they have not indulged in 

5

 MR. LAYCOCK:  I understand that concern, and 
that was my second point, that if you want to carve out 

1  by a minister presents the question why she was 
2  discharged, and the court should stay out of that. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem with that is 
3
4  that it doesn't take account of the societal interest in 
encouraging the reporting.  And, in fact, if we -- if we 
5
6  define the ministerial exception in the way you want, we 
7  take away the incentive for reporting; we actually do 
8  the opposite of what society needs. 
9
10
11  an exception for cases like child abuse where the 
12  government's interest is in protecting the child, not an 
13  interest in protecting the minister, when you get such a 
14  case, we think you could carve out that exception.
15
16  theoretical framework for this. 
17
18  identify the government's interest in regulation.  If 
19  the government's interest is in protecting ministers 
20
21  the ministerial exception. 
22
23  quite different from that, like protecting the children, 
24  then you can assess whether that government interest is 
sufficiently compelling to justify interfering with the 
25

from discrimination, we are squarely within the heart of 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How?  Give me a 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  The -- first you have to 

 If the government's interest is something

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Laycock, the ministerial 

1  relationship between the church and its ministers.  But 
2  the government's interest is at its nadir when the claim 
3  is:  We want to protect these ministers as such.  We 
4  want to tell the churches what criteria they should 
apply for -- for selecting and removing ministers. 
5
6
7  exception is not something new.  It has been widely 
8  recognized, as Justice Sotomayor mentioned, by the 
9  courts of appeals going back 40 years.  So, we can see 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  any such case.  The one case I am aware of cuts the 
other way.  A minister, a priest accused of sexually 
20
21  abusing children who was fired, sued to get his job 
22  back, and the church invoked the ministerial exception, 
23  and that case ended.  They were able to get rid of him. 
24
 There is a cert petition pending in which a 
25

how the recognition of this exception within -- with 
certain contours has worked out.  And how has it worked 
out over those past 40 years?  Have there been a great 
many cases, a significant number of cases, involving the 
kinds of things that Justice Sotomayor is certainly 
rightly concerned about, instances in which ministers 
have been fired for reporting criminal violations and 
that sort of thing? 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  The only -- I'm not aware of 

teacher with a long series of problems in her school

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But here what we have is a 

had them come interview a student without any 

1  called the police about an allegation of sexual abuse 
2  that did not happen at the school, did not involve a 
3  student of the school, did not involve a parent at the 
4  school, someplace else; and -- and called the police and 
5
6  communication with -- with her principal.  And the 
7  respondents tried to spin that as a case of discharge 
8  for reporting sexual abuse.  But if you look at the 
9  facts, it's really quite different.  And those are the 
only two cases I'm aware of that even approach touching 
10
11  on this problem. 
12
13  claim of retaliation, so that she can't even get a 
14  hearing.  So, we can look at the various tests that are 
proposed here, and I think it's difficult to formulate 
15
16  the tests, but this can't even be -- be litigated 
17  because she is discharged.  The allegation is that 
18  there's a retaliation for even asking for a hearing 
19  where these tests could -- could be applied.
20
21  in civil court.  She could have had a hearing in the 
22  synod before decisionmakers who would have been 
23  independent of the local church.  This Court has 
24  repeatedly said churches can create tribunals for the

the exemption --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's almost like a summary 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  Well, it's an argument we make 

in the hearing on whether the ministerial exception

1
2  be an argument you could make in the -- in the pretext 
3  hearing.

18  judgment. 
19
20
21  you didn't allow me to go to the agency to have a proper 
22  test applied.  The summary judgment was just an analogy. 
23  Forget it. 
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no, no.  What she is 
saying is that you basically gave me summary judgment; 

 (Laughter.)
 MR. LAYCOCK:  I'm not entirely sure I 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's the -- that's 

the analogy, I think. 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  It was a motion for summary 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  It was precisely a motion

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  I understand that.  But once 

you start to litigate these cases --

1  understand the question.  We agree she couldn't go to 
2  civil court if she's a minister.  She could have gone to 
3  the synod.  She wasn't cut off from that.  She decided 
4  not to do it.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I'm saying if there 
5
6  are some substantial interests the church has that can 
7  be litigated in EEOC hearing.  She was fired simply for 
8  asking for a hearing. 
9
10
11
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think your point is that 
12  it's -- it's none of the business of the government to 
13  decide what the substantial interest of the church is. 
14
15
16  decisions are committed to the churches by separation of 
17  church and state, but -- but beyond that, once the --
18  this process of trying to identify, we can decide some 
19  issues in this case and we won't get to other issues in 
20

22  finely spun distinctions that create entanglement rather

referred to the ministerial exception, but, of course, 

this case doesn't work.  As Justice Breyer said in a

the most important of my points.  These -- these 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, you 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's say it's 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  Right.  Here I think it's very 
easy.  She's a commissioned minister in the church.  She 

leads the class in grace before lunch.  Is that somebody 
who would be covered by the ministerial exception? 

1  your position extends beyond ministers.  How do we --
2  how do we decide who's covered by the ministerial 
3  exception and who is not? 
4
5
6  holds ecclesiastical office.  She teaches the religion 
7  class. 
8
9  a teacher who teaches only purely secular subjects but 
10
11 
12
13  that person is not covered.  And we are not challenging 
14  that rule.  Obviously, there has to be some kind of 
quantitative threshold.  There will be line-drawing 
15
16  problems.  But --
17
18  position would be if she's a commissioned minister, as 
19  distinguished from a teacher who conducts grace or takes 
20
21  asking for somebody in this -- that you categorize as a 
22  minister, although mostly she's a math teacher.  You 
23  would say the extent of her religious duties don't 
24  matter; what counts is that she is commissioned as a 
25

minister.

 MR. LAYCOCK:  The lower courts have said 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought your

 MR. LAYCOCK:  If she's commissioned as a

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can we try whether it's a 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is a sham different from a 

1
2  minister and if that is not a sham, then we think that 
3  makes her a minister.  If you have a Jesuit teaching 
4  physics, we think he is still a priest.  And he's still 
5
6
7  sham?  I thought you said we couldn't try whether it's a 
8  sham. 
9
10
11 
12
13
14  something different from a pretext.  A sham is more 
extreme, and it goes to a different point in the 
15
16  analysis.  You can decide whether she's really a 
17  minister.  That's the threshold question that courts 
18  must decide.  And if we have a person with a ministerial 
19  title who is doing nothing at all religious or 
20
21  who ever worked for us or ever may is a minister, the 
22  courts can deal with those cases if they --
23
24  the government courts to probe behind the church's 
25

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. LAYCOCK:  Well, I -- I certainly meant 

ministerial, we have a church that tries to say everyone 

pretext? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, you would allow the --

assertion that this person is a minister?  You would 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  That's right.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, different 

1  allow that, right?  But once it is determined that the 
2  person is a minister, you would not allow the government 
3  to decide whether the firing was a pretext? 
4
5
6  churches have different ideas about who's a minister. 
7  There are some churches who think all of our adherents 
8  are ministers of our faith.  Now, does that mean that 
9  everybody who's a member of that church qualifies as a 
minister because that is part of the church's belief? 
10
11
 MR. LAYCOCK:  I don't -- I don't think it 
12  means that.  And, again, I -- I think courts have some 
13  capacity to look at what this employee is actually 
14  doing, and if he's not performing any of the functions 
of a religious leader, if he's not teaching the faith, 
15
16  then --
17
18  adherents stands as a witness to our beliefs.  And 
19  that -- you know, not every church is hierarchical in 
20
21
 MR. LAYCOCK:  I understand that.  And lay 
22  people in many churches are expected to be witnesses, 
23  right.  So --
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Every one of our 

terms of different offices. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Lay people in many --
MR. LAYCOCK:  Lay people have to be

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the answer you gave to 

full-time ministers at all.  They're all ministers. 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  Right. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you said, well, that 

1  witnesses.  The fact that you're expected to witness to 
2  the faith when the occasion arises doesn't make you --
3  doesn't make you a minister. 
4
the Chief Justice seems to me to be this case.  I was 
5
6  interested.  I didn't know about this -- this minister 
7  capacity in this particular church.  And as the Chief 
8  Justice indicates, many churches don't have -- some 
9  churches don't have what we think of as professional or 
10
11
12
13  -- that can be litigated, that can be investigated.  And 
14  I suppose when we do that we say, how many secular 
15
16  But you don't -- you don't even want that issue to be 
17  tried.  You say that issue can't even be explored. 
 MR. LAYCOCK:  How -- you know, how many 
18
19  religious functions you perform can be explored.  The 
20
21  We think she clearly is.  The issue --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that term is a legal 
22
23  term.  What constitutes a minister is -- is decided by 
24  the law, not by the church, right?
25

functions do you perform?  And that's what this case is. 

issue that can be explored is whether she's a minister. 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  That is correct.

it's not true.  You decided the Tony Alamo case 20 years

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What makes it not true? 

That you have to lead the congregation in their

14  What is the legal definition of "minister"?  What is it?

18  you teach the doctrines of the faith, if that is part of 
19  your job responsibilities, to teach the doctrines of the

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, does that mean that 
22  any religious teacher is a minister under your theory?

not ordained or commissioned in any way as ministers.

faith, we think you're a minister. 

15

 MR. LAYCOCK:  If you're ordained or 

we think you ought to be within this rule. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that it was 

1  Are they ministers? 
2
3  commissioned, that makes it very easy.  If you teach the 
4  religion class, you teach an entire class on religion, 
5
6
7  part of -- it was agreed that there was no fact dispute 
8  that what she did, her duties at the school, did not 
9  change from when she was a contract teacher, and 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  Circuit said.  What they -- what -- you know, I don't 
19  think that changes the nature of the functions that were 
being performed.  But what's relevant to that, that they 
20
21  neglected was these noncommissioned -- these teachers 
22  who were not commissioned ministers, the lay and 
23  contract teachers, were fill-ins only when no called 
24  teacher was available, and Perich identifies only one 
25

therefore not a minister, and then she takes courses and 
is qualified to become a minister, but what she's doing 
at the school is the very same thing.  And I thought 
that was the basis for the -- the decision that we're 
reviewing, that there was no difference at all in what 
she did before she was commissioned and after she was 
commissioned. 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  That -- that's what the Sixth

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  While Justice Ginsburg is 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  Well, it doesn't --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And again, that's 

something that -- that can be heard.  You don't even 
want to hear it. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you're isolating one 
1
2  parish, but there was something in one of these briefs 
3  that said the majority of the teachers in the Lutheran 
4  schools -- let's see where it was.  I think it was --
5
6  looking, I had -- I had the same impression, that 
7  whether you're commissioned or not commissioned doesn't 
8  necessarily mean you can't teach a religious class. 
9
10
11 
12 
13
14  even with ordained ministers, it's not uncommon among 
15
16  denomination that has similar teachings.  So, when --
17  when they can't find a called minister to cover a class 
18  and they hire another Christian from another 
19  conservative Protestant denomination, they say:  While 
20

24  Protestant teachers that's not Lutheran led the

said --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but that was the 

1  saying that the law must recognize that lay teacher as a 
2  minister and apply the ministerial exception, even 
3  though the religion doesn't consider her a minister? 
 MR. LAYCOCK:  I -- I didn't say that.  I 
4
5
6
7  answer you gave.  If she taught a religious class --
 MR. LAYCOCK:  If she teaches a religion 
8
9  class, not if she merely leads a prayer.
10
11  definition of "minister"?  Maybe we need to find out. 
12  So, it's not a title.  It's really -- the only 
13  function -- you're saying anyone who teaches religion? 
14
religion class, you're clearly a minister.  But if you 
15
16  are -- if you hold an ecclesiastical office, that makes 
17  this a very easy --
18
19  saying a fortiori, but basically you'd be here anyway 
20
21
22
23
24  is your reaction to a less dramatic kind of holding? 
25

principle, and it says a religious organization like

decide:  That's true, but there's no evidence here at 
all that religious tenets had anything to do with her 
being dismissed.  No one mentioned them.  She didn't 
know about them.  I didn't until I read the very 
excellent brief filed by the Lutherans that explained 
the nature of taking civil suits.  No one said that to 
her, whether it was in someone's mind or not.  She found 
out on motion for summary judgment.  So, therefore, this 
wasn't an effort by the religious organization to 
express its tenets.  She was dismissed.

 What are your objections to that? 
 MR. LAYCOCK:  Well, my first objection is I 

don't think those are remotely the facts here.  You

say, because -- because of insubordination and because

2  motivation here is due to our religious tenet?

 MR. LAYCOCK:  You don't assess the 
4  importance of a doctrine by asking the person --
5
6  But I went on a different piece of -- matter, that the 
7  people who were involved in this were doing it for 
8  religious rather than civil reasons.  I'm just wondering 
9  what the evidence is that they knew there was such a 
doctrine, that they were motivated by the religious 
10
11 
doctrine, and that they expressed that to her.  I 
just -- I'll look at page 55.  Is there anything else I

should look at?

24  rule.

 MR. LAYCOCK:  The principal --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it -- is it in the 
handbook?  I mean, one of the objections -- if this --
if this is a rule that's going to bind the teachers, 
then you would expect to find it in the handbook.  But 
the handbook doesn't tell her, if you complain to the 
EEOC about discrimination, then you will be fired.

17  suits that could be brought that would not be

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought the reason

 Why -- I don't follow why the tort claim

3  don't think that the job duties of a particular 
4  religious employee in an organization are relevant to

 MS. KRUGER:  Well, Justice Scalia, if I may,

argument to have disputed this basic point, which is 
15
16  that the contours of the First Amendment doctrine at 
17  issue here will depend on a balancing of interests. 
18  That is the only way, I think, that Petitioner can 
19  differentiate a generally neutrally applicable 
20
21  church's choice of those who would govern it and a 
22  church's retaliation against a teacher who would report 
23  child abuse to the authorities.

of interests is different, according to the Petitioner,

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, do you dispute the 
18
19  proposition that one of the central concerns of the 
20
21  choosing ministers?  When there was an established 
22  church, the government chose the ministers or had a say 
23  in choosing the ministers.  And the Establishment 
24  Clause, many argue, was centrally focused on eliminating 
25

certain relationships within a religious community that 
are so fundamental, so private and ecclesiastical in 
nature, that it will take an extraordinarily compelling 
governmental interest to justify interference.  Concerns 
with health or safety, for example.  But the 
government's general interest in eradicating 
discrimination in the workplace will not be sufficient 
to justify the burden. 

Establishment Clause was preventing the government from 

that governmental power.  Now, do you dispute that?

actions of all kinds.  All right?  So, would that not be 
protected by the First Amendment?

2  doctrine.  Their submission is that the hiring and 
3  firing decisions with respect to parochial school 
4  teachers and with respect to priests is categorically 
off limits.  And we think that that is a rule that is
 
5
6  insufficiently attentive to the relative public and
 
7  private interests at stake, interests that this Court
 
8  has repeatedly recognized are important in
 
9  determining freedom of association claims.

12  Catholic Church and say they have to be women.  I mean, 
13  you couldn't say that.  That's obvious.  So, how are you 
14  distinguishing this?
15
16  both the private and public interests are very different 
17  in the two scenarios.  The government's general interest 
18  in eradicating discrimination in the workplace is simply 
19  not sufficient to justify changing the way that the 
Catholic Church chooses its priests based on gender

24  Lutheran Church when it says that this is an important 
25

dictating to the church-operated school who it may 
choose to teach religion classes and who it may not.  It 
is one thing and one thing only, which is to tell the 
school that it may not punish its employees for 
threatening to report civil wrongs to civil authorities. 
That is an interest that we think overrides the burden 
on the association's religious message about the virtues 
of internal dispute resolution as opposed to court 
resolution. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, you're making --

you're making a judgment about how important a 

and central tenet of our faith.

3  it's an important tenet, we assume its validity, we 
4  assume that they are sincere in that religious belief. 
But just as in United States v. Lee, that sincere 
5
6  religious belief was not sufficient to warrant an 
7  exemption from generally applicable tax laws, as in Bob 
8  Jones, or --
9
10
11  should be male only -- you do defer to that, even if the 
12  Lutherans say, look, our dispute resolution belief is 
13  just as important to a Lutheran as the all-male clergy 
14  is to a Catholic.
15
16  balance of relative public and private interests is 
17  different in each case. 
18
19  that a church has a right that's grounded in the Free 
20
21  institutional autonomy with respect to its employees? 
 MS. KRUGER:  We don't see that line of 
22
23  church autonomy principles in the Religion Clause 
24  jurisprudence as such.  We see it as a question of 
freedom of association.  We think that this case is 
25

Exercise Clause and/or the Establishment Clause to 

 MS. KRUGER:  Yes.  But that's because the

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, this is to go back to
 

been referring to when it referred to free association 
claims that are reinforced by free exercise concerns. 
It's certainly true that the association's claim to 
autonomy in this case is one that is deeply rooted.  And 
concerns about how it exercises its religion -- those 
two things merge in some ways in that respect.  But --

1  perhaps one of the cases --
2
3  Justice Scalia's question, because I too find that
 
4  amazing, that you think that the Free -- neither the
 
Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause has 
5
6  anything to say about a church's relationship with its 
7  own employees. 
 MS. KRUGER:  We think that this is one of 
8
9  the cases that Employment Division v. Smith may have 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  all.  Smith didn't involve employment by a church.  It 
18  had nothing to do with who the church could employ.  I 
19  don't -- I don't see how that has any relevance to this.
 I would -- I didn't understand your answer 
20
21  to the Chief Justice's question.  You -- you say that 
22  there were different institutional values or government 
23  values involved with respect to a -- to a Catholic 
24  priest than there is with respect to this Lutheran 
25

minister.  Let's assume that a Catholic priest is -- is

Justice Scalia --

 MS. KRUGER:  -- but that is the --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is that any different 

1  removed from his duties because he married, okay? 
2  And -- and he claims:  No, that's not the real reason; 
3  the real reason is because I threatened to sue the 
4  church.  Okay?  So, that reason is just pretextual.
5
6  to go -- go into the -- into the dismissal of the 
7  Catholic priest to see whether indeed it -- it was 
8  pretextual? 
9
10
11
12
13
14  from the Lutheran minister?
 MS. KRUGER:  I would begin with looking at 
15
16  the burdens on association under the balancing test.  I 
17  think that the core of the understanding of the 
18  ministerial exception, as it was elaborated in the lower 
19  courts, is that there is a fundamental difference 
between governmental regulation that operates to 
20
21  interfere with the relationship between a church and 
22  those who would govern it, those who would preach the 
23  word to the congregations, those who would administer 
24  its sacraments, on the one hand, and the more public 
25

relationship between a church and a school teacher and

 MS. KRUGER:  I don't think it's a question

1  others that provide services to the public at large. 
2
3  nothing different than what the Chief Justice suggests, 
4  that you think the one is more -- is more important to 
5
6
7  of the importance of either function to the -- the 
8  religious association.  It's a question of the realm 
9  of permissible governmental regulation.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but then you have to 
10
11  say that it's more important to let people go to court 
12  to sue about sex discrimination than it is for a woman 
13  to get a job.  I can't say that one way or the other. 
14  So -- so, I'm stuck.
 And since I'm really -- this is tough and 
15
16  I'm stuck on this, I don't see how you can avoid going 
17  into religion to some degree.  You have to decide if 
18  this is really a minister, for example, and what kind of 
19  minister.  That gets you right involved.  Or if you're 
not going to do that, you're going to go look to see 
20
21  what are their religious tenets?  And that gets you 
22  right involved. 
23
24  something -- of getting out of the whole thing.  I don't 
see how to do it.  So, suppose you said in case of doubt 
25

 I just can't see a way of getting out of

1  like that, we'll try what Congress suggested.  And now 
2  we have here a borderline case of ministry, not the 
3  heartland case.  So, you say, all right, where you have 
4  a borderline case the constitutional issue goes away, 
and what Congress said is okay.  So, now what you have 
5
6  to prove is you have to prove that -- the church has to 
7  show that the applicant was disciplined, or whatever, 
8  because she didn't conform to the religious tenets.  All 
9  right?  That's what they have to show.
 And I'm sorry; they maybe only make a prima 
10
11  facie case, but they got to show it, and if they don't 
12  show that there was at least some evidence to that 
13  effect and that somebody knew about the religious tenet 
14  and there was something like that -- maybe it's in the 
air, as is obvious with Justice Alito's question, but 
15
16  where it isn't in the air, you'd have to make a showing. 
17
18  but I don't see how you avoid an interference someplace 
19  or the other.  Otherwise, you're going to get into who 
20
21
22  the moment I'm making an argument for following what 
23  Congress said, go back and try it that way, and if they 
24  can show in this case and she shows in this case nobody 
25

ever thought of the religious tenet, nobody told me, 

 Now -- now, I see that's an interference, 

is a minister. 

 So, what's the answer to this dilemma?  At

that is a perfectly appropriate way to come at this 

1  they didn't read it, then she's going to win.  And if 
2  they come in and show that they really did this because 
3  of their religious tenet, they'll win.  What about that?

6  case, although it skips over sort of the initial 
7  inquiry, which is into whether or not the application of 
8  the regulation to the particular employment relationship 
9  results in an unwarranted interference.
10
11  virtue of deciding a statutory question before a tough 
12  constitutional question.  And I agree, with what we 
13  sometimes do, that seems bizarre, but I thought that was 
14  the basic rule.
15
16  right, Justice Breyer.  And I think the next question 
17  becomes, with respect to adjudicating a particular case, 
18  whether deciding the case would require the court to 
19  decide disputed matters of religious doctrine or to 
20
21
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if -- if the plaintiff

5
6  important this really is to Lutherans.  Is that how that 
7  would play out? 
8
9  out.
10
11  that?  I just don't see it. 
12
 MS. KRUGER:  Any inquiry into the validity 
13  of a particular religious doctrine is simply irrelevant 
14  to the adjudication of the dispute, which is designed to 
15
16
17  I've seen dozens and dozens and dozens of pretext cases, 
18  and in practically every pretext case that I've seen, 
19  one of the central issues is whether the reason that was 
20
21  important reason for that, for that employer, and 
22  whether they really think it's important and whether 
23  they apply it across the board.  That's almost always a 
24  big part of the case.
25

proffered by the employer is the real reason, is an

 Let me give you an example of a real case. 

1  get into questions of -- of religious doctrine.  I just 
2  don't see it. 
3
4  A nun wanted to be -- wanted a tenured position teaching 
canon law at Catholic University, and she claimed that 
5
6  she was denied tenure because of her -- because of her 
7  gender. 
 Now, there the university might argue, no, 
8
9  she was -- and did argue -- she's denied tenure because 
of the quality of her -- of her scholarship.  And, okay, 
10
11 
now, if you try that pretext issue, the issue is going 
to be what is the real quality of her canon law 
12 
13 
scholarship?  And you're going to have the judge and the 
jury decide whether the particular writings on canon law 
14 
are -- make a contribution to canon law scholarship. 
15
How can something like that be tried, without getting 
16 
17 
into religious issues? 
18
19  plaintiff has to show that that may not have been the 
employer's real reason was a subjective judgment about 
20
21  the quality of canon law scholarship, then judgment has 
22  to be entered for the employer, because the plaintiff 
23  has no viable way, consistent with the Establishment 
24  Clause, of demonstrating that wasn't the employer's real

 If, on the other hand, the plaintiff has 

those roles were not ones that were required to be

2  evidence that no one ever raised any objections to the 
3  quality of her scholarship, but they raised objections 
4  to women serving in certain roles in the school, and 
5
6  filled by persons of a particular gender, consistent 
7  with religious beliefs, then that's a case in which a 
8  judge can instruct a jury that it's job is not to 
9  inquire into the validity of the subjective judgment, 
just as juries are often instructed that their job is

was fair or correct, but only whether the employer was

22
23  satisfactory test is that it fails to take account of 
24  the important governmental interests -- for example, in 
this case -- in having everyone have access to the -- to

a lot of secular duties, whether the person has

in the section defining defenses.  The defenses are part 
of the right, and when it forbids retaliation, it says 
forbids retaliation against an individual for the 
exercise of any right granted.

1

 MR. DELLINGER:  No, it doesn't and the
 

reason is --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not? 
 MR. DELLINGER:  -- that there is -- and that 

1  is a constitutional matter.  The state's interest in
 
2  allowing citizens to have access to its courts and to
 
3  its agencies is paramount in cases like child abuse,
 
4  reporting of school safety problems, and others.  In

7  Would you -- take the firing of the Catholic priest
 
8  example.  Does that get into the courts?
 
9
10
11
12
13  points out, Justice Scalia, that there are ample 
14  doctrines to protect church autonomy.  One is that under 
the Establishment Clause, there can be no reinstatement 
15
16  ordered by a court of someone to an ecclesiastical 
17  position.  Another mentioned by General Kruger is 
18  that --

University.  Those doctrines still stand. 

 The problem with the -- this categorical 

to make a report to the EEOC.  And she's not seeking 
reinstatement.  She just wants the economic loss. 
There's no need --

 MR. DELLINGER:  I think, in that case, that 
1
2  that is very likely to fail because you're going to run 
3  into (a) issues of religious doctrine or evaluations of 
4  distinctly religious matters, like EEOC v. Catholic 
5
6
7  exception is it sweeps in cases like this one, where the 
8  well-pleaded complaint in this case simply says, I was 
9  dismissed from my employment because I said I was going 
10
11 
12 
13
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if I could just come 
14  back to the example of the canon law professor, because 
I still don't see how the -- the approach that the 
15
16  Solicitor General is recognizing -- is recommending 
17  could -- can eliminate the problems involved in pretext. 
18  So, the -- as I understood her -- her answer, it was 
19  that you couldn't look into the question of whether the 
professor's canon law scholarship was really good canon 
20
21  law scholarship, but you could try the issue of sex 
22  discrimination based on other evidence.  So, maybe 
23  there's some stray remarks here and there about a woman

8  is unique to ministerial employees, which is why this is 
9  both over- and under-inclusive.  When you -- this is a 
circumstance in which an organization is going into the 
10
11 
public arena providing a public service, and in that 
situation, it ought to be governed by the same rules --
12 
13 
Justice Scalia, you said this case is not like 
Employment Division v. Smith, but under Employment 
14 
Division v. Smith, we know that the State could forbid a 
15
school from -- a religious school from using peyote in 
16 
17 
its ceremonies, but under Petitioner's submission, they 
could fire any employee who reported that use of peyote 
18 
to civil authorities, and that employee would have no 
19 
recourse. 
20
21
 We know that under U.S. v. Lee, an Amish 
22  employer has to comply with the Social Security laws, 
23  but under their submission, the employer could fire 
24  without recourse any employee who called noncompliance

 Thank you.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. 

1  in your opinion in Smith and in Justice Kennedy's 
2  opinion in Rosenberger the value of neutrality where you 
3  have doctrines, as we recognize you do not second-guess 
4  religious doctrine.  You do not under the Establishment 
Clause introduce someone into an ecclesiastical office, 
5
6  and you do a balancing test to make sure that there's a 
7  sufficient governmental interest, if you're going to 
8  undercut an organization's ability to convey its views.

13
14
15
16  briefly:  The many distinctions and balancing tests in 
17  their argument show the mess you will be in if you try 
18  to decide these cases.  And we may have a line-drawing 
19  problem at the margin, but many, many cases are easy. 
The priest, the rabbi, the bishop, the pastor of the 
20
21  congregation cannot sue.  Under their rule, they can 
22  sue --
23
24  sure why the status of the individual matters under your 
25

theory.  It seems to me what you're saying is, so long

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. LAYCOCK:  Two or three points very 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  No. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So, why is 

1  as a religious organization gives a religious reason of 
2  any kind, genuine or not, for firing someone that's 
3  associated with it, whether minister or not, that that 
4  invokes the exception.  Am I hearing your argument 
5
6
7
8  there a difference? 
 MR. LAYCOCK:  The position of minister is 
9
categorically special because that is committed to the 
10
11  church in the system of separation of church and state. 
12  You may have religious questions when they dismiss the 
13  janitor, but the level of sensitivity is not remotely 
14  the same.  And -- and --
15
16 
17
18  pretext question.  Yes. 
19
20
21  "minister" for me again. 
22
23  holds ecclesiastical office in the church or who 
24  exercises important religious functions, most obviously 
25

janitors, you can get into the pretext question. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, you're limiting your 

test to whether that person is a minister.  So, define 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, you would say with 

 MR. LAYCOCK:  The janitor can litigate his

 MR. LAYCOCK:  It's not that institutions are 

in order to make an argument for the ministerial 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Laycock, Mr.  Dellinger 
1
2  has some -- some points here about the way in which the 
3  ministerial exception relates or doesn't relate to 
4  Employment Division v. Smith.  And it seems to me that 
5
6  exception, you in some sense have to say that 
7  institutional autonomy is different from individual 
8  conscience, that we've said in Smith that state 
9  interests can trump individual conscience.  And you want 
us to say that they can't trump institutional autonomy. 
10
11 
So, why is that? 
12
13  different from individuals.  It is that the 
14  institutional governance of the church is at a prior 
step.  Smith is about whether people can act on their 
15
16  religious teachings after they're formulated.  The 
17  selection of ministers is about the process by which 
18  those religious teachings will be formulated. 
19  Smith distinguishes those cases --
20
21 
22
23  well, that --
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- which applies to 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Might not the Establishment 

Clause have something to do with that question --
