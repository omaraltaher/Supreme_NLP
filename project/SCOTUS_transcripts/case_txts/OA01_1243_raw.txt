JUSTICE STEVENS:  The Court will hear argument


in Borden Ranch against the Corps of Engineers, No. 1243.


Mr. Bishop, you may proceed.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. BISHOP:  Justice Stevens, and may it please


the Court:


The Army Corps of Engineers has a considerable


number of hurdles to clear before it may regulate activity


as a discharge under section 404.  Congress specified in


section 404 that a permit is required for an activity that


is an addition of a pollutant to a navigable water.  That


addition -- that added pollutant must be in the form of 

fill material or dredged material.  And the addition must


come from a point source. 


Those statutory terms, we believe, have a core


of plain meaning that excludes a farmer and rancher, deep


plowing in a seasonal wetland, to prepare the soil for


deep-rooted crops.  A deep plowing of that sort does not


add fill material or dredged material, and it doesn't


involve a point source.  And so it --


QUESTION:  Well, did -- did the district court


here find that the deep ripping tracked material into

wetland areas from the adjacent uplands?


MR. BISHOP:  Only as to 3 of the 30-odd wetlands


that are involved. 


QUESTION:  And as to those three?


MR. BISHOP:  And that -- that is not -- and that


was not the basis of the judgment below or of the penalty.


In the summary judgment ruling, the court found,


as a matter of law, that plowing that moved material that


was already in the wetland -- and this is page 36 of the


petition appendix -- was a violation.  When it came to


hearing evidence, for that reason the court did not focus


on the question of whether material was added to the


wetland, as the Government says, from -- from outside.


The penalty in this case was based on 358 rips,


passes, of the plow across the wetlands.  The court did


not distinguish, in any of those cases, as between passes


that brought outside material into the wetland and those


that didn't.  It simply was not a focus. 


This was not the basis of the Government's


argument below.  This is entirely novel.  It wasn't the


basis of the district court's decision in this case.  It


wasn't the basis of the court of appeals decision, if you


look at page 6 of the court of appeals decision.


Furthermore, we believe that --


QUESTION:  Even so, if we agreed that that's a

proper basis --


MR. BISHOP:  That would not be a basis on which


you could affirm here because that was not --


QUESTION:  But we'd have to -- we'd have to


remand for that to be considered?


MR. BISHOP:  And we believe that a remand that


focused on that issue would show, first of all, that there


were on some occasions a minimal amount of material that


was moved into the edge of the wetland, just on some


occasions, a minimal amount that would be well below the


amount of fill that would have fitted at that time with on


the -- under the nationwide permit so that no individual


permit would be required in this case. 


It would also show that the -- that the deep


plow was raised on many occasions before the -- it moved 

from upland into wetland, and there's an example of that


described at page 71 of the petition appendix. 


And finally, on page 3 of our reply brief, we


cite a California Ag Extension pamphlet which describes in


great detail the nature of the soils and the plowing in


this area, and what it -- what it describes is that when a


deep plow passes through this sort of clay soil and it


then rains, that the -- that the -- the clay pan seals up


again and that because of the -- the nature of the clay


pan, there really is no homogenization during the plowing

process between the soils above and below the pan.


QUESTION:  What -- what is the relevance of


that?  That is, I'm thinking of --


MR. BISHOP:  Well, the Government is --


QUESTION:  Let me explain how I'm thinking of


this case.  Suppose that you went in the middle of Lake


Erie with a big punch, and you punched a hole in the


bottom and all the water ran out.  Would that violate this


act?


rivers --


MR. BISHOP:  No.


QUESTION:  No. 


MR. BISHOP:  That would regulated under the


QUESTION:  Okay, it wouldn't violate the act.


There's nothing.  All right. 


Now suppose you went to Lake Erie and you had


about 1,000 dump trucks or great big rakes and you filled


up Lake Erie.  Would that violate the act?


MR. BISHOP:  That would fall under section 404.


QUESTION:  Absolutely, okay.  So now what you


have is you punch a hole in the bottom and you bring some


dirt in.  All right?  So -- so --


MR. BISHOP:  We bring no --


QUESTION:  -- you brought in some dirt and you


punched the hole.  Now --

 MR. BISHOP:  We bring -- we bring a little dirt


in at the margin. 


QUESTION:  So your argument is because you only


brought a little dirt and you were mostly interested in


punching the hole, you fall outside the act.


MR. BISHOP:  That's right.  And that --


QUESTION:  That's it.  Okay.  Well, I don't know


if we're interested in the purpose of the act and you


violate it even a little bit, why don't you lose?


MR. BISHOP:  No, no.  Well, the purpose of the


-- no.  The purpose of the act, Justice Breyer -- there


are multiple purposes of this act, but the purpose to


preserve the Nation's waterways is achieved through a -- a


dual or perhaps a tripartite process.  There is a section


402 NPDES permit that is regulated by the Federal 

Government.  There is a section 404 fill and dredge


authority that is -- is -- that is handled by the U.S.


Army Corps of Engineers.  But that is only part of the


picture. 


The Government through -- the -- the Congress


through section 208 set up a process which is mainly


administered through the States, although with


considerable Federal assistance, for -- for regulating


nonpoint source pollution.  If this activity, this plowing


activity, is not regulated under section 404, it is,

nevertheless, regulated by the States as nonpoint source


pollution. 


And so the goal of the act to -- to protect the


Nation's waters is not one that depends on the Federal


Government, and in fact, we think here that to give a


broad reading to the powers of the Army Corps of Engineer


under section 404 by straining these very -- these --


these terms, these series of terms that Congress


predicated section 404 jurisdiction on, that that would


contravene Congress' other goal in section 101(b) which is


to preserve and protect the primary responsibilities and


rights of the States. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Bishop, will you explain


something to me?  And -- and -- on a most basic level, if


what the concern was it was to preserve wetlands and not 

have them converted into dry lands, what difference should


it make if the conversion comes about through redeposit,


shaking all the stuff up, turning it upside down, but what


you're ending up with is dry land rather than wetland, or


if you take a little sludge from someplace else and put it


there? 


MR. BISHOP:  We don't think it's permissible,


Justice Ginsburg, to protect wetlands by ignoring the


plain language of the statute because Congress, through


using the terms that it did, imposed limits on Federal

power that preserve and protect, as 101(b) says, the power


of the States to regulate nonpoint source pollution.  And


so this --


QUESTION:  So when you say --


MR. BISHOP:  -- so it --


QUESTION:  -- you say, well, nonpoint is --


that's another issue, whether this is a point source,


whether the --


MR. BISHOP:  We don't believe this is a point


source.  We don't believe it involves fill material --


QUESTION:  But that's -- that's another issue --


MR. BISHOP:  -- or dredged material. 


QUESTION:  -- than whether -- I thought you were


saying this is a redeposit of the same material. 


Therefore, it can't come under the act. 

MR. BISHOP:  It's -- it's a redeposit of the


material.  Therefore it is not an addition --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. BISHOP:  -- of material to the wetland.


QUESTION:  Is there any redeposit that could be?


MR. BISHOP:  Well, the -- the -- Judge Silberman


in the National Mining case said that the terms addition


in section 404 and also the concept that a 404 permit is


for the -- is for the deposit of material to a specified


disposal site, that read together, those show that

Congress intended that there be a geographic or temporal


separation between the dredging activity or where the


material comes from and where it is deposited.  So, you


know, if a bulldozer digs up large quantities of material


from one side of a wetland and moves them to another, you


know, perhaps it is reasonable for the agency in a


circumstance like that to say that there has been an


addition. 


Even in a case like Deaton, where you have


dredging, the dredging takes soil out of the wetland.  At


that point it becomes a defined pollutant under section


404 which is dredged spoil, something that Congress said


was a pollutant.  And if is that is sidecast, then, you


know, certainly there is far more movement of the soil and


far more disturbance of the soil in a situation like that. 

It's lifted out of the wetland and it is moved elsewhere.


But what we're dealing with here is a plow, a


deep plow, that goes through the soil and that pushes it


to the side and -- and moves it, but it stays in contact


with the soil all around it and it's simply moved in small


degrees. 


QUESTION:  Is there a difference between deep


ripping and deep plowing?


MR. BISHOP:  They're the same.  They're the same


thing, Justice O'Connor.  And -- and chiseling, which is

mentioned as a form of plowing in the regulations, is the


same thing too.  It's just -- it's exactly the same


implement. 


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what is the effect of


section 1344 which says nonprohibited discharge of dredged


or fill materials, that the discharge from normal farming


and activities such as plowing are not considered, I


guess, as --


MR. BISHOP:  Well, Justice O'Connor, our -- our


take on this case is that we never get to 404(f), that


this activity is not a discharge to begin with because it


doesn't satisfy the requirements set out in 404(a).  It is


not -- it does not involve a point source.  A plow is not


a point source.  This is not fill material.  It's not


dredged material.  It is not an addition.  Therefore, it


is not discharge.


QUESTION:  So, you think we never get there.


MR. BISHOP:  That's -- that's our argument. 


QUESTION:  But if we were to disagree with you,


because of this marginal shifting of soil from the uplands


to the wetland, then we'd have to look at that? 


MR. BISHOP:  If -- well, that would be -- that


would be an issue, but as I say, there's no finding as to


that sort of a -- that sort of an addition.  And I don't


believe -- Justice O'Connor, let me be clear that that --

the -- the movement of material into the margins of the


waters here would not be a discharge.  Even if it is an


addition, it still has to qualify as fill material and as


dredged material and as a point source.  And a plow simply


is none of those things, and I hope I get a chance to


explain why I don't think it's a point source.


QUESTION:  Why -- there's something called a


backhoe that has been labeled a point source and a


bulldozer that has been labeled.


MR. BISHOP:  Right. 


QUESTION:  Why not a ripper? 


MR. BISHOP:  Well, let me explain.  The language


of the statute is that a point source is a confined


conveyance, a confined, discrete conveyance.  And we do


not believe -- and if you look at -- and then are examples 

set -- set out in the statute.  And this is at 5a of the


addendum to the Government's brief, which is a little


easier to handle than our petition appendix.  A point


source is a discernible, confined, discrete conveyance. 


And then there are a series of examples. 


Now, the Government's regulations don't define


point source.  In fact, they don't even use point source. 


The -- the 404 regulations don't include the term, point


source, and they're not in the 1996 memorandum to the


field in which the -- the Government purported to explain

why deep plowing is covered by 404. 


But we think that these terms and these examples


show one important characteristic of a -- of a point


source, that it confines the material that it conveys.


QUESTION:  Why?  It doesn't -- I mean, why is a


truck?  Does a truck fall within it?  I mean --


MR. BISHOP:  A dump -- a dump --


QUESTION:  -- what I do is I have my truck.  I


fill it up with guck and I move the guck over to the lake


and I dump it in. 


MR. BISHOP:  A dump truck --


QUESTION:  Now, is the truck a point source? 


MR. BISHOP:  A dump truck confines the material


and it conveys it. 


QUESTION: 


Well, it doesn't say confined 

anywhere in the statute. 


MR. BISHOP:  Yes, it does. 


QUESTION:  Which word --


MR. BISHOP:  It says a discernible, confined,


and discrete --


QUESTION:  Not confining.  Not confining. 


QUESTION:  It's the conveyance that is confined,


not the material. 


MR. BISHOP:  Well, that's the Government's


theory, but --

 QUESTION:  Well, but isn't that what the plain

MR. BISHOP:  No, no. 


QUESTION:  It says confined conveyance, not


confining conveyance.


MR. BISHOP:  Well, I don't think that's right. 


I mean, first of all, the Government has never adopted


that -- it's just come up with that -- that argument for


the purposes of this litigation.  It's not in any


regulation. 


QUESTION:  Well, we're coming up with it now.


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  And it's a pretty darned good one


too. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BISHOP:  Well, I -- I don't think it is,


Justice Scalia, if you look at the examples that are --


are given because the characteristic of all of these


things is that they confine the material --


QUESTION:  Well, what is rolling stock?


MR. BISHOP:  It's defined in Webster's as -- as


the -- the trucks of a trucking company or --


QUESTION:  Fine.  So -- and it doesn't, however


-- suppose I have a brilliant idea.  Instead of a truck, I


will take a giant rake, 17 feet across, and rake the

mountain into Lake Superior.  All right.  Now, is -- is --


that doesn't fall within this just because I thought of


this brain storm of using this giant rake instead of a


truck? 


MR. BISHOP:  No.  I think the -- the common


sense question is, does this vehicle confine material. 


There are some --


QUESTION:  I would say the common sense question


is whether or not it's exactly the same for all intents


and purposes of this statute as a truck.


MR. BISHOP:  Well, but -- the -- there is a list


of examples --


QUESTION:  Well, isn't -- isn't your point


whether it's a conveyance?


MR. BISHOP: 


Well, that is another point. 

QUESTION:  The rake is a conveyance.  It is


meant to move the dirt down, and I suppose your point is


that the -- the plow is not intended to convey the dirt


anywhere except up and down.  Some of it may accidentally


go sideways, but that's not what the plow is for.


MR. BISHOP:  Well, I think that that is a very


useful term for us, conveyance.  Conveyance certainly


gives the idea of something that is intended to move


material from one place to another.  And a plow is not.  A


plow is intended --

 QUESTION:  Well, why -- why will not up and down

MR. BISHOP:  The -- because we're not -- I mean,


we're not in this business to convey a material anywhere. 


We're in this business --


QUESTION:  No.  That's not your purpose. 


QUESTION:  Isn't a plow a --


QUESTION:  That's not your purpose.  But that is


necessarily what you are doing by the activity that you


engage in, isn't it? 


MR. BISHOP:  Justice -- Justice Souter, I don't


think that in any normal use of the term conveyance that


you would include a rake or a plow that just pushes


material a short distance, perhaps a matter of inches or


feet.


QUESTION:  Well, let's -- let's assume that I --


I'm accepting Justice Breyer's suggestion and the rake


would be a -- would -- would be a point source here


because it conveyed.  If that is so, why should there be,


in effect, a -- a -- an excluding analysis for the -- for


the ripper that moves the stuff up and down?


MR. BISHOP:  Well, I mean, that's my argument,


Justice Souter.  I believe that the terms confined and


conveyance in the statute in their plain meaning and as


they are elucidated through all of these examples that are

given, that they all have characteristics in common.  One


is that they confine the material.  The other is that they


convey it.  And I don't believe that that is an apt


description of a plow shank, a 5-inch wide plow shank,


pulled through the soil and -- and the movement that --


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you could say that it


does convey.  It -- it conveys mostly, almost entirely, up


and down and maybe a little bit sideways.  But to the


extent that it does convey a lot up and down, which is its


purpose, it hasn't made any addition.  That would be your


point for the up and down. 


MR. BISHOP:  Well --


QUESTION:  But you're still stuck with the


sideways, it seems to me. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BISHOP:  Well, and we don't -- we don't


think that the -- the plowing here satisfies any of these


terms.  So we don't think that it's a point source, but


even if it is a point source, we certainly don't think


that it's an addition because there is no addition to the


wetland unless something is added.  And all we are doing


is moving soil, be it up or down or sideways, small -- to


small degrees.  And that doesn't -- nothing is coming into


the wetland from the outside. 


QUESTION:  Well, isn't --

 QUESTION:  -- the argument that -- that it's a


-- it's not adding material.  No new material is added,


but as I take the Government's argument, it's converting


something that wasn't a pollutant into a pollutant when 


this deep ripper churns up the earth and deposits the


rocks and the soil and the biological material on the top.


MR. BISHOP:  Justice Ginsburg, the -- the


statute, section 404, applies to two types of pollutant


only, and that's fill material and dredged material. 


Dredged material is material that is dredged out of the


soil, the sort of thing that a backhoe does, dredging a


hole and lifting it up out of the soil.  The agency's


regulations define dredged material as material that is


excavated or dredged from the wetland. 


The district court didn't find that there was 

any dredged material involved here, and we don't believe


that any reasonable reading of the term, dredged material,


or of the regulation that talks about excavating and


dredging from the wetland could describe the activity of


deep plowing. 


That leaves fill material.  Fill material in its


plain meaning is material that is -- is used, is moved in


to fill a gap or a cavity.  It was defined in the


regulations at the time as material that was used for the


primary purpose of replacing an aquatic area with dry land

or changing the bottom elevation.  As Justice Breyer has


pointed out, if anything took water out of this wetland,


it is the activity of punching the hole in the clay pan so


that it drains out.  We are not interested in filling this


wetland and there was no purpose here to -- to use the


material to replace wet areas. 


And in fact, it's quite irrelevant to a farmer


and rancher if the topsoil remains wet, and in this area


it does, as a matter of fact, remain wet because the clay


pan seals up and during the rainy season, there's --


there's water on the surface.  It's just not our purpose


to do that. 


QUESTION:  You -- you were quoting the -- the


regulations as to the -- the definition of -- of dredged


material, but the definition in the statute of pollutant 

includes rock and sand.


MR. BISHOP:  It does, but the -- but the


pollutants -- the pollutants have to be in a particular


form in order to be covered by 404, and that form is fill


material or dredged material.  So it's not enough to say


that there is rock or sand involved here.  It has to be in


the form of fill material or dredged material which is why


you have these regulatory definitions of those two


concepts.


QUESTION:  Where do I get that from?

 MR. BISHOP:  In -- in section 404(a) on page 2a


of the Government's addendum.  The permits are issued for


the discharge of dredged or fill material into the


navigable waters at specified disposal sites.  The -- the


regulations then define on page 6a and 7a fill material,


discharge of fill material, and dredged material and


discharge of dredged material.


QUESTION:  So the definition -- for present


purposes the definition of pollutant is irrelevant.


MR. BISHOP:  It is -- I'm not sure whether it's


irrelevant because under section 301, if you don't get a


permit, then what you're charged with violating is section


301(a), which is on page 1a.  And that talks about the


discharge of any pollutant. 


But the basis on which this case has been 

litigated is that we needed a 404(a) permit not a 402


permit, and that is a permit for the addition of fill


material or dredged material.


QUESTION:  Is -- is -- what is your definition? 


Because I think that's actually not a bad point.  You said


it's a conveyance.  This is not a conveyance.  The


dictionary, I guess, defines conveyance as a -- as a means


of conveying, and it says conveying is cause to pass from


one place to another.  So the Government says, well, we'll


accept that.  And of course, if you take that literally

from the dictionary, then this is a conveyance because it


is a means of conveying.  You say it couldn't be that


broad.  I have a better definition, more consistent with


what the paragraph means, and that better definition is


what? 


MR. BISHOP:  It's the -- well, clearly the


Government has some room here, but what we do say is that


a conveyance does not describe that no one -- no one


looking at a deep plow would say that's a conveyance.  It


is not an object --


QUESTION:  Well, except Webster would seem to


say that it is a conveyance because it fits the


definition.  And now, so you don't like that definition. 


I understand.  I -- I see where -- in general terms, I see


where you're going, but I -- I'm asking you if you have a 

definition that would help you short of Webster's


definition. 


MR. BISHOP:  Well, I'm not sure that Webster's


covers this situation.  A conveyance in common parlance is


something that will move material that is intended to


convey, to transport.  I'll have to find the page of our


brief.


QUESTION:  Is it --


QUESTION:  I must say I never thought a plow was


a conveyance either.

 MR. BISHOP:  A means -- I mean, this is what I


have from Webster's Third.  This is on page 4 of our reply


brief.  A means or way of conveying, carrying,


transporting, serving as a means of transportation.  I


mean, there's the idea in there that it's a purposeful


activity --


QUESTION:  You -- you want to read it as --


MR. BISHOP:  -- to convey the material to


another place.  And -- and that's not just want a plow


does.  A plow just moves through the soil pushing it to


the side and turning it over and cutting through the soil. 


I -- I just don't think any common sense or reasonable


meaning --


QUESTION:  Is that different from --


MR. BISHOP: 


-- would treat that as a --

QUESTION:  -- the propeller that was involved in


the Florida case? 


MR. BISHOP:  In -- in MCC?


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. BISHOP:  The propeller in MCC -- this is a


huge propeller on a barge in a very shallow navigable


stream.  The propeller cut through the -- the material at


the bottom of this stream, picked up large quantities of


it with every -- with every -- at each stroke, and


propelled it out of the -- out of the waters.  Whether or

not that is --


QUESTION:  Is that what it was designed to do?


MR. BISHOP:  No, that's not what it was designed


to do.  And I think --


QUESTION:  It wouldn't meet your definition. 


QUESTION:  But isn't that exactly what happens


here, that the deep -- deep rigging or whatever you call


it -- the -- it breaks up the clay.  There's a -- a body


of clay, and then the -- the broken-up clay finds its way


into the water. 


MR. BISHOP:  Well, yes, it gets pushed.  It does


get pushed to the side within the -- within the waters.


QUESTION:  So it's the exact parallel to the


other case. 


MR. BISHOP:  MCC -- no. 


MCC is a suspect 

decision, and I'm not sure that it fits the definition of


the point source or dredged or fill material.  I mean, it


is more like dredging. 


But, you know, if a point source is a confined


conveyance, our -- our contention is that it must


transport -- purposefully transport material from one


place to another and it must confine it --


QUESTION:  The key to your argument, if I


understand it, is the purposeful thing.  They didn't


really intend to do this.  It's just a byproduct of what

they're doing, and therefore there's --


MR. BISHOP:  No.  That's -- that's not the key,


Justice Stevens.  The key -- the key is equally that this


is to pick up and move material to another place.  We


don't want it here.  Let's move it.  And it's just not an


apt description of what plowing does. 


But I don't want --


QUESTION:  Would give us -- would you give us a


-- your best comprehensive description of what this kind


of so-called plowing does?  Does it leave the clay down at


the clay layer and simply break it up?  Does some of the


clay find its way up in the course of this ripping?  I'm


not sure that I know how it works.


MR. BISHOP:  Well, I think primarily what


happens is this is a very dense clay layer that the --

they have 5-inch shank cutting through it.  And I think


the most apt description is that it cuts through the clay.


This clay is heavy.  It is not -- there's not a lot of


homogenization, as the -- as the Ag Extension pamphlet


that I cite in the reply brief says.  There's not a lot of


homogenization at the lower levels from below the clay to


above or from the clay above because of the nature of the


soil and because of the nature of the piece of equipment. 


This is not like a moldboard plow that has a curved shank


that pushes the soil up.  It's a cutting device that is

QUESTION:  Mr. Minear.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. MINEAR:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may


it please the Court:


The Clean Water Act placed no regulatory


restrictions on the vast majority of acreage that


petitioners sought to subdivide and sell in this case. 


The act required only that petitioners obtain a Federal


permit for those few acres of -- of wetlands that are


protected under the Clean Water Act.  And those wetlands


are concededly protected. 


The question of whether or not 

these are waters of the United States is not in this case.


Petitioners who are --


QUESTION:  And the -- the legislation doesn't


require that these wetlands be -- be left fallow.  You --


you could use them agriculturally and -- and they would


still be wetlands and you wouldn't be violating the act.


MR. MINEAR:  That is correct.  That is correct. 


Rather, the focus here is on the activities --


QUESTION:  Could be used for normal farming and


plowing presumably without a permit.

 MR. MINEAR:  They could be under the normal


farming exemption. 


And we have three questions here, so I'd like to


try and proceed logically from the question of whether


there was a discharge of a pollutant, the first question


on which we spent most of the time discussing this so far;


the question of whether that discharge would be covered by


the normal farming exemption; and then finally, the


question of civil penalties. 


On the question of whether there was a discharge


of pollutant -- pollutants, the Clean Water Act makes


clear that a discharge is defined as any unauthorized


addition of any pollutant from any point source.  If you


make such a discharge, under 301 you have violated the


law. 


You have two -- 301 provides -- there are two 

exceptions to 301.  You can obtain a permit for normal


pollutants under 402 or you could obtain a dredge and fill


permit for fill and dredged material under 404. 


QUESTION:  So is a -- is a point source a


defined, discrete conveyance?  Is that how the statute


deals with it?


MR. MINEAR:  The -- the statute states that a


point source is a discernible, confined, discrete


conveyance. 


QUESTION:  And is a plow of this type such a

conveyance?


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, it is, and let me describe.


QUESTION:  Why? 


MR. MINEAR:  Let me describe.


QUESTION:  Because that's a point of


disagreement between you and your opponent here. 


MR. MINEAR:  That is correct, Your -- Your


Honor. 


The equipment we're talking about here is a


bulldozer, a Caterpillar D10 bulldozer, that is about 20


feet tall and about 25 feet long and typically carries a


16-foot blade on the front of it.  It weighs about 100,000


pounds.  In this particular application, this earth-moving


application, it carries what's called a deep ripper or


shank behind it.  Mr. Bishop says it's 5 inches wide.  The


understanding from my experts is that it's actually more


like a foot wide.  But the shank is about 5 to 7 feet


long.  The shank penetrates deeply into the ground and


pulls up the material behind it.  The idea here is to


disgorge the clay material that lies beneath the surface


of the soil so that the --


QUESTION:  It doesn't just go in and come out. 


It --


MR. MINEAR:  It pulls --


QUESTION:  -- in your view moves the material?

 MR. MINEAR:  Yes, and in fact the district


court --


QUESTION:  To the side or forward or something? 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  The district court opinion


states on page 70 that material is moved both horizontally


and vertically. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but if -- so long as the


material that -- that moved a couple of inches or even a


couple of feet horizontally is moved from within the


wetlands to within the wetlands, you haven't added


anything to the wetlands, have you? 


MR. MINEAR:  No.  I disagree with this, Your


Honor, and let me make a point here that I think is very


important to the entire dredge and fill permit program. 


Dredged material by its very nature is typically 

moved from one area of a wetland and placed elsewhere. 


Think of it when we talk about dredging a river and we're


dredging a channel.  We are taking the material out of one


portion of the waterway and putting it into another.  So


that's -- this idea of redeposition has been a part --


QUESTION:  Well, that's easy to see, a dredge


that takes a quantity of material and physically moves it


to another place.  Here your opponent says this goes in


but it comes up and down.  It doesn't, in fact, move the


material to a different spot.

 MR. MINEAR:  No.  I think that Mr. Bishop would


agree that once the -- what happens is once the plow


penetrates into the -- the earth, it stays beneath the


earth and it's pulled up.  And what happens is that clay


-- that clay pan that is beneath the surface is raised to


the top, together with other material.


QUESTION:  He says that's not the purpose.  He


says the purpose is -- it doesn't do that.  It just breaks


it up.  I mean, maybe some of it come, but that the


operation is not intended to mingle the clay with the --


with the topsoil.  Just to break up the clay.  I mean,


this is apparently a dispute between the two of you.


MR. MINEAR:  And it was one that was resolved,


with respect, Your Honor, by the district court which made


clear that the purpose here is to break up the clay pan. 

And in the process of doing that, it moves the earth both


horizontally and vertically. 


QUESTION:  Well, he doesn't deny that. 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  And that's sufficient. 


QUESTION:  But -- but you're -- you're


describing the moving it -- of it -- of it at least


vertically as being the whole purpose of the operation. 


And -- and he says that's not the case, that what they


want to do is break up the clay and a little bit may --


may, indeed, come higher in the course of that.  But

that's not what it's designed to do unlike the kind of


plow you -- I'm used to seeing, you know, that you carry


behind a horse and it's -- it's shaped in such a way that


indeed the soil comes up.  This is not that kind of a


plow.


MR. MINEAR:  But, Your Honor, the purpose here


is not what matters.  It's what happens in the wetland. 


Is there an addition?  And as I said, there's an addition


from three different perspectives. 


QUESTION:  Well, I suppose there's an addition


if I'm walking through a wetland that -- you know, that --


that happens to be dry at this time a year and I kick -- I


kick a dirt ball and it moves to another part of the


wetland.  I guess -- I suppose that's an addition too,


isn't it? 


MR. MINEAR:  The regulations make clear -- EPA


has made clear that those types of --


QUESTION:  Lucky for me my foot is not a


conveyance.  Maybe it is a conveyance.  I don't know. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. MINEAR:  The regulations make clear that de


minimis movements of this type are not of concern to the


agency.  Rather --


QUESTION:  Suppose a person has boots that --


and he regularly -- regularly -- people on this farm

regularly walk through some poison and it's on their


boots.  And they walk further on and, lo and behold, they


walk into the place and poison all the fish.  And they do


that on a regular basis.  Are the boots considered a


conveyance?


MR. MINEAR:  EPA has indicated that walking,


bicycling, driving a vehicle through a wetland is normally


-- has -- has de minimis effects and --


QUESTION:  No, no.  I'm trying to ask --


MR. MINEAR:  Can it be?  Can it be in the


abstract sense? 


QUESTION:  I'm interested in the question of


conveyance.  Are the boots a conveyance where the effects


are not minimal where, for example, it happens regularly,


seriously, destroys the fish because they're walking 

through poisons? 


Now, the boots are not normally considered a


conveyance, but they do, in fact, convey the poison.  A


plow is not normally considered a conveyance.  A ditch


that you dig to plant roses in is not a conveyance.  But


any of those things could in a subsidiary way convey


something as part of their primary nonconveying objective. 


Now, I want to know if you consider those subsidiary


things where it is serious to be conveyances.


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  They meet the statutory

definition --


QUESTION:  Gee whiz, Congress should have said,


you know, by conveyance or otherwise then.  Why did it


say, you know, it has to be -- it has to be a conveyance?


MR. MINEAR:  Because although as Justice Breyer


explained --


QUESTION:  And if a boot is not a conveyance,


it's not a conveyance.


MR. MINEAR:  It is a -- it is a conveyance. 


I 

think you -- you need to understand the logic that


Congress applied in enacting the statute, and that was to


define all of these terms quite broadly, understanding


that there would be enforcement discretion. 


Now, we're not talking about de minimis


activities in this case. 


We're talking about filling two 

acres of wetlands in this case.  And we're talking about


activities that were found to have adverse environmental


effects. 


QUESTION:  Now, you -- you say filling as


though, you know, they're not going to be wetlands


anymore, but that's perfectly okay.  He can make them not


wetlands anymore so long as he's doing it by normal


farming.  Right? 


MR. MINEAR:  He can --


QUESTION:  I mean, the evil here is not that

this is taken out of our national deposit of wetlands. 


That isn't the evil, is it?


MR. MINEAR:  That was the concern that motivated


these provisions.  Congress understood when it enacted the


Clean Water Act --


QUESTION:  Well, but Congress exempted normal


farming and -- and activities such as plowing, did it


not --


what --


MR. MINEAR:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- from a permit? 


MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, it did.  And I think


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. MINEAR:  -- that indicates is that Congress


was aware that plowing was a point source of addition of 

pollutants.  It could have that effect.  And for that


reason it created an exemption, the normal farming


exemption.  But that exemption itself is limited and the


regulations that EPA and the Corps have issued under this


-- under this normal farming exemption make clear that the


activities we're talking about here would not be covered.

under the normal farming exemption are ongoing


agricultural activities, part of a regular farming


activity, and also activities that ultimately under the


recapture provision, first, do not change the use of the


land and do not result in converting a wetland to dry


land.


Now, the agency was charged with responsibility


for -- for fleshing out the scope of the normal farming


exemption, and it made clear that a farmer who continues


to engage in practices that he's always engaged in,


including normal -- normal plowing --


QUESTION:  And you say here there was a change


in the use.


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  This land --


QUESTION: 


Well, your opponent doesn't want us 

to reach that exception because he says he wants to rest


on the fact that, A, it wasn't a point source, that the


plow is not a point source, and B, there was no addition.


There was simply a redeposit of material in the same


place.  Have you dealt with that yet? 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  I would like to go back to


that point.  We're now back to question 1 and talking


about the question of addition which is fundamental to the


idea of a discharge. 


Our view is that there were additions from three

sources here. 


First, there was addition by material being


moved from the upland into the wetland.  Counsel states


that that occurred in only three cases.  The record


actually shows that it occurred in at least 33 of the 40


wetlands that are involved here.  The district court made


reference to it only in those three cases where it was the


only movement of that material.  But it's easy to see that


the three cases that are cited in the district court's


opinion refer to those cases where the ripper passed next


to a wetland but didn't go in and pushed -- nevertheless,


pushed soil into the wetland.  The same thing would happen


in those areas where the ripper actually intruded through


the wetland as well.  So in the case of all of the -- the


areas, the 29 areas that were filled, all of them had 

movement of material from upland into the wetlands. 


QUESTION:  Well, excuse me.  I thought your


opponent said it isn't an addition because it's a


redeposit of material.  Have you dealt with that?


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  The -- in talking about --


before when I spoke about the dredged material, about how


material is moved from one place to the wetland to another


place, that is a regulable redeposit that is covered by


the act.  And we believe the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in


Deaton is quite persuasive on this.

 QUESTION:  I think that's already a stretch.  I


mean, you know, with that you'll say, well, literally


you're not adding anything to the wetlands just to move


the -- the mud from one portion to another.  But you have


this big dredging operation and it does disturb everything


and you move it.  So, yes, I'll go along with you on that.


But -- but then, you know, that's not enough for


you.  Now we have to generalize from that and say that any


movement of anything within the wetlands is also an


addition to the wetlands.  And -- and that brings you to


this case.  And I think it is fanciful to think that


anything has been added to the wetlands here.


MR. MINEAR:  As I said before, Your Honor, not


only do we have redeposits.  We also have the material


that moved from the upland into the wetland. 

QUESTION:  Fine. 


MR. MINEAR:  And we also have material, if I may


finish --


QUESTION:  I see that, but -- but not all of the


penalties -- we're going to get to the penalty part. 


Right? 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  They were $25,000 for each pass, and


it hasn't been established that every one of these passes


had that effect.  And -- and he says most of them didn't.

 MR. MINEAR:  Before we get to the penalty part,


if I could, Your Honor, I'd like to point to one area --


other area in which material is moved into the wetland,


and that is material that's beneath the clay pan that was


segregated and separated by this impermeable clay pan and


instead was pulled up and put into the wetland as well.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Would you be explicit about


what is implicit in that is, and that is, the definition


of wetland, I take it, is the -- the land area between the


surface and the hard pan, and the area beneath that is not


part of wetland so that if you take material from beneath


and bring it up, you are moving into the wetland.  Is that


your definition and what you're saying? 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, that's correct. 


QUESTION: 


So I can mine under a wetland, and --

and I'm not disturbing the wetland. 


MR. MINEAR:  You would not be regulated by


section --


QUESTION:  Is that -- is that the position the


Government -- the Government wants to take, that you --


anything that's under the wetland, you know, go -- go for


it?  It -- it doesn't -- doesn't involve the wetland.


MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, we're paying attention


to the -- the strict language of the statute.  The statute


is concerned with additions.

 QUESTION:  How far down does a wetland go?


MR. MINEAR:  We think in this case it's fair to


describe it as going to the bottom of the clay pan because


that's what's actually holding the water in the area.  In


other cases, it might be different.  There's vast


hydrological variation.  In some places wetlands are


sustained by the groundwater that comes up from beneath,


and so it's very difficult to talk about where the bottom


of the wetland would be --


QUESTION:  You're willing to have us say that in


this case, that wetlands only go down as far as whatever


-- whatever stratum holds the water in the wetland, and


everything else is not included.  Below that is okay.


MR. MINEAR:  Well, Your Honor, respectfully what


we're asking you to do in this case is to recognize that 

the wetland does go to that clay pan.  In other cases it


might well be different.  But we need to deal with the


facts --


QUESTION:  I thought so.


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  But I -- I think -- I thought you


were saying it does not go below the clay level because I


thought you were making the argument that when you bring


material from below the clay level into the wet area, you


are moving it into the wetland from outside the wetland.

So I thought you were making the further proposition that


the wetland stops at the -- at the clay.


MR. MINEAR:  In this case that's correct.  But


in other cases such as in Riverside Bayview, the case that


this Court previously addressed wetlands, there the


wetland was actually -- was -- received water from


beneath, and it did not have a sustaining clay pan. 


There's simply variations in the types of --


QUESTION:  No. 


QUESTION:  How do we view --


QUESTION:  Never mind. 


QUESTION:  The sustaining clay pad is not part


of the wetland you're now -- you're now saying.


MR. MINEAR:  We're saying that the clay pan is a


part --


QUESTION:  Is part of the wetland.


MR. MINEAR:  But the area beneath it is not. 


QUESTION:  Well, but he --


MR. MINEAR:  There's -- there's soil beneath the


clay pan that he pulled up. 


QUESTION:  Was he -- was he pulling up soil from


beneath the clay pan? 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  I think it's clear from the


record that he must have.


QUESTION:  What -- what about the question I

think Justice O'Connor asked?  And I think Justice Scalia


did too.  At least I'm waiting with bated breath.  That


is, what -- what -- suppose we agree with you that, well,


at least the material from the side, at least the material


from the bottom was an addition to the wetland, brought


about by, let's say, this conveyance.  All right. 


Now, what do we have to do with this case?  Do


we then have to send it back for a reassessment of


penalties or what? 


MR. MINEAR:  No.  I think you can affirm on that


basis because those two sources were present with regard


to all of the -- all of the -- the wetlands that were --


QUESTION:  All of the passes?


MR. MINEAR:  All of the -- all of the wetlands


that were at issue in this case. 


QUESTION:  Well, he -- he -- I think your


opponent said that the penalties rested upon 17 passes or


something, and I guess they conceded that each one was a


separate violation, which they may regret, if this is the


rationale anyway.  Do we have to have a reassessment of


the penalty or not?


MR. MINEAR:  We don't think that a reassessment


of the penalty would be necessary even if you took this


alternative position.  And let me say, first of all, the


penalty here was based -- what's in contention is how one

calculates the maximum penalty that can be imposed on a


party in one of these cases.  And there's a fair amount of


flexibility in determining how that might be done.  In


this case, the parties had agreed below that each pass of


the ripper was, in fact, a violation.  The -- the district


court then determined the maximum penalty by taking the


number of passes of the ripper and multiplying it times


the maximum penalty.  But it did not impose that penalty. 


Instead, it looked to the specific statutory criteria that


govern the application of the penalty provision. 


QUESTION:  I -- I see that, but I'm still -- I'm


writing the opinion let's imagine.  I say, all right, they


brought some guck from the side.  That violates the


statute.  They got some from underneath the bottom.  That


violates the statute. 


Now I'm at the point where the lower court wrote


most of its opinion.  What about the stuff that's just


sort of muck down at the bottom and it simply turns it


over?  Now, do I have to answer the question of whether


that does or does not violate this statute?  Do I have to


answer that?  Because, after all, it turns -- the penalty


turns on it. 


MR. MINEAR:  I'm not sure the penalty turns on


it.  We would say that if -- obviously this Court has


discretion to determine this -- the types of -- the type

of remand it wants to send back.  We do think --


QUESTION:  All right.  If I do have to answer


it, what do you say to their argument that, yes, if you


churn up a lot and move it, for example, over to the point


where the river is running in and dam up the river, that's


one thing.  But here all it does is turn it around in


place.  And indeed, it doesn't really cause any harm. 


It's the hole that causes the harm.  That's their argument


I think as to that bit.  And what do you say as to that?


MR. MINEAR:  I would say, first, the district


court found that there was environmental harm here.  On


page 106 of the petition appendix, it makes note that


these types of activities did cause environmental harm.


With regard to the penalty assessment, I would


look to the fact that the -- the district court considered 

the seriousness of the violation, the bad faith


activities --


QUESTION:  You haven't quite answered the


question. 


MR. MINEAR:  I'm sorry. 


QUESTION:  The question was think only of that


little bit where the plow blade is taking a bit of muck


and turning it over.  Now, in respect to that they're


saying, one, it's a small amount.  Two, the redeposit of


it has nothing to do with the harm.  The harm is caused by

the hole.  Now, as to that bit, if I have to answer the


question, what's your response to that argument? 


MR. MINEAR:  My response is that deposit, that


turning over material that's in place, can still cause


environmental harm that subjects them to a penalty. 


Imagine if in that muck, in that material, there are


entrained heavy metals, arsenic, the types of materials


that are filtered out through the normal wetland process.


QUESTION:  And they have added those to the


wetlands. 


MR. MINEAR:  They -- they have added those to


the wetland if they've in fact been released from a


situation where they're --


QUESTION:  They were in the wetland before, and


they're still -- and they're still in the wetland. 

MR. MINEAR:  But as the Fourth Circuit explained


in Deaton, that when you take material and you physically


change its situation, if you change it from an aerobic --


an anaerobic environment to an aerobic environment, if you


change its reduction oxidation potential, these are the


reasons why we have a permit because we're concerned about


these types of activities --


QUESTION:  I understand.  It's well to be


concerned about it, but -- but Congress did use the term


addition -- addition -- to the wetlands.  I mean, don't

words mean anything?


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, they do, Your Honor.  And as I


said before, they must have contemplated that an addition


included a redeposit because otherwise the idea of -- of


regulating dredging and the placement of dredged material


wouldn't have made any sense.  Congress was aware of --


chose its terms quite carefully.  It's just that it


understood that --


QUESTION:  Well, it could have meant dredged


from elsewhere, couldn't it? 


MR. MINEAR:  That is -- that is possible, but


that is very unusual.


QUESTION:  Well, if it's possible, it -- it


would mean addition --


MR. MINEAR:  It seems --


QUESTION:  -- if it was dredged from elsewhere.


MR. MINEAR:  It seems unlikely that Congress


would have enacted provisions regulating dredged and fill


material that excluded the most common form of dredging,


which is to take material from one area of the water body


and move it elsewhere. 


In any event, it's important to remember that


the pollutants we're talking about here include sand,


gravel, rock, and biological material.  These are


materials that are defined within the statute as

pollutants.  Clearly Congress recognized the dangers of


moving these materials about --


QUESTION:  What about the raking the beach?  You


know, there are people here worried about what you're


going to do next and say they can't rake the beach in


front of their house on the shore of the lake.  What about


that? 


MR. MINEAR:  The answer again is found in the


agency's regulations which make clear that de minimis


disturbances simply do not rise to the level of a


violation.


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, but they're saying we


go out every morning.  We like a neat beach and we -- we


rake it.  And I don't know.  Are you going to say that's


de minimis or not?  They like to rake their beach.  They


-- they see a lot of muck washed up from the lake.  So


they go out there and they -- they go rake the beach, and


they throw away all the muck.  It might be like an oil


spill.  I don't know.  It could be terrible.  They clean


up the beach, and they say on your definitions what you're


going to do is you're going to subject them to permits


every time they want to stop -- clean up some


environmental disaster.


MR. MINEAR:  I think, Your Honor, the question


is have they been subjected to that type of -- of

regulation, and the answer is no. 


QUESTION:  Well, they're worried that they might


be.  My question is, if we decide the case the way you


want, are we, in fact, making their worry justified?


MR. MINEAR:  I do not think so, Your Honor.  And


again, I think it's important to remember that what the


agency is fully concerned with are those types of serious


violations that cause real environmental harm. 


QUESTION:  Well, I don't think Congress wanted


the homeowner to have to worry about raking.  I don't


think they wanted to place the -- the homeowner at the --


at the mercy of this benign agency who will say, well,


there, there, don't worry.  We won't get you for raking. 


MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor --


QUESTION: 


I doubt whether raking was intended 

to be covered. 


MR. MINEAR:  I think, Your Honor, then if they


had not intended that there would be enforcement


discretion exercised by an agency, they wouldn't have


prohibited the addition, any addition, of any pollutant


from any point source.  They made the net that was covered


here quite broad because they realized there's a vast


variety in the types of environmental harm that might be


caused --


QUESTION:  Maybe they didn't think a rake was a

point source as I don't. 


MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, they -- they have had


ample opportunities to change the regulations -- or to


change the -- the terms of the statute.  The statute has


been revised three times, and they've been quite specific


in what they've done.  The normal farming exemption is a


good example.  Congress could have simply exempted all


farming activities from coverage under section 404 or the


Clean Water Act itself.  Instead, it drew a very specific


line in this case and it said that we are only restricting


normal farming activities and we're subjecting them to a


recapture provision.  That recapture provision applies


whenever the activity, even if it's simply plowing,


results in the change in use of the property and also


results in a diminishment of the waters of the United 

States, if it actually fills --


QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, are you saying that an --


an ordinary plow too, like this deep ripper, would be a


point source, but what takes that activity out is that it


would come under the normal farming exemption?


MR. MINEAR:  That's exactly right. 


QUESTION:  But it is a point source. 


MR. MINEAR:  That is correct.  The -- the plow


would be a point source.  And this is the reason why


Congress enacted the normal farming exemption.  It

realized it defined these terms quite broadly, and it


wanted to provide sensible exemptions.  But it drew limits


on those exemptions to avoid covering situations like we


have here where we're not talking about a yeoman's plow,


but rather we're talking about a 100,000 pound bulldozer


pulling a 7-inch -- 7-foot long shank through a wetland


area. 


I think it's important to remember too that this


lawsuit could have easily been avoided.  The -- the


parties were -- were -- discussed this issue on a number


of occasions, and the Corps made quite clear that they


were not subject to a permit provided they simply avoided


these small wetland areas, what's -- in the case of the


parcels at issue here are about 1 percent of the property. 


It was easy enough to simply mark these areas and have the 

contract rippers who came through avoid those areas.  The


petitioners in this case decided not to do that.  They


decided to disregard the law and the fact is that this


suit and 10 years of litigation -- excuse me -- 8 years of


litigation is the result.


The fact is that this is a quite sensible


program.  The Corps and EPA have applied it quite


sensibly, and I think that their actions in this case, if


you look at the record, were really quite reasonable.


Now, I would like to touch back, since we've

covered a lot of material here, just to go over --


QUESTION:  Excuse me. 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  What -- what farming exception is


there?  Is there just one or are there several of them?


MR. MINEAR:  There's one normal farming


exemption.  That is contained in section 404(f) of the


statute, and that is found on pages 2a and 3a of our --


QUESTION:  Okay.  But, you see, that's -- that's


not an exception for -- for normal -- it's an exception


from the discharge of dredged or fill material.  Right?


MR. MINEAR:  That's correct.  And so what this


does is it exempts the party from having to get a section


404 permit for activities that would otherwise constitute


dredge or fill activities. 


And the fact that Congress has 

chosen to exempt activities, including specifically


plowing, indicates that Congress understood that plowing


could result in a point source addition of pollutants.


Now, what Congress additionally did is it -- it


states on the carryover -- there's a number of other


matters that are exempted as well.  It indicates that


these activities are not regulated under section 301 or


section 404 or section 402, for that matter.  But then on


the paragraph on page 4a, it recaptures those provisions


when they result in a change of use, when someone, such as

in this case, decides to take a ranch and subdivide it and


sell it as farmettes.  And it -- and even that recapture


provision only applies when it reduces the reach of


waters, which is what happened in this case. 


As the district court found, these waters were


filled.  They are no longer wetlands, and the idea that


these areas are going to be resealed finds no support in


the record.  The district court found here that what were


once wetlands are now orchards.  These are not areas that


include wetland -- or have wetland characteristics any


longer. 


I would simply like to touch on -- since we --


we have bounced around among the three issues here quite a


bit, I'd like to simply say a few more words about the


civil penalty provision because I think it's important. 

The legal issue that's before the Court on the


civil penalty is -- is whether a penalty ought to be


assessed in terms of determining the maximum penalty on a


per-day basis or on the basis of the number of violations


per day.  And the Congress made -- made quite clear that


it wanted the latter to be the basis for determining the


maximum civil penalty.  It amended the statute in 1987 to


eliminate any ambiguity that might exist with regard to


the -- to that provision, and it's quite clear that it


does apply to every violation each day.

 Now, it takes into account that some violations


can be continuing and go on for a long period of time. 


And those are treated as receiving a $25,000 a day


penalty.  But in the case of the violations we have here,


they all occurred in one day on the basis the district


court analyzed the -- the problem. 


Finally, I'd like to make the point that the


district court needs to have a great deal of discretion in


determining how to apply the penalty provisions that are


involved here.  There are different ways to calculate


violations, determine what is the appropriate measure of


violations, but ultimately the fairness turns on the


district court's judgment of the individual penalty


factors that are considered here. 


In this case, the court took into account all 

those factors, including the economic benefits that the


party received by avoiding its legal obligations in this


case.  It's important to remember there are land


developers, ranchers, and farmers out there that do comply


with the statute, that do comply with the regulations, and


they are, in effect, penalized if in fact people who


ignore the law are allowed to go forward and not be


subject to a substantial penalty in cases in which they


have violated the law.


In this case the penalties are less than what

actually would be necessary to recoup the economic benefit


that they received according to the -- the facts that the


district court put forward.  The court of the -- or excuse


me -- the -- the Government put forward.  The district


court recognized there was some uncertainty with regard to


determining economic benefit, but nevertheless I think


chose a very reasonable approach here in terms of


requiring both a mitigation remedy and also a substantial


civil penalty. 


If there are no further questions. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Minear. 


Mr. Bishop, you have 4 minutes left.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. BISHOP: 


I think it's a shame that the 

Government has chosen to insert at this level for the very


first time this idea that soil came in from outside the


wetland.  On page 36 of the petition appendix, the -- the


district court, in describing what the plowing here did,


said that it broke up, mixed, turned over material already


in the pools, swales, and intermittent streams. 


If you turn to page 86 through 91, where the


court describes in detail factual findings after hearing


the evidence on the impacts on waters, on only three -- as


to three of the jurisdictional features does the court say

that there is any fill coming in from outside, and that is


where there is upland plowing parallel to a drainage that


pushes a small amount of material into the very margins of


the wetland. 


And the reason that the court didn't need to get


into this is, A, that it had made a legal finding to begin


with that soil disturbed within a wetland was a discharge,


and B, that there was a factual dispute here about the


extent to which we have pulled up the plows before we


entered across from the upland to the -- to the wetland. 


And the court didn't want to deal with -- with that.  And


it didn't have to under this notion that if you disturb


soil within a wetland, that's an addition. 


Second, I'd like to point out on page 8a of the


-- of the Government's addendum the regulation about 

plowing.  Plowing means all forms of primary tillage


including moldboard, chisel, and wide-blade plowing,


discing, harrowing, and similar means utilized on the farm


to break up, cut, turn over, or stir the soil to prepare


it for the planting of crops. 


QUESTION:  What does primary mean?


MR. BISHOP:  Primary I think means just


preparation.  If you -- you have to go to the end and --


and see -- it's soil -- to prepare the soil for the


planting of crops.  Primary is the initial preparation of

the soil.  You might contrast that, for example, with --


even though harrowing is mentioned here, farmers


understand that harrowing is actually a secondary form of


land preparation.  It's like a large rake that -- that


clears the seed bed for -- for seeding.  Primary is the


first movement that prepares the soil for accepting the


crops.


QUESTION:  Why do you need the exception for it? 


That's what puzzles me.


MR. BISHOP:  Well, you don't need an exception


for it.  Our -- our position is that it's not a discharge


and so -- and that Congress, if you read the 1972


legislative history -- I'm sorry to mention it, Justice


Scalia.


(Laughter.) 


MR. BISHOP:  But it's clear that they did not


intend to reach agricultural activity.  The Corps in a


dispute with the EPA made noises between '72 and '77


about, well, we're -- we're going to start regulating


stock ponds and -- and ordinary farming activities.  And


Congress reacted to that by, as one commentator has said,


a provision that reflects the fact that it didn't think


that one stake through the heart of the vampire was


enough.  This is a belt and suspenders provision. 


But what it does, as you remarked Justice


54 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Scalia, is to provide an exemption for agricultural


activities that are discharges.  It doesn't change the


definition of point source, fill material, dredged


material, addition in any way.  It doesn't change any of


the operative terms in the statute that we think mean this


activity is not a -- a discharge to begin with. 


And the exemption also mentions other


activities, seeding and cultivation and harvesting, that


just are not -- I mean, these are not discharges.  These


do not result in the addition of fill and dredged material


from -- to the -- to the wetland.  And -- and that is why


this structure is what's reflected in the regulations. 


The regulation on page 8a.  It says plowing, as described


above -- I mean, they purport to exclude what we did from


the definition of plowing, but plowing, as described 

above, will never involve a discharge.  It's not a


discharge to begin with.  You don't get into the 404(f)


exemption. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Bishop.


MR. BISHOP:  Thank you. 


JUSTICE STEVENS:  The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
