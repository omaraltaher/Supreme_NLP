CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-704, United States v. Bean.


Mr. Kneedler.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. KNEEDLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


In each year's annual Appropriations Act,


Congress has prohibited the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,


and Firearms from investigating or acting upon


applications for discretionary relief from firearms


disabilities under 18 U.S.C. 925(c.)  The court of appeals


held that, in the face of that statutory bar, a Federal


district court could itself grant respondent relief from


firearms disabilities.  That holding is contrary to


fundamental principles of judicial review of agency action


under the Administrative Procedure Act.  Under the APA --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- you call it a statutory bar.  I


thought there was some difference in appropriations


statutes from ordinary, ordinary laws.  Are the two


exactly the same?  Could Congress create a substantive

obligation, for example, in an appropriations law, provide


that, oh, I don't know, nobody shall sell stock on


Tuesdays?  Could they put that in an appropriations


measure?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  An appropriations law is,


for purposes of Congress's lawmaking authority, no


different from any other sort of law.


QUESTION:  That's our holding in Roberts, isn't


it?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  Now, what the Court has


said is that if a subsequent appropriations statute is


said to repeal or suspend the application of a prior law,


that intention has to be made clear, but here we think


that there's no question that the annual Appropriations


Act is clear.  There's nothing implied about what Congress


did here.  There is an express prohibition against ATF


either investigating or acting upon applications for


relief.


law?


QUESTION:  You call this a suspension of the


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  I mean, effectively.  It's


a suspension -- it's an annual -- a suspension for a


period of 1 year.


QUESTION:  I suppose Congress -- well, maybe --


I mean, I suppose Congress could say, this law that we

enacted a year ago is suspended for 10 years.  It will not


go into effect for 10 years.  I suppose it could say that.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, absolutely.  Congress could


certainly do that.


QUESTION:  Well, that's the holding of


Dickerson, is it not? 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  So what we have here is an


express prohibition against ATF exercising the power that


Congress conferred on it.  Under the Administrative


Procedure Act, the only power a court has in judicial


review of agency action is to review what the agency did,


and it may only set aside the agency action if the agency


action is arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law.


QUESTION:  I don't know if it really bears on


the case, but suppose Congress had a completely different


scheme, and it said that the firearms violator's license


could be restored if he applied to United States district


court, no agency at all, you just go to court.  Would that


be a violation of Article III?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think there would be a


question about that.  As I recall, there was, and I think


it still may be true that courts may grant applications


for naturalization, but the court I believe concluded that


there was at least an implicit adversarial process in the


sense that the Government could appear on the other side

of the case and oppose it, but I think you raise a very


good point in terms of what would be the traditional way


that something like this would be accomplished, and that


is that it would be natural, and this is what Congress did


in 925(c), to confer this authority on the executive


branch, and it did it in very broad and general terms and


then provided that a person whose application is denied


may file a petition in district court for judicial review


of such denial.


In other words, under 925(c) it is the denial by


the ATF, not the application itself, that is the subject


of judicial review.


QUESTION:  Is the refusal of the ATF to act on


an application pursuant to this provision in the


appropriation a de facto denial that's reviewable?


MR. KNEEDLER:  We think it is not.  As we


explained in our brief, we believe the word denial in that


context means a denial on the merits, and this is what a


number of the courts of appeals that have looked at the


question have held, and what Congress said in the


Appropriations Act is that ATF is barred from even acting


upon the application.  In other words, it can't either


grant or deny the application for relief, and therefore


the predicate for judicial review under 925(c) is missing.


We're not saying that there is no judicial

review at all.  The general provisions of the APA remain


available and, under 5 U.S.C. 703, the avenue for judicial


review, or the form of the judicial review is either the


special statutory review procedure, in this case 925(c),


or in the absence of that or its inadequacy, then another


appropriate form, in other words, the general provisions


of the APA.


But once again, the power of a court under the


general provisions of the APA is simply to review the


agency's action and to set it aside if contrary to law,


and here the action was not contrary to law, it was


compelled by law.  The most direct avenue that respondent


could have challenged the agency's approach in this case,


its failure to act, was under section 706(1), which


provides for a court in reviewing agency action to set


aside agency action that is -- or excuse me, to compel


agency action that is unreasonably delayed or unlawfully


withheld; and, again, there was nothing unlawful about


ATF's withholding of a decision on respondent's


application for relief, because Congress compelled that


withholding.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, there was an alternate


argument that a foreign conviction shouldn't count for


this purpose.  Has the United States ever taken a position


on that?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  Yes, we have.  It is the


position of the United States that foreign convictions are


covered by the act.  Now, that is not before the Court. 


The -- in fact, below respondent conceded that a foreign


conviction is a proper predicate under 922(g)(1), and the


Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to reach that


question.  It wasn't presented in the petition and it's


not before this Court.


Indeed, the question of whether a foreign


conviction would be a proper predicate is something that


would be raised under 922(g) in a prosecution.  As we


point out in our brief, there is a circuit conflict on


that question, but that conflict has arisen in cases,


criminal prosecutions brought under 922(g), and that would


be the proper place to begin to make that claim.


Neither the general provisions of the APA nor


925(c) provides someone who is wondering whether he may or


may not be covered by a provision of the Federal criminal


laws to bring a declaratory judgment against the United


States to determine whether conduct he hopes to engage in


would be covered by a particular criminal statute.  So


even though it -- it isn't before this Court, but we also


believe that this would not be the proper avenue in which


to raise such a claim in any event.


Respondent has argued that what is going on here

is an implied repeal of the judicial review provisions or


the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to act in a case


such as this and, as I've said, there's nothing implied. 


What Congress did was expressly bar ATF, and it otherwise


left the court's authority unaffected.  925(c) remains in


effect.  It's just that, by virtue of Congress's


prohibiting ATF from acting on applications for relief,


there is no denial which could be the predicate for review


under that, under that special statutory review procedure.


QUESTION:  Well, do you think that that's 100


percent clear?  I mean, in Robertson, the amendment of a


prior statute was affected not by the simple means of


withholding appropriations.  I mean, it set forth


different language that was going to govern the matter.


Here, the only thing that has happened is


they're not given any appropriations, and you think it is


not a matter -- you think it's entirely clear that when


the Secretary receives an application and says, I cannot


act on this application because the appropriations rider


forbids me, do you think it's entirely clear that that


does not amount to a denial of the application?


MR. KNEEDLER:  I think that's the better reading


of the statute.


QUESTION:  Well, it may be the better one, but


is it clear?  I mean, the law is that unless you make it

quite clear in the appropriations statute that you are


intending to amend the prior law, the prior law is not


amended.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Again, the -- our position is not


that Congress amended the judicial review provision of


925(c).  What it did was prohibit ATF from acting. 


925(c)'s judicial review procedure is still in effect. 


The question is whether the -- whether Congress's


directive to ATF not to even act upon applications for


relief constitutes a denial and, as I say, ATF is barred


from either granting or denying relief, and I would refer


the Court also to the general definition of agency action


under the APA, which we cite in our brief.  This is 5


U.S.C. 551(13).  It defines agency action as an agency


rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent,


or the denial thereof, or a failure to act.


So under the APA, which is the general statute


governing traditional review of agency action, Congress


itself has defined a denial of relief as something


different from a failure to act, and I think there's every


reason to look at 925(c)'s reference to a denial as being


consistent, rather than inconsistent with the general


definitions that Congress has applied under the APA.


I would also add, though, that it doesn't


matter, that even if the ATF's decision were viewed as a


10

denial within the meaning of 925(c), the general APA


standards for reviewing that denial still apply.  As we


point out in our brief, this Court's decision in Zurko and


the prior decision in the Brotherhood of Locomotive


Engineers both make clear that, even where you do have a


special statutory review procedure that establishes the


form for judicial review, the nature and character, as the


Court said in Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, of that


judicial review is defined by the general provisions of


the APA, section 706; and again, under those provisions


the court can only set aside agency action that is


contrary to law; and again, here, the ATF's action was


compelled by law, not contrary to it.


So whichever avenue this suit was thought to


have been brought under, there was no basis for the


district court to grant relief at all, and we also think


that that is entirely consistent with the Congress's 


purposes in enacting the appropriations bar.


The legislative history which respondent has


produced as an appendix to his brief explains that


Congress had become concerned about the inherently


subjective nature of the inquiry that ATF was undertaking,


and the severe consequences that could result if ATF had


made a mistake, and also that Congress believed that the


money that was being spent for that purpose, $4 million a

year for 40 positions at ATF, would be better served --


QUESTION:  Why didn't it just repeal the thing,


then, because it didn't have the votes?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, what it decided to do is to


proceed on an annual basis.  It would -- which means it


could be subject to revision each year.  It was a


practical compromise.  The Third Circuit explained in


Pontarelli that the same people who were supporting a


permanent repeal in 1992 were also the movants for the


annual appropriations rider on the theory that it


accomplished essentially the same thing on an annual


basis.


QUESTION:  This was in the appropriations law


just for the ATF, or for the whole Treasury Department?


MR. KNEEDLER:  It's in the provision for ATF.


QUESTION:  Suppose that the Secretary had some


other agency -- the Secret Service didn't have much to do


that month; could he direct them to process some of these


applications?


MR. KNEEDLER:  I think not, for there is another


sentence in the appropriations provision for ATF which


says that no money may be spent to transfer functions from


ATF to another department or agency, and I think the


reference to agency in that provision would probably


include other provisions -- or excuse me, other agencies

within the Department of the Treasury, and the Secretary


of the Treasury personally couldn't be expected to act on


applications like this.  The Secretary, as this Court


pointed out in the Dunne decision, has --


QUESTION:  Well, would he abuse his discretion


if he took that function away from ATF?  You say that


there's a provision in the statute that he -- that the


Secretary himself cannot transfer the function?


MR. KNEEDLER:  It says, no funds shall be


spent -- I believe it says, under this act, to transfer


functions to another agency within ATF.


QUESTION:  Well, how much money does the --


would the Secretary spend if he signed an order


transferring a function?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the clear import of what


Congress directed is, the function shall not be


transferred.  That was clearly what Congress was driving


at.


QUESTION:  It wouldn't be a transfer to another


agency if the Secretary did it himself.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right, but the Secretary -- first


of all, as Congress well knew when it passed this


appropriations rider, the Secretary has delegated the


authority for acting on these applications to ATF.  That


is the legal framework against which --

 QUESTION:  What he gave he could withdraw.


QUESTION:  He could revoke.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Perhaps he -- I mean, he


presumably could, but the proper avenue for a respondent


to pursue in that situation would be to request ATF -- or


excuse me, the Secretary to revoke the regulation that


produced the delegation, and then if the Secretary


declined to do that, to seek review of that under the APA


on an arbitrary and capricious standard.


Respondent has not pursued that avenue, and we


think it would manifestly not be arbitrary and capricious


for the Secretary to withdraw that delegation and take on


that function himself with all the other functions that


are before the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to


the Nation's economy and banking and all those other


matters, and in particular it would not be arbitrary and


capricious for the Secretary to decline to do that in the


face of the appropriations bar that Congress has enacted,


with the -- again, with the clear understanding that it


didn't want these applications to be acted on


administratively, but in any event --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler --


MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, if we shift the focus


from the agency to the court, is it your essential

argument that Congress provided for an appellate,


essentially an appellate role for the district court and


not a first instance role?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, that --


QUESTION:  So that the only authority the court


would have would be to review a decision made by an


executive official, but there is a provision in this law


for the district court to take additional evidence. 


Usually when a court is performing a review function it


doesn't take any evidence.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Excuse me.  That's correct, but


it would -- but even the admission or acceptance of


additional evidence would be in aid of the APA review,


which is, again, of the agency's decision.  A court


receiving evidence is not unheard of under the APA, even


under the arbitrary and capricious standard.  As this


Court pointed out in Overton Park, occasionally there will


be situations in which additional evidence or an


explanation from the agency could be received in judicial


review, but that's only supplemental of the record that


was before the agency.


QUESTION:  Well, but the agency doesn't always


have to make a record.  I mean, suppose the agency just,


you know, just makes a decision.  Why can't this Court


treat it as a matter of review?  That is, the issue before

the Court will be whether the action here, assuming it's a


denial, was unreasonable?


MR. KNEEDLER:  The question before the Court


would be whether it was arbitrary and capricious or


unlawful, and again, it wasn't unlawful because Congress


compelled it.  Congress compelled the Secretary or ATF not


to act on the application.  Now, whether or not that's


called a denial, the bottom line, the failure to afford


any relief, was compelled by Congress, so the agency could


not set -- or, excuse me, the court could not set that


aside.


Looked at another way, the only relevant


evidence that would be introduced in court would be


evidence of the fact that respondent had applied during a


time when the statutory bar on ATF's action was pending. 


That is the only relevant evidence that --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a


question?  Supposing the Secretary or the head of the ATF,


either or both -- say they spent the weekend together


sometimes.  They read through the papers on their own time


on a Sunday afternoon and said, gee, this is a case of


rank injustice, I think we're going to grant the petition,


and they entered some kind of an order granting it, would


that have violated any statutes?


MR. KNEEDLER:  It would.  It would violate this

statute.  The order, whatever they might have read on


their own time the order would be taken in their official


capacity, and the -- and --


QUESTION:  But suppose they drafted it on


Saturday and signed it on Saturday?


MR. KNEEDLER:  It would still be a -- the


second --


QUESTION:  It would be in their official


capacities but it wouldn't have cost the Government a


dime.


QUESTION:  Doesn't -- the statute doesn't say,


official capacity.  It says, expend funds.


MR. KNEEDLER:  It says expend funds, but it


means to act -- but it says, to -- it is directed to the


actions of the ATF in its official capacity.  Only an


official act of ATF could relieve someone from firearms


disabilities.


QUESTION:  I suppose the argument is that the --


certainly the Secretary, and perhaps all Federal


officials, don't get paid by the hour, they get paid for


all the official actions that they take during the year,


so that even if they take it on a Saturday they're being


compensated for it.


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's correct, and --


QUESTION:  Minimally, but compensated.

MR. KNEEDLER:  They are paid for the office, not


for the work that they are performing, nor could the


Secretary direct ATF to grant it, because again he would


be directing an unlawful act.


If there are no further questions, I'd like to


reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Kneedler.


Mr. Goldstein, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Congress, in section 925(c), provided


individuals like Respondent Tommy Bean two rights vis a


vis the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of


America.  Individuals may apply to, quote, unquote, "the


Secretary" for relief from firearms disabilities and, if


the Secretary denies that application, they may secure


judicial review.  The obvious flaw in the Government's


position this morning, as several of the later questions


identified, is that Congress has never, expressly or


impliedly repealed those rights vis a vis the Secretary. 


The appropriations statutes that are before you address


only the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

Congress has set aside a separate and special budget for


the Department of the Treasury generally, which is under


the control of the Secretary, it's for $123 million, and


the right to proceed before the Secretary is unaffected.


QUESTION:  Well, now, did your client seek to


proceed before the Secretary?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  Page 27 of the joint


appendix is the application.  It's directed to the


Secretary of the Treasury, care of BATF.  We went, as the


statute directs, to the Secretary of the Treasury.  The


Secretary of the Treasury told Tommy Bean that he was not


going to restore firearms rights.


QUESTION:  Well, this was not a personal


conversation between the two, I take it.


(Laughter.)


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We don't have his number. 


That's right.  We wrote him a letter, as the statute


requires.


QUESTION:  Well, he didn't say, denied.  He


said, I'm not going to act upon it.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And that --


QUESTION:  Whereupon, your remedy under the


Administrative Procedure Act would be to sue in district


court for agency action unreasonably withheld.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  With respect, the premise and

the conclusion are not -- of your question are not


correct.  The ATF on behalf of the Secretary said, I'm not


going to grant you this relief.  The definition of


denial -- the statute does not say, denial on the merits. 


The definition of denial is a refusal to grant the


requested relief.  That's --


QUESTION:  Mr. Goldstein, may I back you up just


a bit, because I'm looking at the letter you cited.  It is


addressed to the Secretary, but it's care of Director of


the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Congress


passes all kinds of laws giving the Secretary authority to


do this or that, which the Secretary invariably delegates,


and I can't think of an instance where a regime of this


order is taken over by the Secretary herself, rather than


by some delegatee, but this is the kind of thing that's


made to order for, not the top person, but for it to be


delegated.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Can I address both the question


of whether there are other examples of the scheme we've


described, which is to say, the agency head does it, and


then the question of whether or not, if this were a novel


scheme, it would matter?


The premise that there aren't parallels for this


is not correct.  I can give you three examples.  The


Attorney General is required to personally certify any

person who's going to be subject to the Federal death


penalty.  That's 42 U.S.C. -- 18 U.S.C. 3593.  Under the


Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act, which is


42 U.S.C. 1997(a), the Attorney General is required to


personally certify a prosecution, and there are various


Federal criminal prosecutions for civil rights violations,


which are at 18 U.S.C. 245.


QUESTION:  How does the statute make it clear


that it's a personal obligation or a nondelegable


obligation?  What are the words that it uses, or that


those statutes use?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It's the two in combination. 


925(c) says the Secretary.  921(a)(17) defines the


Secretary to mean that individual or the delegate.  Then,


what Congress did is, it came along in the appropriations


action, act and said, we recognize -- well, I'll give --


the literal language is that the ATF may not investigate


or act upon --


QUESTION:  No, no, I'm sorry, my question wasn't


clear.  I want to go to the examples that you were giving


of personal obligation.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize.


QUESTION:  And you used the adverb,


personally --


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  -- certify, et cetera.  How do they


provide for that so-called personal action?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  They generally say, the Attorney


General shall certify, and the courts have interpreted


that -- I believe there is an example that says,


personally.


QUESTION:  Which we don't have here.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We definitely do not have here,


but we have the equivalent, and then I'll get to Justice,


the underlying question of Justice Ginsburg's, and that


is, does it matter if this is done in a different way.


We have here the parallel, because what happened


is that Congress defined the Secretary to be that


individual or the delegate, and in the appropriations laws


has told ATF, as the delegate, that they may not act on


anything else, and the parallel provision that Mr.


Kneedler pointed to, which is that the Secretary may not


transfer to any other division or agency.


What Congress did not say -- and this is


extraordinarily important.  It's the key to the entire


case.  Congress did not say that no funds in this or any


other act, or no funds in the subsection dealing with the


budget of the Secretary of the Treasury, may be used. 


Now, it is that --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe it didn't say that

because it thought it was perfectly clear that if it


didn't want public money used under -- by the delegate, it


presumably wouldn't want public funds used for the same


purpose by everybody else, which seems like a fairly


reasonable assumption.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Maybe --


QUESTION:  I mean, why isn't it a reasonable


assumption?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It may be, but what --


QUESTION:  Well, if it is a reasonable


assumption, haven't we got to take that into consideration


in interpreting the annual bar, and hold against you,


otherwise we'll be clearly -- we would clearly be going


against the intent of Congress?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, and that's the underlying


point to Justice Ginsburg's questions.  This Court --


QUESTION:  My first question started out, it


seems that you in the beginning of this process understood


that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was the


relevant actor, because you addressed the Secretary care


of that agency, not the Secretary --


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And let me explain why.  The 27


C.F.R. 178144(a), which has never been repealed, required


us to send it to ATF.  We had no choice.  There's a


regulation on the books that says we have to submit it to

the Director.  We didn't have a choice, but to make


perfectly clear that it was directed to the Secretary we


say, we send it to the Secretary care of ATF.


But I need to return to Justice Souter's


question, which is, is it good enough in this case, as in


many other instances of statutory construction, to say, we


get the general sense of what Congress was trying to do? 


The answer is no.  In this area of law uniquely, Congress


has to turn square corners.  The relevant text of any


statute is section 925(c).  It's never been repealed.  It


says --


QUESTION:  What you're saying is that Congress


was just wasting its time here.  It was trying to do


something.  It just didn't accomplish it.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, Mr. Chief Justice, and let


me get to that point, and that is, I agree with you that


it would be foolish to say that the appropriations acts


are completely ineffective, and if our interpretation were


to deprive them of any value, we agree it would be highly


questionable.  It is not.


The scheme that results is clearly one under


which the Secretary will grant only those applications


where the right to relief is perfectly clear.  Where, as


in this case, it is --


QUESTION:  How do you know that?  You say the

scheme that results, I don't see how you can see that from


the enactment in question.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because, Mr. Chief Justice, what


Congress did is, it created a system under which the


subdivisions underneath the Secretary may not investigate


or act.  It's left to the Secretary, and now it is --


QUESTION:  But the -- that just doesn't fit with


the real world.  The idea that the Secretary on his way to


the International Monetary Fund meeting is going to


address an application like this just doesn't make sense.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, with respect,


we -- well, first of all, the text of the statute we think


is enough on its face, but on the question of whether or


not it makes sense, we think it does, because -- and I


will point you to several other examples in Federal


firearms law where Congress has adopted categorical rules


allowing felons to have their rights restored.


We believe this is a safety valve.  We're not


saying that the Secretary has to grant any particular


application.  What we're saying is that Congress


recognized that there would be extraordinary cases.  What


Congress was faced with was that ATF had spent $20 million


granting 3,000 applications, and that's what the


legislative history shows that Congress was trying to cut


off.  What we are describing is a very different animal.

It is an animal that's in the text of the statute, and


that is, the Secretary is still empowered to grant relief.


Now, Justice Ginsburg, one of the premises of


your question was that there's a delegation here.  The


delegation here is not exclusive.  The delegation here


provides that -- and this was in 19 -- when the BATF was


created, the Secretary provided that the Director shall


act under the general supervision of the Secretary and


under -- excuse me, and under the supervision of the


Assistant Secretary.


The parallel that's drawn by the Solicitor


General is to United States v. Nixon and to the Accardi


case, and those were exclusive delegations.  In United


States v. Nixon this Court said -- and this is at page 695


of the opinion -- that the special prosecutor had plenary


authority, and the regulation provided that the Attorney


General shall not interfere with the special prosecutor's


decision, and in Accardi, and this is at page 266, the


Court said that -- the scheme in Accardi was that the


Attorney General would act only after the Bureau of


Immigration Affairs, and that clearly contemplated that


the AG would stay out of the process.


In any event, not only is this not an exclusive


delegation, but our fundamental point is that it's an


illegal delegation.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Goldstein, I would -- you are


concentrating on the agency end of it.  Looking at it from


the perspective of a court, you seem to be making of the


district court an entity that doesn't exist in the U.S.


system.  You're having the district court in effect being


an examining magistrate.  There is no adverse party. 


You're having the district court determine whether there's


sufficient evidence to warrant restoring the license.


We don't have district judges performing that


kind of mixed function, proceeding in that ex parte way. 


It would be extraordinary for Congress to make such a


provision, and yet you want us to infer it.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, Justice Ginsburg.  Here's


how it works.  The statute contemplates when there's a


denial, and we will take up, probably, the question


further of whether or not there's a denial here, but to


focus only on the judicial review aspect, when there's a


denial, you file a petition with the Federal district


court.


What happens in all the cases would be what


happened here, and that is that the district judge orders


the United States and the Secretary made the party


defendant.  They come into the case, and they have the


opportunity to put on evidence, to examine the


witnesses -- that happened here --

 QUESTION:  But the United States came in and


said, we are disabled.  Congress doesn't want us to play a


part in that.  It seems to me then the -- you fight that


out, and if the agency isn't disabled, the district court


orders the agency to act.  But that's not what you asked


for.  You asked the district court to restore this


person's license, and that's the relief you got.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, you are


correct what we asked for.  You are, with respect, not


correct about what the Government said in this case.  The


Government did not come in and say, our hands are tied. 


The Government did press its argument that there wasn't


jurisdiction, but it absolutely did participate on the


factual side of the case.  I can give you examples.


J.A. 51 is the examination of Tommy Bean, and


then the cross-examination by the Assistant United States


Attorney.  J.A. 55 is the opportunity given to the United


States to cross-examine the chief of police.  We --


QUESTION:  Did the United States take the


position that this license shouldn't be restored?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.  Precisely the opposite. 


J.A. 37 is the United --


QUESTION:  I don't understand how there was an


adversary proceeding, then.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  What happened is, they came

in -- I'm -- I've confused you with the timing.  On


January 20, 199 -- on 2000, there was a hearing held


before the Federal district judge, Judge Fisher.  The


United States participated.


It did not say, we are prohibited from


participating.  They had been given the opportunity to


take witnesses, and let me detour very briefly, and that


is to say that while the appropriations statutes prohibit


ATF from acting on applications, we are now talking about,


as you've pointed us to, the petition, and there is


nothing -- and that's the distinction drawn in section


925(c).  ATF is not disabled from participating in the


district court.


To return.  There was this hearing on January


20.  The United States was given the opportunity to put on


evidence and cross-examine witnesses, as I was just


describing.  Immediately afterwards, the Respondent Bean


submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law


after that adversary proceeding.  At J.A. --


QUESTION:  In what sense it was adversary? 


Usually, if the bureau hadn't been disabled by Congress it


would say, deny an application, and then there would be a


determination on the merits, but here, apparently there


was no position taken on the merits.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I'm almost there.  There was.

J.A. 37 is the United States' response to our proposed


findings of fact, and they conclude at J.A. 37 that our


proposed findings of fact are supported by the evidence. 


Finding of fact 27 is that petitioner -- that -- he -- we


were the petitioner there.  Petitioner, based on the


circumstances of his disability and based on his record


and reputation, would not represent a threat to the public


safety, and finding of fact 28 that they conceded was that


granting petitioner the relief he requested would not be


contrary to the public interest.  What happened here is


that the evidence was so overwhelming.  We had six chiefs


of --


QUESTION:  Well, why -- if the United States was


a party, as I suppose is the purport of what you're


saying, why isn't that a violation of the appropriations


rider, so that we must disregard it?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because, Justice Kennedy,


nothing in the appropriations rider prohibits either of


the two following things: First, the United States


Attorney showing up and representing the United States,


relatedly the Secretary of the Treasury showing up; or the


ATF participating at the petition stage, as opposed to the


application stage.


I think it's very important to recognize here


that this case has proceeded up until today on the

understanding of the parties that the evidence about Mr.


Bean's entitlement to relief was overwhelming.  Six chiefs


of police, a priest, a local --


QUESTION:  I don't know that that's an argument. 


I mean, I concede that.  I'm still left back at Justice


Scalia's question, because I thought in response to his


question you -- I had the impression you were suggesting


that the Secretary had somewhere written a piece of paper


that in effect denied the application, and I looked


through this appendix -- I've been doing that and


listening at the same time --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  -- and I cannot find that letter. 


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.


QUESTION:  All I find in the appendix is


something written by Ms. Pamela Potaczek, who is from the


ATF, and what that says is, because of the restriction we


are returning Mr. Bean's application for restoration. 


That's the end of that.  He can apply again.


Now, is there some other piece of paper?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.


QUESTION:  No.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Our position is --


QUESTION:  Well then, if there is no other piece


of paper, what is the response to Justice Scalia's

question, which was simply that there has been no denial? 


They return the application, and if your client felt that


they should have acted on it, he should file a request in


the district court for -- of course, as soon as you do


that, the Secretary will come in and say, of course I


didn't act on it.  That's what Congress meant.  And then


the question will be whether that's a reasonable


interpretation of this statute, and then, of course, the


Government thinks of course it's a reasonable


interpretation, and even if it's an incorrect


interpretation, at least reasonable.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.


QUESTION:  Now, that's where I am, which is, I


think, what Justice Scalia was raising.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Breyer, you have several


questions.  Let me deal with them in the following terms:


was there a denial here, second, does it matter whether


there was a denial here, and third, is it sufficient that


the Government's position and interpretation is


reasonable, as opposed to compelled by the statutory


language?


The plain meaning of the word denial is a


refusal to grant the relief requested.  Our position is


that when ATF turns around and sends us a letter saying,


we're not going to act, that is -- it's not a failure to

act, it's a refusal to act.  That is a denial, and I can


point to their own regulation that means it must be so.


Under subsection (i)(1)(3) of the governing


regulation, which unfortunately is not reproduced in any


of the documents -- we do cite it, I apologize, but it is


not quoted in any of the appendices.  Under that


provision, ATF said that any person who is a firearms


licensee -- let me briefly draw the distinction here, and


that is, there are people who are allowed to have firearms


under State law, but there are federally licensed dealers,


importers, collectors.


In the latter class, any person who submits an


application to ATF is allowed to continue operating for 30


days, until 30 days after the denial.  If the Government


is -- and that's a quote, of the denial of the


application.


If the Government is correct here, it would make


the profoundly -- have the profoundly illogical


consequence that no licensed collector has ever been


denied, and they all have the right to continue operating.


QUESTION:  Well, that's true if we assume your


first premise, that a failure to act is a denial, and


that's the question.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Oh, no, just the reverse,


Justice Souter.  Let me be clear.  The regulation says

that you get to keep operating under your license until 30


days after the denial.  What I'm saying is, if you accept


Mr. Kneedler's premise that all these letters that ATF has


been sending out are not denials --


QUESTION:  No, but the -- that provision assumes


that there is going to be action upon the request, that


the ATF or the Treasury will take it under advisement and


in effect say, yes, we'll tell you yes or no when we've


had time, and that's not what is happening here, and if


that, in fact, is a fair distinction, then the statute


you're just referring to doesn't even apply.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Souter, if the


Government is correct -- and I won't belabor this point. 


If the Government is correct that the ATF letters don't


count as denials, then every licensed dealer in the United


States can continue operating indefinitely.


QUESTION:  Well, once again, we're just going


around in a circle.  If we accept your premise, sure.  If


we don't accept your premise that a refusal to act and, in


fact, a very candid refusal to act is tantamount to a


denial, then your conclusion doesn't follow and the


statute that you refer to doesn't apply.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I'll move on, then.  I


respectfully disagree, but I -- and I think the language


will track in our direction, but let me move on, because

Justice Breyer had two subsidiary questions.


QUESTION:  In respect to that, is there an


instance where they sent a letter back to a firearms


licensee saying, well, we aren't going to process this


because of the statute, and then the firearms licensee


said, well, you haven't denied it, I'll stay in business,


and then they went to the firearms licensee and said, no,


you can't stay in business?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I don't know the answer to that


question.


QUESTION:  All right.  Well, if we don't know


the answer to that, we don't know, in other words, whether


or not this reg does or does not stand in the way.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, my impression --


QUESTION:  So I understand --


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  My impression is that it's a


form letter that goes out to everyone.


QUESTION:  Uh-huh.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Now, you -- I had promised to


come back to the question of whether, in this case, it


matters that we didn't get what this Court would conclude


to be a technical denial letter, notwithstanding if you


accept the rest of our argument that we have the right to


compel the Secretary to give us one,  So to play this out,


our position is that the Secretary had the duty to act.

The question back to us is, well, maybe the Secretary


didn't act here.


My point is, that doesn't matter.  The question


presented by -- before this Court, if I could take you to


it, is that -- is fundamentally, and this is the text of


it, whether a Federal district court has the authority to


grant relief.  The Government has never contended, again,


in the district court that there was an insufficient


premise for us to be in district court.


The question before this Court is whether or not


the right -- excuse me, the provision for judicial review


in section 925(c) has been repealed, and that takes us


back to your third question, Justice Breyer, or third


subsidiary one, and that is, is it enough -- and this is


Justice Souter's point.  Isn't it enough for us to


recognize basically what Congress was after here, and I


will turn to the answer.  It is no.


TVA v. Hill, Will, Robertson, many other,


Dickerson, of this Court's precedents make perfectly


clear, and this was the question that Justice Scalia


started out with, that an appropriations repeal has to be


categorical.  The conflict between the two statutes,


section 925(c) and the appropriations law, have to be


irreconcilable, and that is not the case here.


QUESTION:  I don't know that that was the

holding of Dickerson.  I mean, they went into legislative


history -- you couldn't just say it jumped out at you.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, then I


will take you to TVA v. Hill, which does address this


issue.  The Court has made perfectly clear that the kind


of legislative history here is the kind of legislative


history that would draw Justice Souter and possibly


Justice Breyer to the conclusion that we know basically


what Congress was trying to do.  Those are Appropriations


Committee reports, and this Court could not have been more


clear that those are not an accurate indicia of


congressional intent.  There are --


QUESTION:  Mr. Goldstein, before we get into


legislative history and how it bears on this, I see


Congress having established traditional roles where the


executive was going to be the investigator, the court was


going to be the reviewer.  The agency says, we have no


authority to act.  When a court says, we don't have


authority to act, it's not granting or denying the relief


requested, so isn't that the proper way to look at what


the agency is doing?  When it says, we have no authority


to act, it isn't granting or denying.


And then on the court, the court said, Congress


set us up to be a court of review, not first view.  The


agency hasn't looked at it because it says it has no

authority to do it.  Congress did not give us the


authority, ever, to take a first view of this.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, let me -- can


I start at the end of what I think is the consequence of


several of these questions, and then come back to the


difference between administrative review and judicial


review, and whether this would just be unknown to American


law?


The very best we think that the Government can


get out of this argument is a judgment of this Court that


says we were entitled to a remand to the Secretary.  When


we came to Federal district court and asked for relief,


the best the Government could do was an order that says,


no, you should have acted.


What can't be the case, we believe, is that the


Secretary would be able to just let these things pile up


on his desk and say, I've never denied them, tough.


Now, the -- what we take --


QUESTION:  He didn't deny them.  He said the


agency has no authority to rule on these applications.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right, and if we conclude that's


not a denial, we can't get into court.


The Government's answer, I think, if we move


down the road, will be that we should file another


lawsuit, an APA lawsuit that says, to compel agency action

unreasonably withheld, and if you take that position, if


you conclude that this is agency inaction instead of an


agency refusal to act, the surreply to that, the answer is


that you should treat this as an APA action.  The


provision that Mr. Kneedler is quoting to you, 5 U.S.C.


703, says that the form of an action under the APA shall


be the special review provision provided by statute, and


that's section 925(c).


If we were required to file under the APA we


did.  That's --


QUESTION:  The serious underlying question here


is, I agree with you that you found a literal way around


this, and so you're saying, well, if there's a literal way


around it, and you have a statute saying do it, that you


ought to do it, whatever the form of the action is to get


the case here, and I guess the underlying thing is, well,


my goodness, everyone knows what Congress wants here. 


It's perfectly obvious.


And so a Secretary who said, I'm not going to


enforce this statute because Congress doesn't want me to


even though there's a literal way I could do it without


technically violating the actual language of the


prohibition, does the Secretary have the right to do that? 


Well, I would think the answer to that question's yes.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The answer --

 QUESTION:  Because otherwise Congress can't


work.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, the answer to the question


is no, and let me explain why.


(Laughter.)


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Kneedler -- thankfully.


Mr. Kneedler framed the question as whether or


not the Secretary abused his discretion by not withdrawing


the delegation, by saying, I knew what Congress was up to,


this is my agency, I know how this thing works.


The answer is that this is not a question of


abuse of discretion.  It is a question of a clear


statutory command.  Section 925(c) says, we can apply to


the Secretary, and clearly contemplates that the Secretary


will act on these things.  It's not an option.


QUESTION:  Mr. Goldstein, let me just be sure


about one thing.  Is your submission limited to cases that


you think are totally clear on their face, or does it


cover cases when there are marginal issues of fact?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The right to apply to the


Secretary would remain.  We think it's clear that the


Secretary, once his obligation to act is recognized, will


set up standards.  He'll say things like, I'm only going


to grant relief if it's an -- the legislative history


refers to a technical or unintentional violation where

there are sworn statements in front of me that make


perfectly clear this person is no threat whatsoever.


That will be up to the Secretary.  The Secretary


will get to decide, and if he's granting too many


applications, Congress will come along and say, no funding


under this or any other act shall be expended to


investigate or act on appropriation, on 925(c)


applications.


The critical thing, and the -- is that the


Government does not dispute that this appropriations rider


ever since 1993 is in the subdivision that applies only to


ATF.  If you want to talk about Congress working, they


need clear instructions.  We can't have the executive


branch out here saying, I don't really like this statute,


and so I'm going to infer that it's been repealed, and we


can't have the courts doing that, too.  It will take no


effort whatsoever, if this is what Congress really


intends, to strip away the statute and to do it in


appropriations law.


QUESTION:  So I'm still left with -- assuming


all that, I'm still left with the problem that you've


asked for the court to make the decision rather than


asking to have the Secretary make the decision.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  We have a, now, I think,


a different question of administrative law, and that is

the fundamental principle, in the APA context or a


parallel like 925(c), is it only the court that can enter


the order saying, you have a right to relief?  Or does --


where's the proper order, send it to the Secretary and


saying, it would be an abuse of discretion, it's


absolutely clear under the statute you're entitled to it.


Now, the court here did the latter.  If this


Court decided that was technically incorrect, it could


reverse on that ground and say, no, no, no, the correct


technical judgment is to put it back in the hands of the


Secretary.


QUESTION:  But you didn't ask for it to be put


back in the hands of the Secretary.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And neither did the Government.


QUESTION:  You're saying that the court had an


obligation to give you something you didn't even ask for?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Justice Scalia, they gave us


what we asked for.  I apologize for that.  If --


QUESTION:  That was the wrong thing.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  If they should have --


(Laughter.)


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  If they should have done


something else, then this Court can tell it so, but we --


I don't think it's fair to hold us to the position that


the Government did not object, that only the Secretary --

in this case, when you go through the district court


record, that the only proper remedy is an order to the


Secretary to grant us relief, as opposed to granting us


relief personally.  Remember, as I quoted to you from the


findings of fact, the Government left the playing field


here.  It admitted that with all of the evidence we had,


no one could reasonably dispute that Tommy Bean was


perfectly entitled and represented no threat.  The only


question -- they participated on the fact side of the


case.  Their only argument that they attempted to advance


was that the district court was powerless to do anything


at all.


With respect, we did what we were supposed to do


to get relief here, and if the Court decides that it only


should have gone to the Secretary, that's a minor change


in the judgment. 


QUESTION:  I still think participation by ATF in


the judicial proceeding is within 925(c), and Congress was


forbidden that, too.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kennedy, let me be clear


on what money was spent, because there were technical


questions about this.  The United States Attorney's Office


participated here, not --


QUESTION:  There was an ATF agent who testified,


and that's within 925 -- the purview of 925(c), and

Congress says you can't do that.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  With respect, there was one


agent who was one witness.  The appropriations statute


says you may not investigate, which was not what he was


doing, and you may not act upon, which was not what he was


doing, upon applications, which this was not.  It was a


petition under section 925(c).  There was no prohibition,


and the ATF agent did not object that I'm not allowed to


be there.  We did -- we put the witnesses on that we were


supposed to.


QUESTION:  Can I ask, under your view of things


can the Secretary use assistance, or would that constitute


a delegation?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  He can.  What he can do is, he


can take and is required to take up into his own hands, as


the three examples I gave to Justice Ginsburg, the


responsibility.  He can detail.  He has a budget of $123


million, $141,000, and he can take them up into his hands


and say, look, I've got these sworn statements, and he


could require, I want 10 sworn statements.  He could


require, I want 20, and he can have someone confirm that


that's the right person.  But what we do think, and this


goes back to the Chief Justice's question, is that we do


not think that Congress contemplated that the Secretary


would spend $20 million granting 3,000 applications.  If

QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, you have 10 minutes


remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, the argument


that the Secretary could have granted relief was never


raised below in this case.  It was not raised in the court


of appeals, it wasn't raised in the brief in opp, it was


raised for the first time in respondent's brief, and again


if -- we think the proper avenue for that would be a suit


to the -- suing the Secretary under the APA or --


QUESTION:  No, but his point, and actually


although he raised it late, is certainly a factor.  That


seems to me the most powerful argument, that there's no


point sending it back to the Secretary, really, even


though that's the correct procedural route, if the


Secretary under the law has no choice, and what he's


saying is, the Secretary under the law has no choice, and


the reason is because literally this appropriations


measure doesn't cover the Secretary's action.


And given the absence of that, the Secretary's


under a statute that tells him, act, and moreover, he

adds, this is a very bad way to repeal a statute, that


really under normal legislative principles if they want to


repeal it, repeal it; and therefore it isn't wrong for us


to consider this literally in this circumstance. So that,


I think, is -- that's an argument that's worth hearing


what the reply is.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- first of all, I think


it is wrong.  It would be a different disposition of the


judgment, but with respect --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe we'd reach a different --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.


QUESTION:  The disposition would be one thing --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 


QUESTION:  -- but he's saying, that's really


what the heart of this is about.


MR. KNEEDLER:  There's -- first of all, let me


make another point which I think goes very much to the


Secretary's authority.  We point out on page 4 and 5 of


our reply brief general principles of appropriations law


that are really a particular application of the general


principle that the specific governs the general, and under


appropriations law, when Congress appropriates a pot of


money for a particular task, that's all that can be spent


for that task.  Money can't be drawn from some other pot


to perform that task.

 We think that principle should apply a fortiori,


or at least it's a reasonable interpretation for the


Secretary to make, that when Congress has prohibited the


expenditure of any funds by the agency to whom the


Secretary has delegated that authority, that Congress did


not expect money to be drawn from some other pot.  That is


a general principle of appropriations law.  At the very


least, the Secretary should be given the opportunity --


QUESTION:  What is the authority for saying


that's a general principle of appropriations law?


MR. KNEEDLER:  There are a number of Comptroller


General opinions that we cite at the bottom of page 4 of


our reply brief, and it's against principles like that


that agencies always act in deciding how they're going to


spend money.  But if this argument was going to be made,


the right disposition would be to present it to the


Secretary, so the Secretary can construe this statute,


just like all the other statutes that need to be


administered, and the way to do that --


QUESTION:  It's one thing to say that when


Congress says we give $500,000 to subunit B to perform


this function, you cannot use $2 million from somewhere


else to perform the same function.  That's one thing. 


It's something quite different, however, to say that when


you have forbidden one unit from doing something, and

there is a general statute which allows the Secretary to


do it, that that prohibition also applies to the


Secretary.  I just don't think it's parallel.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, at the very least it would


not be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to


decline to withdraw the delegation.  That, we think, is


the question that would arise in that situation, because


the Secretary now may not act on these applications. 


He -- the ATF acts under the general direction of the


Secretary, but if the Secretary directed ATF to grant one


of these applications, he would be directing an illegal


act.  He would have to withdraw the delegation.  He hasn't


been asked by respondent to do that, which would require a


petition for rulemaking.


The Secretary, in deciding whether to take this


power back to himself, could at the very least take into


account what Congress has said about not wanting these


applications to be acted upon by ATF, and also the reasons


the Congress gave, which is that this is a very subjective


undertaking, with high risk, and Congress decided, we


don't want this function being performed because of the


potential consequences.  We want this money to be used for


other purposes in fighting crime.  All of that would make


it entirely reasonable for the Secretary not to take on


this function himself.

 The other important point to notice is that --


QUESTION:  Well, he has a statutory obligation


to perform the function --


MR. KNEEDLER:  I was just going to 


-- 

QUESTION:  -- which has not been canceled by the


appropriations law.


MR. KNEEDLER:  He does not -- nothing in the


statute says that the Secretary must act on applications. 


It says the Secretary may grant relief.  It does not


require him to grant relief, and the Secretary could very


easily withhold action, which is, after all, what Congress


required ATF to do.


QUESTION:  What, on the ground that it's like


the pardon power, it's like a matter of grace, or


something like that?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, very much so.  It's -- it's,


or, as the Court said four or five terms ago in the Yang


case that we cite in our brief with respect to relief from


deportation, it is exactly like the pardon power, and it's


written in very broad terms.  It establishes several


preconditions, whether the person would be dangerous to


the public safety, and whether granting it would not be


contrary to the public interest, and even then the


Secretary is not required to grant relief.


This is a very broad discretionary power, and I

think it ties into what Justice Ginsburg was asking


earlier, wouldn't this be an extraordinary power to give


to the Federal district courts.  Indeed it would, because


the question is not just whether the person might be


dangerous, but whether granting relief would be contrary


to the public interest.  That's not the sort of


determination a court can make in the first instance. 


It's something that Congress has assigned to the


Secretary. 


In this case, even if respondent is correct that


he wouldn't be dangerous, it doesn't follow that


restoration of firearms abilities would be consistent with


the public interest.  That's a judgment that Congress


invested in the Secretary, not in the courts, and as


Justice Kennedy pointed out, ATF could not investigate an


application for relief in connection with a judicial


proceeding any more than it could in an administrative


proceeding.


The ATF agent who testified in this case was one


of respondent's witnesses.  He was not called by the


Government.


QUESTION:  Is testifying investigation?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Pardon me?

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, that would be -- we did not

object, the Government did not object in the district


court to his testifying.  He was just testifying as to


what he had looked up in the records, but an investigation


involves far more than that.


In fact, the AUSA in this case cross-examined


Mr. Bean and a couple of other witnesses, but that's far


short of the investigation that Congress expected ATF to


undertake when it was performing these functions, and that


it did undertake, which involved an investigation of the


crime, neighbors, not just the people whom respondent has


put forward, but ATF would go out and develop its own


independent leads.  None of that capability exists when


the Government is responding to an application filed in


court.


So for these reasons we think it is --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- if you've had a chance to complete


your rebuttal, I had one question.  Do you think the


Secretary's authority under the statute is broad enough


so, even without any act of Congress or anything in the


appropriation, the Secretary could have adopted a policy,


we would rather use our money on other purposes and so


we're not going to process any applications?


MR. KNEEDLER:  I do believe it's -- it is broad

enough.  I think the Secretary -- all it says is, the


Secretary may grant relief.  I think the Secretary could


decide, and in fact the regulations, 144(d) has some


categorical exclusions that the Secretary had adopted but


the district court in this case ignored.  Even -- we think


the court couldn't act at all, but it even ignored the


standards that the Secretary had adopted in the public


interest to implement what would be a public interest


standard under the statute.  The district court ignored


them, so we think that the Secretary could make a


categorical determination not to grant relief.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Kneedler.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
