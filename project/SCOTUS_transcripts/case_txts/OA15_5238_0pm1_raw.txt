CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  No.  15­5238,  Nichols  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States. 

 

            

Mr.  Hansmeier. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  DANIEL  T.  HANSMEIER 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

Until  three  weeks  ago,  a  sex  offender  who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

moved  to  a  foreign  country  was  not  subject  to  any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  registration  requirement  in  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless  and  until  he  returned  to  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Below,  the  Tenth  Circuit  nonetheless  held  that  it  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  crime  for  a  sex  offender  who  moves  to  a  foreign 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

country  to  fail  to  ­­ to  report  that  move.  The  Tenth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  was  wrong  for  three  overarching  reasons.  First, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

SORNA's  text  does  not  include  a  requirement  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unregister. 

            

Second,  SORNA's  statutory  history  reveals 

 

 

 

 

that  if  Congress  wanted  to  include  a  requirement  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unregister,  it  would  have  done  so  just  as  it  did  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SORNA's  enactment.  And  finally,  a  requirement  to 

   

  

 

 

 

unregister  is  unnecessary  because  all  56  jurisdictions

require  sex  offenders  to  unregister.  Failure  to  do  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  violation  of  the  jurisdiction's  law  and  not  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That  would  be  true  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  law  in  this  case.  It  would  have  violated  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  law.  Is  that  true? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  He  had  an  ­­ he  had  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  to  tell  Kansas  of  his  departure,  correct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  How  does  it  work 

  

 

 

 

 

normally?  Say  a  person  under  SORNA  leaves  Kansas  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

goes  to  Illinois  and  registers  in  Illinois.  Is  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  obligation,  one,  for  him  to  register  or  deregister 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Kansas,  and  does  Illinois  have  an  obligation  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notify  Kansas? 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Correct.  So  what  happens  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

practice  is  that  SORNA  sets  minimum  Federal  standards. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  those  minimum  Federal  standards  are  supplemented  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  States,  the  additional,  more  stringent  requirements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One  of  those  more  stringent  requirements  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation  to  unregister,  and,  yes,  Kansas  has  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation. 

            

So  in  your  hypothetical,  Justice  Ginsburg, 

 

 

 

 

 

that  individual  has  to  unregister  in  Kansas  under  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  and  when  he  gets  to  Illinois,  that's  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  to  tell  Illinois  ­­ to  register,  to  update

the  registration  in  Illinois  because  that's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  where  he  resides.  And  in  Illinois  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16921(b)(3)  will  tell  ­­ will  tell  Kansas  of  the  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  move. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  this  is  in  addition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  ­­ the  other  venues. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  If  there  are  any,  correct. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  it  would  be  both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  and  a  State  requirement.  But  in  one  case,  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  SORNA  person  and  the  other,  it's  the  other  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  I  think  that's  correct,  yes. 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Under  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  sense  does  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

make  if  you  have  Federal  law  that  says  we're  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

add  this  ­­ these  ­­ these  sanctions  when  you  violate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  State  law?  And  in  the  one  case,  if  you  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

register,  you're  triggered  and  State  law  says,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  got  to  unregister  too.  But  if  you  unregister  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  don't  unregister,  that's  not  included  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law?  Why  would  ­­ why  would  Congress  draft  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  like  that? 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  they 

   

   

  

 

 

would  have  done  that  because  ­­ and  if  you  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative  history,  I  think  this  is  somewhat  clear. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

What  Congress  was  concerned  about  were  missing  sex

offenders  not  at  initial  registration  but  when  ­­ when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sex  offender  crossed  State  lines.  So  ­­ so  by  ­­ by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring  registration  when  you  get  to  the  jurisdiction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  was  the  aim  because  that's  when  offenders 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  going  missing. 

 

 

            

Now,  the  ­­ the  departure  jurisdiction  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  relationship  between  ­­ very  much  a  relationship 

   

   

 

 

 

 

between  the  State  and  its  citizens.  And  that  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

played  out  if  you  think  of  a  State  sex  offender  who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  live  in  Kansas.  And  if  he  were  to  have  a  Federal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  to  unregister  in  Kansas,  that's  actually  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable  under  SORNA  because  the  travel  has  to  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  or  before  he's  ­­ he  can't  register. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  Mr.  Nichols  were  a  State  sex  offender 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ he's  only  committed  an  offense  when  he  leaves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas.  And  that  doesn't  ­­ and  that's  a  problem  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  saying  that  there's  a  Federal  requirement  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unregister  in  ­­ in  the  departure  jurisdiction.  Now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  may  work  for  Federal  offenders,  but  I  think  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea  is  that  there  are  Federalism  concerns  underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SORNA.  And  those  Federalism  concerns  come  into  play 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  an  individual  crosses  State  lines,  and  that's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimum  requirement  in  SORNA. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  there's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

problem  to  require  him  to  register,  but  all  of  a  sudden

there  is  a  problem  to  require  him  to  unregister? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well,  it's  not  a  problem. 

   

  

 

 

 

It's  just  SORNA  left  it  to  the  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  They  left  the 

  

 

 

 

 

unregistering  to  the  States  but  not  the  registering? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Not  a  ­­ not  the  updating 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  registration  in  a  new  State,  correct. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  curious.  You 

  

  

 

 

responded  to  Justice  Ginsburg  that  he  did  violate  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  Could  the  United  States  have  asked  for  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extradition  based  on  the  State  law  violation?  Is  this  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permanent  hole  or  did  they  just  pick  the  wrong  law  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seek  extradition  under? 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well,  Justice  Ginsburg's 

  

 

 

 

example  was  interstate  travel. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  no,  no.  I'm  saying, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

they  asked  him  to  be  ­­

for  him  to  be  returned  under  the  State  law  violation? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  There's  actually  a  provision 

   

  

 

 

in  SORNA,  I  think  it's  19  ­­ 16917,  which  requires 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  ­­ the  marshals,  Federal  officials  to  assist  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  in  enforcing  the  registration  requirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  is  that  a  yes? 

   

  

 

 

 

MR.  HANSMEIER:  I  think  yes. 

    

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  really  what  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

talking  about  is  that  they  asked  for  the  extradition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  wrong  law. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  I  think  that's  exactly 

    

 

 

 

right.  And  ­­ and  Mr.  Nichols  was  also  on  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervised  release,  so  there  was  a  connection  there  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ the  connection  to  the  Federal  aspect  of  it  was  his  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  his  supervision. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Did  leave  ­­ did  leaving 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  country  without  notice  violate  the  terms  of  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervised  release? 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  It  did.  And  he  was  ­­ his 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervised  release  was  revoked.  He  ­­ he  received  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ten­month  sentence  for  that.  And  then  they  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecuted  him  Federally,  and  he  got  another  six­month 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yeah.

the  United  States,  no  foreign  travel  ­­ he  decides  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  wants  to  move  to  the  West  Coast,  so  he  checks  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas.  But  he's  not  sure  where  he  wants  to  live,  so  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drives  to  Washington,  Oregon,  California,  takes  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weeks.  What  would  the  requirement  for  registration  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there? 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Right.  Well,  I  think  it 

   

  

  

 

 

gets  a  little  confusing  with  the  interstate  travel 

   

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  don't  really  address  it  because  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  There  is  an  arrival  jurisdiction.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

think  under  our  rule,  what  16913(c)  says  is  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  unregister.  You  ­­ you  register  in  the  arrival 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  Now,  there  may  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  the  arrival

what  it's  going  to  be.  He's  just  there  two  days.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  going  to  go  two  days,  and  he's  going  to  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around. 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  SORNA 

   

   

  

 

 

doesn't  do  a  good  job  of  this.  The  definition  of  ­­

the  location  where  one  habitually  lives.  And  so  I  do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  SORNA  does  not  do  a  good  job  of  this,  but  I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  sure  that  that  wasn't  unintended.  Because  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  about  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  window,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­business­day  window  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Yes. 

  

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  ­­ that  ­­ that  actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

creates  a  system  where  an  individual  is  not  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registry  for  a  certain  amount  of  time.  If  you  think  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  change  of  name,  which  you  have  to  report,  if  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  business  days  to  do  that,  there  is  going  to  be  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  five  days  where  that  registry  is  inaccurate,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  just  the  way  it  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think,  although  we  might  not  want  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

admit  it  or  ­­ but  the  ­­ the  reality  is  that  SORNA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  creates  these  gaps  by  allowing  offenders  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period  of  time  to  register.  And  I  think  Congress  did 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  because  it  knew  the  States  could  supplement  SORNA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These  are  just  minimum  standards. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  have  a  textual  argument 

   

  

 

 

 

that  I  ­­ that  I  understand,  but  one  of  the  arguments 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  mentioned  at  the  outset  was  that  an  examination  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legislative  history  shows  that  Congress  intended  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

produce  the  sort  of  result  that  was  produced  here,  and  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wonder  if  that's  really  a  plausible  argument.

If  you're  correct,  then  two  things  happen; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  least  two  things  happen.  One,  Kansas  retains  on  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  an  inaccurate  ­­ inaccurate  information  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence  of  a  sex  offender,  which  can  have  a  lot  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

adverse  consequences  for  a  lot  of  people.  I  don't  see 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

why  Congress  would  have  wanted  that  to  remain. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

And  do  you  really  think  Congress  was 

 

 

 

 

 

unconcerned  about  the  United  States  exporting  pedophiles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Philippines  or  to  other  countries?  Do  you  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  they  were  not  concerned  about  not  only  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

human  rights  implications  of  that,  but  our  relations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  other  countries? 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well  ­­ well,  I  think  if  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  legislative  history,  there  ­­ there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  to  indicate  that  ­­ that  SORNA  in  2006  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  to  do  with  international  travel.  And  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  new  legislation  is  important  in  this  regard,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  ­­ I  don't  ­­ I  don't  know  that  I  said 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

"intended."  If  I  said  that,  I  didn't  mean  it.  I  think 

    

   

   

  

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  history  of  it  shows  more  or  less  that  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1996,  each  State  had  a  registration  system.  One  year 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

later,  Congress  required  departure  notification, 

 

 

 

 

required  unregistration.  By  2006,  that  had  happened  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  jurisdictions. 

 

 

            

So  I  think  what  I  mean  by  the  "statutory

history"  is  that  that's  ­­ that's  an  indication  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  no  unregistration  requirement  put  in  SORNA, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  existed  in  all  the  jurisdictions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  if  I  could  then  come 

   

  

 

 

 

 

back  to  Justice  Ginsburg's  hypothetical  of  someone  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  client  who  moves  from  Kansas  to  Illinois,  what,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  language  of  the  statute,  would  prevent  that  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  going  to  the  registry  office  in  Kansas  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

departing  and  reporting  there  that  he  was  moving  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Illinois  and  his  new  address  in  Illinois  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  it  would  be?  Why  does  that  not  fit  under  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ under  the  language  of  the  statute?  Or  would  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree  that  it  does? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well,  I  would  agree  that 

   

  

 

 

 

there's  nothing  that  prevents  him  from  doing  that,  and  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  agree  that  he  should  do  that  under  State  law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  if  you  ­­ if  you  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  that,  then  I  don't  see  why  ­­ why  there  is  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  that  situation  and  the  situation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  ­­ the  person  leaves  Kansas  and  goes  to  the

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well,  what  ­­ but  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

agree  that  it's  a  ­­ it's  sufficient  or  a  Federal

distinction  I  would  make  ­­

   

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  would  it  not  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  HANSMEIER:  ­­ it's  not  a  requirement. 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  would  it  not  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  under  42  U.S.C.  16913(c)? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well,  because  that  provision 

  

 

 

 

 

is  still  going  to  require  ­­ and  the  government,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  agrees  with  this.  There  is  still  a  ­­ the  ­­ the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  is  to  report  in  the  arrival  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  it  says,  "shall  not, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

later  than  three  business  days  after  each  change  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residence,  appear  in  person  in  at  least  one  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  pursuant  to  subsection  (a)  and  inform  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  of  the  change  of  address." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  prior  to  leaving,  he  is  within  the  period 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  not  later  than  what  ­­ than  three  business  days  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  change  of  residence.  And  at  that  time  when  he  goes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  registry  office  in  Kansas,  he  is  residing  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas.  So  he  falls  within  subsection  (a). 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well,  this  is  on  ­­ the  text 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  on  page  11A  of  the  blue  book.  I  think  ­­ I  think 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  ­­ the  blue  brief.  I  think  what's  important 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ is  if  you  looked  directly  above  subsection  (c)  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection  (e),  I  think  this  is  what  you're  really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  Congress  did.  Subsection  (b)  sets  forth  two

subsections,  the  first  of  which  begins  with  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"before."  The  second  of  which  begins  with  the  phrase 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"not  later  than  three  business  days  after." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  if  Congress  had  meant  to  do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  structurally  similar  in  subsection  (c),  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  done  it,  but  it  didn't.  Instead,  it  just  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"not  later  than  three  business  days  after."  And  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  the  change  is  a  trigger,  and  I  think  that's  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  key,  and  it's  similar  to  subsection  (b)(2)  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  trigger  is  being  sentenced.  And  ­­ and  so  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

event  has  to  happen,  that  occurrence  has  to  happen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  you  report  it. 

 

 

 

            

And  so  in  subsection  (c),  until  the  change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens,  you  can't  really  report  it  and  satisfy  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  now,  under  current 

  

 

 

 

 

law,  under  the  2016  change  ­­

immediately  provide  that  information  to  all  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions  in  which  the  defendant  is  required  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

register.  Here,  there  were  none. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well,  correct.  And  ­­ and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

typically,  there  may  not  be.  But  that  ­­ that  language, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think,  captures  the  defendant  ­­ for  instance,  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  come  from,  a  lot  of  people  live  in  Kansas  and  work  in

jurisdiction  would  notify  the  residence  jurisdiction  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vice  versa.

It's  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  There  was  a  reference  to 

   

  

 

 

 

a  form  that  everyone  under  SORNA  signs  that  acknowledges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  requirement  to  register  on  commencement  change, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination  of  residence,  and  give  21  days  notice  before

Nichols  signed  such  a  form,  did  he  not? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  HANSMEIER:  He  did. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  what  you're  saying  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  form  has  no  operative  effect,  the  fact  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  do  what  he  ­­ what  he  undertook  to  do  in  the  form 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  a  Federal  offense. 

   

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well,  what  I'm  saying  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  that's  a  State  form.  That's  actually  the  State  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas.  So  SORNA  is  implemented  by  the  States.  So  each 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  ­­ there's  not  some  Federal  form  for  sex  offenders 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  sign.  There  are  no  Federal  registration  offices. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  are  no  Federal  officials  who  do  these  things.

This  is  a  local  thing.  A  lot  of  it  is  county  sheriffs.

required  to  register,  to  update  your  registration  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  by  Kansas  law,  which  is  much  more  in­depth  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law.  And  so  that's  where  that  language  comes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  it's  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

register,  that  is  ­­ you  said  there's  no  separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  entity.  So  all  these  requirements  in  SORNA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  satisfied  by  informing  the  State  office.  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Well,  I'm  saying,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

practice,  that's  what  has  to  happen.  There's  no  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  you  can  tell.  You  register  with  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  find  interesting  the 

    

 

 

 

new  legislation.  As  I  see  it,  it's  getting  away  from 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  reside  or  anything  else.  It  just  says  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  going  to  travel  to  a  foreign  place,  you  have  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  the  United  States,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Yes.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Is  there  anything  in 

  

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ in  that  law  that  requires  the  U.S.  to  tell  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  the  person's  left  ­­ that  they've  left? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  I  think  there  is  a  provision 

    

   

 

 

 

for  that. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  didn't  ­­ I  didn't 

    

   

 

 

have  a  complete  chance  to  go  through  it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

MR.  HANSMEIER:  I  don't  know  that  that 

    

 

 

 

provision  made  its  way  into  the  ­­ the  government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supplemental  brief. 

 

            

Yes.  I  think  at  (4)(a),  if  I'm  reading  this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

correctly,  there's  an  implementation  provision. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  the  problem  at  issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here  has  been  completely  resolved  by  new  legislation? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HANSMEIER:  Oh,  I  think  that's 

   

  

 

 

absolutely  true.  I  think  if  there  ­­ whether  there  was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  gap  or  not,  whether  it  was  intended  or  not,  the  bottom 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  is  that  it's  gone  away.  And  there  ­­ there's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  to  take  an  atextual  interpretation  of  16913(c). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  ­­ I  do  want  to  mention  something  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  in  Reynolds,  because  I  think  this  Court  is  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  path  as  us.  Reynolds  was  the  second  SORNA  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Court  heard.  And  there  was  ­­ there's  a  point 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Reynolds  in  which  the  Court  is  talking  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant,  and  it  says  ­­ it  says  that  he  was  in  prison,

he  was  released,  he  registered  in  Missouri,  but  he  moved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Pennsylvania.  And  it  says  "without  updating  his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Missouri  information,"  and  then  this  Court  puts  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parentheses,  "as  Missouri  law  required  and  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registering  in  Pennsylvania."  Then  it  goes  on  to  talk 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  how  the  failure  to  register  in  Pennsylvania  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16139(c)  offense.  That's  our  position.  And  I  think 

   

  

  

 

 

 

this  Court  ­­ you  said  it  in  Reynolds.  It  had  nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  with  the  holding.  But  I  ­­ I  do  think  that's  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  in  this  Court's  mind,  at  least. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  I  do  want  to  note  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  reading  defining  the  supplemental 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  is  one  where  the  defendant  appears  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resident  on  the  ­­ on  ­­ on  a  registry  creates  a  really 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weird  situation  where  Mr.  Nichols,  when  he  lived  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Philippines,  because  he  still  appeared  on  the  Kansas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registry,  under  SORNA,  he  still  lives  there.  He  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resides  there.  And  that's  just  not  right  under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  and  the  way  SORNA  defines  "resides."  And  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  not  right  as  a  matter  of  common  sense.  You  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reside  in  Kansas  when  you  actually  live  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Philippines. 

            

And  with  that,  if  there  are  no  further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions,  thank  you. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

Mr.  Gannon. 

 

            

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CURTIS  E.  GANNON 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

SORNA  required  Petitioner  to  register  and  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keep  his  registration  information  current.  This  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  unregistration  requirement,  but  a  requirement  to  keep 

   

 

 

 

 

 

his  registration  current  in  the  jurisdictions  where  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  registered  by  timely  giving  notice  of  any  change  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residence  to  at  least  one  jurisdiction  involved. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  disagree  with  Petitioner.  We  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  was  a  jurisdiction  involved  pursuant  to 

   

 

 

 

 

subsection  (a)  here,  both  because  of  the  meaning  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase,  which  is  more  capacious  than  just  taking  down 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  phrase  that  appeared  in  subsection  (a),  and  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it's  reinforced  by  Section  16921(b)(3). 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  it  your  position  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

he  was  required  to  notify  Kansas  both  that  he  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terminating  his  residence  and  that  he  was  moving  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Philippines,  or  just  that  he  was  terminating  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residence? 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Here  it's  just  that  he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

terminating  his  residence.  He  could  have  given 

  

 

 

 

 

 

information  about  where  he  was  going.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  he  was  not  required 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  But  that  is  ­­ that  is  not  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

to? 

            

he  was  being  required  to  do  here.  He  was  being  required 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  keep  his  registration  information  current  by  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  he  will  ­­ where  ­­ where  he  is  residing,  and  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  ­­ he  is  no  longer  going  to  be  residing  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

The  phrase  that  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  ­­ I  think  your  answer 

    

   

 

 

 

was  clear,  but  I  didn't  understand  it. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Would  it  ­­ in  your  view  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  The  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ would  it  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

compliant  with  SORNA  simply  to  say  I  am  leaving  Kansas, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period? 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That  would  have  complied  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

his  obligation  to  keep  his  registration  information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current  with  the  jurisdiction  involved,  yes. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ we  do  think  that  Section  16914(a)(3) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows  him  to  report  where  he  resides  or  will  reside, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  therefore,  he  can  report  future  information,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  the  guidelines,  promulgated  by  the  Attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General  in  2008,  says  that  normally  when  somebody's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moving  from  one  jurisdiction  to  another  jurisdiction,  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  tell  Kansas,  I  am  leaving  Kansas  and  this  is

where  I'm  going  next,  so  Kansas  can  give  that  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  warning. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  the  ­­ the  Philippines 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  a  jurisdiction  under  the  statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That's  correct.  And  so  what  we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  is  key  here  is  that  Kansas  is  still  a  jurisdiction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  pursuant  to  subsection  (a).  Congress  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say  a  jurisdiction  described  in  subsection  (a);  it  said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  jurisdiction  involved  pursuant  to  subsection  (a). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  all  right. 

  

 

 

 

 

How  is  that  the  case  since  subsection  (a)  refers  to  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  where  the  offender  resides,  is  an  employee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  a  student?  When  he's  in  the  Philippines,  there's  no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  jurisdiction  covered  by  SORNA  where  he  resides,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  employee,  or  is  a  student. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That's  correct,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice,  but  we  think  that  that's  not  the  only  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  pulled  in  by  the  phrase,  "jurisdiction  involved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to  subsection  (a)."  He  is  required  to  register 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while  he's  a  registrant  in  Kansas.  He's  required  to

he  has  to  keep  the  registration  information  current.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  he  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  keep  the  registration  current  if  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  where  he  ­­ covered  jurisdiction  where  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resides,  is  an  employee  or  is  a  student. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Otherwise  that

Kansas  is  not  a  ­­ is  not  a  jurisdiction  involved.  But 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  it  were  not  such  a  jurisdiction,  subsection  (c)

jurisdiction.  And  as  Justice  Alito  has  already

MR.  GANNON:  It  does  say  where  he  resides. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  it  also  says  he  has  to  keep  the  registration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  current  there.  And  we  think  that  Section 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16921  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Current  where? 

  

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  In  ­­ in  the  jurisdictions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

where  he  has  been  registered,  where  he  is  residing,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  it  is  current. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ and  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It  is  current  at  all  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  in  which  he  resides  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That  is  true.  I  ­­ I  certainly 

    

   

  

 

 

 

take  the  point.  But  we  think  that  Congress  is  using  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  capacious  phrase  in  subsection  (c)  when  it  says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"jurisdiction  involved  pursuant  to  subsection  (a)." 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  is  inescapably  involved  because  he  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registered  there.  And  we  think  that  this  is  reinforced 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  Section  16921(b)(3)  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  then,  you're  just 

  

 

 

 

 

reading  pursuant  to  subsection  (a)  out  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  No.  I'm  reading  it  to  mean

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Excuse  me,  Mr.  Gannon. 

  

 

 

 

 

It  tells  you  exactly  what  it  means  to  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  ­­

 

            

            

jurisdiction  involved.  It  means  a  jurisdiction  involved 

   

  

 

 

 

pursuant  to  a  particular  subsection  which  focuses  only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

on  his  current  residence.  And  all  the  time  he  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current  resident  of  Kansas,  the  registry  was  accurate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  I  understand  that,  Justice 

    

 

 

 

Kagan,  but  our  view  is  that  this  is  not  the  same  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  a  jurisdiction  described  in  subsection  (a).  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a  more  capacious  word  to  say  it's  involved  pursuant  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection  (a). 

 

            

We  know  that  Kansas  is  involved  here.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  16921(b)(3)  makes  it  clear  that  Kansas  continues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  involved  because  that's  the  provision  that  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  as  soon  as  the  new  change  in  residence  information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  conveyed  to  at  least  one  jurisdiction,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  has  to  give  it  to  every  jurisdiction  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ from  or  to  which  the  change 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  residence  occurs.  So  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  understand  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

understand  your  argument  about  16914(a)(3),  but  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  ­­ what's  the  ­­ the  penalty  for  ­­ the  maximum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty  for  violating  this  provision?

MR.  GANNON:  I  ­­ I  believe  it's  ten  years. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yeah.  I  think 

    

  

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ for  violating  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ ten  years. 

  

 

 

 

 

So  you  think  somebody  is  supposed  to  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's  ­­

 

            

it's  ­­

 

            

provision. 

            

            

this  and  say,  should  I  register?  Obviously  he  doesn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  register  or  unregister,  whatever  it  is.  And  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  okay,  it  says  "involved,"  but  that's  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  described  in.  And  (a)  says  "jurisdiction  where  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offender  resides,"  and  there's  no  place  to  register 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  I  currently  resides.  And  then  he's  supposed  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

say,  ah,  but  16914(a)(3)  says  "resides  or  will  reside." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  And  6  ­­

   

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That's  an  awful  lot 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  ask  a  ­­ a  layperson  to  parse  at  the  penalty  of  ten 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  for  being  wrong.

MR.  GANNON:  It's  ­­ it's  also  a  State  law

violation  pursued?  So  he's  in  the  Philippines,  and  he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extradited  because  on  the  government's  reading  of  SORNA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  he  did  commit  an  offense,  it's  conceded,  under  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That's  true,  Justice  Ginsburg, 

  

 

 

 

 

and  that's  going  to  be  true  in  virtually  every  single 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  of  Section  2250. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why  wasn't  the 

  

 

 

 

extradition  sought  under  that  which  is  clear  and  certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead  of  a  ­­ a  provision  where  there  has  to  be  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strained  interpretation? 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  maybe  we  should  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sought  that  as  well,  but  we  did  think  we  had  a  strong 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  interest  in  this  particular  prosecution  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple  reasons.  He  was  a  Federal  sex  offender.  And 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

as  the  Court  has  already  recognized,  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  a  special  interest  in  ensuring  that  Federal  ­­

Let's  look  at  this.  It's  the  word  "involved."  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  saying  it  means  ever  involved;  is  that  right?

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ in  the  exchange  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

information. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  I'm  trying  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

understand  it.  It  is  a  jurisdiction  that  is  involved  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  special  way.  It  is  a  jurisdiction  that  used  to  be  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residence,  and  it  is  no  longer  a  residence.  And  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

creates  an  involvement  even  after  they're  no  longer  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residence. 

            

You  know,  the  more  I  explain  it,  the  less  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  it. 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That  may  be  my  fault,

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  perhaps  it's  mine  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

well.  But  I  think  that  it's  involved  because  he  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  registered  there  as  a  resident.  And  we  know  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fundamental  purpose  of  this  law,  in  order  to  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sex  offender  registry,  is  to  provide  an  accurate  listing

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  firmly  for  purposes, 

  

 

 

 

 

but  this  one  is  a  ­­ a  little  tough,  because  as  I  read 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  literally,  at  all,  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  get  an 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  ­­ and  you  could  do  the  same  thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're  supposed  to  ­­ and  you  seem  to  be  saying  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Look,  you  said  you're  supposed  ­­ they're  supposed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keep  the  registration  current.  Now,  maybe  there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  somewhere  that  says  when  you're  thinking  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaving,  before  you  leave,  you  have  to  go  tell  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  before  you  leave  of  where  you're  thinking  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going.  So  then  I  looked  up  what  you  have  to  have  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  and  it  says  the  attorney  general  can  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  that  would  say  something  like  I  just  said. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  I  take  it  there  are  no  such  regulations.  And  I  take 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  when  it  ­­ it  says,  you  know,  the  kinds  of  things  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  report,  I  guess.  You  know,  you  could  get

years  in  the  Philippines  where  he  is  employed.  He  now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes  his  employment  and  he  goes  to  work  in  Thailand.

MR.  GANNON:  Because  ­­ no.  Because  Kansas 

  

  

 

 

 

 

was  not  a  registration  where  he  was  listed  as  being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employed.  If  he  were  moving  his  job,  his  employer  ­­

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  We  believe  that  this 

  

 

 

 

 

requirement  is  about  updating  the  registration 

 

 

 

 

 

information  associated  with  his  residence  in  Kansas.

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ and  he  has  not  yet  given 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notification  to  at  least  one  jurisdiction,  that  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  longer  true. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It  seems  to  me  that  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  saying  is  that  each  of  those  offenders  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  recognize  the  underlying  purpose  of  the  law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  to  have  accurate  registries,  and  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  he  can  to  serve  that  underlying  purpose.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  would  ­­ you  know,  it  would  be  good  if  everybody  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  But  the  text  of  the  law  is  something  different. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  you  look  at  this  text  of  the  law,  there's  just  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  that  a  reasonable  reader  reads  that  text  and  says  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  me  to  provide  departure  notification  when  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave  to  another  country. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  you  can  say  well,  he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  keep  it  current,  and  ­­ and  that's  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He  is  ­­ he  should  keep  it  current,  because  we  would  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  sex  registry.  But  the  statute  provides  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  details  about  what  it  means  to  keep  it  current, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  seems  to  me  he  has  conformed  with  every  single 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  those  requirements. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  And  we  just  don't  think  that's

true,  because  Kansas  was  a  jurisdiction  that  he  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  informed  while  he  was  still  a  resident.  That 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  even  require  this  reading  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You  know,  he  could  have,  and

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  he  didn't  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ but  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ this  statutory  language. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  But  it  is  subsection  (c)  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides  the  content  for  what  it  means  to  keep  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration  current,  and  it  says  you  have  to  inform  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  one  jurisdiction.  He  informed  zero  jurisdictions. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  problem  here. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It  ­­ it  says  he  has  to  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informed  at  least  one  jurisdiction  involved  pursuant  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection  (a),  and  subsection  (a)  makes  clear  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  jurisdictions  that  they're  talking  about  are  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions  in  which  he  currently  either  lives,  works, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  is  a  student. 

   

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  And  that  was  true  the  morning 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  he  left  Kansas  and  the  morning  he  was  going  to

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ today  is  my  last  day  in

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  morning,  everything  was 

  

 

 

 

 

current.  And  then  when  he  left  Kansas,  he's  not  subject 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  this  statutory  provision  anymore. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  He  is  subject  to  the  provision 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  requires  him  to  keep  it  current.  He's  given  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­business­day  grace  period,  but  if  he  fails  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply  with  it  by  the  end  of  the  three  business  days 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anywhere,  that's  what  we  think  the  problem  is.  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  do  think  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  ­­ you  agree  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ he  could  have  done  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ that  the  problem  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been  cured,  prospectively. 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  think  that  the  new 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

statute  captures  this  type  of  conduct,  effectively, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incidentally,  because  the  new  statute  actually  talks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  a  much  broader  category  of  conduct.  It  talks 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

about  intended  international  travel.  It  doesn't  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  talk  per  se  about  changes  of  residence,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  require  you  to  report  your  itinerary  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  of  your  travel.  Therefore  ­­

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  ­­ so  who  ­­ who  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left  out  under  the  new  law  that  would  be  covered  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  reading  of  the  old  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  I  ­­ I  don't  think  any  ­­ my 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  not  that  somebody  is  left  out  under  the  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  My  point  is  that  the  new  law  captures  many  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  I'm  trying  to  find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

out  what  is  the  effect  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GANNON:  The  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ of  ­­ of  ruling  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  or  another.  It's  a  relatively  small  category,  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  problem,  prospectively.  Is  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Yes.  And  we  ­­ we  acknowledged 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  brief  opposing  certiorari  that  we  thought  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  affected  a  small  category  of  cases.  That  was,  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  before  the  new  statute  took  effect.  And  so  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  think  that  there  will  now  ­­ this  type  of  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  now  be  captured  under  the  new  statute,  but  we  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  the  new  statute  indicates  that  Congress  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  think  this  conduct  was  captured  under  the  old 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  because  it  is  directed  at  a  much  broader 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

category  of  conduct.

if  I  understood  you  correctly,  there  is  still  a  category 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  people  under  your  interpretation  today  that  would  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  covered  under  the  new  law,  because  you  have  to  file 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  itinerary,  right? 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Yes. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well,  okay. 

  

  

 

 

 

This  person  files  an  itinerary  saying  I'm  flying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  Philippines.  And  if  he  takes  up  residence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there,  then  he's  still  violating  the  law,  under  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation? 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  that  would  be  true,  Mr. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice,  except  that  the  language  that  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  here  is  the  new  subsection.  It  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  16914(a)(7),  and  it  includes  not  just  the  itinerary, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  also,  the  offender  has  to  report  the  means  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  of  travel.  And  so  we're  expecting  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  of  travel,  if  it  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  if  his  purpose  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  going  to  visit  the  Philippines,  and  while  there,  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decides  I'm  going  to  set  up  permanent  residence  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  you  would  be  able  to  prosecute  him  under  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision,  even  though  the  new  law  doesn't  cover  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  I  think  ­­

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  then,  I  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

would  ­­ that  would  raise  a  separate  question,  and  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  that  because  his  purpose  had  changed,  we  would  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  would  have  to  find  out  whether  the  attorney  general's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  and  manner  implementation  of  this  provision,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  also  authorized  under  the  new  statute,  requires  him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  report  such  changes  in  purpose  after  he's  already  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Philippines.  And  if  so,  and  he  doesn't  say,  well,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  I  was  here  on  vacation,  but  it  turns  out  I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moving  my  residence,  so  that  may  well  turn  out  also  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  violation  because  he  needs  to  report  the  purpose  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  travel  has  changed. 

 

 

 

            

But  my  point  is  just  that  even  though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  now  addressed  intended  international  travel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  is  expecting  this  to  be  reported  in  advance,  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

title  of  the  new  statute  indicates,  and  therefore,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  have  to  have  this  debate  about  whether  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  jurisdiction  in  which  he  is  currently  residing  when  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  I  intend  to  fly  to  the  Philippines  in  21  days. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  debate  would  ­­ would  be  mooted  out  by  the  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you  ­­ you  read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16913(a)  as  saying,  where  the  offender  resides  or

or  was  a  student. 

   

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  I  don't  think  that  that's  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

way  we're  reading  the  provision,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  saying  that  there  are  two  obligations  there:  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  register  and  the  other  is  to  keep  the  registration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current.  And  if  you  allow  the  registry  to  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inaccurate  information,  that  when  it  ­­ where  you  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  your  current  address  and  it's  not  your  current 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address,  then  you've  violated  that  obligation.  And  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  subsection  (c)  provides  additional 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation  as  to  what  it  means  to  keep  the  information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current. 

            

And  it  says,  you  know  what?  You  don't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  give  advance  information,  advance  notice  that  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  changing  your  residence.  You  can  do  it  up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  three  business  days  thereafter.  But  you  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inform  at  least  one  jurisdiction  involved.  And  we  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  that  situation,  especially  because  another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  of  the  statute  makes  it  clear  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions  that  are  entitled  to  the  information  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  change  in  residence  include  those  from  and  to  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  change  in  residence  is  made,  they  get  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information.  They  are  involved  ­­

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  is  16921(b)?  Is  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  one  you're  referring  to  there? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That's  correct,  16921(b)(3), 

  

 

 

 

which  is  on  11a  of  the  government's  brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  16921(b)(3)  is 

  

 

 

 

specifically  an  obligation  that's  placed  on  officials. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  has  nothing  to  do  with  any  obligations  on  offenders. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That  is  true,  Justice  Kagan, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

but  what  we  think  it  reveals  is  that  it  is  telling  us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  jurisdictions  are  involved  in  the  exchange  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  that  is  at  issue  in  the  change  of  residence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  but  an  offender  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  look  at  a  statute  that  places  only  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation  on  State  officials  and  to  say,  really?  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation  applies  to  me  as  well? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  No.  We  think  the  offender  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  look  to  the  notices  that  he  received,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  he  was  supposed  to  provide  notification  of  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  of  address.  I  think  any  reasonable  person,  when 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

told  that  he  has  to  give  notification  of  his  change  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address,  says,  oh,  if  I  decide  I'm  moving  out  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country,  I  don't  have  to  tell  every  ­­ anybody,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  is  actually  contrary  to  a  common­sense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  of  this  provision.  And  we  know  that  the  notice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reinforces  the  idea  that  he  does  have  to  inform  Kansas.

Now,  as  Petitioner  says,  that's  clear  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  State  law.  We  also  think  that  it's  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  part  of  the  minimum  requirements  of  SORNA,  and  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  it's  sufficient  for  the  court  to  say,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  expected  this  to  be  a  State  law  prosecution  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  want  there  to  be  a  Federal  law  prosecution, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that  would  be  true  of  virtually  every  single 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  Section  2250. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  They  might  have,  but  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  language  that's  bothering  people.  And  what  ­­ I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  see  if  there  is  support  for  this  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"involved"  which  I  hadn't  really  thought  of. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  let's  imagine  he  leaves  Kansas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He  left  on  Monday.  It's  now  Tuesday.  So  he  doesn't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reside  in  Kansas  anymore.  He's  now  over  residing  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  not  there  anymore.  So  is  Kansas  still  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  involved  pursuant  to  subsection  (a)? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

and  I  say  ­­

   

 

            

            

MR.  GANNON:  If  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  your  answer  is  "yes," 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  If  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ okay.  You  mean  any 

  

  

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  that  he  ever  ­­ no,  you  said  it's  not  ­­ it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  mean  "ever."  I  said,  does  it  mean  involved 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  now?  No,  you  said  it  doesn't  mean  that,  because

if  it's  involved  right  now,  it  isn't.  You  mean  it  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  two  days  ago? 

 

 

 

            

And  now  you  have  a  general  definition  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And  you  mean  it  was  involved  because  it  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last  jurisdiction  in  which  he  actually  resided.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  you  ­­ now,  is  that  basically  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  No,  not  precisely  it.  We  mean 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  is  involved  because  he  has  not  told  them,  I  am 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  longer  living  in  Kansas. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  that  can't  be  a  reason 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  be  involved,  because  he  didn't  ­­ I  mean,  there  are  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  people  he  didn't  tell.  I  mean  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  They  are  involved  because  he  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  is  on  the  rolls  there  as  being  a  current  resident. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR.  GANNON:  So  he  has  an  obligation  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  In  other  words,  where  he  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  rolls  as  being  a  current  resident  ­­ be  careful,

And  now  ­­ now  I  ­­ I  have  an  idea  of  it.  What  support 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  there  for  that?  Is  there  support  in  a  regulation?

interpretation  of  the  word  "involved."

Attorney  General  guidelines  to  the  extent  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Attorney  General  ­­

And  then  if  you  ­­ if  you  go  on  to  page  24, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ it  articulates  the  same  requirement  in  the  context 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  needing  to  keep  the  registration  current  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions  where  someone  resides  when  you're  moving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  the  country. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  This  ­­ this  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  administrative  law  provision.  It's  a  criminal 

   

  

 

 

 

statute.  The  Attorney  General's  guidelines  can't  expand 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  fair  reading  of  what  Congress  made  illegal  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law. 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  We're  not  claiming  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Attorney  General  has  expanded  the  text  of  the  statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice.  I'm  just  saying  that  this  is  the  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Department  of  Justice  has  been  construing  the

statute.  Understand  this,  and  they've  been  informing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sex  offenders  that  they  have  an  obligation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  it's  still

not  going  to  tell  you  that  the  guidelines  make  it  a  fair

is  the  Attorney  General  thinks  it's  a  fair  reading  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute. 

 

            

            

MR.  GANNON:  I'm  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­ so  I  should 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  it's  a  fair  reading  of  the  statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  I'm  also  telling  you  that

Justice  Breyer  asked  if  there's  anybody  who's  ever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted  this  construction  before,  and  I  say,  yes,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Attorney  General  publicly  did  so  in  2008.  All 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

SORNA­implementing  jurisdictions  were  told  this  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  the  Federal  government  reads  the  statute,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  supposed  to  inform  sex  offenders  of  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  this  instance,  Kansas  has  informed 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Nichols  that  he  has  an  obligation  to  provide  notice

above  and  beyond  what  SORNA  requires  by  always  demanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  inform  Kansas,  even  though  SORNA,  under  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading,  would  allow  him  to  inform  any  one  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved.  We  think  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Just  to  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

probably  should  know  this,  but  Kansas  requires  him  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list  any  change,  right?  He  has  to  unregister? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  He  has  to  ­­ he  has  to  report 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  change  in  the  residence  information,  yes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right.  What  ­­ what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

sort  of  language  did  they  use? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That  their  language  does  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  says,  "He  must  reregister  any  change  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination  of  residence  within  three  days  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registering  law  enforcement  agency  or  agencies  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last  registered." 

 

            

So  that's  the  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  it  says  "where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

last  registered." 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Where  it  specifically  picks  up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  says,  you  have  to  go  back  to  where  you  last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registered,  we  think  that  goes  beyond  ­­ that's  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  Kansas  law  goes  beyond  SORNA,  because  SORNA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  always  require  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

We  think  that  in  a  situation  like  this,

SORNA  effectively  required  that,  because  there's  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  place  for  him  to  have  gone.  But  we  also  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  concession  that  SORNA  permits  him  to  comply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  requirement  to  keep  his  registration  current  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  the  office  in  Kansas. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  it's  the  same  form.  There's  no  doubt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  possible  for  him  to  report  the  change  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residence  there.  The  form  says,  what  is  your  address? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  it  has  location  start  date  and  location  end  date, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  those  can  be  reported  in  advance  or  after  the  fact. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Our  position  is  just  that  when  SORNA  gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around  to  saying  what  it  means  to  keep  your  registration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  current,  you  have  to  do  that  in  at  least  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  within  three  business  days.  And  so  we  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  means  he  could  do  it  in  Kansas  even  the  day  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  moved. 

 

            

If  you  disagree  with  that,  we  still  think  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  must  mean  at  least,  as  Justice  Alito  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explaining,  that  he  has  to  do  it  ­­ he  has  to  comply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  it  by  doing  it  while  there  still  is  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  There's  no  doubt  that  Kansas  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  involved  while  he  was  still  residing  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Could  I  ­­ could  I  ask  a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

question,  Mr.  Gannon,  of  absolutely  no  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significance?  Chalk  it  up  to  curiosity.

Justice  Kagan,  but  remember  this  is  somebody  who  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  a  Federal  sex  offender.  He's  on  Federal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

supervisory  release.  The  notion  that  we  have  somebody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  Federal  supervisory  release,  we're  supposed  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keeping  track  of  him  and  making  sure  that  he's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committing  other  crimes.  If  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  you're  not  ­­ you're  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  I  understand  the  requirement  that  even  you  say  he's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to,  it's  just  a  requirement  that  says  he's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaving  the  State.  It  doesn't  ­­ he's  not  required  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  you  where  he's  going  in  the  world.  He  could  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  the  Philippines  or  any  other  country.  So  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  really  help  us  in  terms  of,  you  know,  helping 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  allies  deal  with  sex  offenders. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'm  just  curious  why  it  is  that  people  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  DOJ  makes  the  decision  to  bring  sex  offenders  back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  this  country  in  such  circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  as  ­­ as  I  said,  he  was  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  sex  offender  who  was  on  Federal  supervisory

release  who  appeared  to  be  on  the  cusp  of  committing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  Federal  offenses  in  the  Philippines,  and  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  brought  him  back.  And  we  do  think  that  there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  interest  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  Section  2250  includes  cases  where 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  is  also  violating  State  law,  because  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition,  all  of  these  registration  requirements  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SORNA  much  of  the  time  are  also  going  to  be  violations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  State  law. 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  so  in  this  instance,  the  problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  the  registry  was  inaccurate.  It's  supposed  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  where  he's  living. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  am  right,  right,  that  when 

    

 

 

 

 

 

you  say  he  had  the  responsibility  to  keep  the  registry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accurate,  that's  just  to  say  he  had  the  responsibility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  tell  Kansas  he  was  no  longer  in  Kansas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Even  on  your  view,  he  had  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  responsibilities. 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That  ­­ that's  ­­ that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  responsibility  here.  That's  right.

MR.  GANNON:  Absolutely,  Justice  Alito.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

it  ­­ it  would  have  been  a  Federal  offense  for  him  to

Philippines,  look,  you  have  a  sex  offender  in  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

midst. 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That's  ­­ that's  correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan.  The  new  statute  does  that  as  did  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supplemental  guidelines  that  the  Attorney  General 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted  in  2011  under  SORNA  as  additional  information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  required.  That's  not  what's  at  issue  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  case. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What's  so  interesting  is 

  

 

 

 

 

that  regulation  tells  the  States  to  do  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  doesn't  tell  the  sex 

  

 

 

 

 

 

offender  that  he's  obligated  to  do  it.  It  says  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  must  do  it. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  It's  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  ­­ it's  a  little  bit 

   

  

 

 

 

 

odd. 

            

MR.  GANNON:  It's  true  that  the  guidelines 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were  addressed.  Both  the  guidelines  and  the

directive  to  jurisdictions  in  your  regulation  and  say,

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  we  ­­ we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Jurisdiction  is  supposed 

  

 

 

 

to  do  this,  but  now  I've  got  to  do  something  more. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  but  what  the  jurisdiction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was  told  is  that  it  has  to  inform  sex  offenders  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  must  do  this,  and  that  happened  here.  Kansas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informed  him  that  he  had  to  provide  notice  of  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination  or  change  in  his  residence.  That's  what  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  by  SORNA. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  makes  it  a  State  as

MR.  GANNON:  It  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  understand  it's  a 

    

 

 

 

crime. 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  question  is  which

to  be  independent  travel.  It's  the  violation  of  the

Department  of  Justice,  "A  jurisdiction  may  require  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes  in  registration  information  be  reported  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registrants  on  a  more  stringent  basis  than  the  SORNA 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimum  standards.  For  example,  requiring  that  changes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  residence  be  reported  before  the  sex  offender  moves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  than  within  three  business  days  following  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

move." 

              

I  mean,  that's  our  position.  I  don't  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

there  are  other  portions  in  ­­ in  the  guidelines  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  jurisdictions  to  do  this.  But  that  ­­ but  ­­ but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  ­­ what  the  guidelines  say  right  there  is  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  what  we  say,  that  it  ­­ it  is  a  more  stringent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement. 

              

A  few  other  points  on  the  word  "current."  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  if  you  ­­ if  you  look  in  the  ­­ in  the  ­­ there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  provision  on  in­person  verifications  where  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  for  a  current  photograph.  That  word 

   

  

 

 

 

clearly  doesn't  mean  a  future.  And  I  think  that's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

important  to  understand,  that  when  you're  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current  information,  it's  not  future  information.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  Justice  Kagan  mentioned  that  a  few  times. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

On  1621  ­­ 16921(b)(3),  again,  that's  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  language  directed  towards  the  jurisdictions. 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  not  a  requirement  for  the  offender,  and  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  the  former  jurisdiction  would  be  informed  of  the
