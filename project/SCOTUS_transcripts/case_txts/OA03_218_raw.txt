 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument next


in No. 03-218, John D. Ashcroft v. The American Civil


Liberties Union.


 General Olson.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. THEODORE B. OLSON


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


 The Child Online Protection Act addresses a


problem that all three branches of our national Government


have repeatedly and consistently described as compelling,


the pervasive and essentially unavoidable commercial


Internet pornography that inflicts substantial physical and


psychological damage on our children.


 COPA was carefully drafted by Congress after


hearings, debate, reports, and findings according to


explicit guidance from this Court as to how constitutionally


to address and resolve and deal with this -- this menace. 


The compelling need is overwhelming and is growing. 


Internet pornography is widely accessible, as easily


available to children as a use of a television remote.  This


Court has noted, as Congress has, that immense psychological


and immeasurable physiological harm is done.  The -­

 QUESTION: Mr. Olson, part of the problem is that


the pornography laws that would apply to adult viewers don't


seem to be enforced very well, the obscenity laws.  There


are very few prosecutions, and yet there's all kinds of


stuff out there.  What's -- what's going on?


 MR. OLSON: Well -­

QUESTION: I mean, if they were enforced, a lot of


the problem would be assisted.


 MR. OLSON: Well, it -- in the first place, Justice


O'Connor, while there may have been some lapse in -­

diminution in obscenity prosecutions a number of years ago,


the information that I'm given, and it's not in the record,


is that 21 indictments have been brought in the last 2


years, 17 have involved Internet.  But the problem with


respect to the children is the material that is so widely


available on the Internet that doesn't reach the definition


of -- that is not as bad as obscenity.  It is a wide amount


of information. 


The legislative history described 28,000


pornographic sites in a -- this is also outside the record,


but if an individual goes to their Internet and -- and uses


an Internet search engine and -- and types in the word, free


porn, I did this this weekend, the -- your -- your computer


will say that there are 6,230,000 sites available.  Now


that's available now -­

 QUESTION: Well, how many sites are there available


altogether on the Internet?


 MR. OLSON: Well, there are -- there are a great


deal more than that, Mr. Chief Justice, and I don't know the


exact number, but I believe the record, with respect to the


Child Online, COPA, uses -- describes those numbers, but it


is increasing enormously every single day, but the -­

QUESTION: Yes, even -- even the 28,000 was at the


time this bill was enacted.


 MR. OLSON: That's right.


 QUESTION: So I'm -- so I assume -­

MR. OLSON: And so the -­

QUESTION: -- it's much greater now.


 MR. OLSON: And every evidence that's available to


us, and I don't think this is disputed by respondents, is


that the number of Internet sites is growing up


exponentially.


 QUESTION: Those figures include the obscenity


violations too, I assume?  You're -- you're not just talking


about sites that are affected by the Child Protection Act?


 MR. OLSON: Well, I'm talking about sites that -­

that would be available to you -­

QUESTION: Other things too, right.


 MR. OLSON: -- to you or me -­

 QUESTION: Yeah, and my first inquiry was -- was


such a vast array of sites.  There are so few prosecutions. 


It's just amazing.


 MR. OLSON: Well, as I said, the number of


prosecutions are increasing.  What -- what the -- what the,


and United States Attorney manual asks United States


Attorneys to focus on obscenity where there's evidence of


organized crime -­

QUESTION: Now, you said free porn, not free


obscenity.


 MR. OLSON: That's correct.


 QUESTION: Presumably they still can't advertise


free obscenity.  We -- we've drawn a line.


 MR. OLSON: That's correct, and I -­

QUESTION: Pornography is okay?


 MR. OLSON: Well, this -- what we're talking about


today is something that would be described as -- and I'm


using the term pornography as a shorthand version to


describe what was described in the statute as harmful to


children.  That's a -- statute itself refers to obscenity


and material which is harmful to children.  It then goes on


to describe the category of material that is harmful to


children using the language that was approved by this Court


in the Miller case, as modified by the Ginsberg v. New York


case with respect to material which is harmful to children,


which is broader than the definition of obscenity.  The -­

QUESTION: You're -- you're not suggesting that the


free porn site that you call up would not include any


obscene material?


 MR. OLSON: I did -- I didn't have time to go all


the way through all those sites.


 (Laughter.)


 MR. OLSON: And -- and -- and it's not a pleasant

QUESTION: I'd imagine you found some that it was

obscene.


 MR. OLSON: And it's -- I didn't.  I -- the


material that I saw and I think that the Court would see is


that the people that are putting in -- these are -- this is


material in front of, and the legislative history describes


this, the material which is obscene is usually kept behind


so-called blinders, which do -- which is a very good point


here, because the very mechanism that the statute requires


is already in existence with respect to commercial


pornography sites.


 Justice Stevens, what the -- what the -- what the


purveyors of this material do is put in front of the screen


provocative material that we submit would meet the


definition of harmful to children and make that available to


everybody to entice people to go the next step to use their


credit card or their age identification mechanism to go the


next step.


 QUESTION: General Olson, you said something that I


-- I would question.  You -- you said it's just like the


blinder racks, but it isn't, because I don't have to give my


ID and I don't have to be concerned that someone will know


that this person with this address and this credit card


wants to look at this material.  You can -- you can -- the 


-- the -- the idea of the blinder rack is to protect the


child, but at the same time, the one who wants to see it

doesn't have to disclose his identity.


 MR. OLSON: Well, you're disclosing your identity,


Justice Ginsburg, because you're standing there in public


examining those -­

QUESTION: How many people are going to be in that


adult store, bookstore with you, as opposed to giving your


credit card number?


 MR. OLSON: What you're -- what you're -- what


you're disclosing your identity in person, I -- we would,


the Government would argue that that is more invasive, but


that nonetheless that there's some -- this is a counterpart


to those blinder racks.  In many of the convenience stores


or adult bookstores or stores that you may go into where


those blinder racks are, there are cameras recording the -­

the -- for protection of the shops, for other reasons,


recording the presence of the person.  We submit that in the


privacy of one's home, use -- utilizing this information


with the provision in the statute -­

QUESTION: But the whole world can know about it if


I've given my credit card number.


 MR. OLSON: It -- it is a -- it is a crime under


COPA for the persons providing that information pursuant to


adult identification provisions, it's section, subsection d


of COPA that makes it a crime to reveal that information. 


So there is protection built into the statute that protects

QUESTION: Then why is there such resistance to


giving the ID and the credit card?  People resist giving it,


their credit cards, and I think the two reports said that


that was the case, the reports on COPA.


 MR. OLSON: Well, some -- some people may. 


Congress made a -- some people -- there -- the numbers are


not quantified at all, but there is privacy protection. 


Giving your identity is necessary going into a nightclub,


going into an adult movie, or going into a bookstore and


using this material.  Some people may say, I don't want to,


that's a price I don't want to pay, but it's not quantified

QUESTION: You don't have to give your credit card


to go into the nightclub or the movie.


 MR. OLSON: Well, you probably -- in some cases you


don't, in some cases maybe you do.  I don't know if there's


a charge -­

QUESTION: There -- there may be resistance made


there not on the part of people to stand in front of blinder


racks or to go into those portions of bookstores that are


excluded, that exclude children because of the presence of


pornography.  There may be people who won't go into that


section because they don't want to be seen there or don't

want to be seen standing in front of the blinder rack,


although they'd be happy to look at pornography if it was


mingled in with everything else.


 MR. OLSON: That's correct, Justice Scalia, and


Congress acknowledged that.  There's no dispute by the


Government -­

QUESTION: Did -- I thought that at least we have


some cases that -- that recognize that there is -- someone


doesn't have to come forward and say, I want this material. 


That was the Lamont case where the person wanted to get


whatever was being sent and didn't want to say, oh yes, I


want to get that material.  And Denver -- didn't Denver Area


have the similar thing that a customer doesn't have to say,


I don't take that stuff off my screen -­

MR. OLSON: In the Denver Area case, the person had


to make an application to unblock the material, that that


material -- there's a big distinction in the Denver Area


case because there wasn't a requirement of anonymity and a


protection of privacy in the statute.  But I guess the


bottom line, Justice Ginsburg, is that, yes, we have to


acknowledge that there is some burden that is imposed when


you're required to identify yourself into the purveyor of


this material, but that -- but you get to, you have the


opportunity to do that in the privacy of your own home. 


By statute, a criminal statute protects the

privacy of your doing that, and the -- and the balance that


Congress struck, which is what this Court dealt with when it


dealt with this statute two -- on two previous occasions,


the Court did acknowledge that there's a compelling


governmental interest here, and that significant harm is


being done on a daily basis. 


The magnitude -- we point this out on page 20 of


our brief -- that 11 million children visit these porn sites


every week, and that between the ages of 15 and 17, 70


percent of the children, according to the statistics that we


cite, visited porn site inadvertently.  It is very difficult


to avoid. 


As we describe in our brief, the use of innocuous


names, I'd mentioned last time that I was here and it hasn't


changed, Whitehouse.com is a porn site.  Many of these


things that the evidence suggest children visit and visit


accidentally or they're shown to by their friends, and then


it's very difficult to get off -­

QUESTION: Mr. Olson, the -- the court of appeals


addressed certain principal flaws that it saw in the


statute, and I wish you -- you could address those.  First,


whether there material taken as a whole includes the whole


Web site or -- or the article and so forth, and you, I


think, took a different position in the Third Circuit than


you took here.  And -- and the second is this question of

the definition of the commercial use.  Could you -- could


you address those?


 MR. OLSON: Yes.  We -- we submit, and Congress was


basing its definitions on the decisions of this Court with


respect to taken as a whole, as this Court put it in the, I


think it's the Kois case, K-o-i-s case, from Wisconsin, and


that comes from -- that comes from the Roth decision of this


Court, the material to -- for -- for purposes of the


performance of this statute must be taken not only in its


content, but in its context.


 Now, in many cases it won't be necessary to do


that, but something that might appear to be harmful in one


context, if it's examined as a whole and it turns out to be


a part of an art exhibit or a anatomy book or a sex


education program, that would -- would have redeeming value. 


It's this Court's decision that it's the protection of the


communicator that the material be looked at as a whole. 


Congress carefully built that into the statute, and your


second point, Justice Kennedy, is commercial purveyors of


this -­

QUESTION: Well, just -- but -- but before we leave


the -- the whole, what is -- your position changed between


the Third Circuit and here as to what we should look like,


should we look at the whole -- are you saying now we should


look at the whole Web site?

site, it may not be necessary.  It may be in the defendant's


interest.  We're not suggesting that the whole Web site


should not be looked at -­

QUESTION: But I mean, how -- how is the purveyor


or the -- the broadcaster supposed to know?


 MR. OLSON: The broadcast -- with respect to the -­

QUESTION: I mean, if we can't define what -­

MR. OLSON: Well -­

QUESTION: -- what the whole means -­

MR. OLSON: Well, this Court -- what -- this Court


has defined that.  It is -- requires looking at the material


in the context it's which -- it's presented.  In addition,

QUESTION: But it's presented on a screen.


 MR. OLSON: It's presented on a screen -­

QUESTION: One -- one screen at a time.


 MR. OLSON: Certainly, Justice Kennedy, but one


page in a book is presented at a time, one book in a


library, one magazine in a bookstore.


 QUESTION: Yeah, but as we all know, this -- this


is -- a book, we know about book, but the Web site is


different, and that's where we're struggling.


 MR. OLSON: Well, that's right, and we're saying

that the entire Web site may be looked at as a whole to see


the context in which the material is presented.  These are


protections that the Court think are available and should be


concluded within the statute to protect the communicator. 


So if the communicator is accused of putting the material


out there that otherwise might fit these definitions, and


the person doing the communication said, you have to look at


the whole Web site, this was in an art gallery and so forth


and those pictures were a part of that exhibit, that's a --


that's -- the reason why Congress put that provision in


there is that this Court repeatedly said it was necessary to


protect First Amendment rights, and in Ginzburg, U.S. v.


Ginzburg, the Court said the context might be considered in


terms of how the manner is being purveyed, is there


pandering going on, is it being put out, is -­

QUESTION: But that's not obvious in the text of


the statute, because it says, it says any image, any


article, any image.  Then it could be any image taken as a


whole.


 MR. OLSON: But -­

QUESTION: The question that -- that I have is, you


-- you have clarified what the statute means in this


respect, you've also said that harmful to minors, the minor


in view is the normal 16-year-old, but the statute doesn't


say that, and since we're dealing with a content

construction of words that are susceptible to a broader


meaning?


 MR. OLSON: The -- I submit that the -- what the -­

with the issue of as a whole as a part of the statute, taken


in the context which it is given, it -- it -- the -- this is


-- this is part 6 of the definition, which is on page 189a


of the appendix to the cert petition -- that the -- the


context of that is quite clear that the material is -­

QUESTION: Well, three -- two -- yeah.  No, it was


three, wasn't it, judges on the Court of Appeals for the


Third Circuit missed it?


 MR. OLSON: That's why we're here.  But the -- the


fact -- and I -- and I submit this.  In the first place,


this Court has repeatedly said, and it said last year in -­

in connection with the McCain-Feingold case, that if there's


a reasonable construction or a narrowing construction to


which the statute is reason -- readily susceptible, the


Court will adopt it in order to avoid the constitutional


question, but I don't even think that's necessary in this


context. 


The contact of -- context of as a whole comes to


this Court from the -- comes to Congress through a series of


definitions and actual cases by this Court, so -- and the


legislative history is manifestly clear that what Congress

QUESTION: Why did you -­

MR. OLSON: Those were book cases.


 QUESTION: -- pick 16-year-olds instead of 17-year-


olds if you want to use the old -- the oldest minors?  Where


-- how -- how did you come up with 16-year-olds?


 MR. OLSON: Because this Court -­

QUESTION: And I mean, you know, maybe you -- you


won the battle by losing the war.


 MR. OLSON: Well -­

QUESTION: You -- you're going to allow to come in


without any restriction under this statute for a 5-year-old


anything that wouldn't be -- wouldn't be bad for a 16-year-


old.


 MR. OLSON: Well, there's two -­

QUESTION: Is that a great victory?


 MR. OLSON: There's two answers to that, Justice


Scalia.  As this Court has repeatedly said, the Constitution


does not require impossible definitions.  What is -- what


puts a person reasonably on notice is an appropriate way to


go, and what -- the -- the reason why it was 16 rather than


17, of course, is because this Court criticized the previous


statute because it drew the line at a different age. 


It would be impossible, I submit, for Congress to

select a different age for every different piece of


material.  What Congress was trying to get at was the worst


problem, the material that even with respect to 16-year-olds


meets the standards set out in the statute.  That at least 


--

QUESTION: How do we know that?  I -- I doubt that


very much.  I -- I think Congress probably wanted a good


deal of stuff that might be okay for 16-year-olds not to -­

not -- not to be shown -­

MR. OLSON: No, as a matter of fact -­

QUESTION: -- to really young children.


 MR. OLSON: As a matter of fact, Congress was very


clear that what it was adopting is what this Court had


previously considered in the American Booksellers case and


those blinder racks and the -- and the definition that came


out of the American Booksellers case and the subsequent


Fourth Circuit definition of that term in that case, of


which this Court subsequently denied cert.  Those bookseller


blinder rack cases are exactly cited in the legislative


history. 


This is a remarkable instance of where Congress


went through all of the things that the Court identified as


problems with the previous statute, grappled with each of


these definitions, adopted Court-approved definitions,


standards, and limitations with respect to what this Court

has agreed is a compelling problem.


 If I can return to Justice Kennedy's concern about


the issue of -- take -- the commercial pornographers, the


statute is very clear that it refers to people that are in


the business of profiting from this material, and then the


Court -- the statute goes on to say what is the business of


being engaged in this and says that someone that takes time,


effort, or labor in the regular course of a business of -­

of profiting from the transmission of this material. 


So the legislative history, the previous iteration


of the problem in this Court makes it clear that what


Congress was concerned about and was -- was not trying to


capture with this statute the person that occasionally


transmitted a -- a photograph or an image, but someone who


is in the business of doing this on a regular basis for


profit.


 QUESTION: Well, but the -- the doing -- the this


is having the whole Web site, and -- and I, you know, I -- I


concede it'd be a very difficult task if we told the


Congress you come -- you come up with some definition of the


commercial pornographer.  On the other hand, it seems to me


that this is very -- very sweeping.  We -- even leaving


aside the question of non-profit associations and so forth,


people that have these Web sites will tell you that 100


percent of what they do is for profit.

 MR. OLSON: Well, the answer to that, Justice


Kennedy, is the -- the fact that this is not any -- that


that definition, what the Congress adopted at the suggestion


of this Court, was the same definition that this Court had


approved in prior contexts with respect to obscenity, 18


U.S.C. 1466, and that definition, commercial use of

obscenity, is something that prosecutors and courts have


been dealt -- been dealing with for a couple of -- for over,


well over a generation, for several decades.  So -­

QUESTION: Mr. Olson, may I ask you a question


about the -- on the -- the meaning of this very provision? 


Supposing a beer company or a cigarette company used for


advertising purposes regularly used material that would fit


the definition.  Would they be violating the statute?


 MR. OLSON: Yes, I believe they would, Justice


Stevens, that if the idea is to sell -- to use the material


that fits the definition, I keep saying the word pornography


because I want to use the shorthand, and that is to make


commercial use of it by making money out of it, whether they


sell -­

QUESTION: Well, they're making money out of the


sale of -- of the product, which itself is not pornographic.


 MR. OLSON: That's -­

QUESTION: But -- but if it's regular advertising,


you think that would -- that would meet it?

 MR. OLSON: Yes, I -- Congress would not have


wanted to create that massive loophole, because the people


that are -- this is a multi-billion dollar business, the


people that are doing it would readily adapt to that type of


a loophole.  The other one that was suggested by the


respondents is that -- and the, and by the Third Circuit -­

is that somehow Congress should have required that this


would be the primary business that the person was engaged


in.  Again, that would have been a massive loophole subject


to constant litigation over what was the primary business


and whether a person's surrounded the harmful material with


an acre or two of unharmful material. 


What Congress was getting at is that people that


are in the business, knowing and knowing the character of


the material, two other terms that are in the statute, that


are making money distributing this material and who won't


take the steps necessary to protect minors from them. 


With respect to the argument that the respondents


make and the court of appeals focused on that blocking at


the home might somehow be a problem, Congress carefully


considered that, decided it would not be an acceptable


solution, except that it did at the same time enact -- that


it enacted COPA, required that the Internet service


providers make that type of information available to people


in their homes so that that could be in addition to what

COPA requires.


 The fact is that blocking material in the home is


both underinclusive and overinclusive.  It requires the


consumer to go out and buy a product and spend money to


adapt it to technological improvements that are happening


all the times, and it's readily avoidable.  I did the same,


this again is outside the record, but I did this, anyone can


do this, the same experiment over the weekend.  I went to


Google and I typed in disable filter and you push the button


and you will get a screen full of programs that will tell


you step by step how to dismantle the computer so your


parents won't know about it.  It is that easy, and you can


put it back on.


 These things are readily avoidable.  So the burden


that Congress was -- was -- the burden that Congress imposed


at the suggestion of this Court is to put the burden on the


person or persons making money on a regular basis from this


product to take the minimal steps necessary to prevent the


damage that's done every day by minors by allowing people to


use mechanisms that are already in place.  This Court


mentioned it and Congress mentioned it, this adult check


mechanism, that's another thing that -- that anyone can


check out.  Type in adult -- adult ID, and then press the


button and you will find, I think there were 25 sites that


mention in the congressional history which will provide an

adult identification at a relatively nominal cost, I think


it was 19.95 for a several-month period or something like


that, and the availability is such that the steps that can


be followed take a matter of less than a couple of minutes.


 So in the privacy of the home, the adult who wants


material protected by the Constitution, in order to avoid


damage to children in the privacy of the home with statutory


protection as to anonymity, the -- the problem can -- it -­

it cannot be totally solved, but this is an important major


step and this is an example of Congress following the


directions of this Court as to how constitutionally to do


it.


 Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance


of my time.


 QUESTION: Very well, General Olson.


 Ms. Beeson, we'll hear from you.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN E. BEESON


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


 MS. BEESON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


 COPA violates the First Amendment for two


independent reasons.  First, it is a criminal statute that


suppresses a wide range of protected speech between adults


on the Web, and second, the Government has a range of more


effective, less restrictive tools available to protect

minors.  The Government's attempt to narrow the range of


speech that is affected by this statute defy the law's plain


language, the record, and plain common sense.


 Even under the Government's interpretation, COPA


criminalizes speech that under any definition adults have


the right to access.  It criminalizes a depiction or even a


description of nudity or even a description or depiction of


the female breast.  It does not just cover sexual conduct.


 QUESTION: Now, I thought what it said is it picks


up the definition that this Court has used for obscenity.  I


thought that definition was primarily an appeal to the


prurient interest and it cannot have any -- it has to lack,


taken as a whole, serious literary, artistic, political, or


scientific value, and it adds the word, for minors.  For a


16- or 17-year-old, I'm not sure there'd be much difference.


 MS. BEESON: I -­

QUESTION: And -- and so, I looked through all your


stuff, or not all of it, but some of it, and I'd like you to


point out for me, what is the material there that has that


serious scientific value, which you have quite a lot of -­

MS. BEESON: Yes.


 QUESTION: -- but that the statute would forbid?


 MS. BEESON: Yes.  Two points, Your Honor.  First,


the obscenity statute actually covers only sexual conduct. 


It does not cover mere depictions of -- of nudity and it

does not cover just an image of the female breast, so I


think that that's an important difference.


 QUESTION: It has to be an image or whatever image


they are that appeal to the prurient interest.  Now, that to


me is material that does not communicate.


 MS. BEESON: Yes.


 QUESTION: It is material that is looking for a


kind of emotional response, period.  No communication and


trying to elicit a certain emotional response, all right? 


And it lacks serious artistic or cultural or other value,


all right?  Now, what is the material that you point to,


because most of yours I think didn't fit that definition. 


In fact, I couldn't find one that did fit it.


 MS. BEESON: Your Honor -­

QUESTION: So I want you to tell me which is the


one that fits it.


 MS. BEESON: Yes, and, Your Honor, the question


ultimately is what a speaker on the Web who communicates


material like this will do, what they think is covered by


the law, whether they will self-censor everything they think


--

QUESTION: Oh, I would imagine it's what we say is


covered by the law.


 MS. BEESON: Your Honor, I don't think so, under


this Court's precedents.  In other words, if the -- if the

record shows, and if the law covers, material that clearly


has value for adults but lacks value for minors, there has


to be some distinction there or otherwise this turns into


the obscenity statute.  There is no difference.  In other 

words, there is material that has -­

slow down, Ms. Beeson?  I didn't get your last -­

MS. BEESON: Sure.


 QUESTION: -- clause.


 MS. BEESON: Sure, sure, Your Honor, of course. 


The point is that the serious value for minors clause does


not protect as much material as the serious value for adults


clause in the obscenity statute.  That by definition must be


true, and in fact, as a society, just even using common


sense -­

QUESTION: Did you get my question?  I wanted you,


I was serious in my question.


 MS. BEESON: Yes.

citations.  You don't have to -­

to look at them, and if I thought that this statute didn't


cover it, why not say so?  Why not say all these things that


the ACLU is worried about, given the Government's effort,


are outside the statute?  Would that take care of your


problem?  But tell me which they are.


 MS. BEESON: Yes, let me do that.  First, there are


numerous discussions in the -- in the record of lesbian and


gay sexual pleasure and the pleasure of sex outdoors.  This


is not sex education materials.  These are materials


intended for adults which explicitly discuss sexual


pleasure. 


Let me give a few citations:  PlanetOut, in the


joint appendix, 658 to 69; BlackStripe, the joint appendix,


753 to 57; and the Susie Bright column.  She is a sex


therapist, she is -- she talks about sexual pleasure.  She


is not talking about educational material.  The purpose of


her columns are to invite adults to discuss and to read


about sexual pleasure if they want -­

QUESTION: Exactly, and I don't think that that's


prurient.  I think a discussion about sex is a totally


different thing from a -- a discussion that is itself


supposed to be part of a sexual response, all right? 


They're night and day different. 


MS. BEESON: Your -­

QUESTION: Now -- now you tell me why that isn't

so. 


MS. BEESON: Your Honor, let me put this another


way.  This statute covers written text.  All of the exhibits


that have been put in by the Government are of images. 
 I


don't know what else could be covered that is written text


that, you know, other than our client's material, in other


words, what is left.  That is what they are.  They are -­

they are prurient discussions, they are intended for adults,


they have value for adults, but they lack value for minors. 


That is the concern.  It's a very big concern.  There are a


lot of people on the Web that communicate that.


 And as a society, again, there's a lot of material


in this, we have defined a wide range of material as having


value for adults and lacking value for even older minors.  A


16-year-old cannot get into an R-rated movie.  If you're a


speaker on the Web and you communicate material that's like


Bertolucci films, for example, or Sex and the City, you are


going to be very, very worried.  The Government has made


your speech a crime and you have only three options under


the statute.  All of those options violate the First


Amendment.


 The first option is that you can take a risk and


leave your speech up there, Justice Breyer, as you're


saying, you know, leave it up there.  You're Susie Bright


and you think that your -- your speech is not covered.  What

happens?  You can go to jail, not because you made that


column deliberately available to a minor, but because you


merely displayed the column to the general public.  That is


a pure violation of this Court's rule in Butler v. Michigan


that you cannot make it a crime to display material to


adults in the name of protecting children.


 The second option.  You're worried, you don't want


to go to jail, you self-censor.  Everything that you have


self-censored, adults had the right to access.  It violates


the First Amendment for the Government to do this through


the statute.


 The third option is that you can set up costly


screens, which the record shows drive away your users.  The


district court and the court of appeals also specifically


found that because of the risk of criminal penalties, it's


quite likely that you never get to the defenses because the


vast majority of rational speakers, when faced with this


choice, are going to self-censor, and that is speech that


adults had the right to get.


 This Court, for that reason -­

QUESTION: You're talking about self-censoring. 


You're meaning an interpretation of the statute that is not


warranted by the -- the proper interpretation, I take it?


 MS. BEESON: No, I'm not.  I -- no, I'm not, Your


Honor.  I think this is very different than the -- than that

problem, the self-censorship problem with the obscenity


statute, and here's why.  Under the obscenity statute, if


you self-censor material that is actually obscene, there's


no First Amendment problem.


 QUESTION: That's the whole point of the thing.


 MS. BEESON: Exactly.  There's no First Amendment


problem.  That speech is illegal.  If you self-censor speech


under COPA that we can all agree is harmful to minors,


whatever that is, it's harmful to minors, you have self-


censored material that adults have the right to access. 


That's the fundamental difference, and that is why this


self-censorship is problem with this statute is so much


broader than it -- than it could ever be in the obscenity


statute.


 Now, you also have -­

QUESTION: If -- if you run that self-censor, I


mean, you -- you could not have any laws protect.  I -- I


suppose the laws that require certain categories of


materials to be put in these, what do we call, the blinder,


blinder racks, I -- I suppose that -- that's invalid on the


same basis because those magazines that want to appear in


the general readership rack will self-censor them -­

themselves so that they won't be put in there, right?  So


all of those, and I think every state has laws like that,


they're all invalid because of self-censorship?

what's your view?  The argument you're making suggests that


they're all bad.


 MS. BEESON: We think that that is one of the three


First Amendment burdens that these kinds of statutes impose. 


The first one is the self-censorship problem.  The second


one -­

QUESTION: All right.  But that alone is not


enough, you think?

QUESTION: Then all the blinder racks are bad?


 MS. BEESON: And under -- under this law -- under


this law, Your -- Your Honor, there are two additional


burdens which are much greater than the online blinder rack


statutes, and in fact, it's quite notable that even though


some states, it's about half of the states that have display


statutes as opposed to statutes like Ginsberg that make it a


crime to simply sell directly to a child material that's


harmful to minors, those same states that have passed and in


some cases upheld offline display statutes have now struck

down online display statutes because they have reached the


same conclusion that the district court and the appellate


court in this case found and that is that there is -­

QUESTION: Well, their supreme courts did, their


supreme courts did.  I mean, don't represent it as a


judgment of the people of the states by their legislature. 


You're saying that -- that there were state supreme courts


that struck it down, right?


 MS. BEESON: I'm saying that there are -- there


were Federal courts that have struck down now seven state


online harmful to minor statutes because they have


recognized the distinction between those statutes in the


online context and the offline context, and let me just get


to that second problem, you know, self-censorship being the


first problem, self-censorship of speech that under any


definition is protected for adults.


 The second one, the -- let's just assume that you


-- that you want to go ahead and try to set up these


screens, first of all, a credit card is a form of payment,


it is not an ID.  This is not just a matter of flashing your


ID if you're a young-looking adult and the bookstore owner


is not quite sure that you're -- you're an adult yet.  This


is a matter of every single adult having to -- to provide


their credit card to a Web site every time they visit a new


Web site.  The -­

 QUESTION: But there's a -- there's an alternative,


the ID, you -- it doesn't have to be a credit card.


 MS. BEESON: Your Honor, there is an alternative in


the statute.  What the record shows is that to get an adult


ID, the primary way to get that is through a credit card. 


So another problem you have very similar to the problem


identified by this Court in Reno v. ACLU is that, you know,


almost all adults without credit cards have no way to access


this speech at all, and again, you don't even -- you don't


even get to this problem if, of course, the Web speaker has


chosen the first option and has self-censored and not even


tried to set up the screens.


 So the other -- the -- the other thing that's very


different, of course, about the blinder rack statutes is


that none of them required the adults to actually register


or disclose their identity.  Credit cards create a permanent


transaction, a permanent record of the transaction, and the


-- the potential for abuse, because they are a form of


payment, is much greater than merely flashing an ID.


 QUESTION: Yes, but the Government says that


there's a statutory protection that they cannot -- that the


-- the person who gets the information can't pass it on to


third parties.


 MS. BEESON: Your Honor, there was actually -­

there actually was a similar protection in the Denver Area

case, which this Court found irrelevant given the remaining


burden on -- on adults having to identify themselves before


they seek access.  In both the Denver Area case and in the


Playboy case, this course -- Court -- struck down very


similar burdens on adult speech.  The burden here is much


greater because the quantity and diversity of speech


affected is much greater and the number of users affected is


greater.


 I would also like to point out that there's -­

QUESTION: Well -­

MS. BEESON: -- loophole in that privacy


protection, which is -- which is right in the -­

QUESTION: Well, who -- who says that they're


guaranteed anonymity?  I mean, if you go buy a gun, you're


certainly not guaranteed anonymity.


 MS. BEESON: Your Honor, the anonymity -- there


actually -- this Court has held, of course, that there is a


right to access --


QUESTION: When -- what -­

MS. BEESON: -- protected speech anonymously, but


that is not really what's at issue here.  What's at issue is


what the effect of the law is on protected speech for


adults, and what the anonymity cases show is that if you


have to give up your anonymity, a lot of people are going to


be deterred, and that's what the record in this case shows

too.


 General Olson acted as if there was nothing in the


record about the number of times.  In fact, there is quite a


lot in the record.


 QUESTION: Well, you -- you say you're not relying


on what you refer to as anonymity cases for this


proposition?


 MS. BEESON: I'm saying that I think that those


cases are relevant only to the extent that they show that


anonymity often deters -- that the -- the loss of anonymity


will deter viewers.  Here there is evidence, and it isn't


even just the -- the loss of anonymity that's the problem,


it's also the stigma of being associated with material


that's been labeled by the Government as illegal, and that


was a stigma that the Court also found relevant in striking


down the Denver Area case. 


I wanted to just quick -­

QUESTION: If -- if it really -- if it really were


illegal, then the stigma would be irrelevant, don't you


think?


 MS. BEESON: The -- the -- if it were illegal to?


 QUESTION: Suppose you were stigmatized by having


subscribed to poor -- to obscenity.  You couldn't object to


that.

the speech is protected for adults.  They have the right to

and in Playboy.


 QUESTION: Now, you have a third -- the third


point.  The first is there's too great a risk of self-


censorship.  The second is a screening requires loss of


anonymity, and what's the third?


 MS. BEESON: The -- the third was the four -- first


point I made, Your Honor, which is that if you -- the


defenses don't help you at all if you take a risk and -- and


assume that your speech is protected and in fact the


Government thinks it isn't.  You know, you're Susie Bright,


you put the column up, you think it's, you know, you think


it's okay.  The defenses don't help you and you're going to


jail, not because you gave it deliberately to a child, but


because you displayed it to an adult.


 QUESTION: Well, that seems to me just really much,


very much like the point that -- that the statute sweeps too


broadly, there's a risk of too great self-censorship. 


That's really the same point, isn't it?


 MS. BEESON: Your Honor, I -- I don't think it is


the same point.  I really think it's a -- it's a very


distinct point, because the point is the speaker has two


choices.  They can either take a risk and display the


speech, in which case they go to jail.  They go to jail not

because they gave it to a child, that's the only kind of a


statute this Court has upheld.  That's the -- that's what


they upheld in Ginsberg is that you can make it a crime to


deliberately sell this material to the child.  All the -­

all the -- all the Web publisher has done under this statute


that sends him to jail is to simply make it available to the


general reading public.


 QUESTION: All right.  Suppose -- what in your


opinion is the right way for Congress to go about this? 


That is, I assume, and you may not assume, but assume with


me that Congress is not interested in Susie Bright.  That's


all fine.  They're not really interested in your examples. 


What they're interested in are -- is the professional


pornographer and we know who that is and we know what it


looks like, and it's too tough to go after them with the


obscenity statutes because they say artistic, whatever it


is, there's a set of reasons that hasn't been successful.


 So here's their solution.  It's called zoning.  We


won't stop people from looking at the worst stuff if they


want to and if they're adults, but you have to take the


subway and go out of Times Square, of if you're on the


Internet, you have to identify that you're not a child. 


Now, we know that's a burden, but it's far more consistent


with the First Amendment to let people look at anything they


want including this worst possible stuff, as long as they're

not hurting anybody else, and the way to deal with this is


to zone just like we use to do in libraries.  If you want to


see the stuff that's locked up, you have to go to the


librarian and identify yourself and show you're not a child


and she'll open it with a key, that used to happen, and you


could go look at it, all right?


 That's Congress' solution.  Now, if that is not a


good solution, what is?  Is there no solution?


 MS. BEESON: Yes, there are a number of solutions


which Congress has now passed which don't present the -- the


problems that this statute does.  This is not a zoning


statute, it's a criminal statute, and because it's a


criminal statute it's far more likely to lead to the self-


censorship that -- that causes the big problem here.


 We now have a Federal filtering law that this


Court upheld, so any child that's accessing the Internet in


a school or a public library has already -- is protected


from most of these images.  One of the most -- one of the


important cites in the record that I want to mention here,


the Government put in more exhibits -­

QUESTION: Your organization didn't -- didn't


support that -- that statute.


 MS. BEESON: I'm sorry.


 (Laughter.)

 QUESTION: Also, what else, because as you know


from things I've written, I'm very skeptical about the


ability of filtering to deal with millions of families where


there are no parents at home during the day and it's very


tough.  So -- so that's one.  I'll look at that.  What's --


what's two?


 MS. BEESON: If I could just mention the cite to


the record, Your Honor, because I think it's very important. 


The Government put in a lot of sexually explicit images as


their exhibits in this case.  They stipulated that every one


of the major filtering products blocked every one of the


images that they submitted as being a problem in this case.


 QUESTION: Where's that at in the record?


 MS. BEESON: That is in the joint appendix


beginning at page 170, that's the joint stipulation between


the parties, numbers 45 to 47.  That is a pretty ringing


endorsement for filtering software, and again, the district


court specifically found -­

QUESTION: If it's working what do you do about the


Solicitor General's contention that it's easy to turn the


filters off?


 MS. BEESON: Your Honor, first of all, that is not


in the record.  What the record shows and what the district


court found was that the filters are more effective than


COPA, and the reason that they're more effective -­

 QUESTION: When they're working.  Do -- do you


contend -- I mean, if -- if we're uncertain whether it's


easy to turn them off or not, let's assume it's not in the


record.  I -- it seems to me it's not a good argument on


your part unless -- unless you maintain, and perhaps can


show from the record, that it is -- it is not easy to turn


them off.


 MS. BEESON: Your -- Your Honor, under this Court's


long-standing precedents, any content-based regulation of


speech is presumptively invalid.  It is the Government's


burden to show that there is no less restrictive


alternative, and they did not meet this burden under the


clear record in this case.  The district court very clearly


found that the filters were at least as effective.  They can


actually block material that is not even commercial that


comes from -­

record to make that point, when we have only the record to 


-- to base the decision on here.  Justice Breyer, to get to


the other options that are available, the other things that


Congress can do, one that I want to mention is a new statute


that was passed, 18 U.S.C. -- I believe it's 2252(b) -- it


gets at the Whitehouse.com problem.  This is a law that


penalizes sites that knowingly use misleading domain names,


like Whitehouse.com, in order to lure children to this sites


inadvertently.  That is another law -­

QUESTION: Statute -- has that statute been


challenged yet?


 MS. BEESON: That -- that statute has not been


challenged.  It is on the books now, and -- and therefore it


is -­

QUESTION: You think that's a good one, though?


 MS. BEESON: It is certainly narrower, Your Honor,


than this statute.


 QUESTION: I understand that, but you think it's


good, so we can count on the fact that that one's okay?


 (Laughter.)


 MS. BEESON: I will argue only that it's -­

QUESTION: You will demur.


 MS. BEESON: -- clearly narrower.  And one of the


reasons that it's narrower, all -- all jokes aside, is


because it gets more clearly at -- at what the statute is

aiming to get at, which is, you know, luring inadvertent


viewers, especially minors, to particular sites, whereas


this -- this law makes it a crime for anyone, any individual


running a small business, you know, Mitch Tepper, our client


who runs a sexual health network -­

QUESTION: No, no, I understand it's a lot


narrower.  I've got -- I agree with you about that.  I just


want to be sure you don't stop before I've listed all the


alternatives that you think are possible.


 MS. BEESON: Yes, Your Honor, and thank you for


returning me to my -- to my task there.  Another one is a


law that was passed the same time that COPA was passed -­

passed, which requires Internet service providers to give


all customers information about their filters. 


Another misconception I think left by General


Olson, you don't have to go out and buy another product. 


The record shows that all of the major filtering, all of the


major Internet service providers provide these parental


controls as a -- as a default for parents.  When you -- when


you set up your account with AOL, it asks you right then and


there, you don't have to pay extra, whether you want to


install the parental controls.


 There is also a new law -­

QUESTION: But why did Congress not think these


were adequate?  I can't understand it.  I mean, if that's so

obvious, why -- why didn't Congress see that, that obvious


fact?


 MS. BEESON: Your Honor, part of the problem, of


course, is that most of these laws that I'm mentioning were


passed after COPA was passed.  COPA was passed very early on


in this debate when the Internet was not as well understood


as it is now.  Frankly, the -- the solutions that it has


thought up since then have been better, they've been


narrower, and they have had less -­

QUESTION: Screening existed.  They certainly had,


you know, you're relying heavily on that.  Those -- those


technologies existed and Congress surely considered them and


thought it was inadequate for some reason.


 MS. BEESON: Your Honor, the record in the case


shows that it's at least as adequate and where, as here,


there's a record that shows that there is a broad chilling


effect on protected speech for adults because this is a


criminal statute, those -- those tools are -- are -­

QUESTION: But you're back to your first point now. 


I've got down filters, I understand that, and I've got the


domain names, and I want to know if there's anything else.


 MS. BEESON: Yes.  There are two other points I


would like to make on that.  One is there's -- Congress has


now created something called the Dot Kids domain, which is a


safe environment in which there are sites that are reviewed


43

that are intended just for children.  That Dot Kids domain


can interact with the filters in a way that allows a parent


to set up the AOL account, for example, so that their


younger child has access only to the sites in the Dot Kids


domain.


 QUESTION: What -- what are -- what are the age


limits that are -- are specified there?  Is there something


for the 6-, 7-year-old group and then up to the 15-, 14-,


15-year-old group?


 MS. BEESON: Your Honor, I believe, I don't have


that statute in front of me, but I believe that that -- that


the idea is to set up a safe environment for children 12 and


under, that that -- that's the way that -- that it's defined


there.  And then finally, of course, as we mentioned,


vigorous enforcement of the obscenity law could solve some


of these problems.  The Government has not been doing that,


and I think that before -­

QUESTION: But that, of course, in a sense is


contrary to the -- I mean, from a First Amendment point of


view, isn't it preferable to draw obscenity prosecution


lines favorably towards free speech?  And that's -- I


mention that because that seems to me the basic First


Amendment dilemma that I am having, that it is actually


preferable to lean in the direction of letting the adults go


and see anything they want, virtually anything.  But that

means that there'd be some burden attached, and the burden


that's attached is the key to the spot -- locked room in the


library, the taking New York Times -- Times Square and


moving it out to Yonkers and some place, and here that you


have to identify yourself as an adult. 


That's the true dilemma I'm having, so when you


suddenly say, oh well, let's, you know, launch a crusade


against the obscenity, from a First Amendment perspective,


that might be worse.  So what do you think?


 MS. BEESON: Your Honor, obscenity -­

QUESTION: You don't really want that anyway, do


you?


 MS. BEESON: Obscenity is by definition speech that


is not protected by the First Amendment.


 QUESTION: Yes, but there are a lot of hard lines


in this area, and a set of prosecutors -­

MS. BEESON: There -­

QUESTION: -- who are now determined to go, to -­

to -- to crusade in this area could draw a lot of those


lines differently from say you would.


 MS. BEESON: Well, and I -- and I, of course, am


not trying to say that those prosecutions wouldn't ever


raise a First Amendment issue.  Of course they would -- they


would.  But this statute raises a First Amendment question


in every single application.  Every single time this statute

is applied, it violates the First Amendment because the only


options available to speakers would either put them in jail


for making their speech generally available to the public or


-- or prevent adults from accessing that -- that protected


speech because either the speaker has self-censored or


they've put it all behind a screen that the record shows


drives -- drives away the users, and I -- I think I was


going to make just a another cite to the record that I think


is an important one to note, and that is that the


Government's own expert conceded that thousands of users


would be deterred from any single Web site as the result of


any registration system, and that is, again, similar to the


evidence that the Court relied on in striking down the


statutes regulating indecency in cable television in both


the Playboy and the Denver Area cases. 


This statute has greater problems because it's a


criminal statute.  Those statutes, of course, just involve


civil penalties that -- oh, I thought I had that cite to


give you but I actually don't -- I'll try to -- I'll try to


find it in a moment.


 The -- the district court in its findings of facts


specifically noted that point about the Government's expert


conceding thousands of -- of users.


 QUESTION: But, just clarify it for a minute.  The


reason that thousands are deterred are, one, they don't want

to self-identify, and two, they're unable to have credit


cards or something of that kind.  Those are the two reasons?


 MS. BEESON: Yes, and they don't want to self-


identify because they're too embarrassed or because they


don't want to be stigmatized by being associated with the


content. 


There is an additional reason, which the record


showed, which I think is important to close with, and that


is the nature of this medium.  This is an -- a wholly


unprecedented medium of communication.  This Court found


that in Reno v. ACLU.  It has extremely low barriers to


entry.  It allows users to access millions of sites just


through this linking process. 


The record also showed that by setting up these


barriers that kind of destroyed the nature of accessing


information on the Internet.


 QUESTION: Would you tell me your response to


General Olson's argument that the self-identification


problem is not serious because there's a restraint on the -­

on the transmitter's use of that private information?


 MS. BEESON: I -- I'm sorry, I didn't follow you,


Justice Stevens.


 QUESTION: Well, his answer to your self-


identification problem is that self-identification to


someone who by law is not allowed to pass that self­

identification material on to third parties.

never upheld any statute which -­

QUESTION: But why shouldn't we uphold that


argument?


 MS. BEESON: Because it's so clear that it would


deter adults from accessing protected speech.  I think that


that is -­

QUESTION: But I don't see if you rely on your


reason for deterrence is fear of self-identification, and if


the statute makes that fear groundless, I'm not sure your


argument is persuasive.


 MS. BEESON: Oh, let me then cite to one more


thing, which I meant to get to before and I didn't, and that


is that there is a very big loophole in the privacy


protection in the law and that is -- it's under (d), let me


quickly find it -- under (d)(1), there was an exception --


(d)(2), exceptions to the privacy protection, any -- any


person making a disclosure is not covered, I mean, can make


the disclosure as long as it's necessary to conduct a


legitimate business activity related to making the


communication. 


That's a fairly big loophole that I think would


make a lot of users very nervous, and of course, the -- the


initial problem is that they don't want to give their credit

card or their -- or their ID even to the Web site.  I mean,


these are Web sites that they've never seen before.  They're


surfing the Web.  They're not trusted local stores, they're


-- they're unknown Web sites.


 QUESTION: Yes, but -- but millions of users of the


Web give their credit card number in order to buy books or


something else that's for sale.  I don't understand why


that's such a terrible invasion of privacy. 


MS. BEESON: Your Honor, in fact, what the record


showed in this case was that the only time that Internet


users were comfortable giving their credit card was when


they were ready to make a purchase.  This law applies to -­

as General Olson conceded, to just making the speech


available with -- surrounded by advertising.  Anybody who


did that, it doesn't just apply to speakers who are selling


their speech on the Web.


 In closing, I just want to say again that this


Court has repeatedly held that the Government can't burn


down the house to roast the pig, especially with so many


other tools available to protect minors more effectively


than this statute does.  The Government cannot send adults


to jail for displaying protected speech in the name of


protecting children.  Thank you.


 QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Beeson.  General Olson,


you have four minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. THEODORE B. OLSON


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


 QUESTION: Could you address that exception to the


disclosure thing that Ms. Beeson just brought to our


attention?


 MR. OLSON: Yes.  I don't -- I don't read it that


way.  I don't think that's the -- the exception is intended


to -- to allow the person safe harbor by performing the


function of the adult check.  I mean, I think that's what


it's intended for -­

QUESTION: Where --


MR. OLSON: -- and it hasn't been, hasn't been


identified before as a giant loophole in the statute, and I


don't think it's susceptible to that construction.


 I wanted to go back to where Justice Breyer


started, what would be covered by the statute?  The examples


given by the respondents were addressed in the Government's


brief and all three of the -- all of those examples we don't


believe are covered by the statute.  Susie Bright is not


within, doesn't fit within the prurient interest in the -­

and would be defended on -- this is reminiscent of what the


Court was facing in the American Booksellers case, and the


respondents here were involved in that one as an amicus,


where 16 examples were cited as the house was going to fall

down, the sky was going to fall. 


This Court decided to remand that to the -- the


Virginia Supreme Court and the Virginia Supreme Court found


that none of the 16 parade of horribles would be even


covered by the statute.  That's this all over again, and it


flies in the face of the requirement by this Court to find a


reasonable, a construction of the statute that would be, to


which it would be reasonably susceptible that would deal


with those constitutional problems.


 And -- and these definitions, these definitions


have already been approved with respect to minors in the


Ginsberg v. New York case, so we're not -- and that's a


couple of -- several decades ago, so we're not dealing with


something that is brand new.  Susie Bright, by the way,


writes for Salon magazine.  In order to get her column you


have to register.


 Adult IDs, you can get them with credit cards, you


can get them with a check, and as we point out in footnote 2


of our brief, you can use a driver's license or a passport,


so you don't have to necessarily use a credit card to do


that.  The -- the deterrence issue, all of the -- all of the


-- all the court of -- the lower courts decided is that some


people may be deterred, may be deterred, and some people may


be -- find this as an impediment.  Some people may engage in


self-center -- self-censorship, and to the extent that there

are thousands of people, that's an infinitesimal quantity of


what's on -- on the Web in itself.


 The most important point here, with respect to


alternatives, Congress considered, as this Court suggested


it should, the various alternatives.  The House, the Senate


report's good, but the House report, 775, which is cited all


over the briefs on pages 16 through 20 considered all of


these examples, the tagging, the filtering and so forth and


went through all of the reasons why Congress found that they


would not be effective and that what COPA was providing


would be effective, that there were costs, the burden should


be on the commercial purveyor of the material and so forth. 


Congress went through all of these things and made specific


findings.


 At the end of the day, it's important to emphasize


this is a facial challenge to a statute constructed


according to this Court's guidance, according to this


Court's decisions as to how to deal with a very serious


national problem.  It contains a scienter requirement the


purveyor of this material must know what's being done, he


must be engaged in the regular course of business, and I


can't recall -- I think it was you, Justice Breyer -- who


asked the question, how else could Congress have done it? 


This is a national problem.  It's serious.  It's causing


irreparable injury to our most important resource, our


52 

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 

children.


 Congress has been struggling with this.  It


listened to what this course had -- Court had to say.  It


examined the nature of the medium, because this is a


different medium, but one of the wonderful things about this


medium is also the -- one of the potentially dangerous parts


of this medium.  It's easily accessible to children in the


home and it's important that the Government be -- this


Nation and its three branches of government be concerned


with the care and welfare of children independent of the


parents' responsibility.


 So this is an example of a serious national


problem, Congress following conscientiously this Court's


guidance as to how to solve the problem and then laying it
