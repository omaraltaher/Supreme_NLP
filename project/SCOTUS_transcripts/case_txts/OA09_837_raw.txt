Education and Research v. The United States. 

 Mr. Olson. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 Congress expressly exempted from Social 

Security taxes wages paid to a student who is enrolled 

and regularly attending classes.  The medical residents 

at Petitioners' schools are enrolled and pursuing a 

formal accredited curriculum that has a rigorous core 

curriculum, as I said; hundreds of classes, conferences, 

lectures; laboratory research; written exams; grades; 

and intensive, hands-on clinical patient training under 

the supervision of faculty members.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Olson, are -- are all 

21 

institutions that employ residents schools? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. OLSON:  I don't know -- I don't know 

whether all -- as I understand, the resident program, 

which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for 

Graduate Medical Education, does involve an

accreditation program which would probably fit -- where 

it's taking place, would probably fit the definition of 

schools.  That is certainly not an issue in this case. 

There are -- these -- the institutions that we 

represent -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it might -- it might 

be relevant, because it would be unseemly, perhaps, to 

have residents who are not working at, quote, "schools," 

subject to the FICA tax, and other residents whose 

training is approximately the same escape the tax. 

 MR. OLSON:  Well, that was a judgment that 

Congress made.  Congress made the exemption with respect 

to students, and it tied specifically in to someone who 

is enrolled and regularly attending classes -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you can't give me the 

reality there.  Are all resident programs conducted in 

schools, or are there resident programs that would not 

qualify because they take place in institutions that are 

not schools?

 MR. OLSON:  The only reason I'm hesitating, 

Justice Ginsburg, is I don't know the entire universe 

out there.  Every program, residents' program, that has 

been involved in the various cases that have discussed 

this have been at schools or universities or colleges. 

I'm aware of no program that involves residency and

resident programs accredited by the ACGME that is not 

involve in and does not take place in a school or a 

university or college.  So it could be something out 

there that I am not aware of, but I'm not aware of 

anything of that nature. 

 It is undisputed that these individuals in 

these residents' programs are enrolled and that they are 

regularly attending classes by various definitions of 

the word "class."  The clinical experience that they are 

receiving in hospital rooms, in lecture halls, in all 

circumstances that they're involved in, are educational. 

They are classes, and it is undisputed -- undisputed -­

that the purpose of these programs is to educate doctors 

so that they can achieve board certification and 

hospital privileges. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Olson, are residents 

supervised their entire 40 to 80 hours?  Is there an 

attending physician standing over their shoulder and 

looking at what they're doing?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, there's two parts to that 

question.  The answer to the second part is:  Of course 

not.  There is not a supervising attending physician 

standing over their shoulder at every moment, but they 

are being supervised at all of the time during their 

residency program; that is to say that the work that 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

they do is under the supervision, in that broad sense, 

of an attending physician who looks over what they do, 

comments on what they do, and so forth. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What I -- how I look at 

this case is:  How do you draw the line between a 

student who is working and a worker who is studying?  So 

the issue for me is:  Is the Treasury Department's 

identification of how to draw that line unreasonable? 

Do we owe them deference?

 MR. OLSON:  Well -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's use the example 

that's been floated around the briefs:  the general 

counsel of the university who takes classes to increase 

his knowledge.  Is he a student who is working, or is he 

a worker who's studying? 

 MR. OLSON:  There is --

well, the various 

courts that have considered this have found the 

statutory provision -- that Congress has spoken to the 

subject.  It has provided an exemption for students, and 

it has provided its own limitations.  You have to be

counsel who's going to, let's assume, either three 

classes a week or 6 -- 6 hours of classes, is working 

40 hours as general counsel, and he's regularly enrolled

exemption?

 MR. OLSON:  Well -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why isn't he part of the

9 

 MR. OLSON:  The -- the Internal Revenue 

Service imposes a predominance requirement with respect 

to this.  The courts that have considered it have said: 

This is not a question of law; it is a question of fact. 

Is someone really a student or not?  Common sense and 

10

common understanding of the word "students" would lead 

11 

one to the conclusion of that.  I -­

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why wouldn't common 

sense lead you to the conclusion that if someone is 

working 40 unsupervised hours without an attending 

physician at their side, taking care of patients, that 

that's really not a student?  That's what the Treasury 

Department is saying. 

 MR. OLSON:  Well, that is what the Treasury 

19 

Department is saying.  But, first of all, you have to be 

20

an employee for this provision to apply at all.  This 

21 

provision -­

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't think 

receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make 

you an employee of someone?

 MR. OLSON:  No.  No.  In fact, the 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1

3

government will say that the amount of remuneration is 

immaterial.  The government says that in its 

regulations.  The IRS says that, and it has said it for 

many, many, many years.  And right from the beginning, 

the amount of the remuneration has no significance at 

6 

all.

 The fact is, as every court that has 

considered the question has concluded, is that these 

residents are under supervision.  It -- you may be 

supervised if someone's not standing over your shoulder. 

If they review at the end of the day or at the beginning 

of the -- of the course what you've done, what you -­

what you -- what situations you've encountered, the 

standards that are being applied -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why doesn't that -­

assume it's not the general counsel of the university 

but a lawyer working in the general counsel's office. 

 MR. OLSON:  Well -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He's being supervised by 

the general counsel, his work's being reviewed, and he's 

21 

attending classes at night. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. OLSON:  Well, in the first place, that 

is a different case.  This is a refund action based upon 

the situation -- the facts are on the ground with 

respect to these residents.  That is not the case here.

However, that and the other parade of horribles that the 

Government mentions in its briefs -- what about the 

professor -- I mean, what about the university 

president, what about the general counsel? -- all would 

be excluded by the predominant requirement -­

predominancy requirement, which we're not challenging, 

which is not involved in this case, and the Government 

hasn't challenged here. 

 These individuals cannot achieve what they 

need to achieve for board certification and hospital 

privileges except by having clinical experience.  That 

is -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, what they want to 

14 

achieve is a higher long-term pay, but they can go out 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

and work as doctors. 

 MR. OLSON:  They could -- well, very little. 

The -- the record is very, very clear that almost in no 

cases, in -- in a very, very narrow circumstance can 

they work as doctors.  They won't have hospital 

privileges.  They won't -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I understood that 15 

22 

percent of the physicians were not board certified. 

23

 MR. OLSON:  And -- and many of them may be 

24 

in the military or in circumstances -- but the -- but

considered it, said, for all intents and purposes in the 

modern world, that physicians that are going to be 

treating you and me in the vast majority of cases will 

be board certified.  It's an enormous impediment, and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how about the 

architect residents who are working in universities? 

Are they medical -- like medical residents as well? 

 MR. OLSON:  Well, they may be.  I haven't

studied whether an architect, if they are in a school --

Congress decided what this exemption would cover.  It 

says:  If you are a student enrolled in a school, 

university, or college, and you are regularly attending 

classes, then you would be covered. 

 Now, that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Olson, why not read 

that provision -- now we are going to the statute -- if 

such service is performed by a student, et cetera, as 

saying, look, there's a student status, and the service 

is distinct from the student's status?

 Take the typical work/study program in a 

college.  That would seem to fit this language to a tee. 

There's a student, and the student is working part time, 

but you are -- there -- there is no independent 

significance to the term "student" as you read the text; 

that is, the student and the services are all together.

It's not, "I am a student here and I perform services 

there."  It's -- the student is -- the education is the 

service. 

 MR. OLSON:  Well, the services are performed 

for the purpose of receiving an education.  As -- as the 

Internal Revenue Service construed this provision, up 

until the fact that they lost several cases, was that if 

your purpose was to achieve or pursue a course of 

studies -- that's the old regulation.  If your -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But wouldn't -- wouldn't 

this fit the work/study student who is studying 

philosophy and then he's working in the, say, speech 

department? 

 MR. OLSON:  I didn't hear that last word.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- it seems to me 

that -- what came into my mind when I read these words 

was a work/study program where the student is studying 

and that's the status of student.  The work is separate 

from that.  It's not necessarily to advance the person's 

education.  It's to give the student some money.  So 

that's what I thought -- I thought that this was -- this 

was describing student status, okay; and the student is 

also working for some money. 

 But you seem to say that the service -­

that -- that it's -- the student status is not 

11

1 

independent from the service. 

Official 

2

8

 MR. OLSON:  Well, this -- absolutely, that's 

true in this case.  The students -- the service that the 

students are performing in hospital rooms, looking at 

patients, listening to lectures, working in 

laboratories, is a part of what they're getting paid 

for. 

 So they have to be an employee to begin 

9 

with, in order for this exemption to apply.  They 

10

11 

12 

13

have -- it might be -- it's -- I don't know whether you 

have in mind someone being paid for -- by someone 

outside the school, but this -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No, I have in mind the 

14 

typical work/study program.  The -- the student signs up 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

for work/study and may be assigned to work in the 

administration, helping out with clerical things there. 

But the student status is one thing; the services are 

another. 

 Now, that, I assume, would be covered, that 

the earnings of the student in the work/study program 

21 

would not be subject to FICA? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. OLSON:  Well, the government's got 

various categories of examples.  The situation that 

you've just described sort of falls close to one of 

those examples, but this is -- that is not this case.

 The government would say, I would think, 

that if you are a student, even though your service is 

unrelated to your education, you would fall within the 

exemption.  I think that's one of the examples that the 

government gives. 

 I might have guessed that it would come out 

differently.  But in this case, the purpose for the 

service is education.  The goal of the service is 

education.  It's not to earn a living.  And -- and it's 

10

-- and the goal of the universities is not to make 

11 

money.  It is to provide -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you keep 

focusing, Mr. Olson, on -- on this case.  And one of the 

things that I think is important in the tax code is that 

you not have litigation of each different case, so the 

different courts are coming out with different rules. 

And, at the end of the day, you put one next to the 

other, and it looks pretty hard to tell the difference. 

 So why doesn't it make sense simply to refer 

to -- defer to the Service's interpretation? 

 MR. OLSON:  Well -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You go back and -­

both of you go back and forth with hypotheticals, each 

of which sort of supports, but this basically a very 

familiar situation of an apprentice who is both an

employee and both a student, and to try to draw the line 

in some categorical way doesn't make sense.  The only 

way you can draw the line is to have somebody say:  This 

is going to be the line.  And if anybody is going to say 

it, it ought to be the IRS. 

 MR. OLSON:  Well, I know we're in the 

Supreme Court, but five courts of appeals that 

considered this said that the language is clear.  It 

does not admit to a categorical exclusion of residents 

in programs like this.  It -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, those five courts 

did it before -- most of those opinions were rendered 

before the new regulation. 

 MR. OLSON:  That's right.  And what the 

government having -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Only one of them -­

 MR. OLSON:  The government having lost based 

upon the words of the statute and the regulations that 

they had promulgated that had to do with the goals, the 

purpose, the objective, and the nature of the 

activity -- lost every one of those cases and said: 

We're going to adopt a regulation that does have the 

virtue that the Chief Justice mentioned of -- of being 

categorical.

 It's the same as saying, if you're

left-handed, you're not going to be covered by this 

student exemption, or if you're only doing it during the 

daytime -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it -- is it -- the -­

the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question -- I was 

uncertain.  Suppose a student is working 45 hours a week 

in the grounds department cutting lawns, and he does -­

cutting the school lawn, and he earns enough money to 

help with his way through college.  Now, I thought, 

10

under this, that he is not within this statute because 

11 

it's 45 hours and not 40? 

12

 MR. OLSON:  Oh, yes.  The -- the United 

13 

States -­

14

15

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.

 MR. OLSON:  -- would take the position that 

16 

it's not 45 hours. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That it's not -- okay. 

So -- so, what they're doing is -- it started out with 

the word "student" and the word "service performed" in 

the statute.  Then, for many, many years, they have 

talked about the employment, how it has to be an 

incident to the study.  And "incident" is the key word. 

 And so now what they've done is interpret 

24 

their own word "incident" as saying if it bulks too 

25

large in comparison with the -- with the studying, it's 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

not incident to the study; it's a separate thing.  And 

that's true whether it happens to be medical school or 

it happens to be lawn mowing.  They can't -- they don't 

want it as so big in comparison to the study that it's 

not really part of trying to get the study.  It's just 

6 

too big.  And they use the 40 for that. 

7

8

 MR. OLSON:  Yes, they have. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, if you're 

9 

going to admit the word "incident to," if you're saying 

10

11 

12 

13

they have the right to put the word "incident to," why 

don't they have the right to define "incident to" in 

part in terms of 40 hours a week? 

 MR. OLSON:  Well, because it's both 

14 

arbitrary and it's irrational.  If what the student is

experience, and it's a special learning experience.  The 

problem I was having that I wanted your answer to is 

17

that they have for many, many years said:  Just because 

it's a pure learning experience and nothing but a pure 

learning experience, you still can't get this exemption 

unless the work is incident to that experience.  And by 

"incident" we mean it can't bulk too large -­

 MR. OLSON:  Well -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in respect to the whole. 

8 

So the problem for you is not that it's not education.

 MR. OLSON:  That last step that you made is 

just like Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll's "Through the 

Looking Glass":  A word is what I say it is.

 It -- the work that the -- the residents do, 

the services they perform are all incident to the 

educational process.  There's no dispute that the goal 

is the education, both from the standpoint of the 

university and from the standpoint of the student, that 

that is what is accomplished.  And what -­

Justice Breyer, what they've said is because you are 

doing that, the -- the service is incident to the 

education until you do it for 40 hours.  Then it's no 

longer incident.

 So someone who may be a student under the -­

under the government's interpretation is a student until 

they work that 40th hour a week on a regular basis; then 

somehow they're no longer a student. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Olson, there has been 

a concern expressed that if we accept your position that 

residents are students, it will have ramifications for 

other areas of the law, notably, the National Labor 

Relations Act.  Suppose the residents wanted to organize 

and collectively bargain.  If they're students, they 

can't do that. 

 And let's take the Title VII and the other 

antidiscrimination in employment statutes.  If they're 

not employed, if they're students rather than employees, 

then they wouldn't be covered by that legislation.

 MR. OLSON:  That is the fallacy that the 

government is making, that you have to either be a 

student or an employee.  That argument is not correct, 

because in all other respects, these residents are 

employees.  The exemption provided in 3121(b)(10) does 

not come into play unless you are an employee. 

 So for all those purposes, Title VII, the 

Fair Labor Standards Act, and so forth -- those are 

other statutes that define the term in a certain way. 

What the -- what the code says in 3121(b)(10) -- that 

you are an employee, but if you are an employee of a 

19

college or a university and you are a student, which 

means you are enrolled in classes and regularly taking a 

program for the purpose of education, then you don't pay 

FICA taxes.  It doesn't have any other implication.

 And the Government's position in that 

respect, and the argument that's made in the other 

briefs, is -- are classic red herrings.  They distract 

from the real issue. 

 You don't have to be either an employee or a 

student.  In fact, you have to be both for this 

11 

exemption to apply, and that is what is happening here.

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 Now, again, this is -- there may be 

circumstances where there might be something that's 

close to the line and the government might say, well, 

you're not really a student.  And the government really 

tried that in the Second Circuit, in the Sixth Circuit, 

and the Eleventh Circuit, and -- and the Seventh 

Circuit.  And in each one of those cases, the court -­

and uniformly, all five circuits, including the Eighth 

Circuit -- until the government decided to change the 

regulation to say, essentially, residents are out -­

that's basically what they said. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I looked it up in the 

24 

dictionary, and the meaning number 1 b of "incident" is: 

25

an accompanying minor occurrence or -- occurrence or 

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

3

condition.  Minor.  In other words, there's the big 

thing, and then there's the incident. 

 Now, if that's the meaning, well, this says

 MR. OLSON:  That's the same dichotomy that 

doesn't exist.  The -- the person is a student.  They're 

just doing it long and arduously, and they're doing it 

for several years so that they can be board certified as 

good doctors in their specialty. 

 The idea that somehow you are a student if 

you do it for 39 hours, and if you do it for 41 hours -­

the programs are rigorous.  They -- they have been 

designed by the accreditation programs to be rigorous, 

so that the -- a doctor will see lots of patients, do 

lots of clinical work, because that, according to all of 

the record in all of the cases, is where the education 

takes place. 

 You need the classes.  You need the 

laboratory.  But you need to work with patients doing 

the things that we want doctors to be doing with respect 

to us when they are certified as a specialist in 

neurology or whatever it might be. 

 So Justice Breyer, the idea that -- this is 

a classic definition of not only an arbitrary but a 

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

capricious and irrational regulation.  It says that 

if -- even if you are a student, you're -- you're doing 

the things where you would have to be a student, and 

you're doing the types of things that you would make -­

make you a student, and you're doing it for the purpose 

that would make you for a student, but if you do it a 

little bit too much, you're too much of a student, and, 

therefore, you're not a student. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's because -­

MR. OLSON:  It doesn't make sense. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- of the second meaning 

here.  It's very surprising, I found, first reading the 

statute in the last case, and now I'm reading the 

dictionary.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And here what it says is -­

22

 So they're trying to work out, with that 

word "incident," is the studying of greater or principal 

import?  And what they're saying is, when it's 40 hours

student, and if you do it for 40 and a half hours, all

that the -- that the noneducational aspect of the

service has to be incidental to what they're doing? 

 MR. OLSON:  Well, that might be also.  What 

we're -- what we're saying -- I don't -- I'm accepting 

the word "incident" for the purposes of this case, that 

there is no question that the work that's being done, 

the services that are being performed, Justice Alito,

are incident to the education.  They are a part of the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

 FICA student exemption covers individuals 

who are predominantly students but perform incidental 

employment for their schools.  It does not cover 

Petitioners' medical residents.  They are full-time 

employees, and the Treasury Department has reasonably 

concluded that an employee's paid work does not make him 

an exempt student, even if he also learns from his job. 

 And that's true for three reasons.  First, 

the text of the student exemption makes clear that it's 

not a broad exclusion for apprenticeships and other 

learning jobs.  Instead, it's a narrow exemption that 

applies only to students performing services for a 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1

school, college, or university where they're enrolled 

and regularly attending classes. 

 And, second, when employees are working long 

4 

hours and being paid substantial amounts, they and their

employers should be helping to fund the Social Security 

system, and they should be earning credit towards 

benefits so that they and their families will have 

something to fall back on if they become disabled or 

die.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If the question is whether 

someone is predominantly a student or an employee, why 

shouldn't we ask:  Why are they enrolled in this 

program, and why is the institution enrolling them in 

the program?

 Why are residents enrolled in the program? 

Are they enrolled in the program to make money, or are 

they enrolled in the program either because it's a 

licensing hurdle they have to clear or they want 

additional education, and why is the institution hiring 

them?  Is the institution hiring them to get the value 

of their services or is it hiring them for educational 

purposes? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  It's probably both, Your 

24 

Honor, but it's not workable to determine student status 

25

by looking in a particular case whether the predominant 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

3

motive or the motive of the employee or the employer is 

education.  People who -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in general, though. 

4 

In general, why are residents -- why do medical school 

5

6 

7 

8 

9

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

graduates become residents?  Do they do -- are they 

doing that because they want to earn the 40 to $50,000 a 

year that they're paid, or are they doing it for some 

other reason? 

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think they're doing it for 

both -- for both reasons, Your Honor.  But many, many 

individuals pursue their jobs for the primary purpose of 

learning, like judicial law clerks, like other 

apprentices.  But they're not excluded -- they're not 

covered by this exemption.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because they don't work 

16 

at schools. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. ROBERTS:  Because they don't work at 

schools, colleges, and universities, and they, you know, 

may not be enrolled and regularly attending classes. 

And so the Treasury reasonably concluded that because 

this isn't a general exemption for apprenticeships, that 

they shouldn't construe it as providing a special 

exemption for apprentices who happen to be employed by 

schools, colleges, and universities.  And -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if they -- on average 

26
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

they were paid $10,000 a year?  Would it be the same?

10

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  If they would -- if 

their work -- I mean, here, basically, they have work, 

and the argument is that that work qualifies them as 

students.  And what the -- what the Treasury Department 

has concluded is that it's going to treat work and study 

as distinct categories in deciding whether somebody is 

predominantly a student, and that it's not going to 

count the work as study even if there's some educational 

component to it. 

 And that's reasonable for several reasons, 

as I said.  First, because the statute just isn't a 

general provision that's designed to cover 

apprenticeships.  And, second, because when people are 

primarily workers and they're working for long hours, 

they should be covered and participating in the FICA 

system. 

 And, finally, it -- it would be very 

19 

difficult to determine on a case-by-case basis what's 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

their purpose, what the employer's purpose.  You know, 

is this job more like study?  Is this job more like 

work?  And on that basis -- and to, on that basis, 

decide whether that should make them a student. 

 So considering all of those things, the 

Treasury has decided to draw a bright line and say: 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

Study is study; work is work; and if you're not a 

student independently of that, then your work doesn't 

make you a student.  And the Treasury has also decided 

that if you're working full-time, that then you're 

predominantly an employee rather than predominantly a 

6 

student, and you're not covered by the exemption.

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 In addition, FICA's historical development 

indicates that the student exemption doesn't cover 

medical residents, because at the same time that 

Congress enacted the student exemption, it also enacted 

a separate exemption for medical interns, and it decided 

not to include residents in that exemption.  And those 

actions would have made little sense if the student 

exemption had the scope asserted by Petitioners.

 And then, in 1965, Congress repealed the 

intern exemption in order to give young doctors an 

earlier start in building up Social Security coverage. 

And that repeal also wouldn't have achieved its purpose 

if many and most residents were covered -- were excluded 

from FICA under the student exemption. 

 These -- these residents are people. 

They're working between 50 and 80 hours a week.  They're 

working over a long period of time, and they're 

providing critical patient care with minimal 

supervision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- what if 

the school said:  You have to get all this clinical 

experience, but we're going to pay you for the first two 

hours of the day that you're doing that.  Does that 

change the analysis at all? 

 You seem to be focusing on how many hours 

they're working.  But what if the school says:  Well, 

look, we recognize some of this is going to school and 

some of this is working; so, just like the IRS, we're 

10

going to have an arbitrary rule and we're going to say 

11 

you're being paid for the first two hours.

wouldn't -- it doesn't count whether you're doing it for 

4 hours, for 10 hours, or for 40 hours.  So, in a 

circumstance where they're only being paid -- they're 

only working for paid time for a certain amount, that 

then that work -- you would have to look there, I -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It looks more -- if 

you accept their classification, it looks more like the 

work is incidental to their status as a student.  The 

other way around. 

 MR. ROBERTS:  If you accept the

classification in your hypothetical of two hours -­

providing -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It would if they -­

them anything. 

 MR. ROBERTS:  No, not necessarily, Your 

Honor.  What -- the Treasury regulations define what a 

class is and what a course of study is, and the -- the 

individuals have to be engaging in that to qualify as 

students and performing -- giving somebody something of 

value.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But I thought clinical work 

16 

could qualify as a course.  Is that wrong? 

17

18 

19 

20

 MR. ROBERTS:  Clinical work can qualify as a 

course under certain circumstances.  But the clinical 

work that medical students are doing, if you're 

referring to that, is of an entirely different order 

21 

than the work -­

22

23

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it certainly can if 

they're a -- if they can be a student in the last year 

of medical school, and they -- they're doing 

subintern-level work.  That's a clinical program where 

30

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, it's clinical work, but 

it's -- but it's very different than the work that the 

residents are doing.

 First, there's the distinction that the 

residents are getting paid and that the medical students 

are paying tuition.  But, secondly, from that the 

residents are providing valuable patient care.  Medical 

students are primarily participating in the clinical 

activities solely in an educational capacity.  And I can 

-- if I can describe the different things that they're 

doing. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  We now have a lot of 

14 

briefs -- we now have a lot of briefs filed in this 

15

16 

17 

18

Court by -- in which a lot of the work is done by 

students in law school.  I assume they're getting credit 

for that.  Is that -- is that not a course?

I'm questioning why you're resisting the proposition 

that clinical work can constitute a course.

 MR. ROBERTS:  I'm not resisting the 

proposition that clinical work can constitute a course. 

What I'm saying is that when you're -- when you're being 

paid to provide services, that doesn't count as a 

course, because the IRS has decided to treat work and 

study as distinct categories in -- in applying this 

exemption, and that that's a perfectly reasonable 

distinction. 

 Nothing in the statute precludes them from 

14 

doing that, and Petitioners concede that -- that it's 

15

reasonable to interpret the statute as limited to 

16 

individuals that are predominantly students.

the answer to the question I asked Mr. Olson; that is: 

Are all hospitals with resident programs schools?

 MR. ROBERTS:  No, Your Honor, they're not. 

First of all, under the IRS's regulations, the IRS 

defines schools, colleges, and universities to include 

only institutions whose primary function is the 

provision of formal instruction.

 And, second of all, if -- on J.A. 27a, in

the record in this case, there's an example of residency 

programs that are not students.  The -- one of the 

hospitals that -- the Hennepin County Hospital that has 

University of Minnesota residents also has its own 

residents.  And just looking on page 27a, if you have 

the J.A., there's a question:  Do the Hennepin County 

residents -- are they enrolled in any academic 

institution that you are aware?  Not at the present 

time.

 So, that is an example of one, Your Honor. 

And that does point out an anomaly about Petitioners' 

interpretation of the exemption.  Medical residents who 

work for hospitals that are operated by schools, 

colleges, and universities would be exempt from FICA 

tax, but residents who work for other hospitals wouldn't 

be exempt, even though their work is equally 

educational.  That's just an illustration of the broader 

principle that this isn't an apprenticeship exemption, 

and that's why, because of that, the Treasury has taken 

this approach to the situation where people are learning 

21 

on the job. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Roberts, the 

Petitioners' brief says twice that there's some 

question.  Assuming that we hold that the -- the 

residents are subject to the FICA tax, there's some 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

question whether, even if they had to pay the tax, 

whether they would be eligible to receive Social 

Security benefits or, I take it, credit for four 

quarters in full.

 MR. ROBERTS:  There's no -- there's no 

question, Your Honor.  It's always been the Social 

Security Administration's position that medical 

residents are not students exempt from the Social 

Security Act.  The Social Security Administration stated 

1

 In addition, as a practical matter, the way 

the Social Security Administration determines whether 

people get coverage for a particular period under the 

Social Security Act is they look at the W-2's that come 

in, and if FICA tax has been paid, then they put them 

down as being covered under the Social Security Act.  So 

as a practical matter, it works that way as well. 

 As I said before, these workers who are 

working between 50 and 80 hours a week over many years 

for substantial salaries are precisely the kind of 

workers whose employers should be supporting the Social 

Security system and who should be earning credit towards 

disability and survivor benefits.  And we would ask that 

the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed.

 Thank you. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

 Mr. Olson, 5 minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 With respect to the question that 

Mr. Roberts was addressing with you, Justice Ginsburg, 

the record is very unclear.  In the Eighth Circuit, 

residents may not be eligible for Social Security 

benefits.  It's quite unclear in the other circuits. 

And I invite your attention -- and this is cited in the 

briefs -- to 20 C.F.R. 404.1028, which is a Social 

Security regulation.  It says:  "If your main purpose is 

pursuing a course of study rather than earning a 

livelihood" -- and it's unquestioned that that is what 

is happening here -- "we consider you to be a student, 

and your work is not considered employment." 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Olson, you're not 

taking issue with what Mr. Roberts just said?  That is, 

in practice the -- Social Security looks to see -- they 

look at the W-2, see if the FICA tax was paid, and if it 

was, then -- then they get credit for Social Security. 

 MR. OLSON:  Well, that may be what they do, 

and that may be dependent upon what happens with the

FICA taxes, which is going to be determined -- which has 

been determined in four circuits as not being payable 

with respect to the residents' programs. 

 The fact is that the government has taken a 

position for many, many years.  Talk about deference for 

a moment, the National Muffler factors, which we 

understand still to be appropriate to evaluate deference 

given to an IRS regulation.  This is not a 

contemporaneous regulation.  It is something that came 

along just a couple of years ago.  It's a 

result-oriented regulation.  It's basically saying, we 

lost all these cases on the facts in the court of 

appeals, and now we will pronounce that we will win 

these cases, because we know all these residents 

programs involve more than -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We have said that 

agencies can clarify situations that have been litigated 

and positions that they've lost on. 

 MR. OLSON:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, why is this any 

21 

different? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. OLSON:  This is very different, because 

it -- there's -- not because of any change in 

circumstances or facts.  It isn't a clarification.  It 

is a reversal.  Because for all those years, the 

36

government said that we had this predominance test.  If 

your goal is to pursue a course of study, you are a 

student. 

 Now the government is saying, if your goal 

is to produce a course of study, but you do it for 

6 

41 hours a week, you are not a student.  It is a -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why are we talking 

about National Muffler?  I thought the whole point of 

Chevron was to get away from that kind of multifactor ad 

hoc balancing? 

 MR. OLSON:  Well, I -- this is up to the 

Court.  The Court has never set aside National Muffler. 

The Court cited the National Muffler case in the Cottage 

Savings case, which is subsequent to Chevron.  It cited 

Cottage Savings case in the Boeing case just a couple of 

years ago.  You may tell me that the factors in National 

Muffler are no longer something that you would apply, 

but they're all sensible factors with respect to whether 

you would give deference to a regulation that pops up 

65 years after the enactment of the statute, after the 

government has lost five cases on the facts which are 

directly relevant to the facts here, and it's a new 

regulation, and there has been no reliance. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If Chevron applies, 

those considerations are irrelevant, right?

 MR. OLSON:  You don't need to get to the 

part 2, because we submit Chevron would apply and would 

stop you at step 1.  Government -- the Congress 

addressed the factor at issue in this case.  It said 

what students are:  People who are regularly -- are 

6 

enrolled and taking classes. 

7

 To the extent that you get to the second 

8 

phase, those factors seem to be appropriate to consider.

 If this is important, and if there is some 

anomaly out there, what the government should have done 

is turn to Congress, which enacted the regulation that 

described student and described what the limitations 

were.  It had said nothing to do about a categorical 

limitation that if you're too much of a student, you're 

not a student.  It is backwards.  If there is some 

anomaly, and if the government wants to collect the 

funds from these programs that it has really never 

collected them from before, then it should turn to 

Congress.

 There has been no reliance and -- well, the 

intern -- the intern anomaly, one of the court of 

appeals that -- the court of appeals that considered 

that said it relies completely on non sequiturs.  It 

relies for the interpretation of one statute with the 

repeal of another statute 45 years ago and draws

inference from the legislative history with respect to 

that which -- the repeal took place 1 year after the 

St. Luke's case.  The St. Luke's case, the Sixth Circuit 

decided that interns were not residents, residents were 

not interns. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

 MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The case is
