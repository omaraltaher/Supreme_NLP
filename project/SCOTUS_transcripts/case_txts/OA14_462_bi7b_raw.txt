CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CHRISTOPHER  LANDAU 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  court  below  violated  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

Arbitration  Act  by  refusing  to  enforce  the  parties' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  agreement  on  grounds  the  Ninth  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characterized  as  "nonsensical." 

 

 

            

The  agreement  provides  for  individual 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  and  expressly  precludes  class  arbitration. 

 

 

 

 

 

And  just  to  underscore  that  point,  it  specifies  that  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  would  force  the  parties  into  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration,  then  the  entire  arbitration  agreement  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  unenforceable. 

 

            

The  court  below  interpreted  the  reference  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  to  mean  inoperative  State  law  preempted  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FAA.  But  neither  respondents  nor  the  court  below 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  a  single  case  in  the  history  of  California  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American  law  adopting  that  interpretation  for  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract.  And  it  would  be  ­­

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  about  the  problem  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  California  law  and  a  California  court  said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  the  contract  means  under  California  law?  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  words,  I  can't  find  a  case  that  we're  supposed  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  ­­ or  we  have  the  power  to  say  that  they're  wrong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  they  were  to  say  the  words  "do  not  turn  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

light"  mean  turn  on  all  the  lights. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  ­­ so  ­­ and  they  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  done  that  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

about  it? 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Here  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Nonetheless,  what  do  we  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  LANDAU:  What  you  do  about  it  is  look  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  Arbitration  Act.  There  is  not  a  general 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  contracts  act,  but  there  is  a  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Arbitration  Act  that  Congress  passed  specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

because  a  particular  kind  of  contract  was  not  getting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforced  by  the  courts,  and  Congress  was  concerned  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  So  what  Congress  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  principle  of 

  

 

 

 

contract  interpretation  ­­ I  ­­ I  beg  to  differ  with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia,  the  ­­ I  thought  that  what  the  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked  itself  is  what  did  the  parties  intend  when  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  the  words  "State  law"?

MR.  LANDAU:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Is  that  correct? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  LANDAU:  That's  what  the  court  purported 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  the  interesting

part.  You  used  the  word  "purported."  What  California 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

law  did  it  apply  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ that  disfavors 

  

 

 

 

arbitration?  What  contract  principle  did  they  use? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  again,  a  lot  of  cases, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  have  courts  that  are  ­­ are  bringing  in  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  external  to  the  contract,  and  those  are  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  easy  cases.  This  Court  has  now  made  clear  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  can't  rely  on  principles  external  to  the  contract 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  hostile  to  arbitration. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  courts  also,  under  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

Arbitration  Act,  have  a  responsibility  to  enforce  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

contract  according  to  its  terms  with  a  reference  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  substantive  law  ­­ for  more  than  50  years,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  has  made  clear  that  the  Federal  Arbitration  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creates  Federal  substantive  law.  What  is  the  content  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Federal  substantive  law? 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  was  the  point  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

putting  State  law  in  at  all?  If  Federal  law  applies,

then  it  makes  no  sense  to  have  any  reference  to  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  If  State  law  means  State  plus  Federal  law  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law  trumps  State  law,  the  reference  to  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  just  inexplicable. 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  No,  Your  Honor.  It's  to  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

contrary,  Your  Honor,  with  respect.  The  reference  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  was  a  recognition  of  the  concern  ­­ the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  that  the  parties  were  confronting,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  laws  were  being  enacted,  as  in  California  in  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Discover  Bank  rule,  that  would  force  the  parties  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  arbitration  against  their  will. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  we  had  not  yet  held  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time  this  contract  was  made  that  those  laws  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid. 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Precisely,  Your  Honor.  And  so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

at  that  point,  the  problem  they  were  focusing  on  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law.  They  could  have  also  said,  you  know,  if  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  unenforceable  or  used  the  passive  voice.  But  here, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  chose  to  take  the  bull  by  the  horns  and  be  honest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  what  was  actually  the  problem,  and  they  said  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

But  the  use  of  the  term  "State  law"  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicate  a  recognition  or  a  desire  to  ­­ to  have 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

inoperative  State  law  that's  been  preempted  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Arbitration  Act.  As  the  Ninth  Circuit  said,

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  still  not  sure  that  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  your  answer  to  Justice  Breyer's  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

His  question  was,  this  Court  purported,  and  did,  give  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  the  intent  the  two  parties  had  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  entered  into  a  contract.  And  that  is  a  matter  of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

State  law. 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  ­­ I  understand  the 

    

   

 

 

problem  of  preemption.  I  understand  the  problem  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

preemption  is  ­­ that  a  judicial  decision  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

retroactive.  This  was  not  the  State  law.  But  the  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  assume  that  the  trial  court  in  the  California  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pardon  me  ­­ that  the  California  appellate  court  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  intent  of  the  parties  was  to  interpret  the  law  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  A.  And  ­­ and  "A"  meant  this  superseded  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted  State  law.  How  can  we  reverse  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  if  it's  a  matter  of  State  laws 

   

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting  a  contract  made  by  two  people?  I  ­­ I  ­­

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

that  was  the  question  and  I'm  ­­ I'm  not  quite  sure  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  answer  is. 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  I'm  sorry.  I'll  try  to  be  as 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  as  I  can. 

   

 

            

The  answer  is  because  ­­ you  wouldn't  go  any

Arbitration  Act.  And  the  Federal  Arbitration  Act  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  particular  kind  of  contract,  an  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement,  is  not  solely  a  question  of  State  law.  There 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  Federal  substantive  law  created  under  the  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To  be  sure  as  this  Court  said  in  Volt  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  quoting  from  Volt:  "The  interpretation  of  private 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts  is  ordinarily  a  question  of  State  law  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  does  not  sit  to  review." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  have  no  quarrel  with  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposition.  But  the  key  word  there  is  "ordinarily," 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  case  shows  that  ordinarily  does  not  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively.  Because  the  Court  in  Volt  went  on  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  ­­ and  I  think  this  is  critical,  and  I  think  you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  quote  this  passage  from  Volt  and  be  finished  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case.  It  says,  "In  applying  general  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  of  contract  interpretation  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  an  arbitration  agreement  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope  of  the  Act,  due  regard  must  be  given  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  policy  favoring  arbitration  and  ambiguities  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  scope  of  the  arbitration  clause  itself  resolved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  favor  of  arbitration." 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Does  that  mean  that  whenever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  dispute  about  the  scope  of  an  arbitration 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause  and  a  State  court  says  that  it  includes  a  certain 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  or  doesn't  ­­ it  doesn't  include  a  certain

subject,  that  there  is,  then,  the  question  of  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  because  insufficient  weight  has  been  given  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption  of  arbitrability? 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  There  is  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  question.  Again,  ordinarily  you  start  out  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  proposition  that  contracts  are  governed  by  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  And  we  should  be  very  ­­ let  me  be  very  clear.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  by  any  means  saying  that  the  Federal  Arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  federalizes  this  entire  area.  We  are  kind  of  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  opposite,  that  it  generally  is  a  matter  of  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  but  there  is  a  Federal  toll.  So  you  always  have  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  question  to  be  a  check  on  the  State  court's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application  of  law  for  cases  like  this  when  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfectly  clear  what  is  going  on. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  this  may  be  an  extreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  but  where  ­­ how  do  you  define  the  borderline? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Again,  Your  Honor,  I  think  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  average  case,  the  State  court  can  interpret  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  as  it  sees  fit,  but  then  this  Court's  responsibility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  reviewing  State  law  ­­ this  Court  obviously  can

out  in  favor  of  arbitration? 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  I  found  no  case  ever 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that's  done  that.  And  I  have  exactly  the  same  problem 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Justice  Alito  has. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  mean,  once  we  start  with 

    

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  even  if  this  is  not  too  difficult  under  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  we've  got  every  arbitration  contract  in  the  world 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  one  lawyer  or  another  will  suddenly  be  saying,  oh, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  interpretation  of  the  contract  here  by  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  judge  is  not  favorable  enough  to  arbitration  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hostile  to  the  act.  And  suddenly  we  have  Federalized, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  not  every  area,  a  huge  area  of  State  contract  law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  there's  another  way  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

do  it.  We  could  just  ask  the  California  Supreme  Court. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now,  what  about  that? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Or  ­­ or  come  up  with  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  to  what  Justice  Alito  just  asked. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  No,  your  Honor.  Again,  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  ask  the  California  Supreme  Court  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately  this  is  a  Federal  law  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  not  ask.  No. 

  

  

 

 

 

Ultimately,  it's  a  State  law  question,  what  does  the

contract  mean.  And  the  contract,  on  reading  it,  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  mean  that  it  applies  to  laws  that  are  laws,  not  laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  have  been  held  unconstitutional.  So  what  I've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked  at,  I've  looked  at  civil  rights  cases,  for  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds  of  cases.  I  can't  find  any. 

    

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Even  if  this  case  came  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  Supreme  Court,  and  the  California  Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  we  ­­ again,  it  has  never  done  that,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  one  of  the  odd  things  about  this  case.  But  even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  California  Supreme  Court  were  to  say,  we  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  California  law  say  that  this  ­­ you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  ­­ a  reference  to  State  law  means  preempted  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repealed  or  otherwise  inoperative  State  law  ­­ again,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  hard  to  imagine,  but  let's  say  they  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  you  as  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  still  have  a  responsibility  to  make  sure  that  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comports  with  the  Federal  policy  of  arbitration. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Maybe  that's  so.  But  if 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  California  Supreme  Court  had  said  this,  I  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  ­­ they  would  read  the  Contract  as  if  it  said,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  law  in  the  State  of  California,  a  State  law, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  if  there  ever  has  been,  whether  that  law  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  or  not  constitutional,  whether  it 

 

 

 

 

 

violates  the  Supremacy  Clause  or  not,  if  they  ever  wrote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  words  in  the  State  legislature  into  a  law,  there

is  no  arbitration  contract.  Okay?  I  guess  parties  have 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  right  to  do  that.  And  if  the  California  court  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  matter  of  California  law  they  did  it  right  here,  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  that  we'd  have  a  ground  to  stand  on. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  And  that's,  Your  Honor,  where, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

respectfully,  the  Federal  Arbitration  Act,  again  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  you  ­­ you  need  a  test, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Landau.  You're  ­­ you're  ­­ I  ­­ I  sympathize  with 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer's  point.  You  need  some  test. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Where  does  it  stop?  We're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

going  to  reinterpret  every  State  interpretation  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  that  ­­ that  ends  up  invalidating  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  agreement?  Certainly  not.  So  what's  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

test? 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  The  test  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Can't  you  say  that  at  least 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case  where  ­­ where  the  State  court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  flouts  well­accepted  universal  contract 

 

 

 

 

law  principles,  the  most  important  of  which  is  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret  a  contract  in  a  manner  that  makes  it  valid 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

rather  than  invalid.  And  they  went  out  of  their  way  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret  this  in  a  manner  that  causes  the  whole 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  to  be  thrown  out. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Correct,  Your  Honor.  That  is

why  this  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  give  us  a  test.  Say 

   

  

  

 

 

 

that,  you  know. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  The  test  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You  don't  have  to  go  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  than  that,  where  it  ­­ where  it  flouts  standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  interpretation  principles. 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  certainly,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

that  is  clearly  one  way  to  look  at  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Do  you  really  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  parties  here  ­­ this  is  something  that  I  don't  know 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  to  quarrel  with  or  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  California  court  said,  we  don't  know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  parties  even  thought  about  preemption.  And  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  three  years  into  litigation  that  preemption  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settled  by  this  Court.  Do  you  really  think  they  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  said  that  ­­ one  of  the  parties  would  have  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  adversary,  oh,  yes,  now  I'll  go  into  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  three  years  of  litigation? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Absolutely,  Your  Honor,  because 

  

 

 

 

 

the  only  reason  that  they  were  not  arbitrating  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get­go  was  because  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Was  because  California

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ you  don't. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  LANDAU:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  what  they  wanted. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

If  California  law  said  no,  they  wouldn't. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Right.  Right.  And  so  once  it 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

is  clear  that  the  thing  that  would  have  forced  them  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  arbitration  is  gone,  either  because  the  California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  repealed  it  or  because  this  Court  held  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  preempted,  then  it  ­­ again,  it's  nonsensical  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  when  they  entered  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

when  they  entered  the  agreement,  both  parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplated  that  State  law  meant  California  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  why  you  did  not  object  to  the  lawsuit  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  in  court.  So  if  the  parties'  intent  at  the  time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  entered  the  agreement  and  at  the  time  the  lawsuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  court  was  started  was  clear,  the  parties  intended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  arbitration  agreement  would  be  out  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  class  action  was  unenforceable  in  California.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  intended  at  the  time  they  made  the  contract; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  that  so? 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  No,  Your  Honor.  What  they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

intended  was  that  this  would  turn  by  reference  to  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  At  that  time,  State  law  was  as  Your  Honor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describes.  You  are  absolutely  correct.  But  they  didn't

say,  if  State  law  as  it  exists  today  requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration.  In  other  words,  there's  nothing  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  that  freezes  this  in  a  particular  point  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

time.  It  takes  a  snapshot  ­­

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  we're  trying  to  find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

out  what  the  parties  meant,  why  wouldn't  we  look  to  see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  meant  at  the  time  the  contract  was  formed? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  because,  again,  it's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  contract  that  they  chose  used  an  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verb.  We've  been  talking  a  lot  about  the  noun  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence,  the  clause  "the  law  of  the  State."  But  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  verb  says  if  the  law  of  the  State  would  find,  not  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  law  of  your  State  today  finds. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  imagine,  Your  Honor,  if  California  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repealed  its  CLRA,  which  has  the  anti­waiver  provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  are  relying  on.  Well,  I  don't  think  anybody 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say,  well,  because  the  CLRA  was  in  effect  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  this  thing  was  ­­ was  enacted,  that  if  a  CLRA  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later  repealed,  we  still  have  disclaimed  arbitration. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So,  Mr.  Landau,  let's  assume 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're  right,  that  this  is  a  really  bad  mistake  when  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  to  arbitration.  So  just  to  take  you  back  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito's  point  and  Justice  Scalia's  point,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  usually  we  don't  fix  bad  mistakes  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Correct.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ when  State  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

interpret  State  law.  I  mean,  there  are  a  lot  of 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

mistakes  when  it  comes  to  interpretation  of  contracts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including  arbitration  agreements. 

 

 

            

So,  again,  what's  the  standard?  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

nothing  on  the  face  of  this  opinion  that  indicates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hostility  to  arbitration.  To  the  extent  that  you  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  reasoning  in  this  opinion,  which  you  have  to  search 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  find,  but  to  the  extent  that  you  can  find  reasoning, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  about  interpreting  form  contracts,  interpreting  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

whenever  you  see  an  ambiguity  in  a  form  contract,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret  it  against  the  drafter.  And  that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  of  contract  interpretation  that,  as  far  as  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  see,  has  been  used  hundreds  of  times  in  California. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  appears  to  be  a  very  common  principle  of  contract 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  in  California  whenever  California  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  a  contract  of  adhesion. 

   

 

 

 

            

So  why  isn't  that  just  what  they  did,  and  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  did? 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Fair  enough.  But  even  by  its 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

terms,  the  predicate  for  that  is  some  ambiguity.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  just  say,  well,  guess  what,  contract  of  adhesion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately  we  go  to  construing  against  the  drafter. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  have  to  have  an  ambiguity.  There's  no  antecedent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity.  And  the  court  really  didn't  identify

anything  other  than  to  totally  question  begging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assertion  that  the  general  ­­ specific  governs  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general. 

            

Again,  Your  Honor,  I  want  to  be  very  clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  our  rule  is  very  narrow.  And  this  Court  does  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  go  any  further  than  it  went  in  Volt  to  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally,  contract  interpretation,  even  if  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

erroneous,  is  a  matter  of  State  law.  But  ­­ and  we're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  saying  that  every  mistaken  contract  interpretation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  rise  to  a  Federal  question. 

   

 

 

 

            

What  we  are  saying,  though,  is  just  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  court's  role  is  to  make  sure  ­­ to  look  at  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  court  did  and  say,  can  we  see  that  this  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave  effect  to  the  healthy  Federal  policy  regarding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  and  construed  doubts  in  favor  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration?  Here,  you  see  the  opposite.  And,  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

know,  with  respect,  Your  Honor,  you  can't  see  on  the

worked  for  the  last  30  years  that  it's  been  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

books.  I  think  ­­ this  case,  again,  is  not  a  great  case 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  saying  how  wrong  does  wrong  have  to  be.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly,  here,  it's  nonsensical.  Again,  I  think  there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

may  be  cases  that  will  have  ­­ and  I  think  you  have  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  If  I  were  to  come  ­­ I  could  use  other  words 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  unreasonable  or  manifestly  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  back  to  my  point.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

looked  in  civil  rights  cases. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  south  passed  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

after  statute  like  the  sit­in  statutes  and  so  forth  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  prevent  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  from  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implemented.  So  I  looked  at  a  few  of  those  that  my  law 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clerk  got.  In  none  could  I  find  the  court  saying  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  State  law  where  it  isn't  itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional,  you  know,  what  ­­ what  is  a  trespass 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  forth.  There  ­­ it  violates  the  Federal  law, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they'd  say  is  we  interpret  the  State  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  They've  gone  that  far, 

  

 

 

 

 

because  we  think  the  State  would  interpret  the  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  way.  But  I  can't  find  an  analogy  to  what  you're

we're  not  going  to  make  too  much  progress  on  finding  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  but  California  does  accept  requests  from  us, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  other  Federal  courts,  to  explain  what  California  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is.  I've  looked  at  that  statute.  And  if  this  is  so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outrageous  as  a  matter  of  contract  interpretation  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

State  law,  why  don't  we  just  ask  them? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

this  case. 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Because,  again,  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  They  have  not  considered 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  LANDAU:  They  ­­ they  denied  certiorari 

  

 

 

 

 

 

over  the  ­­ one  of  the  justices.  And  ­­ but,  again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Your  Honor's  role  is  is  to  interpret  this  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  Federal  law.  So  the  ­­ again,  it  would  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away  if  ­­ if  they  were  to  change  the  rule  as  a  matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  State  law.  But  ultimately,  the  Federal  issue  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  present  here.  The  ­­ again,  there's  always  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  issue  just  to  make  sure  that  the  State  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't  gone  too  far. 

 

 

 

            

Again,  I  understand  exactly  what  the  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

is  grappling  with.  Where  do  you  draw  the  line  on  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  goes  too  far.  Again,  our  point  is  this  case  is  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

far  on  one  side  of  the  line.  And  ­­ for  instance  ­­

a  contract  against  ­­ against  the  person  who  drafted  it.

MR.  LANDAU:  I  think,  Your  Honor,  you 

    

 

 

 

 

started  out  by,  one,  that  you  want  a  contract  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid.  They  went  out  of  their  way  to  look  to  a  way  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  this  unenforceable.  And  if  you  just  take  a  step 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  and  look.  It  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Make  what  unenforceable? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  LANDAU:  The  arbitration  agreement. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  the  arbitration 

  

 

 

 

agreement  was  enforceable  in  lots  of  situations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  No,  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  There  was  no  agreement 

  

 

 

 

 

to  arbitrate  class  actions.

MR.  LANDAU:  Their  position  is  that  the

respect  to  California. 

 

 

            

Again,  what  is  going  on  here?  It's  clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  parties  say  we  want  to  arbitrate  our  disputes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless  State  law  forces  us  into  arbitration.  Once  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  can  no  longer  force  you  into  arbitration,  they  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  any  plausible  narrative  for  why  the  parties  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  agreed  to  blow  up  and  jettison  their  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights  if  nobody  is  actually  forcing  them  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Go  back  to  Justice  Scalia, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

please.  What  I  understood  this  to  be  is  one  reason  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  from  your  perspective  is  an  unreasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  weird  one  is  because  the  statute  basically  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  to  arbitration  unless  you  are  in  a  State  where  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  would  require  class  arbitration.  And  if  that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  you're  in,  dump  the  whole  arbitration  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ business.  Okay. 

  

  

 

 

Now,  one  reason  that's  a  bad  interpretation 

   

 

 

 

 

is  that  probably  what  they  meant  is  valid  State  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Of  course. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  That's  one. 

  

  

 

 

 

MR.  LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  is  there  any  other?

that  in  Section  10  here,  there's  a  choice  of  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  specifically  addressing  the  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

clause.  And  the  general  choice  of  law  provision  is  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  9  of  the  agreement,  but  ­­ excuse  me,  in  Section 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  ­­ but  it  says,  "notwithstanding  the  foregoing."  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  words,  the  fact  that  State  law  and  FCC  or  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  applies.  With  respect  to  the  arbitration  provision, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  FAA  shall  govern. 

 

 

 

            

So  our  position  is,  it  is  nonsensical  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  when  the  contract  goes  out  of  its  way  to  say  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FAA  shall  govern  the  arbitration  provision,  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  take  a  reference  to  the  law  of  your  State  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  provision  and  say  the  law  of  your  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  unaffected  by  the  FAA. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Landau,  I  completely 

   

  

 

 

take  your  point  as  to  what  the  parties  must  have  wanted, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  does  make  this  State  court  opinion  unsatisfying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  a  kind  word  for  it,  but  ­­ but,  you  know,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairness  to  the  State  court,  part  of  the  problem  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  this  contract  was  worded.  Everybody  else  finds  ways 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  word  contract  provisions  like  this  so  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  a  problem.  If  the  contract  had  said,  you  know,  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  action  waivers  are  invalid  in  your  State,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  9  is  unenforceable,  there  would  have  not  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  this  problem.  This  is  ­­ it's  a  very  unusual

contract  provision.  Most  companies  use  very  clear  ones. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  one  did  not. 

 

 

 

            

And  so  the  ­­ the  State  court  had  to  sort  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

puzzle  over  what  it  meant  and,  as  you  say,  probably  got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  answer  wrong.  Strike  the  "probably."  Got  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer  wrong.  But,  you  know,  wrongness  is  just  not  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  do  here. 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Your  Honor,  but,  again, 

  

 

 

 

 

wrongness  is  not  what  you  do  here,  but  this  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  contract.  And,  again,  I  think  this  is  why 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Did  you  draft  this

MR.  LANDAU:  The  new  provision,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  I  have  here,  it  says  ­­ it  just  ­­ it  takes  out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  word  "State  law"  and  just  says  "if  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unenforceable." 

            

 

 

And,  again,  the  ­­ but  the  reason  it  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  was  not  to  suggest  that  inoperative  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  do  it.  It  was  recognizing  the  fact  that  the  evil 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  which  it  ­­ the  clause  was  being  put  in  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  laws  that  would  force  you  into  class  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  your  will. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Do  we  have  ­­ do  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someplace  that  has  the  change  that  was  made  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  of  the  contract? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  I  do,  Your  Honor.  I  have  the 

    

    

 

 

 

 

new  ­­ here  it  is,  Your  Honor.  The  current  version  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  DIRECTV  contract  says,  "A  court  may  sever  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  of  Section  9  that  it  finds  to  be  unenforceable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except  for  the  provision  on  class  representative  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  attorney  general  arbitration."  That's  in 

  

 

 

 

 

Respondent's  brief  on  Page  36. 

 

 

 

 

            

Again,  I'm  not  saying  there  aren't  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways  to  write  it,  but  the  fact  that  there  are  other  ways 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  write  it  doesn't  mean  that  it's  ambiguous.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  I'm  sure  this  Court  construes  many  statutes  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  been  written  in  other  ways,  but  that  doesn't

make  them  ambiguous. 

 

 

            

Let  me  just  please  underscore  one  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point.  If  the  contract  ­­ and  the  California  Court  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appeals  said,  if  in  Section  9  the  law  of  your  State  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governed  by  the  FAA,  if  that  had  been  in  Section  9,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  would  have  had  no  problem  with  this  enforcing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  provision.  But  it  does  say  that.  It  just 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  that  in  Section  10.  Section  10,  the  choice  of  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision,  specifically  says  that  the  FAA  shall  govern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  9,  the  arbitration  provision.  The  law  of  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  language  in  Section  9  is  governed  by  the  FAA.  So, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact,  it  is  right  there  on  the  contract. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  again,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  we  know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  had  a  ­­ Congress  was  concerned  because  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  kind  of  gimmick  where  courts  were  coming  up  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strained  interpretations  to  avoid  enforcing  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions.  This  is  FAA  101.  We  are  not  asking  this 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  to  make  any  new  law,  but  just  to  reinforce  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  said  in  Volt,  which  is  ordinarily,  it  is  a  matter  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law. 

 

            

And,  Your  Honor,  Justice  Breyer,  you  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  couldn't  find  any  case.  Well,  Volt  is  a  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  Court  went  on  to  examine.  The  Court  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  we  defer  to  California  State  law  and  it  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  unassailable  to  use  the  words  that

Respondents  would. 

 

            

To  the  contrary,  Volt  said  we  are 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

going  to 

 

consider  the  ­­ the  interpretation  proffered 
 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the 

 

State  court  and  decide  whether  we  think  it  is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent 

with  the  Federal  policy  favoring  arbitration 
 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  FAA. 

 

 

So  there  is  a  Federal  component.  It  isn't  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  the  ­­ Volt  says  the  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  place  interprets  the  law  of  the  place  exactly  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  ­­ or  allows  that  interpretation  exactly  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  that  this  State  court  interpreted  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  law  of  the  place  was  just  the  law  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  unmodified  by  any  possibly  preempting  Federal  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Right.  But  in  Volt,  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

course  ­­ the  issue  in  Volt  was  that  the  court  there  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  refuse  to  enforce  arbitration.  The  Volt  court  said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  we  don't  have  a  problem  with  this,  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  all  about  the  efficient  process  in  terms  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration.  And  the  Volt  court  went  out  of  its  way  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  we  find  that  this  favors  the  Federal  policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fostering  arbitration. 

 

            

And  the  court  reiterated  that  specific 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  Volt  and  insisted  on  it  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mastrobuono,  Casarotto  and  Preston.  In  other  words, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Volt  took  pains  to  say  that  the  interpretation  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upheld  there  was  a  pro  arbitration  provision  that  gave

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Goldstein. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  THOMAS  C.  GOLDSTEIN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice,  and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  case  is  a  reprise  of  Oxford  Health. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

The  argument  of  the  party  that  wanted  arbitration  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Oxford  Health,  the  arbitrator  had  just  gotten  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terribly  wrong  under  this  Court's  decision  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Stolt­Nielsen.  And  this  Court  may  well  have  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sympathy  for  that,  but  the  Court  realized  that  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  actually  have  to  write  an  opinion  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  an  opinion  that  the  lower  courts  were  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  apply  in  later  cases.  And  the  difficulty  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  you  interject  Federal  law  here,  you  are  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  just  a  wealth  of  DIRECTV  challenges,  because  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  instance  in  which  the  State  court  announces  here's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  we  understand  this  language,  which  is  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  in  our  contract,  it  will  be  open  to  the  party

favor  of  arbitration,  and  this  is  always  a  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  but  that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  if  you  said  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  If  ­­ that  may  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  with  the  FAA.  But  the  FAA  was  adopted  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  courts  were  hostile  to  arbitration  and  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  like  that.  Now,  how  were  they  hostile  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration?  They  were  hostile  to  arbitration  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

adopting  special  rules  of  contract  interpretation  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disfavored  arbitration.  And  in  those  instances,  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  FAA  says  is  that  that's  what  they  wanted  to  stop, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  rules  of  contract  interpretation,  ordinarily  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  State  law,  but  not  when  it's  hostile  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FAA. 

            

And  what  could  be  more  hostile  to  the  FAA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  to  interpret  a  phrase  that  says  nothing  about  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FAA  to  dispense  with  our  holdings  about  ­­ as  they  came 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  ­­ our  holdings  about  what  the  FAA  has  to  say. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  to  do  that  even  though  there's  a  provision  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  that  says  this  is  governed  by  the  FAA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  So,  sir  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  In  other  words,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understand  ­­ I'm  sympathetic  to  the  notion  that  this  is

precisely  what  the  FAA  was  getting  after,  State  judges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting  contracts  under  special  rules  hostile  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration. 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  So,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  if  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  deal  with  your  real  concern  about  where  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  comes  from,  the  idea  that  this  is  kind  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

core  discrimination  against  arbitration  that  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  after  kind  of  structurally  and  then  what  exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

The  root  of  the  FAA  ­­ and  it's  reflected  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ in  the  statutory  text  in  Section  2  ­­ is  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  courts  were  adopting  doctrines  that  were  hostile 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  arbitration.  Discover  Bank's  one  of  them  this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded.  What  the  FAA  is  not  concerned  with  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  could  well  pass  a  law  that  would  be  ­­ is  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold  question  of  whether  there's  an  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  in  the  first  place;  that  is,  we  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unable  to  locate  in  this  Court  or  any  other  court  a  time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  courts  overturned  the  determination  under  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  whether  the  parties  had  agreed  to  arbitrate  vel  non. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  an  antecedent  question. 

 

 

 

            

It  may  well  be  that  Congress  could  conclude 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  is  a  problem  like  that  and  adopt  a  statute 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  it.  But  to  do  that  here  is  to  really  open  up  an

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You're  arguing  that  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  FAA  does  not  cover  State  gimmicks  that  disfavor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  so  as  long  as  what  they  say  is  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  agreement  in  the  first  place. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  No,  Justice  Scalia,  don't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  misunderstand  me.  If  the  Court  were  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  what  you  said. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  I  apologize,  then. 

    

 

 

If  the  Court  were  to  conclude  that  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  an  effort  to  discriminate  against  arbitration,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  the  Court  has  doctrines  and  the  lower  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  doctrines.  We  are  not  saying  that  you  have  to  turn 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely  a  blind  eye  to  the  idea  and  let  a  State  court 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  away  with  anything. 

 

 

 

            

My  point  is  different.  And  that  is,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  not  a  doctrine  that  is  intended  to  discriminate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  arbitration.  It  is  not  an  indicia  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pattern  ­­

Federal  question. 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  If  you  were  to  ­­ we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree  that  there  is  a  backstop  here,  and  it's  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  backstop.  And  that  is,  if  you  conclude  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  is  just,  you  know,  making  it  up  and  discriminating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  arbitration,  we  think  that's  an  important  role 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  court  to  play.  But  the  difference  here  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  argument  is  that  the  State  court  really  got  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong  and  had  an  obligation  to  kind  of  presume  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  wanted  to  engage  in  arbitration. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  is  a  very,  very,  very  different 

   

 

 

 

 

proposition  of  law  because  it  asks  the  Federal  courts  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interject  and  the  State  courts  to  interject  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  exactly  what  Volt 

  

 

 

 

 

says,  what  Mr.  Landau  quoted,  is  "Due  regard  must  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  to  the  Federal"  ­­ in  interpreting  a  contract. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  talking  about  interpreting  the  intent  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  ­­ "Due  regard  must  be  given  to  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  favoring  arbitration  and  ambiguities"  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

  

we 

could  ask  whether  or  not  this  clause  is  ­­ this  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ambiguous  ­­ "and  so  the  scope  of  the  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  must  be  resolved  in  favor  of  arbitration." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  There  are  two  points 

  

  

 

 

 

 

about  that.

law  contract  looking  at  State  law  principles,  but  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  Federal  rule  that  must  be  followed  in  ­­ in  making 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  interpretation,  and  that  is  a  matter  for  us  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review. 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  There  are  two  things 

  

  

 

 

 

 

about  that.  The  first  is,  Justice  Kennedy,  the  language 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  kind  of  trailed  off  in  your  sentence  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  been  very  clear  that  ambiguities  in  the  scope 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  an  arbitration  agreement  have  to  be  construed  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor  of  arbitration,  and  here's  the  reason.  And  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  if  we  know  these  parties  have  agreed  to  arbitrate  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  in  the  first  options.  It's  in  lots  of  cases  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  we  know  you  and  I  have  agreed  to  arbitrate  so  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  an  arbitration  agreement,  we're  going  to  assume 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  all  of  the  cases  fall  into  the  bucket  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrability,  and  that's  a  fair  common­sense 

   

 

 

 

presumption. 

            

But  what  the  Court  said  in  Justice  Thomas's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  for  the  Court  in  Granite  Rock  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  whether  there's  an  enforceable  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  at  all  is  not  ­­ is  a  State  law  question,  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  Federal  law  question,  and  here's  the  reason.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  two  interpretive  principles  under  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Arbitration  Act.  Number  one  is,  we  want  to  only  require 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  to  arbitrate  when  they  have  ­­ we  are  convinced

under  their  State  law  contract  they  did  intend  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrate.  We  can't  presume  that  you  and  I  intend  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrate  because  that's  the  question  we're  asking. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  most  important  thing  for  you  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  about  the  nature  of  this  Section  9  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  is  that  it  does  determine  whether  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  any  arbitration  at  all  in  California.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  say,  is  there  any  agreement  between  DIRECTV  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  California  consumers  to  arbitrate? 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  can  point  to  ­­ it's  very  important 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  understand  that. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  I  just  don't 

    

   

 

 

understand,  then,  Mr.  Goldstein  ­­ and  maybe  it's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  question  that  Justice  Scalia  asked  ­­ I  don't  see 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  it's  better  somehow  to  discriminate  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  by  declaring  arbitration  agreements 

 

 

 

 

unenforceable  writ  large  than  it  is  by  narrowing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope  of  arbitration  agreements  unfairly. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  There  are  two  just  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  two  rules  at  stake.  When  it  comes  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  whether  you  and  I  have  an  arbitration 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  at  all,  what  the  court  has  said  is  two  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One  is,  this  is  going  to  be  a  matter  of  State  law.  But, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  course,  if  all  you're  doing  is  ­­ this  is  a  game.

Arbitration  Act.  That's  a  ­­ you  know,  that's  a  role 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

for  the  Federal  courts. 

 

 

 

            

 

What  Mr.  Landau  is  relying  on  and  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  that's  quoted  from  Volt  that  comes  from  Moses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

H.  Cone  is  talking  about  is  something  quite  different. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  is,  construe  every  ambiguity  in  favor  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration.  That's  what  I'm  resisting,  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  he'll  say,  I  think,  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

­­ we  certainly  pressed  him  on  it  enough  ­­ is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ read  the  sentence,  the  relevant  sentence.  "If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  law  of  your  State  would  find  the  agreement  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispense  with  class  action  procedure  unenforceable,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  entire  Section  9  is  unenforceable."  All  right. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

That's  what  it  says. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  would  the  law  of  California  find  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  "dispense  with  class  action"  procedure 

 

 

 

 

 

unenforceable?  The  answer  to  that  question  is  clearly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no.  Because  they  did  have  a  law  like  that,  but  it  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid.  So  in  order  to  read  this  in  your  favor,  you'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  say  these  words:  If,  however,  the  law  of  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  would  find  this  agreement,  you  have  to  read  it  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  if,  however  the  invalid  law  of  your  State  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  this  agreement  to  dispense  with  class  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unenforceable,  then. 

 

            

Now,  nobody  ­­ it's  very  hard  to  say  that

the  parties  meant  if  the  invalid  law  of  your  State  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  it  and,  therefore,  contract  interpretation  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  law,  this  question  of  law  was  decided  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  to  read  the  word  "law"  as  "invalid  law," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  case  in  California  or  anywhere  else,  to  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledge,  that  has  interpreted  contracts  in  such  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  the  arbitration  context,  and  therefore,  this  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  law  interpreting  this  word  this  way  is  discriminating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  arbitration.  That's  something  like  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument  he's  making.  Your  answer  to  that  is? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  First,  is  that  there  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrable  line  that  he  can  identify  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that's  wrong  and  really,  really  wrong.  But  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  event,  it's  not  ­­ it's  not  correct  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  is  improperly  interpreted. 

 

 

 

            

Here  are  the  reasons:  The  first  is  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer,  if  you  and  I  have  a  contract  that  says 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  California  law  would  prevent  us  from  having  a  class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  waiver,  we  will  not  arbitrate  at  all.  That  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  preempted.  That's  the  second  holding  of  Volt. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Remember,  all  AT&T  versus  Concepcion  is,  is  a  rule  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  if  California  forces  us  to  engage  in  class  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration.  But  you  and  I  can  agree  to  anything  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all. 

            

This  contract,  when  it  says,  "If  the  law  of

your  State  would  find  the  class  action  waiver  invalid" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  perfectly  fine  thing  for  us  to  agree  to.  That's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  and  even  accounts  for  preemption  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FAA  does  not  preempt  California  law  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  does  California  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

law,  a  valid  law  that  would  find  the  agreement  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispense  with  class  action  unenforceable?  Does  it  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  it? 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  It  does.  It  does. 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  does.  In  other  words, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

California  now  has  a  law  that  makes  it  okay  to  dispense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  class  action  procedures. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  In  several  respects.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

first  is  there  are  several  cases  ­­ there  are  an  array 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  cases  that  aren't  subject  to  the  Federal  Arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act.  And  the  second  is  if  you  and  I  agree  to  follow 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  law,  it  is  not  preempted. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let  me  also  point  to  some  other  indicia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  going  to  make  it  very  hard  for  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  you  have  to  agree  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer  ­­ or  do  you  not  ­­ that  California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted  this  contract  as  saying  if  there  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid  State  law  that  prohibits  arbitration,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  binding  on  us.

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  what  you're  saying. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  We  don't,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

So  remember,  my  point  is  this:  If  you  and  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

have  a  contract  to  follow  that  State  law,  which  is  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  contract,  then  it's  not  invalid  because  Concepcion 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  preemption  only  apply  when  the  State  forces  you  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  something.  But  in  all  events  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  sure.  The  parties  can 

  

  

 

 

 

 

do  anything  they  want.  But  the  question  is,  did  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  do  what  they  want  ­­ did  the  parties  do  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here? 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Right.  And,  Your  Honor,  my 

  

  

 

 

 

 

problem  is  that  that's  going  to  be  the  question  in  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  And  if  we  say  we're  going  to  reverse  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision,  then  every  time  there's  going  to  be  a  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  whether  this  is  really  what  the  parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended,  that  every  time  that  the  contract  is  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous  under  State  law. 

 

 

 

            

            

But  I  did  have  a  couple  of  other  things  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  one  horrible,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

the  horrible  on  the  other  side  is  if  we  ­­ if  we  agree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  you,  the  States  can  do  whatever  they  want  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalidate  arbitration  agreements  so  long  as  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  it  under  the  guise  of  contract  interpretation.  Is

that  not  also  a  horrible? 

   

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  It  is  ­­ is  a  possible 

   

  

 

 

 

 

horrible,  Justice  Scalia.  So  let  me  just  give  you  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice  between  the  two  of  them.  There  is  no  evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  latter  is  actually  happening,  and  you  do  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  backstop.  And  that  is,  we  fully  agree  that  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclude  that  a  State  court  is  just  making  it  up  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminating  against  arbitration,  the  FAA  has  a  role 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  play. 

 

            

What  I'm  saying  to  you  is  that  they  do,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

truth,  want  a  different  legal  rule,  and  that  is,  you've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  to  construe  these  in  favor  of  arbitration.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  principle  that  he's  trying  to  derive  from  Volt,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  That's  a  whole  other  kettle  of  fish  than  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

backstop  that  you  and  I  are  talking  about. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  if  we  could  see  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  court  opinion  that  doesn't  say  anything  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicitly  against  arbitration,  but  it  interprets  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  in  such  a  strange  way  that  the  only  possible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation  for  the  interpretation  is  hostility  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration,  can  that  be  invalidated? 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  I  think  so,  Your  Honor. 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  that's  the  question. 

  

 

 

 

 

Does  this  case  fall  to  that  category?

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  All  right.  If  that's  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  question  is,  because  that  is  not  the  Volt  principle. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  the  idea  that  this  is  just  wildly  out  of  bounds. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  the  incredibly  fact­bound  question  about  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  one  decision  is  wildly  out  of  bounds.  So  let  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk  about  the  other  reasons  it's  not  remotely  wildly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  bounds.  Because  if  you  write  an  opinion  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  other  than  legal  rule  you  just  articulated, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito,  we  are  going  to  be  in  an  incredible  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  you  say  that's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Volt  principle.  Why  isn't  it  the  Volt  principle? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ambiguities.  I  mean,  this  is  even  more  than  an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity.  Even  ambiguities  have  to  be  interpreted  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved  in  favor  of  arbitration.  And  this  is  more  than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  ambiguity. 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Okay,  Justice  Kennedy. 

  

 

 

 

Because  in  my  ­­ I  may  be  mistaken,  but  I  think  that  you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Justice  Alito  are  describing  two  different  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules.  Justice  Alito  is  saying,  as  I  understand  it  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  don't  purport  to  speak  for  the  Justice, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  ­­ is  that  if  this  is  a  crazy  decision,  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid  under  the  FAA.  The  ambiguities  construed  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor  of  arbitration  principle  is  an  ordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretive  principle.  And  the  reason,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Kennedy,  just  to  bracket  this,  why  the  Volt  principle,

the  Moses  H.  Cone  principle  doesn't  apply  here,  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  it's  ambiguities  in  the  scope  of  an  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement.  Here  the  question  is  whether  the  parties  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  arbitration  agreement  whatsoever. 

 

 

 

            

So  we  ­­ I  think  we've  now  agreed  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  rule  perhaps.  And  so  let  me  tell  you,  if  I  could, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  I  don't  think  you  can  write  an  opinion  that  says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  nuts. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  add  to  that,  what  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Ninth  Circuit  say  about  this?  The  Ninth  Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  it  was  absurd.  Was  that  the  word? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah,  it  was  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Right. 

  

 

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  ­­ nonsensical. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Nonsensical. 

  

 

If  we  agreed  with  the  Ninth  Circuit  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  nonsensical,  we  ­­

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  I  mean,  I  just  don't  want  to 

    

   

 

 

 

 

­­ I  don't  want  to  play  around  with  words,  Your  Honor, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  nonsensical  or  not.  I  think  you  and  I  are 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

basically  on  the  same  page  about  the  FAA  principle. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here's  what  I  have  in  terms  of  why  this  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  remotely  outside  the  bounds,  why,  if  you  write  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  reversing  here,  you  are  going  to  invite  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enormous  amount  of  second­guessing  of  State  law  contract

interpretation.  The  first  is  that  Section  10  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  expressly  contrasts  State  and  Federal  law;  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  it  says  the  law  of  your  State,  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguishes  Federal  law  from  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  is,  as  Justice  Ginsburg  says,  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  it  the  parties  even  referred  to  State  law  at  all  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  are  talking  about  is  just  "it  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid." 

            

The  third  is  both  before  this  contract  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  this  contract,  DIRECTV  wrote  this  contract  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently  in  the  way  that  it  now  says  this  contract 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means,  and  it  says  if  it  would  be  found  invalid,  and  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  mentioned  in  the  first  half  hour,  every  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fortune  500  company  wrote  it  that  way  as  well.  So  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  a  whole  series  of  very  good  contrasts  for  us. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  also  have  what  I  think  is  the  pushback  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  intuition  that  DIRECTV  really  must  have  always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended  for  the  contract  to  pick  up  Federal  preemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  And  here's  the  reason  why  that's  not  right: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DIRECTV  claims  and  has  applied  the  power  to  unilaterally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  this  contract,  and  that  is  a  huge  deal  in  the  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  context  of  a  national  form  contract. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here's  what  happened  here:  DIRECTV  put  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  contract  in  2006  before  AT&T  v.  Concepcion  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  glimmer  in  anyone's  eye  at  all.  And  it  referred  to

State  law,  and  everybody  agrees  at  that  time  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California's  Consumer  Legal  Remedies  Act  was  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control  and  was  going  to  prevent  any  arbitration  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  whatsoever.  DIRECTV  filed  an  amicus  brief  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Concepcion  saying  we  will  not  arbitrate  with  anyone  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  before  the  court's  decision  in  Concepcion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  way  that  DIRECTV  intended  to  account 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  changes  in  the  law  is  that  they  would  change  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  unilaterally  when  the  law  changed,  and  I  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove  it.  In  the  wake  of  Concepcion,  DIRECTV  rewrote 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  contract.  It  did  it  before  the  California  Court  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appeals'  decision  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

DIRECTV  had  another  mechanism  fully 

 

 

 

 

available  to  it  that  would  account  for  the  idea  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now,  under  the  Federal  Arbitration  Act,  the  State  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forbid  class  action  waivers.  It  didn't  need  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  to  do  anything  other  than  to  pick  up  existing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  law. 

 

            

And  I  will  add  a  couple  of  other  points  just 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

about  whether,  as  a  matter  of  Federal  law,  you  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  say  that  right  now  we  have  to  go  to  arbitration. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Remember,  DIRECTV's  position  is  in  the  teeth  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

efficiency  of  the  Federal  Arbitration  Act.  Its  view  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  parties  intended  that  three  years  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation,  what  they  would  want  is  to  blow  up  the

litigation  and  send  everybody  to  thousands  of  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrations.  That  is  an  extremely  implausible 

  

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  what  the  parties  would  want  if  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goal  was  to  have  an  efficient  dispute  resolution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism. 

            

And  so  what  I'm  ­­ the  point  that  I'm  trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make,  Your  Honors,  is  while  I  am  sympathetic  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern,  and  it  may  be  a  concern  directed  at  California 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  particular,  that  we  need  to  be  attentive  to  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not  those  courts  are  discriminating  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration.  My  point  to  you  is  that  you  may  believe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  wrong,  like  you  were  concerned  in  Oxford  Health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  arbitrator  had  got  it  wrong,  but  you  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopt  a  legal  rule  here.  And  there  are  too  many  points 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  favor  of  the  California  Court  of  Appeals'  decision  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  this  is  wildly  out  of  bounds  and  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrable  legal  rule  that  the  lower  courts  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  apply.  You  can  say  it's  way  out  of  bounds;  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  say  it's  nonsensical.  But  then  the  lower  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  going  to  look  at  what  happened  here,  and  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  going  to  view  it  as  something  that  is  just  wildly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  guess  I  don't 

    

   

 

 

understand  why  it's  a  question  of  way  out  of  bounds  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

slightly  out  of  bounds.  It's  a  question  of  whether  it

demonstrates  hostility  to  arbitration.  And  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

way  you  show  that  is  you  say,  well,  look,  here  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  a  number  of  provisions  illegal,  and  they  struck 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  whole  thing.  Here,  every  other  case  that's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  arbitration,  when  they  find  a  couple  of  provisions 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal,  they  just  sever  those;  they  keep  ­­ you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  keep  in  effect  the  rest  of  the  agreement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  a  different  rule  for  arbitration 

   

 

 

 

contracts  than  other  contracts.  It's  not  a  question  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

way  out  of  bounds  or  way  in  bounds.  It  may  be  a  hard 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  in  some  cases;  it  may  be  easy  in  others.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  very  simple  question  of  ­­ of  what  the  rule  is. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  rule  is  does  it  demonstrate  hostility  to  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts? 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

  

 

 

 

let  me  just  distinguish  this  case  from  the  one  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

granted  in  the  Long  Conference,  which  is  the  factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scenario  that  you  just  described.  In  that  context,  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  is  an  arbitration  agreement.  You  know  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  have  agreed  to  arbitrate  and  what  you  then  do  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume  that  they  intend  the  arbitration  to  be  effective. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  is  importantly,  doctrinally  a  very  different  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That's  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

understand  the  point  and  ­­ but,  as  I  understand  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  law,  if  you  have  an  arbitration  agreement,

says  you're  going  to  arbitrate  workplace  disputes,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  safety  disputes  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ and  if  there's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue,  is  this  a  safety  dispute  or  not,  that's  covered 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  arbitration  agreement.  The  arbitrator  decides 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

If  you  have  a  contract  that  says  you  agree 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  arbitrate  with  all  of  our  subsidiaries  except  the  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  does  this,  that's  not  for  the  arbitrator  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  decide  if  that  other  subsidiary  has  agreed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not. 

 

            

Now,  this  one  talks  about  methods  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration.  It  doesn't  seem  to  me  to  be  covered  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  of  those  two  paradigms. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Excellent.  So  you've  just 

  

  

 

 

 

described  Prima  Paint  and  the  assignment  between  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  and  the  arbitrator.  Here  is  why  it  is  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paradigm  of  not  favoring  ­­ not  presuming  arbitration, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  is,  the  effect  of  this  contract,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  effect  of  Section  9  is  not  to  determine  ­­ this  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor's  question  about  whether  there'd  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  arbitration  in  California,  but  just  not  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration.  The  effect  of  this  provision  is  to  mean 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  will  be  no  arbitration  between  DIRECTV  and

asks  is,  is  there  an  agreement  with  ­­ to  resolve  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputes  by  arbitration?  And  what  Section  9  tells  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  States  where  it  is  effective,  where  the  ­­ what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  call  the  blowup  clause  takes  effect,  is  that  in  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  States,  DIRECTV  will  not  arbitrate  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals,  it  will  not  arbitrate  with  respect  to  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration. 

            

If  I  could  just  give  you  the  reasons  we  know 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  true.  DIRECTV  filed  an  amicus  brief  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Concepcion  saying  we  do  not  arbitrate  with  anybody  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California.  It  then  ­­ and  you  can  see  this  in  the

Stevens  declaration  in  opposition  to  the  motion  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compel  arbitration  said  we  have  gotten  215  small  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requests  related  to  these  early  termination  fees,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ and  in  court,  which  is  the  subject  matter  of  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint.  And  we  have  arbitrated  with  one  party. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

So  what  was  going  on  ­­ and  so  there  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California,  DIRECTV  was  arbitrating  with  no  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatsoever  because  of  this  contractual  provision.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  brings  it  not  within  the  Volt  principle,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  We  interpret  ­­ when  we  have  an  arbitration 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement,  we're  going  to  put  things  into  the  bucket, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  argument  ­­ your  ­­ your  point,  Your  Honor,  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope  when  it  comes  to  safety  disputes.  But  rather, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  Granite  Rock,  which  said  quite  expressly,  what  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  ­­ when  we  are  talking  about  the  antecedent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  we're  trying  to  figure  out  if  you  and  I  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreed  to  arbitrate  any  subjects  whatsoever.  When  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  circumstance,  we  can't  presume  that  we  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrating,  because  the  first  principle  of  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Arbitration  Act  is  to  not  force  people  to  arbitrate  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  haven't  intended,  and  to  require  people  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrate  when  they  have. 

 

 

 

            

So,  Justice  Kennedy,  the  distinction  I  was 

   

 

 

 

 

drawing  with  Justice  Alito  is  if  we  had  an  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  and  we  were  trying  to  figure  out  if,  say,

class  cases  were  in  and  individual  cases  were  out,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  make  a  little  bit  more  sense  to  say  we're  going  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presume  and  resolve  ambiguities  in  favor  of  putting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  cases  in. 

 

 

            

But  this  is  not  that  situation.  It  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  whether  we  are  going  to  arbitrate  with  anyone. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now,  that  is  not  to  say  that  Federal  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  may  be,  but  that's  quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  the  question  of  whether  there  was  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  agreement.  Certainly,  whether  there  was  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  in  the  first  place  is  quite  different  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  meaning  of  the  agreement  is.  And  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  decide  the  ­­ the  first  thing,  and  it's  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  arbitrator.  But  this  is  not  a  ­­ there  is  no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt  here  that  there  was  an  agreement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  I  ­­

    

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  There  is  no  doubt  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  an  agreement.  The  only  issue  was  a  matter  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  that  agreement,  whether  a  provision  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  agreement  blew  it  up. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Okay. 

  

 

Justice  Scalia,  what  I  am  saying  is  you  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ you  and  I  agree,  but  the  consequence  of  the  place 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  disagree  is  important;  that  is,  you  and  I  agree  that

subject  of  arbitration.  When  this  Court  has  said  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  will  construe  arbitration  agreements  and  their  scope 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  include  all  the  subject  matter,  that  is,  we  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construe  them  in  favor  of  arbitration,  it  has  been  doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  when  we  not  only  have  an  agreement  on  the  subject  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration,  but  we  have  an  agreement  to  arbitrate  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputes. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  may  have.  They  may 

  

  

 

 

 

 

have.  And  I  just  don't  want  ­­ I  want  to  give  you  one 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  issue. 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Because  it's  in  my  mind, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  I'd  like  you  to  respond  to  it,  if  you  wish.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  there's  some  pretty  good  arguments  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  interpretation,  consciously  or  unconsciously, 

 

 

 

 

is  flying  in  the  face  of  an  opinion  of  this  Court,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  disagreed  with.  That  was  an  opinion  that  ­­ that  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  particular  provision  of  California  law  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid.  I  dissented. 

    

            

All  right.  So  we  have,  on  the  one  hand,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risks  that  we'll  get  into,  too  many  State  law  cases,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  take  their  side.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk  that  they'll  run  around  our  decisions.  Now,  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  get  to  that  second  thing,  even  though  I  dissented,  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  an  extremely  important  thing  in  a  country

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Breyer,  there's  one 

  

 

 

 

 

threshold  point  that  needs  to  be  made,  and  that  is  five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  of  the  Court  in  Concepcion,  as  I  understand 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  opinions,  would  not  have  applied  Concepcion  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  circumstance.  They  would  not  extend  it  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatsoever,  because  the  four  members  of  the  Court  who  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  and  the  other  members  of  the  Court  who  agreed  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  not  extend  it  to  the  circumstance  in  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  have  agreed  by  contract. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  Justice  Thomas  explained  in  his  opinion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  case  that  the  opinion  there  ­­ that  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  opinion  depended  on  obstacle  preemption,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  argument  here  that  this  case  implicates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obstacle  preemption  because  it's  a  question  of  contract 

   

 

 

 

 

 

law.  So  at  the  threshold,  I  don't  think  Concepcion

would  apply  here  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  your  question  is  bigger.  And  that  is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look,  I'm  concerned  that  if  we,  as  the  Supreme  Court  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.  Supreme  Court  articulate  a  question  of  Federal  law, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  on  a  statute  that's  as  important  as  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Arbitration  Act,  particularly  on  a  statute  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ is  rooted  in  a  concern  about  hostility  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  courts,  we  have  to  show  people  that  we're  serious. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A  couple  of  things  about  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  is,  we  know  the  California  courts  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious  in  the  wake  of  ­­ excuse  me.  We  have  filed  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supplemental  brief.  The  California  Supreme  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

decided  a  case  called  Sanchez.  And  Sanchez  dealt  with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  contract  that  is  written  like  every  other  Fortune 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

500  contract  is.  And  it  talks  about  if  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  barring  class  action  waivers  would  be  deemed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid.  And  the  California  Supreme  Court  said  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlled  by  Concepcion.  That  is  an  enforceable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  agreement  right  there.  And  so  now  we  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dancing  on  the  head  of  the  pin  about  one  contract  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely  defunct,  and  the  question  of  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference  to  State  law,  when  contrasted  in  another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  of  the  contract  with  Federal  law,  is  so  far 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  bounds. 

 

 

              

I  think  that  what  you  have  to  do  is  compare

two  prospects,  Justice  Breyer.  One  is  the  concern.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  recognize  the  concern  that  if  you  write  in  an  opinion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  says,  nah,  we're  not  going  to  take  too  hard  a  look, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  State  courts  will  run  wild.  All  I  can  tell  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  there  really  isn't  evidence  of  that  happening  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all.  And  the  Court  has  doctrines  like  discrimination 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  arbitration  that  can  handle  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  is  a  reality.  We  know  for  a  fact 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  if  you  announce  an  opinion  that  says,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  State  law  ­­ because  we  know  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  law  is  here.  The  California  Court  of  Appeals 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  told  us.  This  interpretation  of  State  law  is  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too  bad  and  invalidated  my  arbitration  agreement,  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  a  question  of  Federal  law,  and  we  are  going  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relitigate  what  State  law  means.  That  is  a  boundless 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

rule  that  is  going  to  be  invoked  in  every  single 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  case.  And  so  you  just  have  to  choose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  those  two  prospects. 

 

 

 

            

One  is  you  know  what  will  happen.  You  will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  going  against  the  very  first  principle  of  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration  law,  which  is  that  we  look  to  State  law  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining  whether  an  arbitration  agreement  is  formed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  you  have  the  hypothetical  prospect.  And  what  I  can 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  to  Your  Honor  is  we  have  a  legislature  that  is  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  event  that  the  hypothetical  prospect  comes  to

pass.  We  have  doctrines  to  deal  with  this.  I  am  just 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terribly  worried  about  how  it  is  that  you  write  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  that  says  this  is  not  just  wrong,  it's  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  wrong,  and  explain  why  in  the  face  of  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  in  this  contract,  the  contrast  with  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts  that  I  have  given  you  are  out  there.  You  do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retain  the  possibility,  of  course,  of  not  deciding  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  at  all  in  the  wake  of  Sanchez,  why  it  is  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  to  have  an  opinion  about  this,  given  that  this  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  that  doesn't  exist  anymore,  and  the  California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  of  Appeals  has  resolved  it  is  a  question  that  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is,  you  know,  very  difficult  to  answer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  you  are  going  to  write  an  opinion  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case,  please  do  not  do  it  in  a  way  that  just  invites 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  upon  litigation  upon  litigation  because  you, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  in  Oxford  Health,  are  concerned  that  this  Court  got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  wrong,  just  like  you  were  concerned  that  the

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CHRISTOPHER  LANDAU 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor.  I'd 

  

  

 

 

 

 

like  to  make  three  very  quick  points.  First,  the  fact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  opposing  counsel,  my  friend,  started  with  Oxford 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Health  is  very  telling  because  Oxford  Health  was  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  case  about  the  scope  of  this  Court's  review  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  arbitrator's  decision.  Everyone  there  agreed  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  parties  had  delegated  the  question  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  the  clause  to  the  arbitrator.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  very  different  question.  We  don't  have  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

here.  We  are  ­­ in  this  case,  this  Court  is  reviewing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  a  court  did.  You're  not  reviewing  it  under  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguable  standard.  It's  a  very  different  standard. 

   

  

 

 

 

            

Second,  my  friend  said  that,  well,  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  that  special  rules  for  arbitration  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted  is  discriminatory.  And  again,  those  tend  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  easy  cases.  You're  not  probably  seeing  as  many  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  cases  anymore.  But  now  this  case  in  a  sense  shows 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  a  new  frontier,  when  a  court  will  just 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

basically  reach  the  same  goal  by  saying  black  means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

white.  Guess  what?  I  haven't  done  any  different  rule. 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  just  applying  State  court  principles  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation.  But  at  some  point,  you  can't  just  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  rule  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse  me.  Why  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

everybody  is  assuming  that  this  is  just  a  crazy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation,  but  if  you  start  with  the  proposition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  the  intent  of  the  parties,  and  everybody's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framing  this  as  invalid  State  law,  or  valid  State  law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  your  own  company  decided  before  Concepcion  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  okay,  they  would  litigate  everything,  they  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  the  words  as  they  stood. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Because  prior  to  Concepcion, 

  

 

 

 

 

State  law  was  valid.  The  question  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  it  wasn't.  If  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

was  preempted,  it  was  preempted  back  then. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

­­

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  Your  Honor,  but  it's  hard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  ­­ and  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

preempted  forever. 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  And  it  would  have  been  futile 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  that  argument.  In  fact,  we  would  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  punitive  damages.  I  mean,  we  were  just 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking  it  at  its  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Probably  could  have  done 

  

 

 

 

 

what  happened  here  and  bring  it  up  to  the  Supreme  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  again,  you  know,  hats  off 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  AT&T  for  doing  that,  but  there  are  futility  doctrines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  recognize  that  not  everybody  has  to  do  that.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  how  far  does  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

go?  When  do  we  make  this  judgment? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Again,  Your  Honor,  you  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

decide  this  case  on  the  ground,  as  the  Chamber  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commerce  urged  in  its  amicus  brief,  that  this  is  so  far 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  the  pale  as  an  interpretation,  that  it  can  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  explained  as  discrimination.  Again,  discrimination 

  

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ you  know,  it  is  an  existing  category  for  knocking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  out.  It's  not  the  exclusive  category.  And  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  discrimination  becomes  a  hard  principle  to  apply 

   

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  have  individual  contracts.  Somebody  can  always 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  well,  you  know,  my  ­­ you  know,  discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anticipates  you  have  two  things  that  are  similarly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situated.  So  how  can  you  say  you're  discriminating? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Again,  I  ­­

   

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  why  ­­ why  is  it  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  so  farfetched  ­­

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  It's  so  farfetched  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ to  place  the 

  

 

 

 

 

legitimacy  of  this  action  at  the  time  the  complaint  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed  as  opposed  to  three  years  later  or  the  day  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  trial  or  the  day  after  a  trial  before  judgment  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered? 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Because  the  parties  use  ­­

make  a  motion  at  any  of  those  times.  Why  does  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  the  contract  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  They  use  ­­

time  that  you  make  your  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Because  they  use  the  verb  tense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"would  find,"  Your  Honor.  They  didn't  say  State  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  now.  They  didn't  freeze  it  in  place.  There's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  ­­ and  they  have  no  way  of  saying  when  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  frozen  in  place.  Just  a  line  ­­ in  a  sense,  this  is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ultimate  gotcha  kind  of  case.  And  the  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  this  Court  is,  is  this  Court  going  to  basically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  a  stamp  of  approval  to  a  gotcha? 

   

   

 

 

 

            

The  last  point  I  want  to  make  is  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  ­­ my  friend  says  that  there's  a  question  here 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  whether  there  was  an  arbitration  agreement  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  place.  There  is  absolutely  no  question  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  an  arbitration  agreement.  The  California  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  Appeal  acknowledged  that  there  was  an  arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  and  construed  it  to  be  self­defeating, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construed  there  to  be  a  blowup  provision  that  destroyed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  parties  were  trying  to  accomplish. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank  you,  Your  Honors. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted.
