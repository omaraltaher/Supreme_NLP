 ORAL ARGUMENT OF A.J. KRAMER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4  first this morning in Case 11-8976, Smith v. United 
5
6

11
 From the first Congress in 1790, Congress 
12  has made the decision that all Federal statutes which 
13  are, of course, creatures created by Congress in 
14  statutes, should be subject to a statute of limitations; 
15
16  conspiracy cases, as this Court said in Hyde, the 
17  statute of limitations is treated a little differently 
18  because conspiracy statutes are -- conspiracy crimes are 
19  continuing offenses.
 So the Court said the way we determine --
20
21  one way to determine whether a particular defendant's 
22  involvement in a conspiracy has ended -- in other words, 
23  his membership has ended -- is by the doctrine of 
24  withdrawal.
25

in this particular case, five years.  When it comes to 

 It's the statute of limitations that is the

defense in the Cook case, in the Oppenheimer case --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It has to be raised by the 

 MR. KRAMER:  It does have to be raised 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but that -- is that an 

1  defense in the case.  It's the doctrine of withdrawal 
2  that triggers -- that is the triggering event for the 
3  statute of limitations, which sets the date for when the 
4  statute of limitations starts to run.  Withdrawal, in 
and of itself, is not a defense.  It's the statute of 
5
6  limitations that's the defense.

15
16  element, so it doesn't have to be charged in the 
17  indictment.  Now, how can something that goes to the 
18  existence or non-existence of an affirmative defense be 
19  an element?
 MR. KRAMER:  Well, I don't -- it is -- it is 
20
21  not an element, I agree with that; but it is -- I would 
22  say that it's engrafted onto every Federal criminal 
23  statute by statute.  This is not the common law, but by 
24  Congress' decision.  I would also say that even though 
25

it's not an element of defense -- of the offense, in 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which means it's not an

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- but you could 

1  Winship, this Court referred to the fact that the 
2  government must prove every fact necessary to prove a 
3  crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  It's a fact 
4  necessary --
5
6  prove the crime without a reasonable -- beyond a 
7  reasonable doubt, if you never raised the statute of 
8  limitations.  And statutes of limitations exist for 
9  civil claims, as well as criminal claims.
 And in -- on the civil side, the statute of 
10
11  limitations is an affirmative defense.  And it's up to 
12  the plaintiff to plead and prove -- both plead and prove 
13  it, both the burden of production and persuasion.  Why 
14  should it be different on the criminal side?
15
16  of all, obviously, the burden of proof is different in 
17  criminal cases as the court said in Mullaney v. Wilbur. 
18  It has been suggested that, because of the difficulties 
19  in negating an argument that a homicide was committed in 
the heat of passion, the burden of proof should rest on 
20
21  the defendant. 
 And they said the same may be said of the 
22
23  requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of many 
24  controverted facts, but this is the traditional burden 
25

which our criminal justice system applies.  I also think 

 MR. KRAMER:  I think several reasons.  First

 In fact, in the number of cases, this Court 

 In fact, the Quick case said it's part of 
the merits of the case; although it doesn't have to be 

1  that the Court has distinguished on some grounds and is 
2  the civil statute of limitations from the criminal 
3  statute. 
4
has talked about the criminal statute of limitations. 
5
6  It has never referred to it as an affirmative defense. 
7  It has said it's a defense, but it has never said that 
8  the defendant is required to prove it. 
9
10
11  pleaded in the indictment, and the -- that it has to 
12  be -- the government has to present evidence of it and 
13  proof of it. 
14
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- I think you --
you recognized that -- that the defendant has the burden 
15
16  of production, not the government, the burden -- burden 
17  of coming forward with this defense and producing some 
18  evidence of the withdrawal. 
19
20
21  several other things that are not affirmative defenses, 
22  like entrapment or alibi, also have a burden of 
23  production before the government has to prove the 
24  elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  So 
25

 MR. KRAMER:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do 
accept that there is a burden of production, as with 

it's not --

member of the conspiracy.  The government has the burden 
to show membership, and it did.  So it's not -- it 
doesn't reach back to negate that there was membership 
at some time.  It just says, after withdrawal, we no 
longer prosecute.

 MR. KRAMER:  That's true.  What it does is 
15
16  extinguish liability for that offense past that time if 
17  the statute of limitations has -- if withdrawal occurs 
18  before the statute of limitations, someone can no 
19  longer, as the statute says, "be prosecuted, tried, or

4
5
6  obviously, the conspiracy itself, which is an agreement 
7  between -- it can be anyone.  And then they have to 
8  prove the defendant's membership in that conspiracy.

for as long as you stay, until you prove you withdrew?

 MR. KRAMER:  I would say until you produce 

evidence that you withdrew, yes.  And then the

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. KRAMER:  It -- I think, Justice 

1
2  joined, you're trying to extinguish liability.  Why 
3  would the government have to prove that you're entitled 
4  to amnesty or not entitled to amnesty?
5
6  Sotomayor, that it's really no different than if the 
7  government has to prove you guilty of a crime in the 
8  first place.  They have to prove that you committed the 
9  offense.  The statute of limitations, which is, as I 
said, engrafted on every Federal criminal statute --
10
11 
almost every statute --
12
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, your argument 
13  basically reduces to the fact that, when it comes to the 
14  statute of limitations, you treat the conspirators as 
individuals, rather than as members of the conspiracy. 
15
16
17
18  not true with respect to other aspects of the 
19  conspiracy.  If members of the conspiracy commit a 
20
21  that has nothing to do with that, other than being a 
22  part of the conspiracy, is liable -- criminally liable 
23  for that as well.  Why is there a special rule for 
24  statutes of limitations?  Well, why is he treated as an 
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, well, that's 

murder, and it was anticipated and all that, the person

 MR. KRAMER:  Well, he would be treated 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, my point is 

activities of the conspiracy, is still responsible for 
them.  So it makes sense to say you can prove the 
statute of limitations with respect to the conspiracy, 
not with respect to each individual. 

1  that respect? 
2
3  for -- for the withdrawal purpose.  If he withdrew, he 
4  would also not be liable under Pinkerton.  There is a 
membership element component of Pinkerton as well, for 
5
6  Pinkerton liability. 
7
8  that, once you prove the conspiracy, a member who 
9  doesn't -- that doesn't actually participate in the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  government -- if the defense -- if the claim of 
17  termination is raised, the government has to prove that 
18  the conspiracy continued into the limitations period and 
19  that there was an overt act -- that was an overt act.
20
21  indicates, it seems to me, is that if we accept your 
22  view, then there is going to be a different statute of 
23  limitations for each member of the conspiracy.  And so 
24  you have four or five different statute of limitations. 
25

 MR. KRAMER:  Well, I think, actually, it's 
just the opposite.  If -- under -- under Grunewald, the 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what the Chief Justice 

I find that -- I find that puzzling. 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 So there were already, in this case, 

 MR. KRAMER:  Well, actually, in this case, 
1
2  there was different statutes of -- I believe there were 
3  three different statute of limitations that the district 
4  court instructed the jury about because there were 
superseding indictments and people were indicted at 
5
6  different times. 
7
8  different statute of limitations.  But if one of the 
9  reasons for withdrawal is to encourage people to get out 
of the agreement, Justice Kennedy, then -- and try to --
10
11 
try to thwart the agreement, then people may have -- may 
come in and leave at different times during a 
12 
13 
conspiracy. 
14
15
16  statute of limitations.  And what occurred to me, just 
17  as an example, that you might have in your practice 
18  found a different one, the Thomas Crown Affair.  Say 
19  that he robs the bank or the art museum, but he has an 
intent to return it, and he produces evidence that he 
20
21  had an intent to return. 
 Now, in such a case, once he produces the 
22
23  evidence, does the government have to prove beyond a 
24  reasonable doubt that he didn't have an intent to 
25

return?  Or does he -- is there any instance in which 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What is -- is there any --

I'm trying to find an analogous instance without the

1  the burden of persuasion shifts?  Do you see what I'm 
2  driving at? 
 MR. KRAMER:  I do, and I think that there --
3
4  that an argument can be made if the intent -- if one of 
the elements of that offense is to deprive the owner 
5
6  permanently of the property and he did not have that 
7  intent, the government would have to prove what it would 
8  have to prove originally, which is that he intended to 
9  deprive the -- the owner --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  remains on the defendant? 
19
20
21
22
23  think of some instance -- as I said, I would be 
24  repeating myself -- I'm looking for any instance in 
25

case -- I will ask the government this -- in the 
substantive criminal law, no matter what, who is -- even 
if the defendant is the only one ever likely to know 
anything about it, you've never found a case where, once 
the burden's produced, the -- the burden of persuasion 
remains on the defendant? 

 MR. KRAMER:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And so I was trying to 

which, leaving the statute of limitations out of it, the 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So you have never found a

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Have you heard of it?  So 

not negate the elements of the offense, it was an 
affirmative defense that excused --

1  burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant.  So I'm 
2  saying, did you ever find one?  The Thomas Crown Affair 
3  or some other instance, and your answer is, no, you 
4  never have heard of it.
5
6
7  what? 
 MR. KRAMER:  Self defense and duress, as the 
8
9  Court said in Dixon, dealing with duress, because it did 
10
11 
12
13  does not negate the elements of the defense -- this does 
14  not negate the elements of the crime.
15
16  elements of the crime, I would say then this Court has 
17  classified it as an affirmative defense. 
18
19  that's so, if it's an affirmative defense and if 
20
21  crime the burden of persuasion remains on the defendant, 
22  then why shouldn't it here?  Because he's the one most 
23  likely to know.

4  nothing more than what they would have to prove

13  done originally.  The -- the burden of production on the 
14  withdrawal, the government could just say to the jury 
15
16  We've proved that he was a member.  There is a 
17  permissive inference that he's still a member within the 
18  limitations period.  They would not have to prove it 
19  twice.  They could rest on what they had done

13
14  it's very difficult to put the burden on the government, 
15
16  I'm out of this business, I'm not going to do it 
17  anymore.  And so the government, if they had the burden 
18  of proof, would say, well, I don't think that's true, I 
19  want to call the person you -- you talked to.

doing that, satisfies its burden of production. 

1  withdrew is to produce evidence of withdrawal.  That is 
2  inconsistent with the fact that he is a member --
3  necessarily negates the element of membership in the 
4  conspiracy.  If he withdrew, he cannot, at the same

 Now, you say the government has the burden 
13  to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, not only that this 
14  conversation didn't occur, but also, that the defendant 
never withdrew at any other time during the limitations 
15
16  period.  Isn't that where your argument would lead? 
17
18  disprove the conversation.  All they have to prove is 
19  what they had to prove originally, which is that the 
defendant was a member of the conspiracy within the 
20

11  argue that the government has to prove, beyond a 
12  reasonable doubt, active participation in the conspiracy 
13  during the statute of limitations period, rather than 
14  the -- the affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy.
15
16  active participation, if that means an overt act.  It 
17  can just be -- the government could simply rest upon the 
18  inference from Hyde that the defendant had been a member 
19  outside the limitations period and their continued

court give the withdrawal instruction after the jury's 
note. 

1  affirmative actions?  I mean, the law is that he has to 
2  take an affirmative action withdrawing from the 
3  conspiracy.  I don't think being in jail is -- is an 
4  affirmative action.  I don't think being mad at the 
5

14  how is that carrying the burden that you say is on it to

 JUSTICE BREYER:  This is true, but his 
point -- basic point -- and he has responded to the 

 As the Court has suggested, first, the 
government has to allege in the indictment in every 

raise it. 

 But none of those things apply as to a 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Correct. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So he's saying 

1  points I've made, is that, of course, if there's a 
2  five-year statute on robbery, it doesn't help the 
3  government that he create -- he committed a robbery 
4  before.
5
6
7  what you charged in the indictment is that he was a 
8  member of a conspiracy that existed between 1995 and 
9  2005.  Now, that's the crime that concerns us, roughly. 
And he is saying, to prove your case, you have to show, 
10
11 
as an element, that he was a member. 
12
 Now, you did present some evidence that he 
13  was a member.  And he wants to present some evidence, 
14  and has, that he wasn't a member.  And he wasn't a 
member if he withdrew.  And therefore, once he presents 
15
16  enough to get -- make that an issue, you have to prove 
17  beyond a reasonable doubt that he was a member.  So you 
18  have to show he didn't withdraw. 
 Now, this has nothing to do with the statute 
19
of limitations.  By coincidence, it does.  But a statute 
20
21  of limitations issue would be that you all agree that he 
22  withdrew, but the question is did it happen in 1993 or 
23  1997?  That's a statute of limitations issue, but this 
24  isn't.
25

 This is a question of whether he was a 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

this particular member of the conspiracy --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, in other words, you 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  So I guess I have two 

responses.  The first is that it is a statute of 

1  member of the conspiracy during the time period that you 
2  charged in the indictment.  That's his point.  So what 
3  is the response? 
4
5
6  limitations question, in the sense that the government 
7  proved -- and there is no dispute about this -- that the 
8  conspiracy that was charged did exist within the 
9  limitations period.  And so the question is just did 
10
11
12  can charge me or anybody in the audience or anybody here 
13  with what?  Not charging them?  You are saying there was 
14  a conspiracy?  Doesn't he have to be shown to be a 
member of the conspiracy in order for you to get a 
15
16  conviction? 
17
18
19  the crime?
20
21  Petitioner talks about the membership or participation 
22  element, what he is really talking about is the 
23  agreement element.  The government has to prove that 
24  each defendant who is charged with a conspiracy 
25

 MS. HARRINGTON:  He does, and there's no --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's an element of 

intentionally agreed to join the conspiracy.  And there 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  And an -- but when 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, you can use that in order to prove that 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There is no more relevance, 

1  is no dispute that the government proved that with 
2  respect to Petitioner in this case --
3
4  is there, to the fact that there happened to be a 
pre-1995 conspiracy, except as a matter of proof -- I 
5
6  shouldn't say relevance -- that he happened to rob a 
7  bank before 1995?  I mean, in each instance, there was 
8  criminal activity before 1995. 
9
he was a member during '95 to 2000.  That, I see.  But 
10
11  he, similar, can use the matter of withdrawal to prove 
12  he wasn't a member during 1995 to 2000.  And, therefore, 
13  it goes to show whether you or the government have 
14  proved an element of the offense, namely, that he was a 
15
16
17  agreement, right?  So we prove that he agreed to join 
18  the conspiracy, and we proved that each defendant agreed 
19  to join the conspiracy.  We don't have to prove that 
that agreement happened in the limitations period, as 
20
21  long as we prove that the conspiracy continues to --
22
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So how do we tell that, 
23  Ms. Harrington?  Because it seems to me that the crux of 
24  the difference between you and your friend is that you 
say the element is membership in the conspiracy at some 
25

member between '95 and 2000. 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  But, again, the element is 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

right, another set of things follow. 

 So how do we determine that the -- you know, 

at a particular time? 

1  point, it doesn't matter whether it's in the limitations 
2  period.  And he says the element is membership in a 
3  conspiracy in the limitations period.  And if he's 
4  right, a set of things follow from that; and if you are 
5
6
7  that the statute of limitations -- that the timing 
8  question is not baked into the elements question, that 
9  it's just membership sometime, as opposed to membership 
10
11
 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, we know it's not an 
12  element for the reasons I explained because it doesn't 
13  have to be charged in the indictment, it doesn't have to 
14  be proved in every case, the defendant can waive it.  So 
it's not an element in the constitutional sense, for all 
15
16  of those reasons. 
17
18  conspiracy context, it's not an element because this 
19  Court's decision in Hyde from 1912.  In that case, the 
defendant, Mr. Schneider, who had raised the statute of 
20
21  limitations defense, had not done anything to 
22  participate in the charged conspiracy within what was 
23  then a three-year statute of limitations period. 
24
25

the court said he didn't do anything.  The court said, 

 The jury was charged, he didn't do anything, 

 We can also tell that, in the specific

5
6  as the government has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, 
7  that -- that the defendant joined the crime at some

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I am looking at it 

1  once the government has proved that he willingly joined 
2  the conspiracy, which it did in this case, then the law 
3  presumes that every person who has willingly joined the 
4  conspiracy remains a member of an ongoing conspiracy, 
5
6  withdraw from the conspiracy. 
7
8  as a puzzle here because I think you could look at it 
9  either way.  I mean, if a person commits a burglary and 
the indictment charges that, and he says, yes, I did, I 
10
11 
did, there is no doubt about all the elements being 
satisfied, but it happened outside the limitation 
12 
13 
period.  That's in the statute of limitations area. 
 But where you charge a conspiracy taking 
14
place within a period of time, as I would think you 
15
16  usually would -- I would think the -- those words on the 
17  paper almost always have a date in them -- then you 
18  could look at it as a question of membership in that 
19  conspiracy, the one that's charged, in which case, it's 
20
21
 And then, if you're in doubt as to whether 
22  or not the time that he withdrew was inside or outside 
23  the period, that becomes a limitations question. 
24
25

 MS. HARRINGTON:  But it can't --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, that isn't true.  You 

it or disprove it, depending on how you look at it. 

1  of -- I'm torn here.  I actually can see it either way. 
2
 MS. HARRINGTON:  I mean, I think it can't be 
3  an element of the crime because, if the defendant 
4  doesn't raise it, the government doesn't have to prove 
5
6  So --
7
8  have to prove membership. 
9
10
11
12  instance, that you bring in a prima facie case.  I'd be 
13  repeating myself.  And that he says withdrawal, and 
14  withdrawal is designed to negate membership.
15
16  negate membership because, again, membership is really 
17  just the agreement.  And, in fact, a withdrawal defense 
18  tends to confirm that a particular defendant agreed to 
19  join a conspiracy because there is nothing to withdraw 
20
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But then the withdrawal 
22  prior to the time charged negates membership in the 
23  conspiracy that you have charged because there was no 
24  membership during that time.

3  to bring you back to the Hyde --
4
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, in a normal 
case, where it's a robbery or burglary, whatever, you 
5
6  charge the crime happened in X date, and the defendant 
7  raises an affirmative defense that it's not within the 
8  statute of limitations.  Who bears the burden of proving 
9  it does, in that situation?
10
11  Grunewald, that the government bears the burden.

13  bear the burden in the normal statute of limitations 
14  case, the issue, I think, in my mind, becomes do you 
continue to bear that burden in a conspiracy crime? 
15
16
 MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes. 
17
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because -- and you still 
18  have to prove -- you're saying that the elements of the 
19  statute of limitation there are that there was an 
20
21  any time during the conspiracy, and the conspiracy 
22  continues.

7  that, again, is clear from this Court's decision in 
8  Hyde, where, in that case, the defendant raising the 
9  limitations defense had not done anything related to the 
10
11
12  argument is, I can't be responsible for a crime I wasn't 
13  a part of during the limitations period.  That really is 
14  the essence of his argument.  And if it's your job to

 MS. HARRINGTON:  It's very long.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it -- it's described in 
15
16  the Court of Appeals opinion as follows:  "According to 
17  the indictment in the district court and the evidence of 
18  the United States at trial, during the late 1980s and 
19  1990s, appellants Rodney Moore, Kevin Gray, John Raynor, 
Calvin Smith, Timothy Handy, and Lionel Nunn, along with

13  absence of particular dates in the indictment, but

2
3  membership, then there may be a problem for you here. 
4  But if the other view is correct, that you are liable 
for setting this thing in motion, whether or not you 
5
6  continue to do anything active in support of it during 
7  the limitations period, then you are correct. 
 Now, which is the -- which is the 
8
9  established view of the crime of conspiracy?
 MS. HARRINGTON:  The view established by 
10
11  this Court is that the crime of conspiracy continues, 
12  and once a person joins the conspiracy, he or she is 
13  liable for all the acts of his co-conspirators that were 
14  reasonably foreseeable in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
And that's true, even if that person, once he joins the 
15
16  conspiracy, doesn't ever do anything else --
17
18  you recognize, as I think Justice Alito's question 
19  doesn't, that there is -- there is a withdrawal defense 
20
21  burden? 
22
23  withdrawal defense.  Indeed, the judge gave a charge to 
24  the jury on -- so the contest, as I understand it, the 
difference between the two of you is you say, defendant 
25

and the question is how do you allocate the proof 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but you recognize --

 So your case accepts that there is a 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  That's right.  And the 

1  can say, I withdrew.  If he does that, he has to prove 
2  it.  And the defendant is saying, I have to produce 
3  enough, so that a jury could find I withdrew, but you 
4  have the ultimate burden of persuasion.
5
6  Petitioners' view is grounded in due process concerns. 
7  Our view is that it is not a matter of due process 
8  because lack of withdrawal is not an element of the 
9  crime of conspiracy.
 So once you take due process out of the 
10
11  equation, then you have to ask what -- where would 
12  Congress have understood the burden -- the allocation of 
13  burdens to be, when it enacted these conspiracy statutes 
14  in 1970?
 And as a matter of logic, as a matter of 
15
16  history, as a matter of policy, there is no reason to 
17  think Congress would have thought the burden of 
18  persuasion to be anywhere other than on the defendant. 
19
20
21  objects, not to its membership.  If there's five people 
22  that conspired to rob a bank and one of the conspirators 
23  has said, I'm out of here, I withdraw from the 
24  conspiracy, metaphysically, you might argue, well, it's

 MS. HARRINGTON:  That's right.  And, again, 
8
9  there's no dispute in this case that the conspiracy was 
10
11
12  you've indicted -- you haven't indicted a conspiracy. 
13  You've indicted an individual, and it's not clear to me 
14  why you don't have to show that that was -- that that

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Because once --

2  evidence goes to whether -- you know, he had joined the 
3  conspiracy and whether he proved withdrawal. 
4
5
6  The conclusion that timing -- the timing is not an 
7  element.  Now, take Justice Sotomayor's example of 
8  something which is not a conspiracy at all, let's say 
9  somebody commits a robbery, and you have to show that 
the person has committed a robbery and if the person 
10
11  brings up the question of timing, you also have the 
12  burden of persuasion on that.  But would the timing be 
13  an element in that case or not? 
 MS. HARRINGTON:  Not.
14
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And so you are essentially 
15
16  saying that this case should be treated just as every 
17  other case.  You happen to have the burden of persuasion 
18  if somebody says the statute of limitations has been 
19  violated, but the question of when conduct occurred is 
20
21
 MS. HARRINGTON:  It's never an element.  It

7  is an -- it is a burden that is placed on the government 
8  by Congress in Section 3282.  I think -- I think a 
9  reason one could think that it makes sense is that the 
government already has to prove all the things that it

21  there are sort of four big reasons why Congress wouldn't

23  reasons -- wouldn't have understood the burden to be on

prove when the crime actually happened.  And so it 

 The first is that the defendant will almost

1  always be in a better position to have the information 
2  about whether he withdrew, except in cases where he 
3  withdraws by making a clean rest with the government, in 
4  which case, it's hard to imagine he's going to be 
indicted for -- for the indictment past that period,
 
5
6  except in those cases, he will know what he said in
 
7  secret to his co-conspirators.
 
 Second, the government will often be
 
8
9  prevented from bringing up evidence to rebut an
 
assertion of withdrawal because it can't make a 
10
11 
defendant testify, and it often won't be able to make 
12 
his co-conspirators testify. 
13
 Third, a defendant doesn't have to give any 
14  advanced notice of his intention to rely on a withdrawal 
defense, and so often, he can scuttle the defendant's --
15
16  the government's ability to procure any other evidence 
17  it may be able to procure relevant to the issue of -- of 
18  withdrawal. 
19
encourage spurious assertions of withdrawal because it 
20
21  has -- it could have the effect of essentially making 
22  the government prove something extra.  It already has to 
23  prove that he joined the conspiracy willingly, that the 
24  conspiracy existed in the limitations period.

2  also have to prove that the defendant essentially took 
3  some other act to show his membership or somehow 
4  re-agreed to the conspiracy --
5
6  point seems to me spurious itself because, to prove 
7  withdrawal, he's got to accept the fact that he was in

inaction with respect to the conspiracy, which this

17  would be an incentive to raise a spurious assertion of 
18  withdrawal because it would require the government to

1
2  there's a good deal of risk in that for a defendant. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but, I mean, 
3
4  that works in a civil case.  But, I mean, in a criminal 
case, it's kind of a big thing to say -- begin my -- my 
5
6  first argument is that, I withdrew from this horrendous 
7  conspiracy that's been going on.

13
14  of defense in this case was, in fact, that there were 
15
16  person had withdrawn, and it only came up, as my friend 
17  pointed out, because the jury asked a question about it. 
 If I can just sort of wrap up on a -- on a 
18
19  broader note?  A defendant does not become liable for a 
criminal conspiracy casually.  As the jury was charged 
20
21  in this case, the government has to prove that every 
22  defendant was aware of the existence of the conspiracy, 
23  that every defendant understood that it had an illegal 
24  objective, and that every defendant willingly agreed to 
25

participate in the conspiracy with the aim -- aim of 

many separate conspiracies, not that any particular

7  objective, the objective of the conspiracy.  Now, that's 
8  a high evidentiary --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which is what your 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.  But that is -- this 

1
2  friend is trying to argue for in this case? 
3
4  is high evidentiary burden that the government has to 
bear to prove that each defendant took some affirmative 
5
6  action to get into the conspiracy.  And once the -- once 
7  the government proves that a defendant was a member of 
8  the conspiracy, then it's on the defendant to prove --
9  to take some affirmative action to get himself out of 
10
11
 And it only makes sense to require him to 
12  prove that he took that act, instead of requiring the 
13  government to prove negative that he didn't take that 
14  act in every case.
15
16
17  allocation, is this a more hypothetical academic 
18  question?  I mean, you pointed out that you had ample 
19  evidence to show that he remained a member of the 
20
21
22  persuasion to the defendant versus proof of production 
23  to the defendant, persuasion to the government, does it 
24  really make much difference?  Does it have much

 But it certainly can come up, and -- you

2  made a difference in this case, for the reasons you 
3  suggest, we had good evidence that he had active 
4  participation within the limitations period.  It can 
make a difference in some other cases -- you know, I 
5
6  think, as a practical matter, most criminal conspiracies 
7  that are charged in the Federal system involve activity 
8  that was more recent than some of the activity that was 
9  involved in this case.
10
11  know, if we didn't have the type of evidence that we did 
12  about this particular defendant's behavior in prison, 
13  then it would have been hard to rebut his assertion of 
14  withdrawal caused by his incarceration.  So it 
15
16
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, when you say 
17  it wouldn't have made a difference in this case, you're 
18  basically saying you had some good evidence.  But a jury 
19  could have always decided against you, right?

22  whole thing, but --

 MR. KRAMER:  Thank you. 
11
12
 I would just like to start with one quick 
13  point.  My friend said that the government would never 
14  rest on its laurels, but that's precisely what they did 
15
16  when they said, go ahead and instruct the jury on 
17  withdrawal, so they rested on the evidence that had been 
18  presented in the trial.  So that's precisely what they 
19  did.
20
21  thought that you had the burden.  And it -- it does 
22  strike me that, if you are right that this is an 
23  element -- membership in the conspiracy at a particular 
24  time -- and the government has the burden, this idea 
25

that the government could -- you know, just sort of say, 

in this case.  It was 12 days into jury deliberation

1  well, we don't have any evidence, but we think you

3  government couldn't do that if you are right. 
4
just rest on whatever they had presented originally and 
5
6  tell the jury that's plenty to prove beyond -- to meet 
7  our burden of proof. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if you make an 
8
9  assertion, and they don't really respond to the

11
 MR. KRAMER:  It -- I mean, it happens all 
12  the time.  The defendants say, I didn't do it, and the 
13  government presents their evidence and say, that defense 
14  is nonsense, we presented overwhelming evidence.

17  was our burden.  They agreed, in the end, that the jury 
18  should be instructed --

20
21  prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, active participation 
22  in the conspiracy during the statute of limitations 
23  period because it is impossible for the prosecution to 
24  prove beyond a reasonable doubt that on no day, during a

8  done by the inference that they were a member outside

18  are required to prove, which is membership within the 
19  limitations period.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought you argue that

22  proved beyond a reasonable doubt because the prosecution 
23  hasn't provided sufficient evidence?

2  And that happens every day, needless to say, that people 
3  are convicted by that argument when --
4
5
6  there is membership in the conspiracy during the 
7  limitations period, they couldn't just come in and say, 
8  well, there's membership in the conspiracy before the 
9  limitations period, and, you know, you should assume 
10
11
12  beyond-a-reasonable-doubt kind of proof, is it? 
13
 MR. KRAMER:  They get a permissive 
14  inference.  And there are many cases when I think that

17  defendant, more than just a proffer. 
18

withdraw during this five-year period?  They have the 
20
21  burden of proving that.  And did you hear any evidence 
22  from them that -- did you hear evidence disproving 
23  that -- that he didn't withdraw during that period? 
24  There is no evidence on that.
