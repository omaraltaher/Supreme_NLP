CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 12-418, United States v. 
Kebodeaux. 

Mr. Dreeben. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Convicted sex offenders pose a serious 

threat to public safety.  When those convictions are 
entered under Federal law, Congress has the authority to 
impose both a criminal and a civil sanction for that 
conduct in order to protect the public. 

The Fifth Circuit in this case applied a per 
se rule that once Respondent had completed his military 
sentence, Congress lost authority to apply a civil 
sanction for that violation of Federal law. 

That per se rule is wrong. 
Nothing in Article I prevents Congress from 
legislating retroactively with respect to civil remedies 
for past violations of Federal law.  The Ex Post Facto 
Clause, the Due Process Clause, and Article I analysis 
under the Necessary and Proper Clause all provide some

degree of protection against retroactive provisions, but 
no per se rule bars Congress from applying sex offender 
registration requirements, which this Court has held to 
be civil remedies not barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause 
to past Federal criminal convictions. 

Now --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the limit of that 
power?  How -- for any Federal conviction, whether it's 
related to sex offense or anything else, Congress could 
impose any kind of registration requirement? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, certainly, Justice 

Sotomayor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could it ask every 
convicted Federal felon to come in for a DNA test 
because we know that people who have been convicted of a 
crime are more likely to be recidivists? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, there 

are independent constitutional limits both outside of 
Article I and within Article I that mean that I will 
answer your question no, it's not the case that my 
position today means there are no limits.  There are 
limits.  If we --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what -- what is the 
limit?  Is it just safety?  It can't be just safety of 
the public because you just said that it doesn't apply

to recidivist Federal offenders, generally. 

MR. DREEBEN:  The -- the principal 

Page 5 

limitation on retroactive legislation is the Ex Post 
Facto Clause.  Indeed, there would have been no need for 
an Ex Post Facto Clause if the Fifth Circuit were 
correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't understand.  I 
just posited a civil registration for Federal offenders 
of any kind.  That's not ex post facto under your 
theory, so --

MR. DREEBEN:  So if -- if the Court agrees 
that it's not a punitive measure and it is a remedial 
measure --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I don't know if I 

agree with that, but accept -- accepting that 
hypothetical. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, if you don't agree with 

it, then you'll be going on the Ex Post Facto Clause, 
and you won't be getting to Article I. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, you know, that's 

settled law.  Whether it's right or wrong is a different 
issue. 

MR. DREEBEN:  It is settled law, and that 
means that sex offender registration provisions aren't 
punitive.  The question here is, are they within

Article I.  And the Court in United States v. Comstock 
went through an elaborate Necessary and Proper Clause 
analysis --

Page 6 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, in Comstock, 
it was very different than the situation here because 
the analysis was that the Federal government basically 
was the source of the problem in incarcerating sex 
offenders away from the State so that no State felt an 
obligation to do something with the problem of their 
release. 

You don't have anything of that sort here. 
MR. DREEBEN:  No.  This provision, Mr. Chief 

Justice, rests on a different analysis than Comstock. 
In Comstock, the problem was caused by Federal custody 
that, as Your Honor has said, broke the relationship 
between the individual and some State that might take 
cognizance of him for purposes of sex offender civil 
commitment. 

The basis for the statute in Comstock was 

that people in Federal custody, regardless of the nature 
of their prior convictions, might pose threats if 
released.  The basis for the statute in this case is not 
that the individual was in Federal custody.  Federal 
custody is irrelevant to it.  The basis for the statute 
in this case is that this is a sex offender in violation

of Federal law, and Congress has the authority to 
impose, as was done in this case, criminal punishment, 
but it also has the authority to impose civil regulatory 
sanctions. 

Page 7 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume that applies to 

all Federal crimes, right?  Anyone convicted of any 
Federal crime can thereafter be subjected to whatever 
civil restraints Congress later decides are -- are a 
good idea in order to prevent that crime, that type of 
crime from reoccurring, right?  I mean, nothing peculiar 
here about sex crimes.  Any -- any crime Congress can 
later decide, you know, it would be a good idea if 
when -- when a person has committed, I don't know, crime 
with the use of a gun, we -- we impose retroactively all 
sorts of different civil limitations. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Scalia, there is 

no per se rule in Article I that forbids retroactive 
civil regulations imposed on a Federal offender.  So the 
question --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no, that's not the 

point, that it's -- that it's retroactive.  The point is 
that it is not in execution of a Federal power. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think the whole point 

in this case is that it's retroactive because there 
isn't any serious dispute that if somebody commits a

Federal sex offense they can be placed on supervised

Page 8 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That would be an execution 

of a Federal power --

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, so is this. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the power -- the power 

to prevent that crime and to punish it. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, but Congress's power is 
not limited to preventing and punishing crimes through 
criminal law.  Except for a brief interlude under United 
States v. Halper where this Court viewed double jeopardy 
as precluding multiple criminal and civil sanctions, the 
Court has recognized that when someone violates Federal 
law they're exposed both to criminal punishment and to 
civil sanctions.  The criminal punishment has to comply 
with the Ex Post Facto Clause.  The civil sanctions do 
not.  So what the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they have to be imposed 
simultaneously as -- as the punishment for the crime of 
which the individual has been convicted.  Here, the 
trial is over, the conviction is over, and then some 
years later the Federal government decides, oh, it would 
be a good idea if people who have committed sex crimes 
are -- are subjected to these limitations.  That's quite 
different from imposing that simultaneously as -- as a

punishment for the crime.  This is not a punishment for 
the crime, right? 

Page 9 

MR. DREEBEN:  That's precisely --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 
MR. DREEBEN:  -- what makes it a civil 

sanction.  But, Justice Scalia, Your Honor is 
presupposing that Congress can only react to a sex crime 
through the criminal law and that it must have those 
laws in place at the time of the punishment, and there 
is no such Article I precept. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your argument 

depends in no way on the fact that he was convicted of a 
Federal offense or -- or incarcerated for that offense, 
nothing at all?  We're just here arguing about the 
retroactivity under -- whether they have the authority 
under Article I to impose punishment for not registering 
under State law? 

MR. DREEBEN:  This case turns entirely on 

the fact that the defendant is a Federal offender.  The 
source of power in question was the power to regulate 
the armed forces.  This is an individual who committed a 
sex crime while in the armed forces.  And Congress's 
power to address that and to prescribe remedies for it 
both civil and criminal is entirely tied to the Federal 
nature of the offense.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, we start out with the 
power under the Constitution to make rules to regulate 
the military and we end up with a registration 
requirement that applies to someone who's not in the 
military and perhaps is not even living anywhere near 
any military installation.  So what would be helpful for 
me is to start out with the constitutional provision, 
identify a purpose of that that is served by this civil 
registration that is imposed later, and trace this whole 
progress through the Necessary and Proper Clause. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Alito, I think the 

most helpful way to do that would be for me -- for me to 
progress through a series of examples that illustrate 
how protecting the public against a Federal sex offender 
is a legitimate aim under the Necessary and Proper 
Clause to implement the underlying constitutional 
authority. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes. 
MR. DREEBEN:  So start with a sex offender 

who commits a sex offense in the military, is tried, 
court-martialed, and sentenced.  Subject to cruel and 
unusual punishment limitations, due process limitations, 
et cetera, that individual can be incarcerated, placed 
on supervised release potentially up to life.  A 
condition of supervised release, well-recognized and now

mandated by Federal law, is that that individual 
register as a sex offender.  And the reason that that is 
tied to Federal law is that when an individual violates 
Federal law it is a legitimate purpose of Congress to 
protect the public against recidivism by that 
individual.  So that's the criminal example that I 
believe is undisputed. 

Now, suppose that the Federal government 

didn't actually get the sex offender while he was in the 
military.  It missed the crime, but later information 
comes to light still within the statute of limitations 
that shows that while this person was in the military 
they committed a sex offense.  This court in United 
States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles made clear that that 
individual can be tried in an Article III court for his 
criminal violation even though he's out of the military. 
It's enforcing the rules that were impressed upon him at 
the time while he was in the military. 

Now let me give a civil example and then I 

will bring it right back to this case.  Suppose that 
Congress concludes that sex offenses in the military are 
a very serious problem and that there are a lot of 
people who have escaped prosecution because of lax 
interest in pursuing those crimes.  And after a period 
of years, it sets up a board of inquiry and it says this

board of inquiry is going to look into sex offenses that 
were committed at the time that people were in the 
military, even if they're out of the military, and we're 
going to subpoena people to testify, and if individuals 
are determined in a civil proceeding to have committed 
sex offenses they may have their military records 
revised, they may lose military benefits, and they may 
have other civil sanctions imposed upon them. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  When you say in a civil 

proceeding, you mean? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, noncriminal. 

Noncriminal. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's just by a 
preponderance of the evidence we think this guy 
probably, you know, 51/49, committed a sex crime. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Not going to be a criminal 

punishment that's imposed at the end of the day. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So just -- just more --

more likely than not is the test. 

MR. DREEBEN:  That's an acceptable level of 

proof for the civil law. 

And if Congress can do that in order to 
protect the integrity of the military and to promote 
confidence in the military, then it's a very small step, 
if any step at all, to SORNA.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, but if they can 

do that.  But that's not what they've done here.  Your 
argument, as you told me a while ago, is linked to the 
Federal offense and the incarceration. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, absolute -- well, 

Mr. Chief Justice, it's not linked to the incarceration. 
This is the difference between this case and Comstock, 
and this is why the Solicitor General's concession in 
Comstock on which the Fifth Circuit heavily relied has 
no applicability here. 

In Comstock, it was irrelevant what offense 
the individual had been committed.  The problem was he 
was in Federal custody, he was sexually dangerous at the 
time he would be released.  Ties had been broken between 
him and the community, and if he were released it would 
pose a threat to public safety that the Federal 
government had power to protect against. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It’s because the 

States were not doing anything about it. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Right. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Here you have a 

situation where I think at the time every State dealt 
with the issue of whether the sex offenders should have 
to register or not. 

MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.  But Federal

law did as well and Federal law provided encouragement. 
This is actually a primary example of partnership 
between State governments and the Federal government. 
The Federal government offers financial support, it 
offers logistical assistance, it offers tremendous 
resources of the U.S. marshals to track down sex 
offenders. 

And as this Court said in Carr v. United 

States, it was entirely reasonable for Congress to have 
assigned a special responsibility for prosecuting 
Federal sex offenders who failed to register.  This was 
integral to this Court's reasoning in Carr, where the 
Court was confronted with two provisions of 2250, the 
criminal sex offense provision under SORNA.  For State 
offenders, there had to be travel in interstate 
commerce, for Federal offenders there didn't. 

The government argued that the provisions 

ought to be given as co-extensive a reach as possible so 
that the coverage of the statute would be equally 
comprehensive for both State and Federal.  And this 
Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The discussion so far has 

assumed, your discussion primarily, that there's this 
line between civil and criminal, we don't need to worry 
about ex post facto.  Is that line made clear in our

precedents or is there some room to argue that if the 
line is somewhat blurred that there may be ex post facto 
concerns here and that that in turn is a reason for 
constitutional avoidance when we evaluate your argument? 

Page 15 

Is that -- is the civil -- a criminal 
distinction with reference to Ex Post Facto Clause 
absolutely foreclosed and clear in the facts of this 
case? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, it is, I believe, Justice 

Kennedy.  In an opinion that you wrote for the Court, 
Smith v. Doe, which considered the retroactivity of 
Alaska's sex offender registration and notification 
provisions, which are similar but not identical, to the 
Federal provisions, the Court went through the 
established analysis to determine whether the 
legislature had intended a punitive effect and if it 
didn't, whether there was the clearest proof that it was 
punishment in purpose and effect. 

Notwithstanding the legislature's intent, 
the Court upheld the retroactive applicability of sex 
offender registration and notification, making clear 
that it is not governed by the Ex Post Facto Clause. 
Now, that's not to say that an individual 

couldn't argue that SORNA is different or an individual 
couldn't argue that the Due Process Clause makes it

either irrational or substantively off limits to impose 
this kind of civil remedy.  The individual can also 
argue that running this through the Comstock factors, 
it's not reasonably adapted to fulfilling Congress's 
aim. 

But what the Fifth Circuit did is apply a 
per se rule that it drew, I think, from the Solicitor 
General's statement in Comstock that once an individual 
got out of custody and was back in the control of the 
State and within its jurisdiction and population, then 
the Federal government couldn't reach out and commit him 
as a sex offender. 

And there are two main distinctions between 

that concession and this case.  The first is, as I've 
already alluded to, the government's argument in 
Comstock was based on custody.  This case is based on 
the consequences of the conviction itself.  The second 
distinction is that committing somebody civilly is a 
massive intrusion on that individual's relationship with 
the State. 

The individual has been brought within 
Federal custody, they have no relationship with the 
State anymore.  Whereas sex offender notification is far 
more accommodating of State interests.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  To -- to what does this 

Page 17

civil -- civil-criminal line apply?  Suppose instead of 
a registration requirement, Congress just decided, you 
know, our past punishments for sex offenses have not 
been -- have not been severe enough, and so we are now 
going to impose a civil fine on all -- all persons who 
have been convicted in Federal court of sex crimes. 
It's a civil -- it's a civil penalty, not a criminal 
penalty.  That's okay? 

MR. DREEBEN:  It's not per se barred by 

Article I, Justice Scalia.  The question of whether it's 
constitutional is really a question of individual rights 
analysis and whether it passes through the necessary and 
proper gate under the considerations similar to what the 
Court looked at in Comstock. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I find that difficult to 

believe that --

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, there's no --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that whether it's ex 

post facto and impermissible or not is simply 
eliminated, that issue was eliminated by simply calling 
it civil. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, it's not eliminated.  It

abandoned long before he got to the court of appeals, 
that it violates due process, that it violates ex post

post facto. 

MR. DREEBEN:  He can argue that.  I submit 

that he will lose.

MR. DREEBEN:  If it in fact is civil and 

passes through this Court's analysis, then yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I find that difficult 

to grasp. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, it's actually quite well 

established as a principle of double jeopardy law in 
cases like Hudson v. United States and United States v. 
Ursery.  It's established in ex post facto law as a 
consequence of Smith v. Doe.  It's the foundation for 
deciding whether a proceeding requires preponderance of 
the evidence versus proof beyond a reasonable of doubt. 
The Court has articulated this line in a variety of 
contexts.

be inter -- interstate commerce? 

Page 19 

MR. DREEBEN:  No.  As long --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The fact that 

somebody at some time in their life traveled across 
State lines means that the Federal government can go 
back, even though their activity that's challenged in 
the particular instance is only intrastate, and still 
assert jurisdiction over them? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that would probably fail 

a Necessary and Proper Clause analysis, in which there 
has to be a showing that the measure is plainly adapted 
to furthering the underlying power.  This is not a 
difficult problem that the Court has never confronted 
before.  It has resulted in difficult permutations on 
particular facts, but the Court has always recognized 
that there is broad Necessary and Proper Clause 
authority subject to limits.  Those limits --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As broad as that 

authority is, perhaps I'm going back to Justice Alito's 
question, which is if you put aside that it's part of 
the punishment because you say it's not part of the 
punishment, you want us not to look at it as punishment 
because otherwise you'd run into the ex post facto

problem, you're saying we have a need today.  Outside of 
protecting the public from a recidivist, what's the 
interest?  Because that wasn't enough in Comstock.  We 
made it very clear that wasn't enough. 

So if you take out all of the punishment 

aspects of this, which you should have done at the time 
he was sentenced and not now, what remains in terms of 
the Federal interest? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Sotomayor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's promoted? 
MR. DREEBEN:  There is a sufficient Federal 

interest in protecting the public from someone who 
committed a Federal crime.  Supervised release 
essentially performs that function. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that was -- why did 
we even bother going through anything in Comstock?  If 
that stands alone as a Federal interest, then anything 
we do at any point with respect to any person who's 
violated a Federal law would stand in the same shoes. 

MR. DREEBEN:  It's a valid --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You could do whatever 

civil penalties you want for as long as you want.  We go 
back to my initial question and Justice --

MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Sotomayor, really, the 
answer to your question is the same.  The answer to all

of your questions is the same, which is that there is an 
analysis that the Court went through in Comstock where 
it took into consideration history, it took into 
consideration the nature of the fit between the purpose 
of Congress and the activity that it was regulated.  It 
took into account the degree to which the State 
interests were accommodated, and it took into account 
the degree of attenuation between the regulation and the 
underlying offense.  And it -- it didn't open up 
Congress to say any offense you've ever committed means 
Congress owns you for life, it can do whatever you want. 
It has to pass through an analysis. 

But the Fifth Circuit never conducted that 
analysis except for believing that once the individual 
had completed military service, once the individual had 
completed his criminal sentence, Congress lost all 
authority. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm getting confused 
between two different assertions of a Federal interest. 
Earlier you talked about the integrity of the military 
forces.  They go back later, they think they should 
address the fact that people were engaging in criminal 
activities when in the military, they weren't -- they 
weren't found out, they weren't prosecuted.  Later on 
they can go back.

 But then you say that the interest that's at 

issue here is preventing recidivism, and that doesn't 
seem to have anything to do with the integrity of the 
military force. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, it does because when the 
criminal law finds someone who has violated Federal law, 
many of the purposes of the sanctions that are imposed 
on that individual are public protection purposes and 
anti-recidivism purposes.  Most of the things that are 
done on supervised release fulfill those purposes.  If 
those purposes were not validly connected to taking 
someone who's violated criminal law and imposing a suite 
of sanctions on them, then supervised release would 
apparently be beyond Congress's authority. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It -- it seems to me that 
when -- when you say that as your answer to the Chief 
Justice, you're -- you're no longer relying on -- on the 
power to regulate the military.  You're relying on -- on 
some general Federal power to protect citizens against 
people who have committed any Federal crimes.  And I --
I don't see that enumerated power in the Constitution. 
Yes, I see a power to regulate the military, but your 
description, it has nothing to do with regulating the 
military.  It has to do with protecting the -- the 
public at large from people who have committed Federal

crimes, military or not. 

Page 23 

MR. DREEBEN:  As the Court has pointed out 

numerous times, including in Comstock, there is very 
little authority in the Constitution in an enumerated 
way for criminal law at all.  All of criminal law, with 
the exception of a handful of instances that are 
specified in the Constitution, comes in by virtue of the 
Necessary and Proper Clause. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right because it 

protects Federal functions.  The Federal -- the criminal 
applicability to the armed forces protects the function 
of regulating the armed forces. 

MR. DREEBEN:  But part --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But how does protecting the 

public at large from people who have committed a crime 
in the armed forces, how does that have anything to do 
with regulating the armed forces? 

MR. DREEBEN:  That is inherent in taking 

somebody who violated Federal law and imposing 
appropriate sanctions on them for that violation. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Dreeben, it would help 

me in answering some of these questions if you went 
through the analysis on the assumption that this was 
instead a Commerce Clause case.  So take the military 
out of it, what would the necessary and proper analysis

look like? 

MR. DREEBEN:  It would look essentially the 

same, Justice Kagan.  Somebody who violates a Federal 
law that's premised on the Commerce Clause, say a sex 
offender who travels in interstate commerce with the 
intent to commit a sex offense, has placed himself 
within the regulatory authority of the Federal 
government.  Now, that individual can be criminally 
prosecuted for that violation, and that violation 
furthers Congress's interests in regulating interstate 
commerce. 

Congress could also decide, you know, for 

some of these sex offenders, criminal punishment is not 
the right approach.  The right approach is mandate sex 
offender rehabilitative counseling.  And it might 
discover that that's so effective for a class of 
offenders that it's going to apply that even to people 
whose offenses were committed before the law in question 
is passed.  It can't punish those people based on 
retroactive legislation, but it can reach them with a 
civil remedial measure so long as it passes through the 
Comstock-type analysis of the Necessary and Proper 
Clause.

in your brief, that the assumption that SORNA is 
something new added after is wrong because there were 
these predecessor laws that established a Federal 
requirement to register. 

Page 25 

MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Ginsburg, I believe 
that the Fifth Circuit was wrong on that too.  As we 
describe in our brief, Title 42 Section 14072(i)(3) and 
(4) did, in our view, impose criminal punishment on 
Respondent for failing to register as a sex offender at 
the time he was in the military. 

We think the Fifth Circuit was wrong on that 

statutory analysis, but, more fundamentally, the Fifth 
Circuit was wrong in thinking that it mattered whether 
he was under some sort of Federal criminal jurisdiction 
at the time that he was released from Federal custody. 
And if I could reserve the rest of my time. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Dreeben.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. CAROLYN FUENTES

Federal government to reach back, after a Federal 
sentence has expired, to bring back into Federal control 
a person who has returned to the authority of the State. 

Page 26 

And I'm quite surprised to hear the 

government say that this is not a Comstock analysis. 
I'm not sure they stuck with that throughout the 
argument, but I think the -- the Comstock factors are 
factors that this Court looks at quite frequently in 
doing any kind of a necessary and proper analysis. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I bo back to – 

to a primary question, are you challenging – you 
didn't on appeal, but it seems as if you're accepting 
that the Federal government has the power to impose this 
requirement as part of a Federal sentence. 

MS. FUENTES:  I think that's correct. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Are you --

if it's not part of a Federal sentence, but part of 
release, it's not announced at the sentence, but it's 
announced at the time the prisoner is put into 
supervised release or release from jail, do you think 
the government has the power to impose it then? 

MS. FUENTES:  In this case, on these facts, 
and based on the Federal statutes that exist today, the 
answer is yes.  And the illustration, I think, is the 
way that SORNA works today.  As the government

mentioned --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, SORNA today 

becomes part of the supervised relief terms. 

MS. FUENTES:  Correct. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not talking about 

SORNA today. 

MS. FUENTES:  Okay. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm talking about just 
any prisoner who has been in jail, but it's not made, 
has not been paid, part of the punishment. 

MS. FUENTES:  I think the law permits a 

sentencing judge -- I'm not talking about Congress, but 
a sentencing judge -- to go back and impose additional 
conditions of supervised release. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I don't know of 

that power, but do you have a statutory --

MS. FUENTES:  It's 18 -- 18 United States 

Code Section 3583.  And 3583 permits the sentencing 
judge to change conditions of supervised release based 
on the factors that are considered important in 
sentencing in 18 United States Code Section 3553. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So that 

power -- I guess then what the government is saying, as 
I understand their argument, if you have the power to do 
it at that point, why can't you have the power to do it

later? 

MS. FUENTES:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are the same factors 

that compel permission for the government to do it then? 

MS. FUENTES:  It's because the way the 
statute works, even though it wasn't announced at 
sentence, supervised release is considered to be part of 
the sentence.  So if I understand the question 
correctly, the reason the court can go back and impose 
those conditions and possibly the reason that Congress 
can go back and do it is because those statutes that 
I've mentioned, 3583 and 3553, have given notice to the 
individual. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  We are not talking -- I'm 

sorry. 

MS. FUENTES:  That's all right. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  I didn't mean to interrupt 

your question. 

MS. FUENTES:  It's all right. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  We're not talking about 

statutory authorization.  We are talking about 
constitutional power.  So if we start out with the 
example of registration for life being imposed as part 
of supervised release, part of the criminal sentence, 
then we go to an example where it is not part of the

criminal sentence, but it is a civil requirement 
triggered by a separate civil proceeding for every 
Federal -- every person convicted of a sex offense under 
Federal law. 

Page 29 

Now, if that were the setup statutorily, 

would that fall within Congress's power under Article 1? 

MS. FUENTES:  I think not, but I want to 

qualify that because it depends on what powers Congress 
is relying on. 

And let me give an example.  I know the 
government was -- a lot of the government's argument 
relies on this difference between criminal and civil 
consequences. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, we know what -- and we 
know what power they are relying on.  Let's just look at 
the power that they're relying on here.  It's the power 
to make rules for the regulation of the military.  So 
part of their -- in the exercise of their power to make 
rules for the regulation of the military, they impose a 
civil sex offender registration requirement for someone 
convicted of a sex offense under the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice.  That does not, in your judgment, fall 
within Article I? 

MS. FUENTES:  It does if the person is still 

in the military or if he has been -- or if he has

committed a criminal offense and the prosecutorial 
power, the Federal power to prosecute him for that 
offense, has not been exhausted, yes, that can be done. 

Page 30 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  How about if he is on 

supervised release?  He is not in the military, but his 
entire sentence has not been completed. 

MS. FUENTES:  I think if he is still being 

supervised by the military, then I think it's likely 
that power exists. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Then why not this? 
MS. FUENTES:  Because Mr. Kebodeaux was not 

on supervised release.  No, I'm sorry --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well -- why not?  I mean, 
look, this is -- Thomas Reed Powell once said, "If you 
can think of a thing that is inextricably related to 
another thing without thinking of the other thing, then 
you have the legal mind," and that seems to be this 
case.  All right? 

MS. FUENTES:  Yes, it does. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  So somehow I have to get 
out of my mind the ex post facto part, the potential 
violation of due process part, the equal protection 
part, take that aside.  Now I've got to just think about 
whether it has, Congress has the power under the 
provision that Justice Alito said.  I'm trying to do

that, and I've dissented in other cases on other 
grounds. 

Page 31 

All right.  But in -- in just trying to do 
that, I think, well, the military, suppose they found a 
certain number of -- of individuals, men or women, have 
unfortunate problems in the military.  They discover 
there is a mental illness problem.  The person's out of 
the military.  But the law says you can go and tell the 
local mental health authorities about this person even 
though he's no longer there. 

And suppose the person had a criminal 

problem in the military and was in prison and suppose 
the law said, you know, you're the ones who got the 
situation where he unfortunately got into that problem, 
and you, later on, can -- can go and tell authorities 
about his problems so they can take appropriate action. 

Now, if they can do that, why can't they 
have the power under Article I to say really, you all 
have to register.  Now, maybe there are other things, 
but you got this problem in the military.  You were 
convicted in the military.  You did it in the military. 
We turned you loose and there you are, and we want, as 
part of our military regulation, to be able to tell 
authorities about you and to make you register according 
to State law.

 Now, no due process problem, I have to 

Page 32

assume that away.  No punishment, bad punishment 
problem, none of those.  But it's a power, all right? 

Why not? 
MS. FUENTES:  Well, the power can't go to 

both of the examples that you've given.  I don't see any 
problem with them giving notice.  That does not impose a 
Federal obligation on an individual.  So there is no 
power being exerted on the individual.  They can have a 
public -- a public protection purpose and they can 
tell -- tell authorities who need to deal with the 
individual, and those authorities may have the power 
through State power --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where you're leading me 
because I'm not so worried about this case, but where 
you're leading me is down in Commerce Clause cases and 
all kinds of other cases.  Suddenly a distinction arises 
that Congress can, in fact, do all kinds of things 
having Federal authorities do this and that, but you 
couldn't make someone in a State -- you know, you can 
imagine a few that are coming into my mind -- and so 
what I'm worried about is following this distinction 
into other areas. 

MS. FUENTES:  I don't think that is a 

problem, and I think the reason is I disagree

fundamentally with the government.  I think necessary 
and proper analysis is important in each case and it 
does bear similarities in each case.  But depending on 
the power being relied upon, the analysis can be quite 
different.  Commerce Clause is a very broad power. 
I can't say whether this sort of thing, 
depending on the Commerce Clause, would be right or 
would be wrong.  Look at the power to make a uniform 
rule of naturalization. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me -- let me try 
this chain of reasoning out on you and -- and get your 
reaction.  We're starting out with the power of Congress 
to make rules for the regulation of the military.  And 
one of the things that they want to do in making those 
rules is to make military installations acceptable to 
the local communities where they are located. 

They know from experience, for example, 

what's happened in Okinawa, that when have you military 
personnel who go -- who commit sex offenses with people 
off base, it can cause tremendous opposition.  And this 
is what happened here, not the opposition, but an 
offense involving a 15-year-old girl who lived off the 
base. 

So in order to ensure that there -- we don't 

have excessive civilian opposition to the location of

military bases, we are going to do a number of things. 
One thing is we're going to criminally prosecute members 
of the military who commit these offenses.  This will 
deter.  This will incapacitate.  But also, to provide 
further assurance to the community that these people are 
not going to be dangerous, we are going to require them 
to register. 

Now, maybe that's too attenuated, but I'd 
like to get your reaction.  Why could Congress not do 
that under the Necessary and Proper Clause? 

MS. FUENTES:  Well, I think while that 

person is still within the criminal jurisdiction, or any 
Federal jurisdiction, it could be done.  I think that 
once that jurisdiction has been exhausted, once the 
criminal prosecution power has been exhausted, once the 
person has returned to the authority of the State, and I 
think that analysis is important always. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't have to go that 

far though to -- to distinguish the example that Justice 
Alito just gave.  This is not a statute which only 
requires him to registrate -- to register if he hangs 
around the military installation.  This requires him to 
register anywhere, you know, in the -- in the wilds of 
Alaska where -- it's just not this case. 

And even -- even if you would allow that,

and say it is a reasonable -- it has a reasonable 
connection to the power to regulate the military, to say 
wherever he goes he has to register is -- is a different 
question, isn't it? 

Page 35 

MS. FUENTES:  I think it may well be. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  But yet, now that's exactly 

the problem for me because the -- the wilds of 
Alaska you think I think, and I think I think, that --
that sure, if there's a post office there -- there's a 
post office there, then what -- the military is all 
right, they can mail a letter to the -- to be delivered 
to the local doctor to say, look, he has a problem. 
That seems to be okay. 

But you say it's not going to be okay to 
tell him he has to go and make that registration.  At 
that point what you've done is like Madison.  I mean, 
it's an interpretation of the Commerce Clause that I 
think Madison might have wanted, which is you're reading 
a lack of power because of a civil rights problem. 

I mean, it's -- the difference between the 

two cases is really not the need because we have to 
assume the need.  The difference is the restriction on 
the individual.  And it's that part that I'm suddenly 
worried about the Commerce Clause and every power in 
Article I being read with exceptions in the civil rights

area even though we have the amendments to protect the 
civil rights problems. 

Page 36 

MS. FUENTES:  I haven't thought of it that 
way and that really isn't the argument that I'm making. 
I think that the military has jurisdiction.  It's gotten 
information about this individual when it had power over 
him and they can talk to whomever they care to about 
him, or whether --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We've never -- we've never 

held, have we, that what the Federal government can 
itself do under the Necessary and Proper Clause it can 
impose upon individuals to do under the Necessary and 
Proper Clause.  Aren't there two different -- what is 
necessary and proper for the Federal government itself 
to do is not necessarily necessary and proper for the 
Federal government to require private individuals to do. 
MS. FUENTES:  I absolutely agree with that. 

And I think that this goes back to something that the 
government -- well, it gives me an opportunity to 
address something the government has said about the 
Fifth Circuit's opinion.  That it is a per se rule, and 
that is just incorrect.  I -- I have to disagree with 
that.  And I have to disagree with it because the --
everything the Fifth Circuit said was limited by these 
facts.

 These facts are what controls the case.  And 
the Fifth Circuit took great care to make a very narrow 
ruling.  And that ruling, the Fifth Circuit said, is 
that it's unconstitutional, SORNA's requirements, as 
applied to Mr. Kebodeaux and others like him.  It has no 
effect on Congress's ability to impose conditions on a 
prisoner's release from custody or on Congress's ability 
to effect the registration requirements for anyone who 
has been convicted after SORNA's enactment. 

So really, it is not a per se rule.  It is a 

rule, maybe you call it per se as it -- as it affects 
people in Mr. Kebodeaux's position, but I think that is 
very different from what the government is arguing. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess, Ms. Fuentes, what I 

don't quite understand about the argument, this goes 
back to Justice Alito's original question.  You seem to 
say that if this -- if Congress passed a civil statute 
like this one within the time that Mr. Kebodeaux was in 
custody or within the time that he was under supervised 
release, that that would be appropriate. 

But I guess what I don't get is why the 

Federal interests change, whether it's the day before he 
gets out of supervised release or the day after he gets 
out of supervised release.  What in the Federal 
interests shift based on that?

 MS. FUENTES:  I'll answer that question 

Page 38

first, then come back to another. 

It's not a question, I don't think, of 

Federal interest.  It's a question of Federal power. 
And you have to look at the individual power being 
exercised.  And so the way I look at it is what's the 
difference if the Federal government makes a rule for a 
person in the military before -- when he's in the 
military or after he gets out of the military?  That's 
all the difference in the world.  In -- in -- that's our 
argument.  That is all the difference in the world. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I wasn't assuming that 

he was in the military while he was on supervised 
release. 

MS. FUENTES:  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I was assuming that he was 
out of the military in both these cases, but that you 
said while he was still serving his sentence, it would 
be appropriate for Congress to add this additional 
thing, but not after. 

MS. FUENTES:  I think --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  In both cases, he's not in 

the military anymore. 

MS. FUENTES:  Constitutionally, it -- it can 

be all right constitutionally, depending on the

statutory procedures that govern it.  And the way that 
the Federal law operates now, the statutes that I 
mentioned, 3583 and 3553, the way those statutes --
statutes operate is they -- they give someone notice 
that their conditions of supervised release can be --
can be changed.  And so there isn't an ex post facto 
problem with that. 

And there isn't a power problem with that 
because the criminal -- the power to make the criminal 
offense and punish it still exists while that person is 
on supervised release.  It has expired with respect to 
Mr. Kebodeaux, and I think that is one of the most 
important points in this case, and it goes along with 
the Comstock analysis. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it your argument that 
Congress lacks the power to impose supervised release 
after the date when the person leaves the military? 

MS. FUENTES:  No.  After the criminal 

sentence is served. 

I'm sorry.  Maybe I didn't understand the 

question.  Congress --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Someone is sentenced to 

prison --

MS. FUENTES:  Right.

dishonorably discharged from the military.  Can Congress 
say the person has to remain on supervised release for a 
longer period of time after he is returned to civilian 
status? 

MS. FUENTES:  Not if -- not unless it was --

that provision was imposed as part of the sentence or 
while he was still within the Federal power, before the 
Federal criminal jurisdiction expires. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  See, I understand -- I can 

understand why that might create -- that might raise all 
sorts of constitutional arguments about notice and so 
forth. 

But I don't see how that -- how that 

connects with the question whether Congress has the 
power to do it under -- under Article I --

MS. FUENTES:  Well, I'm not sure --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- under the power to 

regulate the military. 

MS. FUENTES:  Yes.  I'm not sure I'm 

answering the question correctly, but that power doesn't 
last forever.  The powers -- there are some powers in 
the Constitution which may last longer than others, and 
the example I raised before was the rule of making 
uniform naturalization.  That's a broader power, I 
think, than the military power.

 And we see that in the cases the 

Page 41

government's mentioned and we've mentioned, the Toth 
case and the Kinsella case. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you could be making 

the argument that the power to make rules for the 
military applies only to people who are in the military, 
and that once you're out of the military that power does 
not permit Congress to do anything special to you. 
But you're not making that argument, I 

gather. 

MS. FUENTES:  No.  No, I'm not making that 
argument.  And again, it goes to the individual facts 
and the power asserted and the way the power operates 
always makes a difference. 

The example that the government gave with 
that board of inquiry and being able to bring people 
back in, I find that whole scenario very questionable. 
But there -- there were people who were -- were 
receiving military benefits, if I understood it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How would you write this 

opinion if you wanted to protect against what Justice 
Breyer was concerned about, constricting the Commerce 
Clause, which has been since Madison more broadly 
defined than he did, or Justice Alito's example of 
ensuring that you're not closing off other things that

can be done after someone leaves, that might be related 
to, like punishing a crime that you find out about 
afterwards.  How would you write this opinion? 

Page 42 

MS. FUENTES:  Just the way the Fifth Circuit 

did in its en banc opinion. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it wasn't really 

helpful because it -- it doesn't give us a limiting 
principle like -- I don't know if it's possible -- that 
if you're relying on just recidivism, Congress has to 
have an independent basis, a power for the imposition 
of -- of criminal or civil sanctions on someone. 

MS. FUENTES:  I'm not certain an opinion 
like that could be written.  I think that the limits, 
the limitations that exist, are on the narrowness of the 
way the opinion is written.  But future cases I don't 
think can be decided that way. 

Certainly, principles can be articulated 
which help to limit.  And I think the -- the best you 
can say in terms of limiting principles is it's going to 
depend on the enumerated power upon which the government 
relies to impose this obligation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how -- I'm not 

sure that makes much sense.  You're saying if they're 
relying on the enumerated power with respect to the 
military, they can do more than if they're relying on

the enumerated power over interstate commerce? 

MS. FUENTES:  No.  And if that's your 

understanding --

Page 43 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So in what sense --
MS. FUENTES: -- I -- I apologize.  I did not 

mean that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, in what sense 

does it then depend on which enumerated power they're 
invoking? 

MS. FUENTES:  Well, let -- let me give an 
example that goes to the collateral consequence cases 
that the government raised. 

The government raises, for example, the 
Hudson case, where a person who is convicted of bank 
fraud both can be punished criminally and then can be 
debarred civilly from participating any more with 
Federal government contracts.  I think the words that 
were used in the Hudson case were, "no longer may have 
business doings with an insured bank." 

Okay, that has to be, I think, the spending 
power.  The government can decide with whom it wants to 
do business.  If it's dealing with an insured bank, then 
it can impose that civil consequence.  And it can do 
it -- I don't want to use the word "independently" of. 
They may do it by reason of the criminal conviction, but

there is an independent power to do it. 

Page 44 

That power doesn't exist here, and so it 

would have to be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They say -- they say 
it exists by virtue of the enumerated power to regulate 
the military forces. 

MS. FUENTES:  Well, I don't think it does. 

Perhaps I don't understand the question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm trying to 

see why you're saying the enumerated power under the 
Spending Clause allows them to take this subsequent 
action, but the enumerated power under the Military 
Clause does not. 

MS. FUENTES:  Well, because the -- I'm 

sorry. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought 

that if you're arguing under the Necessary and Proper 
Clause, that you need an enumerated power that the 
Necessary and Proper Clause is going to serve. 

But I don't see how it makes a difference 

which enumerated power you're talking about. 

MS. FUENTES:  I think it all -- I think it 

does turn on the nature of the power.  I mean, could you 
use the military power to say you, Mr. Bank Fraud 
Client, cannot contract with the government any more?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I get to ask the 

questions.  You don't. 
(Laughter.) 
MS. FUENTES:  Sorry.  You are so correct on 

that.  I apologize. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but it's the 

military -- look, it's the military that they are 
mostly -- that they're relying on. 

MS. FUENTES:  Yes.  And it --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So they say -- I mean, the 

famous statement -- I looked it up -- "Let the end be 
legitimate, let it be within the scope of the 
Constitution, and all means which are appropriate and 
not forbidden are -- fall within the Necessary and 
Proper Clause." 

All right?  The end is to protect the 

communities from those individuals in respect to those 
matters that they became dangerous with when they were 
in the military, okay?  That's the end. 

And is the means appropriate?  They say yes. 
They say, after all, the means here is, notify them when 
we're -- you're moving around.  And therefore, is it 
forbidden?

part, but -- so leave that out.  But the -- the others, 
they say is okay.  So that's the basic. 

Page 46 

Do you think maybe we should send this back 
to the -- to the Fifth Circuit?  The government suggests 
that --

MS. FUENTES:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- because they didn't get 

it right in respect to what the previous statutes 
require. 

What about all that? 
MS. FUENTES:  Well, the Fifth Circuit did 

get it right with respect to the previous statutes.  And 
the reason that the government wants to send it back is 
because they say that the Fifth Circuit relied on the 
fact that Mr. Kebodeaux was unconditionally released. 
And as a matter of fact, he was unconditionally 
released.  But they equate unconditional release with 
release free from a registration requirement. 

We have gone over that in great length in 
our brief.  The government is simply wrong about that, 
for the reasons that we state in our brief.  And I can 
go into those, if you want, if you'd like. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I just want to know what to 

do if I end up thinking they are right.

Page 47
 JUSTICE BREYER:  What's your recommendation 
there on that assumption?  I'm not saying I would, but 
I'm just saying on that assumption. 

MS. FUENTES:  I -- I guess it depends on 
which assumption.  The Fifth Circuit would not have 
changed its opinion in this case because Mr. Kebodeaux, 
as a matter of fact, whether the government agrees or 
not, was not released on condition that he comply with 
sex offender registration requirements. 

You can see the difference between 

Mr. Kebodeaux's release and the release of a person who 
is released on conditions that he comply with 
requirements, and that is in 35 --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Your argument is he was 
released on condition of State registration.  Isn't your 
argument dependent only on that there was no Federal 
registration requirement? 

MS. FUENTES:  No.  It is dependent on 

whether that release was conditioned on his 
registration, and it wasn't.  Today, when a person is 
released from custody on supervised release, it is a 
condition of that release, under 3583, that he comply 
with sex offender registration requirements.  What 
happens if he doesn't comply? 

He can go back to prison on the original

conviction because he was released on condition that he 
comply with Federal sex offender requirements.  It just 
goes to -- to the judge.  It's by preponderance of the 
evidence. 

Page 48 

That is not what happened here. 

Mr. Kebodeaux was released, not on any conditions.  Now, 
the State may have imposed an independent obligation to 
register, but that was not a condition of his release. 
And so it is not the case, as a matter of fact, that he 
was released on condition. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The bottom line is you 
don't think the Wetterling Act applied to him.  Is that 
your point? 

MS. FUENTES:  I'm sorry? 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The Wetterling 

Act didn't apply to him; is that --

MS. FUENTES:  No.  I don't think the 

Wetterling Act applied to him. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  At all? 
MS. FUENTES:  Correct.  But even if it did, 

it was -- it's far removed from a registration 
requirement.  It is a penalty, not a registration 
requirement. 

The State imposed a registration 

requirement.  Wetterling did not.

 And if you'd just read -- and I think that's 
what the Fifth Circuit did.  They just read the statute, 
14072(i)(3) and (i)(4).  It doesn't say a person who is 
required to register will follow -- will suffer the 
following punishment.  It says a person described in 
4042(d), a person who's been into a court-martial. 

If you look at the rest of 14072 and parts 
of 14071, there are provisions that say such and such 
person shall register.  That is a registration 
requirement. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I guess what I'm not 

understanding, Ms. Fuentes, is -- I understand the 
difference between a requirement of registration and a 
penalty for failing to register, but it's a little bit 
cutting -- slicing the baloney thin. 

And if you think that he was in any event 

while he was undergoing his sentence subject to a 
penalty, it's a pretty minor exercise of Federal power, 
isn't it, to say that, instead of making you just 
subject to a penalty for doing something, we're going to 
tell you, you have to do it? 

MS. FUENTES:  I guess I don't.  And the 
reason is it's not the degree of power exerted, it's 
whether the power exists.  And once Mr. Kebodeaux 
completed his Federal sentence, the military power,

which permitted him to be prosecuted and punished, had 
expired. 

Page 50 

And so in some ways it's like there's 

Federal enclave jurisdiction on this side of the street 
where the base exists, where the Navy yard exists, and 
things that happened here can be punished by the Federal 
government, but just across the street the exact same 
things can occur and the Federal government cannot 
punish it. 

So I think it is very careful to draw those 
fine lines, and I think it is essential when discussing 
issues of the enumerated powers because they are 
limited. 

I don't mean to move on fast.  I did want to 

mention -- I know my time is almost up -- that we have 
offered an alternative ground for deciding the 
constitutional questions here, the effective date 
argument.  I know we didn't raise it in the Fifth 
Circuit, but this Court has the authority to consider 
it, and we have put into our brief all the reasons that 
Mr. Kebodeaux is not covered by SORNA to begin with. 

In the Sixth, Ninth and Third Circuits, he 
could not be prosecuted under SORNA, and so that is an 
alternative basis that I think the Court can decide this 
case on.

 And if there are no other questions, I will

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
Mr. Dreeben, you have three minutes 

remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
As I understand Respondent's argument, 

Respondent concedes that he could have been put under a 
lifetime requirement to register with State authorities 
and punished federally if he did not, if only that 
requirement had been imposed on him either at the time 
of sentencing or in a parallel civil proceeding that 
occurred while he was in the military. 

This case, therefore, reduces to a question 

of timing.  The essential argument that Respondent is 
making is that Congress had its -- had its authority 
expire because it didn't exercise it.  There's some sort 
of notion that Congress must speak now or forever hold 
its peace. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's not unusual. 
When you're released from the military, for example, 
you're no longer subject to -- to Congress's 
jurisdiction over the military.  That's a matter of

timing too, isn't it? 

Page 52 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that's just wrong, 

Justice Scalia, because this Court made clear in United 
States ex rel Toth v. Quarles that if an individual has 
left the military, but hasn't been prosecuted, they 
can't be court-martialed, but they can be prosecuted in 
an Article III clause. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not for something that 
they've done after they left the military.  That's a 
question of timing.  Had they left the military when 
they committed this crime? 

If so, they can't be prosecuted under --

under that power of the Federal government. 

MR. DREEBEN:  But sex offender registration 

is a consequence of the military crime.  That was 
committed while they were in the military.  It's a civil 
remedy that may, consistent with other constitutional 
provisions, be imposed retroactively. 

And this case comes down not to whether any 

member of the Court agrees with the Ex Post Facto 
Doctrine analysis in Smith v. Doe or whether there might 
be due process or other concerns out there, it comes 
down to whether Congress has Article I authority to 
say --

limited.  You've limited it to sex offenses, but the --
Congress could say it's important to us that people who 
serve in the military behave correctly even after 
they're released. 

Page 53 

So it is a Federal offense to do anything 

that violates State law for the rest of their lives, and 
your argument would say, well, that's part of their 
authority to regulate the military and so it's okay. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Let me make two points about 

that, Mr. Chief Justice.  First of all, a standard 
condition of Federal supervised release is that the 
individual shall not violate any Federal, State or local 
law, and for many sex offenders, supervised release runs 
for life. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's part of his 

sentence.  That's part of the punishment imposed.  You 
assert that this is not part of the punishment imposed. 
MR. DREEBEN:  I don't see any relevance that 

has to Article I authority.  It has relevance to other 
constitutional provisions. 

So insofar as supervised release does 

contemplate this longstanding, continuous jurisdiction, 
that's a feature of Federal law that the Court ought to 
keep in mind in the way that it writes this opinion. 

But, second, if Congress passed such a law,

it's not that it has carte blanche to do that, it's just 
that there's no per se rule that says it can't.  The 
Court would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your answer to my 

question is yes, Congress can do that.  It can say 
anyone in the military is subject for the rest of their 
life to Federal jurisdiction.  Whatever is a State law 
crime is a Federal crime. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not 

going to say no to that question because I don't want to 
foreclose options that Congress may decide it's 
appropriate to pass, but the Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  Who knows what 

they'll do, right? 

MR. DREEBEN:  But the Court does not have to 

agree that that is constitutional -- may I complete my 
sentence? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 
MR. DREEBEN:  -- in order to uphold this 

narrowly focused, tailored law that looks at a specific 
crime and imposes a specific requirement that's directly 
tied to the nature of that crime. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted.
