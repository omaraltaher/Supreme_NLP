CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  14­1175,  Franchise  Tax  Board  of  California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v.  Hyatt. 

 

            

Mr.  Clement. 

 

            

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  PAUL  D.  CLEMENT 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  States  entered  the  Union  saddled  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  war  debts.  As  a  result,  critics  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  were  quick  to  point  out  any  possibility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  States  could  be  haled  into  court  by  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens  without  their  consent  in  order  to  secure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially  bankrupting  judgments. 

 

 

            

When  this  Court  opened  up  the  possibility  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  such  a  judgment  by  allowing  Chisholm,  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

South  Carolina  citizen,  to  sue  the  sovereign  State  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Georgia  in  this  Court,  the  nation  quickly  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphatically  reacted  with  the  Eleventh  Amendment  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eliminated  the  possibility  of  such  a  suit  even  in  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  neutral  of  Federal  forums. 

 

 

 

 

            

Regardless  of  all  that,  Respondent's 

 

 

 

 

position  is  that,  if  Chisolm  has  turned  around  and  sued

Georgia  in  South  Carolina  State  court,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

South  Carolina  in  its  unreviewable  discretion  decided  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  jurisdiction  over  the  sovereign  State  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Georgia  ­­

 

            

            

law  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  There  is  one  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  ­­ there  is  nothing  in  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  There's  one  ­­ there's  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

significant  difference  there,  Mr.  Clement,  which  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  are  on  a  par  with  each  other.  So  there's  a  kind 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  mutuality.  So  if  one  State  does  something  to  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  don't  like,  you  can  turn  it  around  and  do  it  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  And  that  mutuality  also  makes  it  less  likely  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  will  do  that  thing  to  you  in  the  first  place 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  know  that. 

 

 

 

            

So  ­­ so  I  think  what  Mr.  Farr  says  is  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  there  was  this  outrage  with  respect  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  court  might  not  have  registered  in  quite  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  way  when  States  were  aware  that  they  were  on  a  par 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  each  other  and  that  they  had  many  weapons  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  use  against  each  other. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  Justice  Kagan,  here's 

  

 

 

 

 

why  I  disagree.  And  because  most  of  the  weapons  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  nations  would  use  vis­à­vis  each  other  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensure  that  sovereign  immunity  as  a  comity  did  not

become  sovereign  immunity  in  name  only  are  precisely  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tools  that  the  States  surrendered  to  the  national 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  in  the  plan  of  the  convention. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So  if  South  Carolina  had  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  for  sure,  Mr.  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Clement,  you  know,  you  couldn't  go  to  war  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neighboring  State  anymore,  and  that's  a  difference.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  could  say,  if  you're  going  to  treat  me  like  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  going  to  treat  you  like  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  you  have  other  ways  of  dealing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  ­­ with  a  State  that  you  wouldn't  have  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government. 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  Justice  Kagan,  two 

  

 

 

 

 

points.  First,  it's  not  just  the  act  of  war.  It's  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability  to  impose  trade  sanctions;  it's  the  ability  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

withdraw  your  ambassadors.  All  of  that  is  taken  away 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  States. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  there  anything  in 

  

 

 

 

 

our  ­­ in  ­­ in  our  jurisprudence  or  our  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tradition  that  say  States  can  protect  each  other  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retaliating  against  each  other? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  that's  the  second  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  was  going  to  make,  Justice  Kennedy,  which  is  it's  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

odd  thing  to  think  that  the  framers,  who  had  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experienced  the  Articles  of  Confederation  where  they  had

unsatisfied  judgments  and  the  potential  that,  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  of  New  York  went  after  the  State  of  Georgia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Georgia  hadn't  complied  with  the  requisition  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funds,  that  there  would  be  civil  war.  The  idea  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  they  would  want  sovereign  immunity,  which  no  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubted  exists,  enforced  was  that  kind  of  race  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bottom.  As  opposed  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  ­­ I  mean,  I  ­­ I 

    

   

   

 

 

thought  that  ­­ I  thought  that  it's  illegal  for  a  State 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ban  Washington  apples. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  there  is  that.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

something  that's  implicit  in  the  Constitution.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Clement,  to  take  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

down  to  the  practical  level,  and  we're  not  getting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  with  war,  take  Nevada  v.  Hall.  But  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan's  point  is,  if  California  says  that  a  Nevada  truck 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coming  on  its  California  roads,  injuring  a  California 

   

 

 

 

 

 

resident,  so  then  Nevada  is  liable  to  the  courts  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  of  California,  Nevada  can  say  fine.  If  a  California 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

truck  comes  into  our  State  and  injures  Nevada  people,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  do  the  same  thing. 

 

 

 

 

            

mind. 

            

That's  what  I  think  Justice  Kagan  had  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  Absolutely.  And  I  think

that's  the  exact  opposite  of  what  the  framers  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  do.  They  weren't  trying  to  adopt  a  union 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there  would  be  signs  on  State  borders  that  say,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  come  in  here,  you  thereby  waive  any  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  and  we  will  hale  you  into  court  and  allow  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens  to  do  it.  Instead,  they  were  adopting  a  union 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  States  came  in  with  substantial  war  debts  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  sovereign  immunity. 

 

 

            

And  there  is  no  way  they  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sacrificed  their  sovereign  immunity,  which  was  the  key 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection  for  those  war  debts  not  being  used  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  to  bankrupt  them. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  The  system 

  

  

 

 

 

that  you're  advocating  ­­ just  so  I  get  it  right  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  saying  constitutionally  any  ­­ every  State  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immune  from  any  acts  that  they  commit  ­­ this  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  that  Justice  Ginsburg  is  making  ­­ from  any  acts

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  their  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  ­­ all  ­­ all  I  have

whatever  bad  acts  they've  had. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Two  points,  Justice  Sotomayor.

First  of  all,  let's  take  a  Nevada  resident,  and  let's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  California  comes  in.  The  Nevada  resident  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  sue  the  State  of  California  in  California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  if  there's  a  waiver  of  sovereign  immunity.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  Article  IV  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protect  the  Nevada  citizen  from  California  saying,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  waive  our  sovereign  immunity  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  citizens  but  not  Nevada  residents. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So  that's  one  protection  that  they  have. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  other  point  is  what  we're  really  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  is,  as  to  the  starting  point,  is  the  default  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Do  you  start  with  sovereign  immunity? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

It's  always  possible  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  ­­ what's  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  ­­ for  States  to  agree  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

waive  their  sovereign  immunity. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  would  they  do  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  for  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  could 

    

   

   

 

understand  them  getting  together,  which  they  haven't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done,  to  agree  upon  limits  to  each  other's  or  waivers  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity.  But  what  would  induce  them  to  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together  to  do  that? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  suppose  consideration  ­­

think  that  they're  forced  to? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  considerations  of 

  

 

 

 

convenience.  I  mean,  Nevada  and  California  could  decide 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  have  sufficient  comity  and  respect  for  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  that  it's  perfectly  fine  for  California  to  be  sued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Nevada  court. 

 

 

            

But  conversely,  they  could  come  and  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary  decision  because  of  their  sovereign  immunity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say,  no,  if  you  want  to  sue  us,  come  into  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts.  And  I  think  a  case  like  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  we  have  here  34 

  

 

 

 

 

 

states  tell  us  that  they  didn't  like  this  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  45. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  45. 

  

 

How  come  they  haven't  gotten  together  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  an  agreement  among  all  of  them? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Because  it  would  be  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

burdensome  to  do  that.  And  I  think,  with  all  due

gave  up  a  lot  of  things  to  the  Federal  government.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  can  understand  why  they  thought  they  needed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eleventh  Amendment. 

 

            

 

But  what  makes  you  think  that  they  gave  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  sovereignty  with  each  other  with  respect  to  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds  of  issues? 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Two  things  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's  not  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Constitution. 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Two  things  principally,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

Honor.  First  is,  I  don't  think  they  actually  gave 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything  up.  What  my  friend  on  the  other  side  suggests 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  gave  up  is  the  right  of  one  sovereign  court  system 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  hale  another  sovereign  into  that  court  system.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  a  right  that  didn't  exist  at  the  founding. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  that's  what  Hall  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  exist.  Hall  said  the  States,  vis­à­vis  each 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other,  don't  agree  to  respect  the  other's  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity.  Hall  distinguished  sovereign  immunity  where 

  

 

 

 

 

you  are  the  king,  where  you  are  sovereign,  a  State's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity.  And  then  said,  but  when  another  State  is  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ in  the  picture,  equally  sovereign,  then  both  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  are  sovereign,  and  neither  has  to  respect  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity  of  the  other,  that  it's  just  ­­ well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  ­­ when  the  nation  was  new,  you  will  admit  that

there  was  no  full  faith  and  credit  obligation.  If  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  was  going  to  respect  the  sovereignty  of  the  other, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  be  a  matter  of  comity,  right? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  You  say  "comity."  I  would 

    

  

 

 

 

say,  as  a  starting  point,  law  of  nations.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely,  it  is  true  that  whenever  you're  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  sovereign  immunity  in  any  court  other  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign's  own,  you  are  talking  about  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  as  of  comity. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Okay.  So  ­­

  

  

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  when  did  it  change 

  

 

 

 

 

 

from  comity  to  an  obligation? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Upon  the  framing  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution,  just  as  it  did  with  respect  to  every  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity  principle.  The  principle  that 

  

 

 

 

 

emerges  from  this  Court's  cases  is  that  if  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  had  preexisting  sovereign  immunity  from  a  suit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  they  did  not  sacrifice  it  in  the  plan  of  convention, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  they  continue  to  enjoy  it  as  a  matter  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  right. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  would  have  thought  you 

    

 

 

 

 

would  answer  that  the  obligation  was  an  obligation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international  law,  that  comity  was  an  obligation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international  law  insofar  as  it  extended  to  sovereign

immunity  of  each  State  not  being  haled  into  the  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  another  State.  That  was  international  law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Yeah.  The  very  concept 

  

  

 

 

 

of  comity  is  a  matter  of  grace,  that's  international 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  That's  what  this  Court  said  in  Hilton  against 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guyot.  Comity  is  not  a  kind  of  a  full  faith  and  credit. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  But  two  points  are  important, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg.  First  of  all,  although  the  law  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nations  as  the  framing  between  independent  nations  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  comity,  that  didn't  mean  that  there  weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  principles  that  were  so  well  established  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  nation  that  didn't  respect  them  would  be  committing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  act  of  war.  And  first  on  that  list  would  be  the  idea 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  could  not  have  an  in  personam  suit  against  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  sovereign.  It  was  unheard  of. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And  my  friend  doesn't  disagree  with  that.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  his  response  to  the  possibility  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  haven't  we  now 

  

 

 

 

 

recognized  that  there  is  no  automatic  immunity  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  nation,  another  nation?  That  ­­ the  Foreign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sovereign  Immunities  Act  said,  yeah,  sometimes, 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  we  respect  the  sovereignty  of  that  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nation,  but  sometimes  we  don't,  like  in  commercial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deals.

don't  think  that  you  want  to  resolve  this  case  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  of  nations'  immunity  principles,  either  in  1789  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today.  But  if  you  were  to  do  that,  we  would  still  win, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  despite  the  relative  laxity  of  waivers  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity  in  the  current  age,  you  still  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  an  in  personam  suit  for  something  that's  of  course 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  function,  like  tax  collection.  Even  to  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

day,  we  couldn't  sue  France  over  the  exact  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  today. 

 

            

But  I  don't  think  the  way  that  this  Court's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  apply  the  law  of  nations  is  the  right  way  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking  about  this.  Rather,  the  right  way  to  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  it  is  that  sovereign  immunity  at  the  framing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes  a  constitutional  principle.  And  I  think  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  There  is  ­­ there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  irony,  isn't  there,  that  California  is  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  gave  us  a  Nevada  against  California,  right?  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

California  then  was  saying,  oh,  yes,  we  can  sue  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  in  Nevada  in  our  courts  if  they  come  into  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  and  hurt  our  people.  It  was  California. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  is  California  now  saying  they  were  wrong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  argument  that  they  made? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  the  FTB  is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

asking  you  ­­ which  is  an  arm  of  California  ­­ is  asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  to  overrule  Hall.  So  I  think  it  is  fair  to  say  that

there  is  some  buyer's  remorse  on  the  principle  of  Nevada 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  Hall  by  the  sovereign  State  of  California. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But  we're  not  estopped  from  making  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  California  has 

  

 

 

 

joined  the  amicus  brief,  has  it  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  They  didn't,  but  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

that's  because  they  felt  that  an  arm  of  State  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  what's  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  ­­ already  here,  so  I  think, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  know,  that  ­­ that  that  explains  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  want  to  make  one  point  very  clear, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  this  Court  has  a  whole  host  of  State  sovereign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  cases  dealing  with  the  Federal  courts.  Every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  those  cases  with  the  ­­ every  one  of  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  cases  and  indeed  every  State  sovereign  immunity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  with  the  exception  of  ­­ of  ­­ of  Alden  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maine  is  a  case  that's  applying  sovereign  immunity  as  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comity.  Because  the  new  Federal  court  system  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  court  system.  The  sovereigns  did  not  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity  as  of  right  in  any  distinct  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  of  a  superior  sovereign  or  of  an  independent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

nation. 

            

So  when  this  Court  says,  well,  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  sovereign  immunity  and  they  didn't  sacrifice  it  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Constitution,  they're  not  talking  in  those  cases

about  sovereign  immunity  as  of  right;  they're  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  sovereign  immunity  as  of  comity. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

So,  too,  in  the  tribal  immunity  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  what  do  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  Everybody  on  this  Court  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Clement,  what  do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

do  with  ­­ I  mean,  one  time  we  had  ­­ had  this  issue, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  argument  that  you're  making  was  ­­ was  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  Alden,  and  the  Court  spent  over  two  pages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguishing  Nevada  v.  Hall  on  that  very  point,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  ­­ when  there  are  two  sovereigns  involved,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  different. 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Oh,  absolutely,  and  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

because  Alden  is  the  only  case  that  involves  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  in  the  State  sovereign  immunity  context.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  also  Federal  sovereign  immunity  cases,  but  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  sovereign  immunity  context,  Alden  is  the  only  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  dealing  with  sovereign  immunity  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign's  own  court  system.  Every  other  one  deals 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  sovereign  immunity  in  a  different  court  system, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

either  the  Federal  court  system  or  the  tribal  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system.  That's  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  in  ­­ in  ­­ in  Hall 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  does  say,  we  determine  the  Constitution  did  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reflect  an  agreement  between  States  to  respect  the

sovereign  immunity  of  one  another. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  think  that's 

   

  

 

 

because  ­­ I  assume  that  comes  from  the  part  of  Alden 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  Alden  is  dealing  with  Hall  as  a  given,  and  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  the  result  in  Alden  does  not  require  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overruling  of  Hall.  I  would  take  that.  That's  fine. 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

That's  true,  they  are  different  issues. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  do  think  they  create  one  anomaly  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another.  I  mean,  Chisholm  can't  sue  Georgia  in  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfectly  neutral  Federal  court;  Chisholm  can't  sue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Georgia  in  Georgia  court;  but  Chisholm  can  sue  Georgia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  least  neutral  court  available,  the  State  of  South 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carolina.  That  doesn't  make  any  sense. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  also  the  anomaly  that  apparently, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alden's  mistake  was  suing  Maine  in  Maine  court.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alden  would  have  sued  Maine  in  New  Hampshire  court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  for  Federal  law  or  maybe  for  State  law,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  suit  could  have  gone  forward. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  is  also  anomalous  that  the  tribes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparently  have  greater  immunity  than  the  States,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  they're  inferior  sovereigns,  because  you  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  same  principles  to  recognize  tribal  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity.  And  the  dissenters  in  Footnote  1  of  those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  even  they  recognize,  well,  States  are  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  are  a  superior  sovereign.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  they  are  not  totally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

bizarre.  It  flows  from  the  principle  in  Nevada  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  maintained  the  sovereign  power  to  define  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  of  its  own  courts,  which  is  also  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  sovereign  power.  So  if  you  look  at  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power,  then  you  have  to  say,  well,  what  is  it  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Constitution  that  limits  or  takes  away  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  power? 

 

            

So  that's,  I  think,  where  I'm  left  after 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Nevada.  And  now  you  have  a  whole  set  of  arguments,  but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  require  us,  for  the  most  part,  to  overrule  several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases. 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  don't  think  so, 

   

  

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer.  Let  me  make  two  points,  one  of  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  not  be  particularly  responsive  to  you,  which  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  I  think  all  of  this  Court's  post­Hall 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions,  some  of  which  you  have  enjoined,  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggest  that  the  burden's  not  on  me  to  show  where  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  it  was  taken  away,  but  that  the  burden  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  my  friend  to  show  where  the  Constitution  specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took  away  the  States'  sovereign  immunity,  where  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surrendered  it. 

 

            

But  I  still  think,  Justice  Breyer,  I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

not  ­­ I'm  not  trying  to  not  get  your  vote,  because  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  even  if  the  burden  is  on  me  to  show  where  the

Constitution  took  it  away,  I  think  I  can.  I  think  it's 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

implicit,  but  it  is  implicit  in  three  places:  Article 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

III,  the  Eleventh  Amendment,  and  all  the  provisions  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took  the  diplomatic  and  war  tools  away  from  the  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  I'd  like  to  get  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

response  to  the  second  part  of  this.  Because  your  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  I  ­­ I  do  ­­ that's  ­­ I'm  finding  that  rather 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hard,  and  it  seems  to  me  intuitively  at  some  level 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct  that  a  State  like  Nevada  should  not  be  able  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  less  sovereign  immunity  to  California  than  it  gives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  own  officials. 

 

 

            

So  I  thought,  well,  where  in  heaven's  name 

   

 

 

 

 

 

does  that  come  from?  And  that's  what's  bothering  me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I'd  like  a  theory.  I  have  ­­ all  I  have  so  far  is 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this:  Full  faith  and  credit,  two  statutes,  sometimes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist.  And  there  is  also,  when  you're  giving  full  faith 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  credit,  the  competing  principle  that,  if  you  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  of  your  own  State  that  cuts  the  other  way  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  reasonable  and  so  forth,  you  don't  give  full  faith 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  credit. 

 

            

And  here,  if  you're  following  that  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle,  the  same  kind  of  principles  in  the  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause  too,  you  would  say,  fine.  Nevada,  since  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  give  its  own  people  the  sovereign  immunity, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  to  recognize  California's  because  of  the

public  policy  it's  following.  But  as  soon  as  they  run 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  sovereign  immunity,  which  is  at  $50,000,  I  think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  they  have  no  reason,  and  therefore  they  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow  California's  law. 

 

 

            

Now,  I  raise  that  because  it's  in  the  back 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  my  mind.  I've  been  thinking  about  it.  And  I  don't 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  in  the  briefs  either  that  theory  or  a  competing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory  about  why  you  can't  ­­ you  ­­ you  see  where  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going? 

            

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  think,  Justice  Breyer  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'd  love  your  view  on  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  ­­ and  I'm  going  to  give  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  best  answer  on  that,  which  is  ultimately  loop  back  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hall. 

            

So  my  best  answer  on  that  is  the  way  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  about  this  is  Nevada  has  said,  we're  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  Nevada  law,  not  California  law,  and  Hyatt  I  says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  can  do  that.  But  then  they  ­­ when  they  start 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  apply  Nevada's  law  of  sovereign  immunity,  they  get  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  point  where  there's  a  50,000  damage  cap  and  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  ­­ unbelievably  in  my  view  ­­ but  they  say,  oh, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  this  statute  only  applies  to  Nevada's  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies.  And  you're  not  a  Nevada  government  agency,  so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  don't  get  the  benefit  of  it.

MR.  CLEMENT:  Now,  if  ­­ rather,  if  Nevada 

  

 

 

 

 

did  the  exact  same  thing  to  a  citizen  of  California  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damage  cap  that  applied  not  to  sovereigns  but  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens,  I  read  my  friend  on  page  52  of  his  brief  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  that  would  violate  the  Privileges  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Immunities  Clause  of  Article  IV,  that  you  couldn't  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  well,  no,  that's  a  benefit  only  for  Nevada 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

residents. 

            

So  his  position  ultimately  is  the  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  worse  off  than  the  citizen,  which  can't  be  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  think  there  are  two  ways  to  respond 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  that  complete  anomaly.  One  is  to  say  that,  although 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  it's  not  right  there  in  the  text  of  it,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  of  Article  IV's  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  the  same  principle,  the  same  protection  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  applies  to  a  citizen. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  ultimately  the  better  way  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  it  is  to  say  the  reason  the  framers  put  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  in  Article  IV  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unamended  Constitution  is  they  realized  States  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued  in  other  States'  courts.  So  there  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vulnerability  they  needed  to  address. 

 

 

 

 

            

They  simultaneously  implicitly  recognized 

 

 

 

that  there  was  no  way  on  earth  that  a  sovereign  could  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued  in  another  State's  court  because  of  age­old

sovereign  immunity  principles.  So  they  didn't  feel  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed  to  give  express  protection  to  the  sovereign  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  they  did  to  the  citizen. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Mr.  Clement,  I  ­­ I  assume, 

   

   

  

 

 

but  maybe  I'm  wrong,  that  it  ­­ it  follows  from  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  a  ­­ a  State  could  not  adopt  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

equivalent  of  the  Foreign  Sovereign  Immunities  Act  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  ­­ make  other  States  suable  in  ­­ in  their  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  for  commercial  activities. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Not  ­­ not  of  its  own  force.

That's  a  little  strange,  isn't  it? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  No.  No,  I  don't  think  it  is 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

strange,  Your  Honor.  But,  I  mean,  I  think  coming  at  it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

from  a  different  angle  ­­ and  maybe  you  get  to  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  place.  I  don't  know.  But  I  think  it  would  be 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

plain  as  day  that,  the  day  after  the  plan  of  the

that  they  yielded  the  opportunity  to  do  that  to  the

I  think  in  the  same  way,  the  States  yielded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  ability  to  make  determinations,  make  treaties  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  governments  over  foreign  sovereign  immunity.

They  yielded  that  to  the  Federal  government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  vis­à­vis  each  other,  what  they 

 

 

 

 

 

preserved  as  a  constitutional  matter  is  an  immunity  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  haled  into  each  other's  courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But,  Mr.  Clement, 

  

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia's  question  does  suggest  that  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  interests  on  both  sides  of  this.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  ­­ one  is  I  want  to  have  sovereign  immunity.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  avail  myself  of  sovereign  immunity.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  is  I  want  to  subject  another  State  to  my  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  when  I  feel  like  it,  and  I  want  the  choice  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  that  or  reaching  an  agreement  with  another  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  should  all  treat  each  other  nicely. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  on  your  view,  the  States  are  giving  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  significant  sovereignty  interest.  They're  keeping 

  

 

 

 

 

one,  but  they're  also  giving  up  one.  And  the  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  have  to  answer  is  why  ­­ why  is  it  so  obvious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  States  would  have  made  that  choice  rather  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  choice?  Which  is,  hey,  it's  been  working  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  us  just  fine  to  have  the  choice  and  to  deal  with  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  on  a  going­forward  basis  on  principles  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

mutuality. 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Justice  Kagan,  I  think  there's 

   

  

 

 

 

two  reasons  that  it  is  glaringly  obvious  that  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  made  exactly  the  choice  I'm  suggesting.  One

is  they  weren't  giving  up  anything  they  actually  thought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existed.  They  did  not  think,  because  the  law  of  nations 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorically  forbid  it,  that  they  had  the  power  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assert  in  personam  jurisdiction  over  a  foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

sovereign.  They  absolutely  ­­ yes,  it  was  law  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nations  that  laid  down  that  principle. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  it  ­­ wasn't  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  ­­ didn't  Chief  Justice  John  Marshall  explain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  as  to  a  foreign  country,  yes,  there  was  a  rule  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comity,  but  it  was  not  ­­ it  was  not  binding.  We  ­­

I  thought  that  was  the  whole  distinction 

 

 

 

 

 

made  in  Schooner. 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  Justice  Ginsburg,  two 

  

 

 

 

 

points  about  that. 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  here  is  what  Chief  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Marshall  says  about  the  amenability  of  the  sovereign  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue.  He  says,  quote,  "One  sovereign  being  in  no  respect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amenable  to  another."

to  disregard  international  law.  So  the  United  States  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  He  didn't  put  it  in  terms 

  

 

 

 

 

of  raw  power,  did  he? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  think  if  you  read 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

the  whole  opinion,  that's  exactly  what  he's  saying.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  had  to  have  ­­ I  mean,  think  about  it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Schooner  Exchange  arises  in  1812.  We're  already  at  war 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  Britain.  So  he  did  have  ­­ the  Federal  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  the  raw  power  to  exercise  jurisdiction  over  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ship  of  France,  but  there's  a  very  good  reason  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  do  it:  Because  they  recognized  that  asserting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  kind  of  authority  would  be  equivalent  to  an  act  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

war. 

            

And  that's  why  I  think  it's  so  obvious  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ that  the  States  did  give  this  up.  Because  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  bring  in  a  foreign  sovereign  into  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  was  unthinkable  to  that  generation  as  a  flat 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  the  law  of  nations.  And  if  they  did  it,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  committing  an  act  of  war.  And  that's  exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  other  things  that  they  gave  up. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  reason  I  think  it's  glaringly 

   

 

 

 

 

obvious,  though,  is  that,  on  the  one  hand  they  give  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that's  inchoate  and  a  violation  of  the  law  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nations.  Sovereign  immunity,  on  the  other  hand,  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single  most  important  issue  they're  dealing  with  because

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Farr. 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  H.  BARTOW  FARR 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Since  much  of  the  discussion  this  morning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  turned  on  the  possible  overruling  of  Nevada  v.  Hall, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd  like  to  start,  if  I  might,  by  setting  out  what  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  are  the  two  main  reasons  why  Nevada  v.  Hall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't  be  overruled. 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  the  Court  in  Nevada  v.  Hall, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlike  the  Board  in  its  argument,  took  account  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that,  after  the  formation  of  the  Union,  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retained  a  great  deal  of  their  essential  sovereign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

attributes,  and  that  it  was  fundamentally  inconsistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  those  sovereign  attributes  for  another  State  to

declare  itself  immune  as  of  right  from  its  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  reason  is  that  the  Board  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failed  to  show  that  the  ordinary  political  processes  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  particular  an  agreement  among  the  46  States,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  now  represented  before  the  Court,  saying  they  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree  there  should  be  absolute  immunity  in  each  other's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  ­­ why  they  can't  reach  that  agreement  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  that  effectively  be  the  law  going  forward  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  intervention  of  this  Court  and  without  the  need  for

intervention  of  Congress,  I  assume,  right? 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FARR:  I'm  sorry,  Justice  Scalia?

Because  this  is  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  thought  compacts  between 

    

 

 

 

States  always  required  approval  by  the  Congress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  I  ­­ I  beg  to  differ,

MR.  FARR:  That's  correct,  that  ­­ that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  whether  an  agreement  among  the  States  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggregation  of  State  power  at  the  expense  of  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government.  If  that's  true,  then  Congress's  approval  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed.  But  there  are  agreements  among  the  States,  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  which  are  actually  called  compacts,  which  do  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  the  consent  of  Congress,  and  I  have  no  belief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  one  would. 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  this  is  not  ­­ if  the  States  got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together  and  mutually  agreed  we're  going  to  honor  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other's  idea  of  sovereign  immunity  in  our  own  courts,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  see  any  reason  that  Congress  would  need  to  be  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  that  seems  to  me  quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disruptive  of  the  union  that  the  Constitution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplates  in  that  States  would  make  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangements  with  each  other.  Maybe  they  would  freeze 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  States  out.  You  would  have  have  States  bargaining 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  each  other.  It  seems  to  me  that  that  causes  great 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissension. 

            

always  ­­

 

            

MR.  FARR:  Well,  Justice  Kennedy,  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  For  instance,  California 

  

 

 

 

Franchise  Tax  Board  has  ­­ collects  tax  from  people  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  the  ­­ all  over  the  United  States.  And  I  could  see 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  States  saying,  well,  let's  leave  California  out  of

this  agreement,  but  we'll  agree  with  ourselves.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  me  highly  disruptive. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  Well,  you  do  have  the  45  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supporting  California  in  this  case,  making  the  total  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46.  So  in  this  particular  case,  there  really  are  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  many  States  that  are  outside  the  circle. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  if  you  say  we're  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  throw  the  States  back  on  themselves;  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  negotiate  with  each  other?  That's  not  part  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  constitutional  tradition  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  Well,  Justice  Kennedy,  I  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

guess  I  do  disagree  with  that.  I  mean,  there  is  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  something  that's  been  set  up  by  the  Council  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  Governments  called  the  National  Center  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Interstate  Compacts,  and  its  job  is  to  help  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilitate  agreements  among  themselves  on  matters  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  interest.  And  there  are  hundreds  of  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreements. 

            

So  the  idea  that  ­­ that  the  States  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  able  to  get  together  and  formulate  policies  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  mutually  beneficial  to  them,  and  reach  them  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  rather  than  approaching  the  Federal  courts  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  overrule  one  of  your  prior  cases  or  invent  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

novel  principle  of  Federal  law  to  ­­ to  limit  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages,  seems  to  me  exactly  what  the  States,  as

JUSTICE  ALITO:  If  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  is  your  first  reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  saying  keep  ­­ keep  Nevada? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  The  first  reason,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg,  is  that  Nevada  v.  Hall  recognized,  in  a  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Board  never  does,  that  there  are  two  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  at  stake  here.  And  one  can  read  the  Board's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs  and  listen  to  the  terrific  argument  this  morning, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  one  will  not  ever  hear  one  word  about  Nevada's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  interest  here  in  protecting  and 

 

 

 

 

 

compensating  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  I  think  Mr.  Clement 

   

  

 

 

 

says  that  there  are  two  answers  to  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One  is  that  they  actually  never  exercised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  sovereign  interest,  so  it  didn't  mean  very  much  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them. 

            

And  the  other  is  that  in  exercising  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  interest,  they  would  be  violating  norms  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international  law,  so  that  they  wouldn't  have  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  that  that  was  a  significant  and  exercisable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

interest. 

            

that. 

            

But  those  are  his  two  arguments  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FARR:  Right.  And  I  don't  think,

frankly,  either  one  really  carries  much  weight.  I  mean 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  first  one  is  a  ­­ is  a  chicken­or­egg 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem,  in  a  sense.  It  is  true  that  they  were  not  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  States  had  not  exercised  their  power,  if  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  the  late  1700s.  They  ­­ they'd  only  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  power  for  ten  years,  but  they  ­­ they  hadn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercised  the  power  to  subject  other  States  to  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

Nathan  v.  Virginia  is  an  example  where,  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  intervention  of  the  Pennsylvania  executive 

 

 

 

 

 

officials,  the  Pennsylvania  courts  said,  no,  we're  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  exercise  jurisdiction  over  Virginia.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  side  of  that,  of  course,  is  that  they  always  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  as  a  ­­ as  a  matter  of  comity  from  the  other 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 

            

So  if  one  is  looking  at  the  question  of  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  we  think  about  this,  looking  back  in  time,  several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundred  years,  what  decision  would  the  States  have  made? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  answer  is  we  really  don't  know.  They  weren't  faced 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  that. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  if  the  ­­ if  the  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  that  they  had  retained  this  power,  why  have  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  cited  any  cases  in  which  this  was  exercised  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nevada  v.  Hall?

cases  where  the  power  was  exercised.  Up  to  that  point, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  courts  ­­ I  mean,  the  courts  of  the  various  States 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ were  treating  the  other  States  as  immune.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't  very  many  suits  filed,  but  immune  as  a  matter  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comity.  But  that,  of  course,  is  exactly  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationships  between  these  sovereigns  are  all  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

If  one  goes  back  and  starts  with  a 

 

 

 

 

 

foundational  decision,  which  is  Schooner  Exchange, 

 

 

 

 

 

Schooner  Exchange  is  a  very  important  decision  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity,  but  it's  also,  and  principally,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  about  sovereignty. 

 

 

            

And  what  Schooner  Exchange  says  is  that  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  within  its  own  territory  has  exclusive  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolute  authority.  And  therefore,  if  another  sovereign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  going  to  come  into  that  territory  and  act  contrary  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  laws  of  the  sovereign,  it  can  only  do  that  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent  of  the  home  sovereign.  That's  the  principle  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  all  of  this  is  based. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  this  ­­ although  there  are  obviously  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereigns  involved,  and  a  sovereign  interest  in  each 

   

 

 

 

 

 

case,  an  interest  in  immunity  on  the  part  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visiting  sovereign,  an  interest  in  having  its  exclusive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  over  its  territory  over  the  home  sovereign,

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Mr.  Farr,  I'm  concerned 

  

 

 

 

 

about  ­­ about  the  Eleventh  Amendment,  which,  of  course, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  prevent  a  ­­ its  words  do  not  prevent  a  State 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  being  sued  in  Federal  court.  They  only  prevent  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  being  sued  by  citizens  of  another  State  in  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  Okay? 

  

            

 

Nonetheless,  in  Chisholm,  we  ­­ we  ­­ we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held  it  it  goes  beyond  that,  Chisholm,  which  prompted  ­­

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Hans  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ the  ­­ the  Eleventh

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  We  ­­ we  have  held  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  Hans  which  held  that  it's  also  citizens  of  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  that  cannot  sue  in  Federal  court,  but  that's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Eleventh  Amendment. 

 

 

 

            

That  rested  upon  ­­ this  is  what  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hughes  said  it  rested  upon,  "Manifestly,  we  cannot  rest,

Amendment  exhausts  the  restrictions  upon  suits  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonconsenting  States. 

 

            

"Behind  the  words  of  the  constitutional

There  is  the  essential  postulate  that"  ­­ "that  the

controversies  as  contemplated  shall  be  found  to  be  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justiciable  character.  There  is  also  the  postulate  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  of  the  union,  still  possessing  attributes  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty,  shall  be  immune  from  suits  without  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent,  save  where  there  has  been  a  surrender  of  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  in  the  plan  of  the  convention." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  other  words,  Hans  says  there's  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption  behind  the  Eleventh  Amendment  that  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  be  sued  without  their  consent. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  why  ­­ why  should  that  apply  only  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit  in  ­­ in  Federal  courts,  and  not  to  suits  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  ­­ in  ­­ in  the  courts  of  other  States? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  I  think  the  answer  to  that, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia,  is  because  the  situations  are  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  I  think,  in  fact  ­­ I  mean,  the  notion  that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Board,  I  think,  presents,  generally  ­­ and  I  want  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  very  specifically  to  the  question,  but  I  want  ­­ I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  just  preface  with  this  one  observation,  if  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may. 

            

The  Board's  suggestion,  I  think,  is  what  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Court  really  just  needs  to  do  now  is  put  the  third  leg 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  immunity  triangle.  It's  already  made  clear  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  have  immunity  in  their  own  courts,  which  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

English  tradition,  and  that  States  have  immunity  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  courts.  That's  the  Eleventh  Amendment.  So  all,

really,  the  Court  should  be  doing  now  is  to  draw  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last  part  of  that  and  say  they  have  immunity  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  of  other  States.  But  those  are  all  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations. 

            

They  ­­ the  States  have  immunity  in  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  courts,  just  as  nations  do,  because  they  are  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sole  sovereign  involved  there.  There  aren't  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sovereigns  when  you're  talking  about  immunity  in  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  courts.  So  that's  one  separate  thing. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  to  get  specifically  to  the  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  raising,  Justice  Scalia:  Immunity  in  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts,  which  is  broader  than  the  language  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eleventh  Amendment.  And  of  course,  the  Federal  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  courts  of  a  different  sovereign,  in  a  sense,  than 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  courts. 

 

 

            

But  at  the  time  that  the  Constitution  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  drafted  and  the  question  of  ratification  came  up, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  was  an  issue  that  was  specifically  discussed.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  when  the  States  were  concerned  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ratifying  the  Constitution  because  of  their  war  debts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  raised  questions,  and  the  Framers,  like  Madison  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hamilton,  so  on  and  so  forth,  gave  them  assurances.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  the  deal. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  The  ­­ the  assurances  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

based  upon  the  postulate,  the  assumption,  that  no  State,

of  course,  can  be  haled  into  the  ­­ into  the  courts  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  sovereign  without  its  consent.  That  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer.  And  that  answer  applies,  not  just  to  being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haled  into  ­­ into  the  Federal  courts,  but  being  haled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  courts  of  other  ­­ of  other  states. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  But,  Justice  Scalia,  to  be  blunt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  it,  there  is  no  such  postulate.  I  mean,  if  ­­ if 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity  is  what  the  Board  says  it  was  or  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  sovereign  can  never  be  sued  without  its  consent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  courts  of  another  State,  then  the  entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international  world  is  operating  on  an  incorrect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise. 

            

State  ­­ nations  can  be  sued  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  under  the  Foreign  Sovereign  Immunities  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  commercial  torts  ­­ I  mean  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  activities,  for  certain  torts,  without  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent.

Austria  case,  the  Altmann  case  where  the  Republic  of

They  say  it's  outside  the  FSIA.  They  say,  you  don't

But  the  ­­ the  Court  doesn't  say,  you're

courts. 

            

The  Court  resolves  the  case  against  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republic  of  Austria  and  finds  no  sovereign  immunity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  there  isn't  such  a  postulate  as  broadly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

worded  as  you  suggest. 

 

 

 

            

Louisiana? 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  How  do  you  explain  Hans  v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FARR:  Hans  v.  Louisiana  is  the  second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  triangle.  That's  the  question  of  ­­ of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  being  sued  in  Federal  court. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  Hans  v.  Louisiana  makes  perfect  sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  if  one  says,  at  the  time  of  the  convention,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  were  concerned  about  being  sued  in  Federal  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  deal  that  was  made,  essentially,  was  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  assurances:  If  you  ratify  the  Constitution,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  not  be  subject  to  suit  at  the  behest  of  individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Federal  court. 

 

 

            

If  you  accept  that  deal  and  then  you  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  language  of  the  Eleventh  Amendment,  well,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eleventh  Amendment  does  ­­ the  language  doesn't  capture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  deal  because  it  leaves  aside  suits  by  citizens  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  own  State. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  Mr.  Farr,  Mr.  Clement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

suggests  that  it's  unthinkable  that  a  State  would  be  so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned  about  being  haled  into  Federal  court  but  not

just  as  concerned  or  even  more  so  about  being  haled  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit  of  another  State. 

 

 

 

            

            

What  is  the  response  to  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FARR:  The  response  to  that  is  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  argument  just  doesn't  give  proper  weight  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  balance  of  power  and  the  difference  in  the  balance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  power  between  the  Federal  government  and  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governments  and  between  the  State  governments 

 

 

 

 

 

horizontally. 

            

When  you're  ­­ to  go  back  again  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formation,  Justice  Kagan,  if  ­­ if  one  is  looking  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  that  the  States  were  facing  at  that  time, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  forming  a  new  union.  So  they  get  a  say  in  this 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  have  to  ratify  it  before  it  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists. 

            

So  when  they're  looking  at  this,  what  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  see?  They  see  a  sovereign  that  is  going  to  be  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

superior  sovereign.  What  does  that  mean  for  sovereign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  purposes?  It  means  that,  if  that  sovereign  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued  in  the  States  ­­ in  the  State  courts,  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  dismiss  the  suit.  There  is  no  principle  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  clearer  than  the  fact  that  a  superior  sovereign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  be  brought  to  answer  in  the  courts  of  inferior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereigns.  So  that's  ­­ that's  the  state  of  play. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  the  other  States,  however,

there  is  inequality.  They  could  subject  other  States  to

wrote  what  they  wrote,  but  that's  what  they're  thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of.  And  you're  saying  the  second  is  what's  at  issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

            

therefore  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  FARR:  That's  correct.  And  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  therefore  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  FARR:  Excuse  me. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ we  have  two  cases  on  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  went  through  the  whole  thing.  At  the  very  least, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  open  it.  All  right.  I'll  accept  ­­ or  don't  go 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  because  it's  at  least  not  that  clear.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  I'll  accept  that. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  would  like  just  two  minutes  on  what's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

bothering  me.  And  what  is  bothering  me  is  I  really 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  see  how  Nevada  can  say,  we're  going  to  give

immunity  to  our  own  State  but  we  won't  accept 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California's  similar  immunity. 

 

 

            

Now,  that  doesn't  seem  intuitively  right, 

 

 

 

 

 

but  if  I  look  at  the  Constitution,  I  see  it  says  this. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  says:  "Full  faith  and  credit  shall  be  given  in  each 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  to  the  public  acts  of  other  States." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

California  has  a  public  act  which  gives 

   

 

 

 

 

immunity.  Nevada  is  not  giving  full  faith  and  credit  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  I  think  those  acts  can  sometimes  include  statutes 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  common  law  rules  or  decisions  of  courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  say,  how  does  Nevada  get  away  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that?  Answer:  Because  they  have  a  strong  public  policy 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

in  not  doing  it;  namely,  the  policy  of  they  don't  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody,  including  their  own  officials,  that  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity. 

            

If  that's  the  answer,  that  answer  runs  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  steam  at  the  very  point  that  they  try  to  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officials  more  immunity  than  California  is  giving. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  you  see  how  I've  lined  up  that  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasoning  with  what  seems  intuitive.  But  I  have  no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

idea,  to  tell  you  the  truth,  about  whether  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent  for  that;  about  what  that  might,  in  fact,  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us  into  trouble  on;  or  et  cetera. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  would  ­­ you  must  have  thought  through 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  If  I  look  in  the  briefs,  the  answer  to  this

question  of  equal  treatment  ­­ I  can't  find  much. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  Well,  I  think  that  ­­ that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

important  part  there  is  that  the  only  Federal  basis  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  have  really  identified  that  conceivably  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support  this  claim  is  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  is  a  Federal  law.  It's  part  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  the  Full  Faith  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Credit  Clause  reinforced  by  it  is  the  same  policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  FARR:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ that  exists  under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Commerce  Clause  too  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FARR:  That's  ­­ that's  part  of  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ and  the  Privileges  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Immunities  Clause. 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  That's  ­­ that's  the  part  I  want 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  to  because,  if  one  applies  the  Full  Faith  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Credit  Clause  ­­ remember,  of  course,  the  Court  did  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Hyatt  I  and  ­­ and  rejected  California's  argument 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  its  immunity  law,  giving  absolute  immunity,  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply,  and  Nevada  did  not  ­­ Nevada  has  to  apply  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  the  Court  has  already  crossed  that  bridge,  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  some  extent. 

 

 

            

Now,  I  agree  with  you  at  that  point  there

was  not  a  judgment,  so  there  was  no  comparison  of  ­­ of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  damages.  But  then  the  question  is:  What  is  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full  faith  and  credit  standard  that  this  Court  applies? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  is  the  same  standard  that  the  Court  applied  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hyatt  I,  and  that  is,  if  Nevada  is  competent  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislate,  it  can  apply  its  own  law.  It  doesn't  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  California  law  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  Nevada's  own  law,  unless  you  try  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rewrite  it  on  some  basis,  which  I'll  also  get  to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California's  law  does  not  give  immunity  to  other  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Nevada's  law  is  great. 

  

 

 

 

 

Nevada's  law  says  if  you're  a  Nevada  worker  ­­ State, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  get  ­­ you  don't  have  to  pay  a  dime.  In  fact,  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  pay  50,000. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FARR:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  if  you're  California  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

some  other  State,  you  have  to  pay  40  million. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  No  ­­ no.  But  let  me  go  to  your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  here.  No,  I  understand  that,  but  ­­ but  I  ­­ I'm

MR.  FARR:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ in  the  Constitution  or

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That  once  they  go  beyond 

  

 

 

 

 

 

their  own  immunities,  they  run  out  of  steam  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  no  reason  for  not  following  California's  law.

right.  Because  your  argument  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  know  he  doesn't  think 

    

 

 

 

 

it's  right,  and  I  want  to  have  the  reason. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  No,  I  don't  think  that's  right. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  Justice  Ginsburg,  thank  you,  because  I'd  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  point  out  ­­ I  think  maybe  by  going  step  by  step,  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  get  to  the  step  I  want  to  get  to  quickly  enough. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  step  that  I  want  to  get  to  is  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  no  requirement  in  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  goes  on  top  of  are  you  competent  to  legislate  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  torts  at  issue?

we're  going  to  apply  our  own  law  to  a  lawsuit  that  it  is

you  to  do  that,  can  you  show  us  a  public  policy  of  yours 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  be  offended  by  applying  the  law?  But  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  but  in  marriages  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  all  kinds  of  things,  I've  seen  the  public  policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  when  ­­ when  there  is  a  ­­ a  right  for  a  State 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ignore  the  public  act  of  another  State  where  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  kind  of  ­­ it's  a  ­­ some  kind  of  policy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orientation. 

            

MR.  FARR:  But  ­­ but  I  ­­ I  want  to  draw  a

are  you  competent  to  legislate.  That's  the  ­­ the  sum 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total  of  the  constitutional  test. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  of  course,  just  because  you  haven't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated  the  Constitution  when  you're  applying  your  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws  doesn't  mean  that  the  way  that  your  decision  to

well  right  to  be  confused,  Justice  Scalia,  because  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  All  California  says  about 

  

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity  is  you  can't  be  ­­ we  can't  be  sued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  courts.  I  don't  think  California  has  a  law  that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  we  can't  be  sued  anywhere,  do  they? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FARR:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  if  they  did,  would  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  jurisdiction  to  say  that?  I  don't  know. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  I  don't  think  ­­ well,  because  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ what  the  Court  said  in  Hyatt  I,  they  don't  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  power  to  enforce  their  own  immunity  and  their  laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  another  State  if  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What's  ­­ what's  being 

  

 

 

 

 

given  full  faith  and  credit,  then,  under  the  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here?  What  ­­

  

 

            

MR.  FARR:  The  original  argument  ­­ the  fact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  the  Board  has  changed  its  argument  about  full 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith  and  credit,  and  that's  why  it's  confusing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  its  brief,  originally,  the  Board  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  asking  that  Nevada  apply  California's  law  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity.  Now,  they  can't  ask  them  to  ­­ ask  that  it  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  totally,  because  that  was  already  rejected  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hyatt  I.  So  they  say  above  the  $50,000.  That's  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  saying,  apply  California's  law  of  immunity  above 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  $50,000  mark.

In  their  reply  brief,  however,  at  pages  4 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  5,  they're  emphatic  that  they're  not  asking  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  to  apply  California  law  at  all.  They  say  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  that  ­­ that  Nevada's  law  of  immunity  be  applied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well,  that,  in  its  literal  term,  simply  doesn't  work. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California's  law  of  immunity  doesn't  apply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California. 

            

So  what  ­­ what  the  Board  is  groping  for  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  sort  of  loose  principle  that  the  Court  could  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  override  a  State's  judgment  about  how  to  apply  its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  laws  of  immunity,  all  in  the  interest,  I  might  note, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  promoting  State  sovereignty.  But  leaving  that  aside, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  is  where  would  that  come  from. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  ­­ let's  ­­ let's  assume,  hypothetically, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  California  brought  an  original  action  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court,  and  it  said  we  want  an  injunction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordering  ­­ ordering  Nevada  to  apply  its  damages  cap  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  suits  against  California  in  Nevada  courts.  This  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming  the  Court  doesn't  overrule  Nevada  v.  Hall,  as  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  hope  it  doesn't. 

 

 

 

            

What  would  the  basis  in  Federal  law  be  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  lawsuit?  The  only  basis  that  I  see  in  their  brief 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Federal  law  is  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  reasons  I've  explained,  if  you  apply  the

that  does  not  help  them.  Comity  is  a  voluntary  doctrine 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

among  States.  And  their  equal­footing  doctrine  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

miles  away  from  anything  we're  talking  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Secondly,  even  if  the  Court  had  the  power, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  Federal  law,  generally  ­­ maybe  Federal  common  law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  always  something  the  Court,  I  guess,  can  create 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  necessary  ­­ why  would  they  particularly  choose  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule?  Because,  although  it  sounds  perfectly  logical, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  is  a  benchmark.  I  mean  Nevada  uses  it  not 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  this  one  exception,  but  Nevada  uses  it  to  knock 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down  punitive  damages  claims  against  negligence,  all  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  As  a  benchmark,  it's  a  perfectly  fine  rule  for 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

States  to  choose.  But  as  a  mandatory  Federal  rule  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose  on  the  States,  it's  not  quite  so  good. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  It's  a  little  odd  that 

   

  

 

 

 

the  Nevada  courts  say  comity  as  far  as  punitive  damages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  going  ­­ we're  not  going  to  slap  California  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punitive  damages,  but  no  comity  before  ­­ above  50,000. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  Well,  I  think  that  ­­ its 

   

  

 

 

 

 

explanation  of  that  actually  makes  quite  good  sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  say,  you  know,  when  we're  compensating  our  people, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  not  just  compensating. 

 

 

 

            

Compensation  serves  two  purposes.  It  serves 

  

 

 

 

 

­­ the  compensation,  it  helps  the  person,  obviously, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cope  with  their  injuries.  And  I  should,  by  the  way,

point  out  that  under  the  overruling  of  Nevada  v.  Hall, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody  injured  by  a  State  gets  nothing.  It's  just  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  that's  a  digression. 

   

 

            

 

 

 

But  back  to  the  main  point,  when  ­­ when 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  talking,  however,  about  a  situation  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

officials  of  another  State,  we  also  want  ­­ we  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  of  protection,  trying  to  protect  our  citizens. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  don't  need  the  same  protection  from  our  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government.  We  hire  these  people,  we  train  them,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervise  them.  We  can  keep  things  from  getting  out  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hand  like  they  did  here  where  somebody  just  sets  out  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  vendetta  against  a  particular  taxpayer.  We  can  stop 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that,  but  not  when  it's  another  State.  So  the  idea  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  more  compensatory  damages  in  order  to  discourage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  kind  of  behavior,  it  actually  seems  to  me  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  you  seem  to  be  arguing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  no  matter  how  hostile  one  State  is  to  another, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  would  be  no  requirement  ­­ there  would  be  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  for  equal  treatment.  I  mean,  you're 

    

 

 

 

 

making  ­­ that  argument  seems  to  point  to  the  need  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overrule  Nevada  v.  Hall. 

 

 

 

            

If  that's  the  case,  suppose  Nevada  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  completely  hostile,  uniformly,  consistently  hostile 

 

 

 

 

 

to  California  on  issues  of  collection  of  taxes  ­­

MR.  FARR:  Well,  first  of  all  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ there  would  be  no  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  would  be  no  remedy  for  that.  And  you  could  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  the  States  could  enter  into  an  agreement.  But  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  in  the  interest  of  both  States,  they  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enter  into  the  agreement. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  Well,  I  don't  see  why  it  isn't  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  interest  of  both  States.  I  mean,  it  is  always  true 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  have  an  outlier  State.  But  just  let  me  take  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ the  example,  though,  of  California  and  Nevada, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  again,  if  we're  looking  at  equality  here,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  supposedly  what  the  equal  treatment  principle  is  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  ­­ and  I  put  "equal  treatment  principle"  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

quotes.  If  we're  looking  at  that,  another  possible  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  looking  at  things  which  States  and  nations  have  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  years  is  reciprocity. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  you  look  at  this  case  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standpoint  of  reciprocity,  what  do  you  look  at?  Well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ that  brings  in  Nevada  v.  Hall.  And  in  Nevada  v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hall  there  was  no  cap  on  damages.  Nevada  was  subjected 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  unlimited  damages  in  California. 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  exactly  the  same  thing  that  happened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  California  was  subjected  to  unlimited 

  

 

 

 

 

compensatory  damages.

unlimited  damages  for  its  own  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  But  ­­ that's  correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg. 

 

            

But  if  you're  looking  at  the  relationships 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  the  two  States,  which  is  what  we're  looking  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  and  the  question  of  how  States  treat  each  other, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reciprocity  actually  is  more  important. 

 

 

 

 

            

It's  no  solace  to  Nevada  to  say,  well,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  to  pay  unlimited  damages  in  California,  but  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  have  to  pay  $50,000  to  your  citizens  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  different  rule.  That  doesn't  help.  Nevada  is 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

being  treated  unequally,  whether  ­­ whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  rule  is  different  or  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  ­­ if  Nevada  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  give  that  California  tax  people  the  benefit  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  punitive  damages,  that  ­­ it  could  do  that,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  would  be  a  matter  of  comity? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  To  be  honest  with  you,  I  have  my 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubts  about  that.  I  ­­ I  suspect  the  subject  would 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

never  come  up. 

 

 

            

But  in  talking  about  this  idea  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  something  that  ­­ that  this  Court  could  impose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  States,  there  are  things,  for  example,  that  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  drawn  from  international  law  that  might,  in  fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  some  sort  of  check,  if  they  were  truly  universal

values. 

            

Equal  treatment  is  not  a  universal  value. 

   

 

 

 

 

For  example,  United  States  is  exempt  in  its  own  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  torts  based  on  battery  and  assault,  and  false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrest.  Foreign  sovereigns  are  not.  Under  the  Foreign 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Sovereign  Immunities  Act,  the  foreign  sovereigns  do  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  immunity  for  those  same  torts. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  there  is  an  equal  treatment  principle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  large  in  the  world  and  is  universal,  then  that  seems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me  to  be  something  that  the  United  States  cannot  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  nobody  suggests  that  that's  inappropriate  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  are  all  comity  based.  Ultimately,  sovereigns  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

serve  their  own  interests  if  they're  willing  to  accept 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  possibility  that  other  sovereigns  will  do  that  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well. 

            

So  when  ­­ when  I  go  back  to  this  idea  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  something  out  there,  I  don't  think  one  can  ever 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  rule  that  out  when  you're  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangements  among  States  and  among  sovereigns,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  Federal  common  law.  But  there  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  don't  you  think  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

­­

  

before  your  time  is  up,  to  answer  the  argument  based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  Kiowa  Tribe,  that  is,  that  Indian  tribes  are  immune 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  suit  by  individuals  in  State  courts.  So  the

argument  that  your  colleague  gave  is  how  can  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  less  dignity  than  the  Indian  tribes? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FARR:  Well,  let  me  just  answer.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  want  to  take  much  my  time  ­­ extra  time,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  is  they  obviously  have  dignity.  They  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereigns,  and  that's  one  of  the  reasons  they  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  treated  so  much  ­­ with  so  much  comity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

But  the  reason  that  they  don't  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

exact  same  immunity  is  the  historical  basis  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  The  Indians,  and  their  particular  realized 

  

 

 

 

 

 

relationship  with  the  Federal  government,  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation  for  why  they  essentially  partake  of  the  same

very,  very  concerned  that  they  would  be  haled  in  front 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  new  Federal  courts,  so  they  sought  an  assurance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  clearest  place  to  see  the  assurance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  got  is  Federalist  No.  81,  where  Alexander 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hamilton  makes  clear  that  there's  nothing  to  worry  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  because  they  have  sovereign  immunity.  And  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  sovereign  immunity  as  an  inherent  aspect  of  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty. 

            

And  that  assurance  then  becomes  the 

 

 

 

 

 

postulate  that  this  Court  applies  in  Hans  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Louisiana,  and  applies  in  Monaco  against  Mississippi, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  all  of  these  other  cases  where  the  immunity  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided  by  the  Constitution  is  actually  greater  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  text  of  the  Eleventh  Amendment.  The  assurance  and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  postulate  are  one  and  the  same. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  it  may  be  that  in  the  world  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international  relations,  we've  wandered  away  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hamilton  Federalist  No.  81  understanding.  But  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  that  matters.  If  it's  constitutionalized,  as  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  in  every  other  context,  then  the  understanding  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1789  is  what  controls. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  as  to  the  all­important  point  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance  that  you  referred  to,  Justice  Kagan,  I  do  want 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  as  emphatic  as  I  can  that  the  States  were  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving  up  anything  they  thought  they  possessed.  And  I

came  upon  a  quote  from  Edmund  Pendleton.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

explained  ­­ talking  about  sovereignty.  And  he  said  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  in  1792  ­­ and  if  you  want  to  find  this,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  Volume  5  of  the  Documentary  History  of  the  Supreme 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court. 

            

He  said:  "I  have  been  taught  by  all  writers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  subject  that  there  is  no  earthly  tribunal  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whom  sovereign  and  independent  nations  can  be  called  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelled  to  do  justice." 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  think  that's  pretty  emphatic,  and  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

think  pretty  emphatically  suggests  that  on  the  one  hand, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  weren't  giving  up  anything  that  they  could  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise.  On  the  other  hand,  they  were  desperately 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

afraid  of  these  war  debts,  and  they  were  desperately  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to  ensure  that  they  would  preserve  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity.  I  don't  think  the  balance  is  even 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

close. 

            

And  what  I  think  is  so  problematic  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's  position  is  that  he  seems  to  say  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precise  moment  that  the  States  were  going  to  give  up  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  tools  that  nations  used  to  make  comity  a  reality, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  unilaterally  disarmed.  They  gave  up  all  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tools,  and  all  they  got  was  sovereign  immunity  as  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comity,  and  which  my  friend's  position  makes  clear,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  voluntary  as  can  be  and  is  just  a  matter  of  grace.

There's  nothing  that  supports  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  So  I  just  wanted  to  finish 

   

  

 

 

 

 

with  some  anomalies  here  because  we've  talked  about  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple  of  them.  We've  talked  about  this  idea  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  prevent  Nevada  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  this  to  a  citizen. 

   

 

 

            

Here's  another  anomaly.  Now,  my  friend 

  

 

 

 

 

suggested  briefly  as  a  parenthetical  that  there's 

   

 

 

 

 

nothing  that  these  ­­ these  poor  Nevada  citizens  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  able  to  do.  One  thing  they  can  do  is  go  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  and  sue  consistent  with  California's  waiver 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  sovereign  immunity.  As  we  point  out  in  the  reply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief,  there  are  some  remedies  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  other  thing  they  can  do,  as  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy  pointed  out  for  the  Court  in  Alden,  is  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  the  possibility  of  an  individual  capacity  suit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  one  of  the  California  officers. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  here's  something  anomalous:  If  you 

  

 

 

 

 

sued  the  California  officer,  who's  presumably  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  resident,  they  would  have  the  protection  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal  to  Federal  court,  so  they'd  at  least  be  given  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neutral  Federal  forum.  When  my  client  tried  to  remove 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  they  were  confronted  with  Mr.  Hyatt's  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct  objection  that  the  Eleventh  Amendment  prevented

removal  to  Federal  court. 

 

 

 

            

But,  my  goodness.  You  have  now  converted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Eleventh  Amendment,  clearly  designed  to  enhance  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty  into  the  States  ­­ of  the  States,  into  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice  Rehnquist  called  in  Hall  an  albatross 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around  their  neck,  that  they  are  the  one  party  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  favored,  even  compared  to  an  ordinary  litigant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  can't  be  right. 

 

 

 

            

And  of  course,  the  granddaddy  of  all  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anomalies  here  is  that  the  idea  that  Chisholm  could  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued  Georgia  in  South  Carolina  State  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  doesn't  lightly  overrule  its 

 

 

 

 

 

precedents,  but  when  it's  faced  with  an  anomaly  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dramatic  and  that  inconsistent  with  the  founders' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding,  it's  time  to  overrule. 

 

 

 

 

            

to  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You  know,  can  I  just  ask  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  On  that  last  point  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  this  is  a  very  hard  case  straight  up.  But  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  straight  up,  right?  You  need  a  special 

   

  

 

 

 

 

justification  on  your  side.  So  what  is  your  special 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justification? 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  My  special  justification  is 

  

 

 

 

 

workability,  consistency  with  precedent.  Those  are  all

of  the  same  ­­ and  lack  of  reliance  interest.  I  mean,
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  special  justification  is  there,  but  then  this  Court
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elaborates  a  variety  of  principles  that  govern  when  it
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

overrules  precedents  and  I  think  all  of  them  point  in
