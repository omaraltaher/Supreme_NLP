CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 00-1072, Leonard Edelman v. Lynchburg College.


Mr. Schnapper.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SCHNAPPER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The relation-back rule for verification under


section 1601.12(b) is a proper exercise of the authority


granted to the EEOC under section 713 of title VII to


promulgate procedural regulations.  The regulation is


consistent with the language of section 706.  Title VII


requires that a charge be verified, and the statute also


requires that a charge be filed within 180 or 300 days of


the act of discrimination. 


But as Judge Luttig correctly observed below,


these two statutory requirements are independent of each


other.  Specifically, 706(e)(1) establishes deadlines of


180 or 300 days, but it applies those deadlines only to


when, quote, a charge must be filed.  Section 706(e)(1)


does not purport to establish a deadline for verification. 


Conversely, section 706(b) requires verification, but it


contains no deadline for doing so.  That omission is

particularly significant because other requirements which


are contained in 706(b) do have deadlines. 


QUESTION:  What -- what about the other elements


that -- that are required by the statute to be in the --


in the charge? 


Surely the commission has to serve notice of the


charge, including the date and place and circumstances of


the alleged unlawful employment practice.  Isn't that


statutory provision implicitly a requirement that the


charge contain the date, place, and circumstances of the


alleged unlawful practice? 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  I wouldn't go quite that far. 


The -- the commission's interpretation of that, which is


embodied in section 1601.12(b), concludes that a charge is


sufficient if it identifies the parties and contains a


description of the alleged discriminatory practice.


QUESTION:  Well, how -- how can -- how can the


statute be complied with?  I mean, the statute,


2000e-5(b), clearly says that the commission on receiving


a charge shall serve a notice of it, paren, including the


date, place, and circumstances of the alleged unlawful


employment practice on the employer.


MR. SCHNAPPER:  Well, it does -- it does so


provide.  But it also provides that the -- that the charge


shall contain the information and be in the form required

by the commission.  The commission does not require that


particular information.  Ordinarily it could be inferred


in practice --


QUESTION:  So, you think the charge doesn't even


have to -- because the commission hasn't chosen to require


that, a charge doesn't even have to contain the date,


circumstances, and place of the alleged --


MR. SCHNAPPER:  Well, the commission has --


QUESTION:  What does it have to contain? 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  The regulation requires --


QUESTION:  I have been discriminated against?


MR. SCHNAPPER:  I understand the regulation to


require more specificity than that.  That -- that question


is not posed, of course, by this case.  No one questions


the specificity of the information in this letter.  It


did --


QUESTION:  No.  I understand that.  But -- but


what you say about -- about the requirement or -- or


nonrequirement of -- of oath, of it being under oath, I


think you -- you're going to have to logically say about


other requirements or, as you think them, nonrequirements


of the charge.  I don't see how -- how the two don't go


hand in hand. 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  I -- I think that you have to


read -- well, the commission's view is that there is an

irreducible minimum that has to be in a charge.  You can't


just file a piece of paper called -- that says charge and


fill in the blanks later. 


QUESTION:  Why?  Why does it come to that


position?  It just made it up? 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  The statute expressly provides


that the commission can specify what information needs to


be in a charge, and that's the -- that's the answer they


give. 


QUESTION:  I see.  Not because there's any


statutory compulsion, but just in its -- in its wisdom and


beneficence, the commission has decided that there has to


be a certain minimal amount of information in the charge,


not because the statute implies that there must be. 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  I -- I don't -- Federal Register


recounts any -- any explanation, but it seems to me it


would be logical for the commission to have looked at the


provision to which you refer in -- in framing the -- the


requirements it has. 


QUESTION:  Right, but if it looked at the


provision to which I refer, it would say a charge has to


-- we're not going to bother an employer and require him


to come back with a response unless you haven't just come


in and said, I've been discriminated against.  We're not


going to ask the employer, has this person been

discriminated against?  You tell us the date, the place,


and the circumstances.  Now, that's perfectly reasonable.


But it seems to me also perfectly reasonable to


say, moreover, we're not going to go and bother the


employer and make the employer go through all the process


of -- of answering the charge unless you're serious enough


about it that you've -- you've sworn to it under oath, as


the -- as the statute requires. 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  Well, what happens as a


practical matter where verification occurs after the


filing date is that the employer is usually not required


to actually take any action.


QUESTION:  But here what -- the employer wasn't


even -- wasn't notified until the form -- on the EEOC's


proper form that did everything, including the


verification.  You seem to have treated both the same way,


that -- that all that the imperfect charge did was stop


the clock, but the EEOC didn't give notice to the employer


at that point.  That wasn't the charge -- the form in


which the charge went to the employer.  As I understand


it, the employer never got the form until it had been


perfected. 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  Your Honor, it's our view that


the -- that the court -- that the EEOC erred in not


providing notice at that time, and it's -- I think it's

clear, from a reading of the compliance manual, that its


own manual did require notice at that time.


But in any event --


QUESTION:  And would also require notice of --


of a charge that was imperfect in other respects within 10


days of receiving the charge.  So, if a -- the requirement


that it be in writing, for example, that's a requirement


that isn't -- isn't particularly in the -- in the statute


of limitations provision, but it's a requirement that it


be in writing. 


So, the commission gets a phone complaint from


somebody who says, my employer is discriminating against


me.  Now, you're saying that the commission should within


10 days contact the employer about that. 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  The -- it's our view that --


that if the commission receives a sufficient charge, it


must do so.  The regulations do not contemplate that a


phone call is a sufficient charge, and they specify how it


-- that would have to be put in writing --


QUESTION:  This is all just a matter of the


regulations.  I mean, the commission can -- can just say,


you know, this is sufficient or isn't.  This commission


could say that a phone call is sufficient.


MR. SCHNAPPER:  The -- the statute requires that


a charge be filed, so I think it would have to be reduced

to writing.  But I --


QUESTION:  The word filed. 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  But I would say the commission


probably could alter its -- its regulation and deem a


memorialized phone call the filing of the charge.  That's


-- those aren't the circumstances here. 


And -- and to get back to the specific issue


before the Court, the Fifth Circuit -- excuse me -- the


Fourth Circuit would have reached the same result in this


case regardless of whether this letter -- notice of this


letter or the letter itself had been served on the


employer within 10 days of the receipt of the letter on


November 14th.  The decision below didn't rest on that. 


Even if there had been service and notice, the court of


appeals would still have held the regulation was invalid. 


And -- and it's the validity of that specific regulation


-- that's the only question that the court of appeals


addressed.


QUESTION:  Mr. Schnapper, if you agree that if


-- you started out with Judge Luttig's position.  He


concurred and he raised four other.  Did the EEOC consider


this a charge?  We don't know whether it did.  Wouldn't


the case have to go back so that the full court of appeals


could examine those questions on which Judge Luttig rested


so that he ended up concurring rather than dissenting?

 MR. SCHNAPPER:  Yes.  Yes.  It remains --


QUESTION:  So, you agree that those four


questions are alive and would have to be --


MR. SCHNAPPER:  It -- it remains open to the --


to the respondent to raise those issues on remand, and we


think that that's the appropriate procedure --


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  -- for addressing it.


The -- as I was saying, specifically 706(e)(1)


and 706(b) establish separate and distinct requirements. 


In the terms of Chevron, the question is whether those


provisions, read together, clearly require in an


unambiguous manner that verification happened before the


charge-filing deadline.  We think that -- that such


clarity certainly isn't present here.  To the contrary,


our view is that the most plausible reading of the statute


is that verification could happen after the charge-filing


deadline.  That's a particularly reasonable construction


of the statute because that is the common law rule. 


That's the rule --


QUESTION:  Do you think it's good practice for


the EEOC to wait until after the 300-day period and a


verification before it even notifies the employer?


MR. SCHNAPPER:  No.  No.  It was -- in our view,


it was improper to have done that here, that the -- the

statute doesn't authorize them to await verification.  It


is our understanding that is not their practice.  It is


not authorized by the compliance manual.  The compliance


manual does identify some circumstances in which there


might be delay in -- notification.  Verification is not


one of them. 


QUESTION:  Let me -- suppose you have a


statutory provision which says that the complaint shall be


in writing, sworn to under oath, shall set forth the time,


place, and circumstances of the alleged grievance, comma,


and shall be presented to the agency within 100 days after


the alleged grievance.  Now, would you be taking the same


position you take here, that that's a separate


requirement --


MR. SCHNAPPER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- and that --


MR. SCHNAPPER:  Yes.  We would --


QUESTION:  Do you have any -- any -- I would


never read a statute that way.  It would certainly seem to


me that -- that what they're talking about to be filed


within 100 days is what they have just described.  And --


and --


MR. SCHNAPPER:  I don't --


QUESTION:  Do you have any cases of ours --


MR. SCHNAPPER:  Well --

 QUESTION:  -- that -- that go that far? 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  The Federal rules require that a


notice of appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed


within a certain period of time.  And yet, in Becker v.


Montgomery, the Court concluded that that didn't mean that


an unsigned -- that -- that where the only document that


was filed on time wasn't signed -- that there was no


timely notice of appeal. 


The -- the -- and -- and indeed, the common law


rule was where a statute said a complaint must be verified


and the complaint must be filed within a certain number of


-- of days or years, the -- the uniform Federal and State


interpretation of that was that the lack of verification


could be corrected after the expiration of the deadline.


It seems to us that the commission reasonably


concluded that Congress would have not wanted a more


stringent rule about relation-back of verification to


apply in the administrative process, a process ordinarily


initiated by laymen unassisted by counsel, than would


apply in civil litigation which is much more formal and


which -- and, you know, the -- the common law rule about


correcting verification after the fact applied regardless


of whether, as would normally be the case, the -- the


party involved was represented by counsel.  So, we -- we


think the common law rule is a very important part of the

background of the statute. 


QUESTION:  In these other situations that you


mentioned, does the court take action against a particular


individual or require a response from a particular


individual before the verification occurs?  You see, that


-- that seems to me the difference here, that you're


saying the commission, within 10 days after receiving this


unverified complaint, has to submit it to the employer and


ask the employer to respond to it.


MR. SCHNAPPER:  No.  The -- under the procedure


established by title VII, the employer is not required to


respond just by virtue of getting notice.  Notice simply


alerts them to the filing of the charge.  It is a separate


step in the procedure for the agency to then require the


employer to do anything in response.  It's not like a


complaint which requires an answer within so many days.


QUESTION:  Okay.  I see. 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  It's simply a heads-up. 


QUESTION:  Now, does the agency require


verification to occur before it will demand a response


from the employer? 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  I think that would be the normal


practice. 


QUESTION:  Isn't that what -- the form --


QUESTION:  That makes me feel --

 QUESTION:  -- that EEOC sends out, as you've


described the procedure?  It's called form 5, or whatever


it is -- that they send to the complainant says sign,


verify.  It has everything to make the complaint perfect. 


And that's the form that is then sent to the employer.  In


this very case, that form was sent to the employer, but


the imperfect form wasn't. 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  That's -- that's what occurred


here.  But I'm thinking -- if I didn't make it clear in


response to Justice Scalia's question, it's my


understanding that the normal practice of the agency would


be not to require the employer to do anything until a


defect in form, such as a lack of verification, had been


-- had been addressed.  The statute simply gives the


employer a heads-up, but doesn't -- the notice simply


gives him -- doesn't require the employer to do anything. 


It's not like a complaint. 


QUESTION:  But -- but meanwhile the -- the -- I


mean, this -- this could occur a very long time after the


event occurred --


MR. SCHNAPPER:  I think --


QUESTION:  -- so long as the commission waits


that long to get the verification.  Right? 


MR. SCHNAPPER:  I think not in practice.  My


understanding is that in practice the commission will ask

for a verification.  In fact, frequently they will ask for


a form 5 regardless of whether what's in the -- the


correspondence that reached them.  So, all problems get


solved. 


If you had an employee who refused to verify


with reasonable promptness, I think the agency would


undoubtedly dismiss the -- the charge for lack of


cooperation, and that would be the end of it. 


With the Court's leave, I'd like to reserve the


balance of my time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Schnapper. 


Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MS. BLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Under the longstanding rule at common law, the


failure to verify a complaint, as required by statute, may


be cured by an amendment that relates back to a timely


filed complaint.  The commission incorporated that rule by


regulation in 1966, 2 years after the passage of title


VII.  The contrary rule embraced by the panel would


invalidate even the most detailed and well-pled complaint


that was timely filed with the commission but did not --

was not verified until later. 


The common law rule ensures that substantive


rights are not foreclosed when the essential elements of a


complaint are sufficient to vest the court with


jurisdiction. 


QUESTION:  But -- but in this case, the -- the


agency doesn't treat it as a full charge until it's


verified for purposes of notifying the employer.  The


agency seems to be quite inconsistent. 


MS. BLATT:  Well, that's not --


QUESTION:  I mean, you -- you want us to accept


this argument as to what a charge is, but then you don't


want us to accept it for when the employer has to know


about it so the evidence doesn't go stale. 


MS. BLATT:  It's not that the -- it's not that


the agency is waiting for verification before it gives


notice, and if the only thing missing from a charge is


verification, the agency's procedures require notice


within 10 days.  Thus, the -- if a November -- if a charge


comes in like the November 14th letter that's not


verified, the procedures require notice within 10 days.


That wasn't done here, Justice Kennedy.  The


agency did not comply with its obligation to provide the


employer with notice.  But that in no way affects or


undermines the validity of the relation-back regulation

which doesn't relate to notice.  It relates to whether a


charge is timely filed even though it is not verified. 


Had --


QUESTION:  Well, but -- shouldn't the two be --


be tied together?  I mean, it's reasonable to have it


relate back so long as there is no prejudice to the -- to


the employer from having it relate back.  But when you say


we're not going to give the employer notice until it's


later verified, there is prejudice to the employer. 


Evidence is getting stale and so forth. 


MS. BLATT:  But, Justice Scalia, the -- the


agency's procedures required this employer to have notice,


whether or not the November 14th letter was verified, and


the employer then can preserve its documents or -- or


respond to the charge or do whatever it wants.  The --


QUESTION:  You say that that's a separate


mistake, and whatever prejudice that comes from that the


employer is free to raise on remand.  Is that it? 


MS. BLATT:  Yes.  The issue of notice is what


drove one of the -- the key issues that drove Judge


Luttig's concurrence, which would have upheld the


regulation and the majority's interpretation.  Had the


agency immediately hand-delivered this document to the


employer, we'd still be here because the Fourth Circuit


would invalidate the charge because it wasn't verified

until day 313.


QUESTION:  But you agree with Mr. Schnapper that


the agency just missed, that they should have given -- for


the purpose of giving -- giving notice, sent that


unverified charge to the employer. 


MS. BLATT:  Yes, absolutely.  It was filed with


the agency on receipt, and the -- an employer should have


been notified within 10 days.  And that wasn't done until


later.  And we think the -- this argument would be open on


remand, what the consequences of the -- of the untimely


notice. 


But the untimely notice is a separate question


from an untimely filing of an otherwise sufficient and


valid charge, and this charge was filed within the 300-


day period because it was received by the agency on


November 14th.  And our point is that if the essential


elements of the charge are sufficient to -- to vest the


commission with jurisdiction, the verification could be


supplied later. 


And the rule at common law, which was well


established in both State and Federal courts by 1964,


applied to lawyers in a formal pleading practice and


judicial proceedings, and the commission certainly acted


reasonably in adopting the same rule where Congress


anticipated that the charging parties are often

unrepresented by counsel. 


We don't think anything in the text of title VII


forecloses the commission's regulation.  Section 706(b)


states that a charge must be verified, but it does not


state when verification must occur.  And section 706(e)


states that a charge must be filed within 300 days, but it


doesn't state that the charge must be verified at the time


it is filed. 


QUESTION:  What about the argument that (b)


comes before (e), so -- and to define what a charge is,


the word charge, and then it's given a certain description


in (b).  Then when you get down to (e), it retains that


same description.


MS. BLATT:  Well, title VII didn't define the


word charge as a verified charge.  It just said that it


shall be verified, and certainly those don't -- it's just


the kind of ambiguity that would invoke the common law


rule that the charge -- a later -- a later verification


may relate back to the time of filing.  So, we don't think


anything in this text comes close to trumping what -- what


would be the common law presumption. 


And as Judge Luttig observed, that there's not a


single provision either by its effect or its terms that


suggests that there's a limitations provision for


verification.  There's certainly one for filing and

there's certainly a 10-day notice period for the employer,


but there's not a specific time period when the


verification must occur.  And in the normal course of


business, the agency will try to obtain a standard form


whose signature line contains an affirmation, and so the


verification requirement will be supplied.  And if it's


not, the agency will dismiss that charge and cease its


investigation.  And there's important consequences to that


because the employee will not be able to pursue a claim


for relief if he's not complied with the statutory


requirement of verification.


QUESTION:  Can you tell me what happens -- it's


not this case -- if there's a rule in -- in the circuits


-- I don't think we passed on it.  What happens if there's


a verified complaint?  The complaint is filed with the


EEOC in time.  Then the EEOC just sits on it and notifies


the employer, say, 100 days late.  Does the employer --


must he show prejudice in -- in -- before he can defend on


the ground of late service?  Or how does that work? 


MS. BLATT:  We know of just a handful of cases


where the charge just got lost in the system, and the


consequences of that would turn on two factors.  First,


whether the employer could show prejudice in its ability


to defend the suit, and we think there's a second, a


constitutional question of whether the employee's rights

could be foreclosed because the agency defaulted on its


own statutory obligations.  This Court's decision in Logan


v. Zimmerman Brush would suggest that it cannot.  But I


don't -- you wouldn't even need to get to that issue if


the employer didn't show prejudice. 


This Court in Shell Oil also discussed that the


-- the courts of appeals had been uniform, that absent bad


faith by the agency or prejudice to the employer in


defending his ability to defend the suit, that the


employee's rights would not be prejudiced.


If there are no more questions. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Blatt. 


Mr. Bell, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER W. BELL


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. BELL:  In the Mohasco case, this Court


taught that the EEOC may not adopt regulations that are


inconsistent with the statutory mandate.  As we have held


on prior occasions, its interpretations of the statute


cannot supersede the language chosen by Congress.  And


that's exactly what's happened here. 


The statute in 706(b) says that charges shall be


in writing and under oath.  Next, it's separated by an


and.  The statute goes on and says the statute -- the


charge shall include such information and be in such form


21

as the EEOC requires.


What the EEOC has done here in its regulation is


to say that a charge is sufficient so long as it's in


writing.  That's exactly what the regulation says.  The


text of the -- of the statute is simply inconsistent with


that. 


What the argument of the respondent is, is that


there's no real linkage between 706(b), the use of the


term 706(b), where the charge shall be in writing and


under oath, and 706(e), which specifies that charges shall


be filed within a certain time period.  That's simply not


so. 


If you look at the text of 706(e), it says


charges under this section, not under this subsection.  It


says charges under this section shall be filed within a


certain period of time. 


So, we're not dealing with two independent


statutes here.  We're dealing with two subsections of


exactly the same section of the same statute that are


joined at the hip. 


QUESTION:  Judge -- Judge Luttig said that that


was a very plausible argument.  However, he said it was


not the only plausible reading of these two discrete


pieces of the same statute, and it was permissible for the


agency to take the view that it did.  To prevail here, you

have to show that the position that the agency took was


impermissible rather than as Judge Luttig said it is --


maybe it's not the best choice, but it was a permissible


reading of this less than crystalline statute.


MR. BELL:  Justice Ginsburg, we don't believe


that that is a permissible reading of the statute.  The


language just doesn't work that way.  The first time


Congress mentioned the term charge, which shall be in


writing and under oath, it gave definition to the term. 


Justice Luttig -- Luttig simply didn't carry his analysis


far enough.  I don't think he mentioned, for example, the


fact that 706(e) begins with charges under this section


shall be filed within a certain period of time.  There's


simply no --


QUESTION:  It seems to me that the reading that


you are saying is the only proper reading is somewhat


inconsistent with this Court's position in Becker against


Montgomery last term.


MR. BELL:  Justice Ginsburg, we -- we don't


think so because we think what happened in Becker was a


harmonization of two rules of the Court, with a focus


particularly on rule 11, which -- in the same rule which


established the requirement of -- of the signing,


established the method to cure a failure to sign.  That's


a very important difference here.  In this statute,

there's absolutely no indication of a -- of a intention on


the part of Congress to allow curing the one thing, the


oath and the signing, that they set apart from the


delegation to the agency of authority to control, which


was the form and content.  I mean, just looking at the


structure of the language, they -- they emphasized oath. 


They applied it to commission charges, and they separated


it from the delegation of the authority to specify the


form and content.  In Becker, again the very thing that


established the requirement for signing established the


method of curing it.  That's not true here. 


QUESTION:  I think we heard the argument from


Mr. Schnapper and Ms. Blatt that as a background common


law principle, the idea of a curative amendment to provide


a signature, to provide verification that then relates


back is nothing new.  So that what Congress wrote has to


be read in the light of that background understanding. 


Yes, you must have a verification, but it can come later.


MR. BELL:  Your Honor, I -- I believe that the


background principle, if you will, the background legal


principle of our federalism and the background legal


principle of due process to employers in fairness to


employers in giving notice was probably more a part of the


applicable legal background here -- here than an --


QUESTION:  But that was conceded.  The -- the

commission should have sent the imperfect charge.  The


employer doesn't have to answer it till he gets the


perfected charge.  So, the function of notice is served if


the EEOC had done what it was supposed to do, and now it


concedes that it should have sent that charge.  And the


employer isn't bothered with having to respond until he


gets a perfected charge. 


MR. BELL:  Well, Your Honor, the -- the


regulation here eliminates the filing deadline.  I mean,


there's no time specified when verification must occur,


and there are cases cited in amicus at page 18 of the


Equal Employment Advisory Council where charges have never


been verified.  I mean, there's just no deadline.


QUESTION:  But that's not what anybody is urging


here.  They concede that there must be a verification. 


The question -- as there was in this case.


MR. BELL:  Well, Your Honor, the letter itself


was never verified.  There was a form 5 that was verified.


QUESTION:  No.  The proper -- like an amended


complaint.  You know that people file complaints in court


to get in under the deadline, and then they file an


amended pleading which relates back.  That's standard.


MR. BELL:  There's no indication that Congress


here adopted common law pleading rules.  In fact, the


legislative history makes it pretty clear that Congress

meant to circumscribe the right that they created in title


VII rather narrowly.


QUESTION:  Do you question, Mr. Bell, your


opponents' descriptions of the common law pleading


background that a complaint that was -- was required by


rule to be verified and filed not verified could be


verified later? 


MR. BELL:  There are certainly many cases that


hold that.  There's no question about that.


But -- but here we're dealing with -- with


Congress creating a right that they struck a careful


balance in, and as this Court has said, Congress specified


certain procedures as a compromise and that the best


assurance of administrative fairness is to insist on the


procedures that Congress put out. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Bell, may I ask, going back to


Justice Scalia's questions earlier?  The statute requires


that the charges shall be in writing, under oath or


affirmation, and shall contain such information and be in


such form as the commission requires.  And then later they


prove it, the date, place, and circumstances of the


practice and so forth. 


Supposing the -- a charge is filed that's kind


of a skeleton.  It has -- maybe it doesn't really describe


the place adequately, and the commission says to him, you

have not complied with the requirement giving enough


information.  We require an amendment.  Would the charge


be untimely in your view or would it be -- because it did


not contain all the information the commission required,


and literally the statute requires that. 


MR. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  I don't think the


commission has the power to change the statute of


limitations. 


QUESTION:  So that if they -- if they add a


requirement, more information after there's a filing, they


would also be deciding that the original charge was -- was


untimely. 


MR. BELL:  Well, and in this case, Your Honor,


that's exactly what they did.  I mean, they -- there's no


question that in this case the EEOC did not regard what


had been filed as a charge. 


QUESTION:  And -- and --


MR. BELL:  They kept writing letters to that


effect.  They kept telling the petitioner, you've got to


file, you got to do something. 


QUESTION:  You'd also have to say, Mr. Bell,


that -- that since the complaint or the charge has to be


under the statute in such form as the commission shall


prescribe, you'd also have to say that if -- if the charge


was filed on 9 by 12 paper and the -- and the commission

had prescribed 8 and a half by 12, that it's ineffective. 


Right? 


MR. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think that's what


the statute contemplated.  I think --


QUESTION:  Any little -- any little foot fault


would --


MR. BELL:  Sorry. 


QUESTION:  Any little foot fault would render it


ineffective.  I mean, any -- any --


MR. BELL:  I think that -- that --


QUESTION:  -- any little technical detail that


-- that wasn't exactly as the commission's rules required.


MR. BELL:  If it was required by the commission,


I think that's what the statute says.  Of course, we're


not dealing with a technical detail here. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Bell, wouldn't that be --


wouldn't that be totally inconsistent with what Congress


envisioned?  That is, these complaints with the EEOC were


not going to be filed by lawyers, lawyers who have leeway


to amend under the Federal rules.  These are going to be


filed by lay people who didn't know anything, maybe not


even know what the word verification means, and yet you


think that Congress erected a structure where that initial


complaint had to be more meticulous than what the Federal


rules require a lawyer's pleading to say filed in court?

That would be very odd.


MR. BELL:  The statute -- the statute seems to


indicate that with respect to the -- at least with respect


to the oath and writing requirements.  I mean, there's no


-- if -- if the EEOC can eliminate the oath requirement,


they'll be here next year perhaps eliminating the writing


requirement. 


QUESTION:  It's -- if the question -- here the


question is when not whether.  They're not -- they haven't


eliminated it.  It's a question as it was in Becker.  Yes,


you have to sign the notice of appeal, but you don't have


to do it within the time that the -- the statute of


limitations is running. 


MR. BELL:  But you do have to do it in the


method and in the time set out in rule 11.  There is no


analogous provision in this statute.


QUESTION:  What was filed in the court of


appeals within the time that you had to file the notice


lacked a signature.


MR. BELL:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And that's the same thing that's here


within the 30 -- 300 days.  And then after -- here it was


313 days.  The same thing with the notice of appeal.  The


-- the signature was supplied some days later, but after


the time line.  So, I frankly don't see the difference in

the two. 


MR. BELL:  Well, we see a fundamental difference


between this Court harmonizing rules over which this Court


has control and the Court deciding whether to apply


requirements set out in a statute that Congress used to


create a certain right.


When Congress knew -- when Congress wanted to


authorize a gap --


QUESTION:  You're not asserting that our reading


of our own rules is unreasonable, are you? 


MR. BELL:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Well, but if our reading of our rules


isn't unreasonable and this agency has simply read the


statute the way we read our rules, then I assume that this


agency's reading of the statute is not unreasonable.  And


that's all that Chevron or whatever has replaced Chevron


requires. 


MR. BELL:  Your Honor, there are two reasons we


don't think Chevron is the correct -- Chevron would uphold


this regulation.  Number one, there's -- there's no


delegation of authority to control the writing and -- and


the signing requirement here.  That's clearly separated in


the statute.  When the EEOC wanted to create a gap, it


knew how to do it, and it did it by saying you have the


right to specify the form and content of the rule.  They

didn't do that here. 


Secondly, this isn't a reasonable interpretation


of -- of the statute itself.  It's inconsistent with


ordinary rules of statutory construction.  We think it


really unravels the statutory scheme.  It is -- it


eliminates the time filing requirement -- the timely


filing requirement.  Under the -- under the regulation,


there's simply no deadline for filing a verified


complaint. 


It -- it undercuts again not only the oath


requirement, but the writing requirement.  There's simply


no intellectually honest way to separate an EEOC


regulation that says an oath is technical and can be fixed


after the filing deadline, but a writing is not technical. 


There's no intellectually honest way to do that.  The same


reasoning that supports the petitioner's argument with


respect to oath applies to -- to the writing requirement. 


Finally, we think it undercuts the policy of


conciliation in the statute because, in fact, the -- the


technical regulation -- the -- the Solicitor General in


his brief says -- and this is in the brief in the --


urging the -- the Court to take cert, pages 16 and 17,


that the charges sworn to or affirmed before the employer


is required to take any action -- we don't think we've


misunderstood what the agency's practice is.  It's

certainly been our experience that you don't get a notice


of any kind until you get a verified notice.  That is the


practice in -- that -- that was what happened in this


case.  The -- the Solicitor General, at least in its


earlier briefs, suggested that that was precisely the


practice that they followed here.  So, we think that


ultimately the regulation also undercuts the policy in the


statute for prompt notice to the employer, which again


undercuts the policy of conciliation that's embodied in


the statute. 


QUESTION:  Well, the Government -- the


Government has asserted that that's not the case, and if


that -- if -- I think we have to accept that unless you


have solid evidence to the contrary that -- that in fact


they think the notice is normally given and should have


been given when -- here when the -- when the charge was


received --


MR. BELL:  They have said that today.


QUESTION:  -- even imperfect --


MR. BELL:  I -- I -- and I of course saw


their --


QUESTION:  Well, unless you know for sure that


it's not.  And I agree with you that if -- if that is not


the policy and if -- if they're being inconsistent in


viewing it as a charge for one purpose but not as a charge

for another purpose, then -- then we have a different


problem.  But I don't know that we can decide the case on


-- on the basis of simply your -- your guess that the


judgment -- that the Government may not be accurate in --


in what the policy is. 


MR. BELL:  Well, again, I -- I refer the Court


to the Government's brief in support of amicus of -- sorry


-- of granting the writ, pages 16 and 17.  I would also


urge the Court to look at page 22 of the Government's


brief --


QUESTION:  Mr. Bell, a lawyer representing the


Government made a representation before the Court this


morning that the EEOC should have immediately sent that


charge to the employer.  I think we must take that to be


the Government's position. 


MR. BELL:  That does -- I mean, I'm not arguing


with that.  I'm just pointing out that that seems


inconsistent with what the Solicitor General's earlier


briefing said in this case.  That's the way we read it.


That's the way amicus read the Government's own brief.  We


didn't --


QUESTION:  Well, now it's clarified what its


position is. 


MR. BELL:  I -- I understand. 


The -- if there is a -- a hardship created by

applying the rule, the statute of limitations, it's no


different from the hardship that always occurs when --


when someone falls outside the statute of limitations. 


And this Court's opinion in Zipes exists for a reason, and


that's to give relief if someone, for good cause, making


out a good claim for equitable tolling, does have a basis


for -- for arguing that the statute shouldn't be applied


to him.  This Court has ruled that the timely filing of


the charge is not jurisdictional and, as a consequence, is


subject to equitable tolling.  And courts who have --


which have applied this rule as it's written -- I mean --


sorry -- the statute as it's written have resorted to


equitable tolling when the circumstances suggested that


that was appropriate to do.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bell, this was a deferral case.


This was a 300-day case because the State agency.


MR. BELL:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 


QUESTION:  Do we know whether in this case


anything had been done at the State agency level? 


MR. BELL:  Your Honor, the charge was not sent


to the State until it was put under oath just like it


was --


QUESTION:  Well, that same -- the same formal --


whatever they called it -- form X, when it was sent to the


employer was also sent to the State agency.

 MR. BELL:  That's correct.  After the statutory


deadline.  That was the -- that's the only involvement the


State agency had in this. 


And again, when you fall on the wrong side of a


statute of limitations, it's always going to seem harsh to


you.  But if -- if a limitations is to have any meaning


whatsoever, you need to enforce it. 


QUESTION:  Is the apparent inconsistency between


what the Government says at page 16 of the brief in


support of granting the petition and its representation


here explained by the fact that at page 16 the Government


says the complaint must be -- the charge must be verified


before it requires a response --


MR. BELL:  I --


QUESTION:  -- but then there is another


requirement for simply notifying the employer that the


charge has been made?  It seems to me --


MR. BELL:  The -- the only requirement in the


handbook that we saw -- I mean, the handbook that was


filed -- that we received on Friday does not mention oath


at all.  I mean, we -- we have looked at it and there's no


mention of oath whatsoever.  So, it's -- it's very


difficult to know, you know, the role of the oath playing.


The handbook also says that the only


circumstance where you have to give notice of a charge

prior to the time that -- that the charge is -- is


perfected -- I think is the term that they use -- I mean,


they -- the -- the regulations talk about perfected


charges, charges.  They talk about potential charges.  I


mean, they're really all over the map.  I mean, they -- in


terms of establishing a bright line rule, this is just the


opposite.  They establish a fuzzy line rule in -- in their


regulations.  But the only time, Your Honor, that the --


they mention giving notice of a charge is if it's within


15 days of the expiration of the filing deadline.  That --


that's the only reference I was able to find. 


And it's also quite interesting that in --


QUESTION:  I don't understand that.  I don't


understand what you said. 


MR. BELL:  If --

what it says.  That's the only circumstance I can see.

handbook. 


I think it's also interesting in looking at the


handbook, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Do you have a section of the handbook


where that's --


MR. BELL:  I think it's -- yes, sir.  I think


it's on -- it's in section 2.1.  It looks like on page


915.001, Your Honor, and it's special procedure, title VII


and ADA.  When it is clear --


QUESTION:  That's not a page.  You got to give


me another page.  The page is down the bottom.  2-19, 2-.


MR. BELL:  2-1 --


QUESTION:  2-1?  Let me try that. 


MR. BELL:  -- is what -- what I have.  And it


would be section 2.2(a)(1).  It's what -- what happens


when the EEOC receives a charge by mail.  And as I


understand, it's only when it's within 15 days of the


deadline that they send notice of the charge to the


employer.


Your Honor, I think it's -- or, Your Honors,

it's also significant looking at 2.5(a)(3) of this


handbook on amending charges, that the agency's own manual


mentions nothing about amending to add verification. 


Nothing.  They talk about amending to cure the common law


sort of problem, Justice Ginsburg, not the -- not the


oath --


QUESTION:  What you have just said suggests that


this compliance manual is -- is in need of amendment, but


the compliance manual, unlike the regulation that we have,


is not something that gets Chevron deference.  This has


not gone through any kind of notice and comment --


MR. BELL:  I understand, and this -- of course,


this regulation was not passed with notice and comment


rulemaking either, which under the Mead decision gives it


less weight than it might have if -- if the regulation --


QUESTION:  I thought the Congress authorized the


EEOC to make procedural rules, didn't it? 


MR. BELL:  They did. 


QUESTION:  And that's what these are.  This --


the relation-back rule.


MR. BELL:  Your Honor, I suppose we -- lawyers


could differ on whether it's a procedural or substantive


rule.  Whether it's procedural or substantive, it changed


the -- it changes --


QUESTION:  Well, what would you call rule 15(c)

of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure?  15(c) of the


Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.


MR. BELL:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Is that a rule of procedure?  The


relation-back rule?


MR. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor, it is. 


QUESTION:  Well, I'm not sure that Mead -- does


-- I don't -- does Mead say that -- that even rules


adopted without notice and comment are entitled to Chevron


deference so long as they were authorized?  I mean, I


thought all rules had to authorized whether they do notice


and comment or not.  What difference does it make whether


the statute authorizes the -- the issuance of these


procedural rules?  You make the point that they weren't


adopted by notice and comment, which is what Mead says is


the only really safe harbor.  So, they were authorized.  I


mean, all rules have to be authorized.  I mean, that's --


that's the starting point, isn't it? 


MR. BELL:  Well, and -- and one of the problems


with this rule is that there's no delegation of authority


to the agency to define the term charge, which is, in


essence, what they've done.  And they've defined it as


something other than what -- what Congress has said, which


is something that's in oath -- under oath and in writing. 


That's the problem.  Again -- and I agree it doesn't make

any difference what procedure is used if they've -- if


they've overstepped the bounds and have interpreted the


statute in a way that's inconsistent with what the


statutory language requires.  That's what we think they've


done here. 


Again, the EEOC itself did not view what was


filed as a charge under their own regulations, under --


under the statute that it exists.  I think that -- that is


significant. 


The EEOC doesn't need to change the statute in


order to help claimants.  They can follow the statute and


tell claimants, you need to put your complaint in -- in


writing and you need to put it under oath.  All we're


talking about is a declaration.  The EEOC's failure to do


that, which apparently they do fail to do, should not be


laid at the door of the respondent. 


And again, equitable tolling is available under


Zipes anytime an unfair result is reached.  And that --


that's the way these problems should be solved. 


But just because equitable tolling is


appropriate in some cases does not mean this Court should


grant the EEOC the right to pass basically a prophylactic


rule that -- that says --


QUESTION:  But how would you distinguish from


the point of view of the claimant who is filing the

original charge, sends a letter, as here, and then the


EEOC, if it were super-efficient, would have gotten out


the form in good time? 


MR. BELL:  It did in this case, Your Honor. 


This man had the form within the 300 days.  He's the one


who sat on it. 


QUESTION:  How many days did he have left?


MR. BELL:  He had it for approximately a month,


at least 3 weeks.

Mr. Schnapper, you have 5 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SCHNAPPER:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


The compliance manual in this case squarely


supports the representation that the Government has made


today with regard to its practice.  The relevant provision


is at the bottom of page 2-1.  It is section 2.2(b), and


it states, when the correspondence contains all the


information necessary to begin investigating -- which is


clearly true here -- constitutes a clear and timely


request for EEOC to act, and does not express concerns


about confidentiality or retaliation, acknowledge the


correspondence by using a form letter, and -- and serve a


copy of the document on the respondent.

 Now, the absence of any reference to


verification is critical.  It is simply not a prerequisite


to this command to agency officials.  The manual is


crystal clear and entirely consistent with what the


Government has said. 


In addition, there are cases in which the


Government with the EEOC has indeed served --


QUESTION:  -- manual say about verification,


later verification?


MR. SCHNAPPER:  I don't believe the manual


addresses it.  It is not relevant to the commands of the


manual as to when service is to --


QUESTION:  Well, one -- one might infer that


then that post-filing verification is not authorized.


MR. SCHNAPPER:  It's expressly authorized by the


regulation in this case.  I mean, I don't know that the


manual reiterates what's in the regulation.  The


regulation is crystal clear.  There's not a dispute here


as to what -- whether the regulation authorized this --


this particular practice. 


There are, indeed, cases in which the EEOC has


served nonverified charges.  You'll find examples of that


in the Philburn and Price cases which are mentioned in the


cert petition. 


With regard to the applicability of Chevron, we

are in agreement with Justice Scalia that the presence or


absence of notice and comment rulemaking is not relevant. 


If that were critical, then Chevron deference wouldn't


apply to most procedural regulations which don't require


notice and comment rulemaking.  That would surely stand


everything on its head.  Justice O'Connor correctly


pointed out in the Commercial Office Products case that


deference to procedural interpretations by an agency are


particularly appropriate. 


In addition, it in fact happened that there was


notice and comment rulemaking in this case with regard to


these regulations in 1977.  The cites to that are in the


amicus brief filed by the EEAC.


The question here, as Justice Ginsburg noted, is


not whether a charge has to be verified but when.  The --


the statutory language is not clear.  It could reasonably


have been read by the agency to require verification prior


to the applicable deadline.  If the agency had written


that regulation, it would have properly have to have been


upheld under Chevron.  But the -- the statutory language


was ambiguous, and this is precisely the circumstance


under which, under Chevron, the resolution of that matter


should be left to the agency.


Thank you.
