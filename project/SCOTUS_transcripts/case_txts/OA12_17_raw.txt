 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

 this morning first in Case 12-17, McBurney v. Young.

 Mr. Gupta? 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. GUPTA:  Thank you, and may it please the 

 Court:

 All 50 States have public records laws.  47 

 of those States make access available to residents and 

 nonresidents on equal terms.  Virginia, by contrast, 

 enforces a discriminatory access policy, and, because 

 commercial requesters make up the vast majority of

 records requesters, out-of-State businesses bear the 

 brunt of Virginia's policy. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  When -- when was the first 

 of those laws enacted?  Do you know?  I think it's -- I 

 think it's in my adult lifetime that Florida was the

 first to enact a sunshine law.  Is that -- am I correct 

 about that? 

 MR. GUPTA:  That's right.  All of these 

 laws -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  In the '60s.

 that -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you say that's a

 fundamental -- that's a fundamental right covered by 

 Privileges and Immunities Clause, which nobody had until 

 the 1960s? 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well, to be clear, the modern 

 transparency laws are new, but they sit on top of

 well-established common-law right -- rights to access 

 that are based, not on modern notions of transparency, 

 but on the right to secure property and other basic 

 interests -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But those -- those rights

 still exist in this State, don't they?  Cannot you get 

 records of deeds and whatever the common law would have 

 covered? 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well, it's true that -- that 

 Virginia's law exempts deeds from its Freedom of

 Information law, but, if I understand their position 

 correctly, they would be entitled, as a constitutional 

 matter, under their theory, to preclude people from 

 other States from accessing even deeds. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I'll ask them -- I

 didn't understand that to be their position, but -- but

 I guess we can ask them.

 is in the business of gathering property records for his 

 clients.  Now, it's true that, in Virginia, he could get

 the deed, but what he can't get and what he principally 

 gathers for his clients are real estate tax assessment 

 records, and those are a much richer storehouse of 

 property-related information than simply the deed. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you -- can you

 explain that business a little more fully than you did 

 in the briefs?  He's in the business of collecting 

 records from all the States about tax assessments. 

 MR. GUPTA:  That's right. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And he -- and he does

 that for a client who could very well ask himself.  So 

 what is the service that's being performed? 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well, he -- you know, he doesn't 

 just do the routine request.  The -- the large data 

 companies are the ones who hire him.  And they -- if

 they're routine requests, they can do them themselves; 

 although if they're not based in Virginia, they would 

 still have to hire a Virginian to do it. 

 But they bring him in when there's some flaw 

 in the -- the routine process where the -- the State is

 being recalcitrant or the local official is being 

5

 recalcitrant.  And he's an expert in being able to  gather

 knowing what he's allowed to do and what he's not 

 allowed to do.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All -- all he has to 

 do is get somebody from -- from Virginia to ask for him, 

 right? 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well, he could hire someone from 

 Virginia to do that, but that's -- you know, that's sort

 of precisely what the -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you don't 

 have to pay the person too much, he just has to write a 

 letter saying, give me these documents, right? 

 MR. GUPTA:  He would still have to hire

 someone, and that would be an increased cost.  And -- for 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, an increased 

 cost of -- I don't know how much -- 100 bucks, right? 

 Go -- write a letter, say you want these documents, and, 

 when they come to your house, give them to me.

 MR. GUPTA:  Yeah.  For the large data 

 companies -- you know, they will hire someone other than 

 him to perform this service.  They will -- if you're 

 talking about routine requests.  But even -- you know, 

 even for them, if you're talking about a -- a request

 that isn't routine, if he has to do something further to 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 enforce the rights, he's going to have to do that in his  own

 other than him, someone based in Virginia, to do that 

 for them.  And then he will lose that business.

 So the lower you go down in the food chain 

 of the data industry, the bigger the effect of 

 Virginia's policy. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How much -- how much of 

 an impact, in fact, does it have on his business?  I

 mean, there are 47 States who will provide this 

 information. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well, for -- for him, in the 

 Virginia market, it completely forecloses him from doing 

 access -- business in the Virginia market.

 And, if other States were to have policies 

 like this, he wouldn't be able to do business in those 

 States as well.  So if -- if the focus is on him and his 

 business in Virginia, it completely cuts him off. 

 If the focus is on -- on what the effect is

 in the aggregate, on the market as a whole, because most 

 public records requests are commercial requests, it's 

 going to have an effect on most commercial requesters 

 who are out-of-State.  And -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Gupta, I -- I

 understand that the -- the reasoning of Virginia in not 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 allowing out-of-State people to -- to get these FOIA  requests 

2  is the following:  That the purpose of these -­

 these laws -- and I remember it when the first ones were 

 enacted -- government in the sunshine.  The purpose of

 it was not to enable people to get information, per se; 

 it was to enable people to see how their government is 

 working, so that they could attend to any malfeasance 

 that is occurring in the process of government. 

 It seems to me entirely in accord with that

 purpose of these laws to say it's only Virginia citizens 

 who -- who are concerned about the functioning of 

 Virginia government and ought to be able to get whatever 

 records Virginia agencies have. 

 What's -- what's wrong with that reasoning?

 MR. GUPTA:  A few responses, Justice Scalia. 

 First, transparency was one purpose, but, as 

 I said, these laws also carried forward the much more 

 longstanding rights to access based on personal 

 interests and property interests.  Also, even at the

 time that these laws were enacted -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but you don't need 

 any personal or property interest under these laws.  You 

 can just -- just out of curiosity, if you -- if you were a 

 Virginian, at least, in Virginia, even though you have

 no interest in the matter at all, you can ask the agency 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

 for records about this or that. 

            

It -- it can't be

 traditional property interest.  It's based on the 

 ability of the citizens of the State to find out what

 the -- what the government of the State is up to. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Even -- even at the time that 

 these laws were enacted in the -- in the '60s, it was 

 well-understood that they were going to have a big 

 commercial impact.  The property records industry was in

 full swing by the end of the late 19th Century. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the point is that 

 FOIA is tied to, as Justice Scalia said, the citizens 

 should know what their government is doing.  And you 

 don't have to give any reason at all, if you were a part

 of that political community.  Now, Virginia doesn't 

 allow people from out-of-State to vote.  They're not 

 part of Virginia's political community. 

 So why isn't this -- if you're not part of 

 the political community, then you don't fall under FOIA,

 which is a peculiar statute, in that everybody who is 

 covered by it can get whatever they want, and they don't 

 have to give any reason for it. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Right.  Well, elections just 

 simply don't work if you -- if you allow noncitizens to

 participate in elections or if you can't wall off the 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 State in that respect.  But what the State can't say is, 

2  simply because one purpose of this law is that we want

 to constitute ourselves as a political community, that 

 we can exclude activities that have a big commercial

 effect. 

 And -- you know, when we're looking under 

 the Dormant Commerce Clause or under the Privileges and 

 Immunities Clause, this Court's cases have said 

 repeatedly you don't look to uncover the original

 legislative purpose, you look to whether there is 

 discrimination, which there is here, on its face, and 

 you look to whether there is a discriminatory effect. 

 One example of how this policy is actually 

 being -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And is the only thing that's 

 necessary -- excuse me -- is the only thing that's 

 necessary that the law affect a few people commercially? 

 I mean, how much -- how many of the requesters have to 

 be engaged in some kind of commercial activity in order

 for your arguments to work? 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well, what this Court has said 

 is that there is no de minimis exception, if there's 

 discrimination against commerce, but, here, what's going 

 on is anything, but de minimis.  Virginia does not deny

 that the -- the vast majority of the requesters are 

10

 commercial requesters -- the vast majority of  out-of-State 

2  requesters are commercial requesters.

 Their -- the amicus brief supporting their 

 side, the Local Government Attorneys of Virginia amicus

 brief, at page 30, explains the way this policy -­

 policy is being implemented, is that noncommercial 

 requests are typically honored, but out-of-State 

 requests by data miners are being categorically denied 

 under the policy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But this -- this is 

 not -- this is not a regulation of commerce.  It's a 

 State practice that may have an incidental effect on 

 commerce, and the incidental effect may be 

 disproportionate, depending upon whether you're State or

 local, but it's not a regulation of commerce. 

 MR. GUPTA:  But that's -- that was the 

 Fourth Circuit's theory, and I think incidental can mean 

 a few different things, and I think in -- in their 

 opinion, it -- it does mean at least three different

 things.  So maybe it would be helpful if I try to unpack 

 that. 

 If it means incidental in terms of the 

 effect on my client's business, I think, as I've 

 explained, it's anything, but incidental; it completely

 forecloses him from the market.  If it means incidental 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 in terms of the -- the aggregate effect of this statute,

 of -- of affected parties under this policy are 

 out-of-State commercial requesters, particularly data

 companies. 

 And -- you know, if it means incidental 

 compared to the purpose of the statute, as I've said, 

 transparency was one purpose of the modern FOIA laws, 

 but they also subsumed and sit on top of all of the

 longstanding rights of public access that have been 

 around since the -- the first settlements in the United 

 States -- or before the United States, when, in order to 

 have a functioning property system, we recognized that 

 you've got to have records of who owns what and -- and

 those records have to be made available to anyone in 

 order to exercise property rights. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the State of 

 Virginia says, as a policy, we want to help Virginia 

 businesses, and so we're going to open a business

 training, best practices institute, where you're going 

 to learn how to be a better business person, but the 

 only people who can come in are -- are Virginia 

 businesses. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under your theory, 

12

 because that will have an effect -- an incidental effect  on

 that unconstitutional? 

 MR. GUPTA:  I don't think so.  And there are

 a couple of distinctions. 

 First, that's not something that the State 

 exclusively is able to provide.  It's not like the 

 courthouse or the public archives across the street or 

 the road that runs between them that only the -- the

 State is able to provide. 

 Anyone can provide a business training 

 institute, so the State is just one player among many. 

 Also -- running a 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that -- that just goes

 to the extent of the impact, not -- not on the 

 principle.  And you say extent doesn't matter.  You say 

 there's no such thing as a de minimis exception. 

 MR. GUPTA:  No -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that -- that explanation

 doesn't -- doesn't seem, to me, to hold water. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well, maybe I didn't explain it 

 very well.  To be clear, I think it's more than just a 

 difference in degree; it's a difference in kind.  These 

 are fundamentally different when -- when you're talking

 about running the courthouse or running the public

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what?  So what?  Except 

 to the extent that that bears upon how much of a -- an 

 imposition this is upon interstate commerce.  It seems, 

 to me, that's the only relevance of that point. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and you dismiss that 

 relevance.  You say it doesn't matter how extensive the 

 impact is on -- on interstate commerce. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well, to the extent that you -­

 you think it does matter, I mean, that -- that

 distinction doesn't matter in this case because the 

 impact is -- is great.  The principal impact is an 

 impact on out-of-State commerce. 

 But let me -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that -- when

 you're talking about impact, is that a Pike analysis?

 in -- in the dormant Commerce Clause, this would be the 

 per se rule of invalidity.  You have facial 

 discrimination.  The -- the -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought, if

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought a question

 of talking about the effects on interstate commerce, 

 that's the -- you know, the Pike analysis. 

 MR. GUPTA:  No.  What this Court has said is 

 that -- that the first -- sort of first-tier scrutiny, 

 the per se rule is -- is for cases where there's

 discrimination on its face or discrimination in effect. 

 And then you've got this other category for the -- the 

 Pike analysis, where the State regulates evenhandedly. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's your closest case 

 in support of the proposition that this is impermissible

 as a discrimination against interstate commerce?  What's 

 your best case? 

 MR. GUPTA:  When you say, "this," you mean 

 the -- that public records access is commerce? 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If -- if you -- you are

 arguing, as one of your arguments here, that this is

 understand your argument, what is the best case you have

 interstate commerce, that's, indisputably, interstate 

 commerce.  So we -­

 MR. GUPTA:  That -- that's right. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what is your best 

 case to show that this is discriminatory in violation of 

 our precedence?

 there's discrimination on its face, so I take your 

 question to be asking -- you know, what about the 

 commerce aspect?  And in Reno v. Condon -­

 more broadly and affected both commerce and 

 non-commerce.  But this Court said that -- you know, you

 had facial discrimination against commerce because there 

 were people operating these summer camps, and they were 

 treated differently -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll look at those.  But I 

 think the Commerce Clause, basically, has, as its

 objective, insofar as it's dormant, to prevent a 

 legislature or decisionmaker within its State 

 discriminating in favor of their own State producers. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Right. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, it's pretty hard for

 me to put this case into that mold. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well, I mean, one -- you know, 

 one piece of evidence, Justice Breyer, is the media 

 exception to the Virginia statute.  It -- this -- this 

 makes it clear that Virginia was aware that people who

 were requesting information for commercial purposes were 

 going to use this statute and they exempted the press -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's just Virginia media, 

 though, isn't it?  Isn't it only media that -­

 MR. GUPTA:  That's right, Justice Scalia.

MR. GUPTA:  That's right.  So it's -­

 it's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's consistent 

 with their purpose, that this statute is meant to assure 

 good, honest government in Virginia. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well, if this is a statute, it's 

 a pretty unusual statute that discriminates among

 newspapers, so it says -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If it does what the -- I 

 had exactly the same question for both parts of your 

 argument, that what it's their -- am I right in thinking 

 that anyone can get any information -- anyone in any

 State can get any information that pertains to him or 

 her?  Is that right or not? 

 MR. GUPTA:  There is a separate Virginia -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right or not? 

 MR. GUPTA:  Yes.  There is a

 separate Virginia statute that allows this. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  That's what I wanted 

 to know, whether it's separate or not. 

 MR. GUPTA:  That's right. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Anyone from Alaska to

 Hawaii can get any information that pertains to him or 

19
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 her. 

            

Second, that this has nothing to do with 

 judicial records, there is a different statute that 

 makes judicial records public. 

 MR. GUPTA:  That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So we're, now, 

 talking about the class of information, other than the 

 two classes I've mentioned. 

 And I then ended up -- and I'd like you to 

 add something to this, if you can, that, really, this is

 about -- since getting information involves usually a 

 benefit to the recipient, but, sometimes, harm to the 

 person the information is about, that willing to run 

 that harm and risk of harm is the interest in State good 

 government, okay?

 MR. GUPTA:  Uh-huh. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, if that's the 

 interest, that's an interest that probably a State has 

 the right, just as it has the right to say other people 

 can't vote in State elections, if that's the interest,

 then I guess it could take reasonable measures related 

 to that interest. 

 All right.  Now, that is the -- the argument 

 or the position that I would appreciate your addressing. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Sure.  You know, that -- we

 reasonably furthered by the statute.  And, here, you 

 have a resource that is not finite, and the statute

 allows the State to recoup its expenses. 

 So nothing is lost to Virginians.  There 

 isn't any loss in transparency to Virginians by 

 extending access to out-of-State data companies. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if it costs for

 Virginia -- Virginia has to take care of its own, and, 

 if it has to service FOIA requests from all over, it's 

 going to cost the State.  It's going to have to hire 

 people to do this.  They're going to have to spend many 

 hours going through these records, so the State

 doesn't -- it wants to conserve its resources for its 

 own people. 

 MR. GUPTA:  But -- but there's no loss in 

 resources, Justice Ginsburg, because the statute allows 

 Virginia to fully recoup any administrative expenses.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm having -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they -- but they just 

 don't want out -- they -- they don't want outlanders 

 mucking around in -- in Virginia government.  It's 

 perfectly okay for good old Virginians to do that, but

 they don't want outlanders to do it.  Why -- why is that

 their interest.  But you've got to see whether the 

 policy serves -- serves -- you know, the interest,

 and -- and this is a statute that is supposed to promote 

 transparency.  It actually makes it less transparent. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm -- I -­

 there is underlying your argument a sort of fundamental 

 belief that you are entitled to relief -- pardon the

 alliteration -- simply because the statute discriminates 

 between citizens and noncitizens.  Is that your 

 position? 

 MR. GUPTA:  No, not at all, I mean -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if it's not, what are

 the two rights that you -- or what rights are it that 

 you're claiming have been violated?  You say privileges 

 and immunities.  What's the privilege or immunity? 

 MR. GUPTA:  It's the privilege or immunity 

 of pursuing a common calling across State borders.  So

 there's no dispute here that Mr. Hurlbert's common 

 calling is -- is gathering data.  In fact, those are the 

 principal users of public records laws. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So is this -- is this an

 as-applied challenge with respect to Mr. Hurlbert's 

 common calling.  There's no -- there's no dispute that 

 that is his common calling and that this law has the 

 effect of completely cutting him off from pursuing his

 common calling in the Virginia market and that 47 other 

 States -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then you would be doing 

 something very strange with this statute because you 

 would be saying Hurlbert has a right to this because

 it's his business.  But the statute, the character of 

 this statute is it doesn't matter what you want the 

 information for. 

 But you're saying the out-of -- the 

 in-Stater, it doesn't matter.  Out-of-Stater, is it your

 argument that, if this out-of-Stater has a good reason 

 for getting this and it's related to the out-of-State's 

 business, so you -- you're changing the character of a 

 FOIA statute, which is it doesn't matter what you want 

 it for.

 MR. GUPTA:  Right.  I mean, you would -- you

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm having a

 problem, and then I think it's Justice Ginsburg's 

 problem, which is, absent the statute, he can't demand 

 that Virginia provide him with this information because 

 that's how he wants to work, correct? 

 So what's the added value that gives him a

 right to demand it merely because a statute exists?  He 

 doesn't have a right to the information. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Well, he's -- all he's asking 

 for is information that's available in the public 

 archives on equal terms with Virginians.  In the same

 way that -- that someone who -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  He -- he has a very 

 reasonable request in my view, but the question isn't 

 the reasonableness of his request.  The question's -­

 you know, whether they can do it.  And the -- the way -­

the work -- the thing that's bothering me on the work 

 part is this:  It seems that the work is sort of 

 tailored to the statute. 

 It's in this way.  I -- I have a job, and my 

 job is to study election processes.  And I write

 reports, and I find amazing things about differences 

24

 lot if I was actually a voter in each of these States. 

 That would help my job.  It would lend authenticity, and

 I could learn things that I probably couldn't learn 

 otherwise. 

 Now, does that add anything to the argument? 

 I mean, I don't think so, but it sounds a little bit 

 like you're making that kind of argument -­

MR. GUPTA:  No. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and -- and they either 

 do have the right or they don't.  And I don't know that 

 it helps that I -- that I say, well, I really want it 

 for my work.

 MR. GUPTA:  Right.  But this is -- this is a 

 profession that has existed since the founding era.  I 

 mean, we've -- you know, we've cited cases in our 

 opening brief of -- of people hiring professionals to 

 search the records for them before engaging in property

 transactions.  By the late 19th Century, you had an 

 enormous industry that was designed to do this. 

 So this isn't -- Mr. Hurlbert isn't someone 

 who's making up some profession.  He's part of a very 

 large industry that has done this for a very long time.

 And that industry, yes, like lawyers depend on 

25

 archives building?  Can they bar the doors to the 

 property records?  So there's no -- I don't see any 

 distinction in kind -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is this -- is this 

 your Privileges and Immunities argument or your dormant 

 Commerce Clause argument? 

 MR. GUPTA:  You know, I think the logic of 

 both arguments are similar, but I think it, most

 clearly, is illustrated in the Privileges and Immunities 

 context where -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So then it's not 

 enough that this is a big deal to your client.  It has 

 to be something that is essential to hold the country

 together as a national unit.  And it seems, to me, it's

 all, Justice -- Chief Justice.  The -- the aggregators

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but, see, 

 they're just to get into those.  Again, I think a lot of

 those examples you -- you do have access under other 

 statutes.  You're talking about mortgage rules and all 

 that.  Aren't those all -­

 MR. GUPTA:  No, no.  Not to this kind of 

 information.  The -- the information that Mr. Hurlbert

 is gathering, tax assessment information, is essential 

 to -- to mortgage origination and credit reporting.  The 

 people who hire him are large data companies, and the -­

 the data industry brief explains the uses of this 

 information.

 That -- that information is essential to 

 these activities.  And Virginia, virtually alone among 

 the States, is -- is erecting this barrier to access 

 that market and reserving the right to access that 

 market to only people who live in the State.

 And -- and -- you know, this would be no 

 different if it were just talking about the archives 

 that -- that include all the information that the -­

 yes, it's true that Virginia has exempted of the title 

 itself, but I don't see that the logic of their position

 tease out what your claim is.  Let's suppose Virginia 

 passes a statute that says, We'll let nonresidents have

 access, but they have to pay all the costs. 

 Nonresidents don't. 

 Would that satisfy you as valid? 

 MR. GUPTA:  I think that would be a closer 

 question, but I think that presents some problems as

 well.  I mean, so, in your hypothetical, it's free to 

 the citizens of the State, but they're just passing the 

 cost on to out-of-Staters. 

 And -- you know, this -- this Court, in 

 cases like Toomer and Mullaney, have said that at

 least -- you know, where the State can show that the 

 nonresidents pose some unique evil, that the -- the 

 State is entitled to pass the costs on. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why isn't it just -- you 

 just being costs them more?

 MR. GUPTA:  Right. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That was Justice 

 Ginsburg's point, which is every time you've put in a 

 request, you're costing them more money. 

 MR. GUPTA:  Right.  But -- but that would be

 discriminating against non as -- noncitizens solely

 because they're noncitizens.  So, if there's some  particular

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, why?  You were

 MR. GUPTA:  Right.  Well, that's -- that's 

 precisely the rationale that -- that in 

 Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Barnard v. 

 Thorstenn, this Court rejected.  This -- the Virgin 

 Islands wanted to say if we open up our bar to people

 from all over the country, it's going to increase the 

 administrative resources.  And this Court said, no, 

 that's not a good enough reason.  That's just 

 discriminating on the basis of citizenship. 

 But if, for example, the State could show

 that there was -- you know, there were shipping costs 

 that were uniquely posed by nonresidents and they wanted 

 to assess a $5 shipping fee for all nonresidents, that 

 might be permissible. 

 And, if there are no further questions, I'd

 like to reserve my time. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARLE DUNCAN GETCHELL, JR., 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. GETCHELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 please the Court: 

            

The -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure how you 

 save administrative costs under this statute.  They 

 could go to any Virginia resident, it's not illegal, and

 probably will, it'll cost them something more, but not 

 you, and get the very same information. 

 So how do you justify this discrimination? 

 Because it's so easily -- the administrative cost is 

 going to be imposed anyway.

 MR. GETCHELL:  I would -- would suggest that 

 the purpose of the statute, which is political, not 

 commercial, left the State with the position that it was 

 going to subsidize with tax dollars this function 

 because we can't recover our overhead; we can over -­

only recover the actual cost. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you want to give more 

 businesses to Virginia citizens who will now charge 

 out-of-State residents money to process their FOIA 

 requests?

 MR. GETCHELL:  No, Your Honor.  I don't 

 think anybody was thinking about businesses of any sort. 

 I think they were saying that we have a political 

 hygiene statute.  They were very much the fad.  It

 And I do want to -- want to repel the notion 

 that there is even substantial discrimination in this

 case because Mr. Hurlbert, in his admission that this is 

 an as-applied challenge, has a difficulty with 

 substantial equality of access, because it turns out 

 that Mr. Hurlbert, in his reply brief, when he teed up 

 the 1786 statute, which does give access -- did give

 access, he focused his argument on that statute. 

 And if you run that statute, you will find 

 that between 1830 -- 1813 and 1840, that you did not 

 have general access.  They went back to having to show a 

 particular interest.  But that -- from 1840, '41 until

 today, through the codes of 1819 and -- and up until the 

 present code, Section 17.1208, he has the right of 

 access to tax assessment records. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the -- if I 

 understood your answer to Justice Sotomayor, the only

 reason you don't let out-of-Staters get these records is 

 because of the added overhead costs? 

 MR. GETCHELL:  No, Your Honor.  It's just 

 not part of the interests the State was trying to serve. 

 The State -­

 big a deal.  It doesn't seem like that big a deal for 

 you either.  If you can recoup overhead costs from

 people who request -- and I'd assume you would be able

 Virginia may have interest in how Virginia government 

 operates, too. 

 And -- and, again, if -- what cost is there to

 you, other than overhead?  You don't want to keep how 

 Virginia government operates quiet from outsiders when 

 you let in -- its citizens get the access, do you?

 MR. GETCHELL:  I cannot, Your Honor.

 overhead.  I cannot -­

 citizens who are going to ask for it.  This is not an

 MR. GETCHELL:  In -- in fact, the State of 

 Virginia has made the policy decision to give this

 information to its citizens and not to inquire behind it 

 to see whether or not somebody's doing it for an 

 out-of-Stater.  And not -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or even for commercial 

 purposes.  Don't you think if -- if those who created

 these government in the sunshine laws could have drafted 

 them in such a way that inquiries for commercial 

 purposes would not be allowed, but only those inquiries 

 that are intended to look into the workings of State 

 government and produce government in the sunshine, don't

 you think that they probably would have excluded 

 commercial inquiries, if they could? 

 But you can't tell which ones are commercial 

 and which aren't. 

 MR. GETCHELL:  And we don't -- and we don't

 try.  We have a policy decision that we want to have a 

 very simple system that allows our citizens to make 

 inquiries without a demonstrated need or cause because 

 we want there to be sunshine. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's no more

 complicated a system if you let out-of-Staters have 

35
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 access, too.  You say we want a simple system.  It's  going to

 MR. GETCHELL:  The thing that is of -- of 

 great concern -- why do we care, why do we bother -- is

 the principle that when a government is providing a 

 taxpayer-subsidized service of recent origin to its 

 citizens, that it does not have to explain its choice, 

 either under the Privileges and Immunities Clause or 

 under the Dormant Commerce Clause.

 It is very important that we not find 

 ourselves with lawsuits that say, "services."  Voluntary 

 services are, in fact, things that, now, have to be 

 justified under those two provisions of the 

 Constitution.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that -- that's where 

 he comes in with his argument because I -- I agree, you 

 can -- you don't have -- let's say the most fabulous 

 reason for doing this, but you have a reason. 

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And so the question is, 

 does it have to be better than that?  And -- and they 

 are saying yes.  And, as I heard it, this -- what I 

 would characterize as a strong argument -- this sort of, 

 first of all, strikes me as a stronger argument, is

 that, look, if we go back into history, out-of-State 

36
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 real estate people could always get information about

 buy it. 

 Now, you've protected that.  But, in today's

 world, it's important that we get statistics about this, 

 too, because our economy is national.  If we understand 

 how States are taxing their real estate, we will know to 

 what extent they increase the value, to what extent they 

 increase the rate, to what extent they really get the

 money they are supposed to, to what extent they might 

 get money or not get money in the future. 

 And all of those things are nationally 

 important, so that people can put them together and 

 make -- better than we have done in the past -­

predictions about what is likely to happen to States 

 and, hence, the national economy.  All right. 

 That's -- that's the kind of argument he's 

 making.  And he says, so, therefore, there is a national 

 interest in the flow of this information.  And that

 means you have to have a better than "uh-huh" kind of 

 rationale.  That's -- that's what he's saying, I think. 

 MR. GETCHELL:  But it's very difficult for 

 Mr. Hurlbert to make that fairly expansive argument 

 because it turns out -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, to be fair, I -- I 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 was sort of expanding it. 

            

(Laughter.) 

 MR. GETCHELL:  But, in point of fact, 

 because he is entitled to the tax assessment data in the 

 clerk's office, in the case of Henrico County, where he

 went, you go in the same building and -- if you're 

 Mr. Hurlbert, you turn in one direction, you go to the 

 clerk's office. 

 And, if somebody in Virginia and wants to -­

 for whatever reason, get it from the tax assessor's

 book, instead of from the clerk's book, you turn in the 

 other direction. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you don't deny that, in 

 general, this does affect out-of-State data collectors, 

 people who are engaged in the kind of business that

 Justice Breyer was talking about, is that right? 

 MR. GETCHELL:  I have no idea in this record 

 because we were on summary judgment -- cross motions for 

 summary judgment, and the district court and the court of 

 appeals, both in our judgment, correctly ruled that

 there's a two -- two-step inquiry. 

 And the first step is whether or not 

 there is a fundamental right.  And in the absence

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He claims that the 

 dormant Commerce Clause has been effected because he

 reads this statute as saying only Virginia recording 

 companies have access; out-of-State can't.  And it's a 

 fair reading of the statute.  It only permits Virginia 

 residents, which include commercial and noncommercial, 

 to access the information.

 So assume, hypothetically, that the statute 

 reads "only Virginia commercial businesses have access 

 to this information" -­

 MR. GETCHELL:  If -- if, in fact, you want 

 to rewrite the statute to -- subject to -- it to attack,

 obviously, that would then raise questions about a 

 nongovernmental protectionist intent, but that's not the 

 way this statute was written.  It's not how it was 

 crafted.  It -- it has nothing to do with commerce. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's the

 question I'm -- I'm raising the best argument for your 

 adversary, okay? 

 MR. GETCHELL:  Right. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because we could call it 

 a direct -- he calls it direct discrimination because

 commercial businesses are being permitted in Virginia, 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 but not noncommercial.  You say it's indirect.  How do  we

 bottom-line consequence is the same? 

 MR. GETCHELL:  I would -- I would have about

 three answers to that.  The first -- the first one is 

 that we don't trigger the dormant Commerce Clause 

 analysis, unless we are exercising the police power of a 

 State to regulate commerce.  And that means -- it does 

 mean that not every statute a State passes triggers an

 inquiry, even if it has an indirect effect on commerce. 

 Whereas, here, we have a statute that has a 

 solely political intent, the fact that -- that now that 

 the amici want to tell us about this great burgeoning 

 enterprise, they -- they want the Court to take that

 into account. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you -- are you telling 

 us that there is simply no commercial consequences to 

 this statute at all, that Virginians find this to be of 

 no commercial value, in any instance?

 MR. GETCHELL:  I am totally agnostic on this 

 record because we don't have any data on that. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you were the one 

 with summary judgment.  Now, maybe -- maybe they didn't 

 come forward with the information, but we interpret

 summary judgment in favor of -- of the losing party. 

40

 by the summary judgment, from showing that there -- even 

 with Virginians, there is a commercial value frequently

 to this information. 

 MR. GETCHELL:  All right. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's not just political. 

 MR. GETCHELL:  On this -- on this record -­

 on this record, the position that was accepted by the

 two courts below, entirely in accordance with this 

 Court's existing doctrine, was the first inquiry under 

 Privileges and Immunities, was whether there was a 

 fundamental right.  If there -- if there is not, then we 

 make no further inquiry.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's talk about -- let's 

 talk about the Commerce Clause.  You are saying you are 

 agnostic.  You have no idea whether or not there might 

 be some commercial value to this information.  I would 

 think, as an officer of the State of Virginia or as a

 matter of judicial notice, we could -- we could take 

 notice that there is. 

 MR. GETCHELL:  I'm saying that, under this 

 record, that never came up, nor should it have come up, 

 because what the court said on dormant Commerce Clause,

 both of the courts below, was this is not a regulation

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You are saying that it's no

 commercial value to allowing out-of-Staters to do this 

 than it is necessary for you to show that there is no 

 commercial value to your not allowing out-of-Staters to 

 hunt deer in Virginia. 

 MR. GETCHELL:  I believe -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say that it's up 

 to Virginia -­

 MR. GETCHELL:  Correct, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- whether -- whether 

 out-of-Staters can hunt for Virginia game.

 MR. GETCHELL:  Correct. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it's up to Virginia 

 whether out-of-Staters can have access to the State's 

 records, that they have no interest in, personally, 

 under -- under this law.  It seems, to me, perfectly

 logical. 

 MR. GETCHELL:  But, remember, they do -­

 they do have access to this information, both Hurlbert 

 and McBurney. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, that assumes

 the question as to whether or not there is a general

 commercial interest in these -- in these -- in these

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. GETCHELL:  Well, here's the problem in 

 this case is because I think that we are not at 

 first-tier analysis, because there is no regulation of 

 commerce that is discriminatory -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't understand -- if 

 that's your argument on it, I reject it as Justice 

 Kennedy does.  I -- I didn't understand you to be 

 arguing that there is no commercial value. 

 MR. GETCHELL:  I'm trying to explain why it

 doesn't matter. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, that's what I thought. 

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. GETCHELL:  It doesn't -- it doesn't 

 matter because if -- if, on the threshold inquiry, we

 don't have a discriminatory regulation of commerce, but 

 just an ordinary governmental function, then only 

 Pike-Church analysis could possibly -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you can't say 

 discriminatory regulation.  What about a tax?  I mean,

 you can't tax discriminatorily, and I wouldn't call

 MR. GETCHELL:  The -- the fact of the matter 

 is that it has been -- taxes have been found to be both

 violations of privileges and immunities and dormant 

 Commerce Clause, where there were -- there was unequal 

 taxation of commerce. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, even though it's -­

 even though it's not a regulation of commerce?

 MR. GETCHELL:  Okay.  Well, I -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  I mean, I guess 

 that's your argument, then. 

 MR. GETCHELL:  I apologize I chose a word 

 that is not as apt as it should have been, but a

 regulation or taxation centering around commerce 

 intended to affect and actually affecting commerce, it 

 just -- this just isn't that kind of activity. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, General, can I-- just 

 indulge me with a hypothetical.  Suppose that the background

 for these statutes was different.  The statutes were the 

 same, but, in addition to talking about people's right 

 to know about how their government works, the people 

 spend a lot of time also talking about the economic 

 benefits of a free flow of information in our country.

 Would that -- if that were true -- and I 

44

 want to put myself on record as not remembering when  these 

2  statutes were passed -- you know.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, if that were true,

 would this case be different?  Or would you still be up 

 here saying the same thing? 

 MR. GETCHELL:  If -- if I had -- if I had a 

 statute which, on its face, dealt with -- with 

 commerce -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The statute does exactly the 

 same thing.  I'm just suggesting that there might be two 

 interests behind the statute.  One is about knowing the 

 way your government operates, and the other is about 

 free flows of information in our economy.

 And, if both of those things had gone into 

 the mix to create statutes of this kind, would you 

 be up here saying the same thing or not? 

 MR. GETCHELL:  I would be saying something 

 at least slightly different, if I had different facts

 that I had to deal with, but I think, in principle, I 

 would be arguing the power of the State to pass this 

 kind of act without having to submit to the dormant 

 Commerce Clause, at least first-tier dormant Commerce 

 Clause analysis.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What else -- what else 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 can Virginia do besides -- I don't know if there are  elks in

 own -- for its own people?  You say, this is -- good 

 government in Virginia is for Virginians.  Big game

 hunting, scarce resource can be reserved for in-State 

 people. 

 What else can Virginia do? 

 MR. GETCHELL:  Well, Virginia can -- can do 

 things including have in-State tuition.  It can have -­

it can subsidize its own businesses, either by training 

 programs or even by other direct subsidy from public 

 FISK.  It limits welfare payments to residents of the 

 Commonwealth. 

 When the Commonwealth is just acting as a

 government and not as a regulator or taxer of interstate 

 commerce, it has the status of a coequal sovereign that, 

 in its own sphere, is allowed to do its own policy 

 choices. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think the thing, General,

 that I was trying to get at, it seems to me you have a 

 very good case that these statutes were -- were meant 

 for a different purpose.  But, in fact, it seems as 

 though your friends there have a good case that these 

 statutes have been taken over, to a large extent, across

 the country by economic enterprises doing economic 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 things. 

            

And, at that point in time, Virginia's -­

 and -- you know, you are only one of two States -­

 Virginia's maintenance of this kind of -- no, it's 

 Virginians -- you know, Virginia information for

 Virginians, looks very different from what it might have 

 looked like when the statute was originally passed. 

 MR. GETCHELL:  If -- if we were going to 

 say, if you were going to say that -- that this is an 

 inquiry that needs to be made under the Commerce Clause,

 this would be a particularly poor vehicle for doing it 

 because the Fourth Circuit held that the Pike analysis 

 of the district court was not appealed, and, therefore, 

 this case could not be sent back on remand to develop a 

 burden analysis of a record -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But Pike is not relevant 

 here.  Pike involves -- the Southern Pacific v. Arizona 

 the -- where there were -- where there were melons -­

 where there were melons, and Arizona wanted to make sure 

 that you had labels and packing of the melons in

 Arizona.  That was -- that was discriminatory against -­

 against interstate -- against interstate commerce. 

 That's not -- that's not dormant Commerce 

 Clause, but that is discrimination, and there is 

 discrimination here.

 against people who we don't let vote because they don't

 statute has a function.  It's a legitimate function 

 and -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- you could say the 

 same thing, we don't discriminate against Californians 

 who want to come and pack their melons in Arizona.

 MR. GETCHELL:  Well, I would say that -­

 that whether or not somebody can deal with an item in 

 commerce is -- is -- raises Commerce Clause questions. 

 And just, like in Reno v. Condon, where the State of 

 South Carolina was choosing to take its records and sell

 them into the stream of commerce, there, the Court held 

 that -- that they thereby became a thing in commerce. 

 The records of the tax assessor of the 

 County of Henrico, which are available through the 

 clerk's office to Mr. Hurlbert, are not things or

 persons in commerce, nor are they -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It -- it would surprise me 

 if an out-of-State investor, who was thinking of putting 

 a large plant in Virginia, had absolutely no interest in 

 Virginia's tax policies.

 MR. GETCHELL:  But they are available.  They 

48

 device where you don't have to go and look.  There has 

 always been public access for these -- these records.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so suppose -- I mean, 

 I think they have an argument, saying, of course, this 

 information would be useful for gathering national 

 statistics and helping the national economy.  I think 

 that's true.

 On the other hand, you say, well, but, look, 

 there must be something left that the States can reserve 

 to their own citizens, there must be something.  They 

 can't protect their own commerce; that's clear.  They 

 can't discriminate against people who want to come here

 and live here.  That's clear. 

 They can't do this and that and the other 

 thing, but, gee, there must be something.  I mean, can't 

 they reserve at least their -- their beaches for their 

 own citizens?  No.  Parking near their beaches?  Well,

 maybe.  And -- and maybe deer.  And, if not this, what? 

 That's the end.  Okay? 

 So that's, basically, what you are saying. 

 This is just an interest in trying to find out how State 

 institutions work, and the voters have the main interest

 there, and this is other -- so you say the other one is 

49

 do something. 

 So if you were me, how would you decide?

 How would you choose? 

 (Laughter.) 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the standard, 

 because you know the -- the Privileges and Immunities 

 Clause is -- is considerably opaque, and there are very

 few cases on it.  And so what -- how would you tell me 

 to -- to resolve that -- that tension because there is a 

 tension. 

 MR. GETCHELL:  I -- I think there that -­

 that the important policy issue in this case for us is

 precisely as you articulated.  There -- there is 

 residual sovereign power in the State to act, and we 

 have to violate the Constitution, clearly, before we 

 lose that authority. 

 And, under existing privileges and

 immunities doctrine, the privileges and immunities 

 are -- are few; they are -- they have been enumerated in 

 the courts, they are similar in character, having to do 

 with commerce, not governmental action.  So I would say 

 you would not extend privileges and immunities.

 MR. GETCHELL:  I agree, Your -­

 Justice Scalia. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the -- the issue is can

 the State allow its own citizens, for purposes of seeing 

 that the government is -- is being run on the up-and-up, 

 have access to those documents, without letting the 

 whole world? 

 MR. GETCHELL:  Yes, Your Honor, that is our

 position. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why doesn't the 

 dormant Commerce Clause affect the hypothetical I laid 

 out?  Because, directly, this permits Virginia 

 commercial businesses to get something that

 out-of-Staters can't.  The State is putting this 

 instrument into commerce.  You say, I don't know that. 

 But make the assumption that we think the record's clear 

 enough on that point. 

 I know you want to fight me on that, but

 it's hard -- it's a fight with no legs because you have

 MR. GETCHELL:  I am -- I am arguing that, of 

 course, I think we say in our brief that -- that they

 can be put into commerce.  They are put into commerce, 

 but we don't put them into commerce.  And we have -- in 

 the architecture of our bill -- our act has nothing to 

 do with commerce. 

 And if a State can't deal with -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Tell us, under our 

 jurisprudence -- the dormant Common Commerce 

 jurisprudence -- and I have some colleagues who don't -- who 

 don't believe it should exist.  Take that argument out. 

 Why is this not a dormant Commerce Clause case?

 MR. GETCHELL:  Because it is not an exercise 

 of the State police power to regulate commerce.  The 

 documents in the -- in the tax assessor's office of the 

 County of Henrico are not things or persons in commerce, 

 nor are they channels or instrumentalities of commerce.

 They are just the records of the sovereign, which we 

 will allow our citizens to obtain. 

 Unless the Court has further questions, I 

 think this argument has been developed from our 

 standpoint.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.

 Mr. Gupta, you have three minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. GUPTA:  Thank you.  Just a few quick

 points:  First, I just want to clear up, on the statute, 

 I want to make it clear that this statute does allow the 

 State to fully recoup its costs, including 

 administrative costs, and the State hasn't said 

 otherwise.

 made -­

 And, secondly, the suggestion has been 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  The -- I -- I 

 think what he's saying is you don't have to pay the 

 costs of developing and maintaining those records, which

 costs are paid by the citizens of Virginia, which gives 

 them an additional interest in being able to get to 

 those documents. 

 You -- you don't claim that -- that you pay 

 for the development and the maintenance of those

 records.  You just pay for the incremental costs of 

 giving it to you, right? 

 MR. GUPTA:  That -- that's right, 

 Justice Scalia -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And Virginians pay for all

 the rest?

 courthouses.  And I think this gets to -- Justice Breyer 

 asked for our test, to try to differentiate this from

 other services, and I'd like to try to provide one. 

 I think, at least where you've got a 

 function that is reserved to the State -- only the State 

 can do it, only the State can run the archives -- it's 

 necessary as a channel to -- to commerce.  And in the -­

in the modern economy, this is as much part of the 

 information infrastructure as transportation is, like 

 courthouses, like archives, like roads. 

 It would not stretch limited resources.  It 

 would not cost the State additional money, and it would

 not jeopardize important local traditions or 

 institutions -­

 you -- you switched now to-- and you were led there, but 

 you switched to the dormant Commerce Clause.  What about 

 your other client, McBurney?  He doesn't have any 

 dormant Commerce Clause claim.

 MR. GUPTA:  Right.  And I -- I think the 

54

 test that I just laid out would work for both clauses.  It's a 

2  limiting principle on the justification side.

 But -- but that's right, Mr. McBurney does not have a 

 dormant Commerce Clause claim.  His claim is based on

 equal access to proceedings. 

 He wanted to get recovery of child support 

 that he was owed.  So he is a creditor seeking to pursue 

 a debt on equal terms with people in the State of 

 Virginia, and the State set up a process.  As one step

 along the way to court, you go to the agency, you ask 

 the agency to enforce.  The -- the agency has unique 

 enforcement tools. 

 It can suspend someone's driver's license, 

 for example.  It can -- it can intercept income tax

 refunds, and it can go to court on your behalf.  And all 

 he's asking for is the rules of the game.  He wants to 

 know what procedures apply to that process.  And at 

 least where a -- an agency has a process that directly 

 affects a non-stater in the pocketbook, all we are

 saying is that equal access to the proceedings means 

 equal access to the information governing those 

 proceedings. 

 And, finally, I would just like to close by 

 saying that -- you know, what I don't think we heard on

 the justification side from the State was really any 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 justification because the State can recoup its costs.  And so 
they are not saying that this will cost them 
 anything more, which was the only justification they 

 pressed in -- in the courts below. 

 And so they are left with the position that

 they can discriminate simply because they think they 

 can.  And, if you look at the Privileges and Immunities 

 Clause, it sits right next to the Full Faith and Credit 

 Clause, which indicates, if anything, that the framers 

 thought that the movement of public records across State

 lines was important to interstate comity. 

 They changed the Articles of Confederation 

 version, which did not include public records; it only 

 referred to judicial records.  They added a mention of 

 judicial records -- nonjudicial records and saw that

 that was important to -- to comity across State lines. 

 But -- but their position is about the step 

 before that.  It's about whether you get the records in 

 the first place. 

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

 The case is submitted. 

 (Whereupon, at 11:16 a.m., the case in the 

 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
