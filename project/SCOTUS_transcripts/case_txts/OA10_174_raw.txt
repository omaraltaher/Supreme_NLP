 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. KEISLER:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court: 

 This is a case in which the courts are being 

asked to perform a legislative and regulatory function 

in a matter in which the necessary balancing of 

contending policy interests is among the most complex, 

multifaceted, and consequential of any policy issue now 

16 

before the country. 

17

20

21 

22 

23

 The States ask that the courts assess 

liability and design a new common law remedy for 

contributing to climate change, and to do so by applying 

a general standard of reasonableness to determine for 

each defendant, in this case and in future cases, what, 

if any, its share of global reductions in greenhouse gas 

emissions ought to be.  That would require the courts 

not to interpret and enforce the policy choices placed 

into law by the other branches, but to make those policy

choices themselves.  And all of our arguments here -­

that plaintiffs lack standing, that the Federal common 

law shouldn't be expanded to include this new cause of 

action, and that the case presents nonjusticiable 

political questions -- while all of them represent 

distinct points, All of them flow from the same basic 

separation of powers principles that establish, we 

believe, that the case ought to be dismissed. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think that's -­

MR. KEISLER:  Now, all of these issues -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's exactly one 

thing that's concerned me.  They do all flow from the 

same basic argument, and I'm concerned why you think we 

should focus on prudential standing, basically, which 

cuts off our jurisdiction at our own whim, as opposed to 

16 

dealing with this on the merits. 

17

18

 MR. KEISLER:  Well -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In either case, your 

19 

argument is that this is too generalized for the Court 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

to -- to address. 

 MR. KEISLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, our 

principal argument has not been prudential standing. 

The government has focused on the prudential standing 

argument.  We join that and we'd be happy to see the 

case resolved on that basis, but our principal argument

on standing has been Article III standing.  And we 

actually believe that the Court could resolve this case 

and address the issues in any order, with one possible 

exception, which is that we do read the Court's decision 

in Steel Co. as holding that the Court has to address 

Article III standing before reaching the question 

whether there's a valid cause of action. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Keisler, what -- what 

9 

good does it do you to have this Court say that there is 

10

no Article III standing?  The suit will just be brought 

11 

in State court -­

12

13

 MR. KEISLER:  Well -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- under State common 

14 

law and -- and the States' rules of standing are not

ours. 

 MR. KEISLER:  Well, many States, Your Honor, 

have similar doctrines of standing, similar doctrines of 

political questions. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They only need one.

 MR. KEISLER:  Well, in any event, Your 

Honor, we believe we would have a very strong motion to 

dismiss in State court on a variety of grounds, 

including -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  We're not sure about that, 

are we?  So we -- we -- we -- may be just spinning our 

5

wheels here.

 MR. KEISLER:  Well, I don't -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Indeed, you know, tapping 

4 

the case to State judges instead of Federal judges, I 

5

would frankly rather have Federal judges do it, 

6 

probably.

 MR. KEISLER:  Well, as I said, Your Honor, I 

think we would be able to defeat a State common law 

claim on grounds of State law, for lack of proximate 

cause, on standing and political question grounds that 

many States have that parallel these; but in any case, 

whichever ground the Court resolves this case on, we 

think it's clear that the cause of action can proceed. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if -- if you had a 

State court suit with a State plaintiff, wouldn't the 

State be able to adduce Federal common law as a ground 

for recovery?  And then we would get to the merits and 

see if there is a Federal common law cause of action. 

 MR. KEISLER:  It's -- it's possible, Your 

Honor, although we think they would be more likely to 

proceed under State common law.  But either way, we 

don't think the elements of a State or Federal common 

law cause of action under nuisance could be met here, 

and we're very confident we could defeat that claim in 

State court as well.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, we all -- we all 

know that you sometimes have to peek at the merits to 

see if there's standing.  There's a little cheating that 

goes on.  But -- but in this case it does seem to me 

that you're lacking any clear precedent.  When I think 

of standing, I think of Frothingham v. Mellon.  That 

isn't this case. 

 MR. KEISLER:  But the Court has said in 

9 

Warth v. Seldin that the plaintiff has to demonstrate 

10

that it will benefit in some tangible way from the 

11 

Court's intervention.  And that's -­

12

13 

14

16 

17 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If you have -- if you 

have the precedent of Massachusetts v. EPA and if any 

one plaintiff has standing, I guess that's enough.  So 

if you look at standing alone, it seems to me the States 

would have standing on the same basis that Massachusetts 

had standing. 

 MR. KEISLER:  Justice Ginsburg, we believe 

19 

that Massachusetts was very carefully qualified to focus 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

on the particular regulatory context of that opinion. 

The Court said that it was addressing standing to 

challenge the denial of a petition for rulemaking, when 

the agency would be proceeding incrementally to address 

a broader problem, and a statute specifically gave the 

petitioners the right to seek that kind of incremental

protection.  The Court was very specific about that. 

The statutory right was of critical importance, it said, 

to the standing inquiry. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Keisler, the Court did 

say that, but it's cut off from the Court's actual 

analysis in the case.  When the Court goes through 

injury and causation and redressability, the Court never 

refers to the statutory cause of action. 

 MR. KEISLER:  But it does, Justice Kagan, 

specifically refer to the regulatory context in which 

the case is taking place.  The Court said that if the 

EPA's arguments there about traceability and 

redressability were adopted, it would doom most 

challenges to agency action because agencies proceed 

incrementally. 

 Here we have no statute, we have no agency 

proceeding incrementally, and we believe there is no 

basis for the plaintiffs to seek that kind of 

incremental relief when they've acknowledged that will 

have no material effect on their injury; and they 

acknowledged that in the State's complaint when they 

specifically said that the relief they seek here would 

only constitute these defendants' share of the larger 

overall emissions reductions that would be necessary in 

order to have any material effect on climate change or

the injuries that they assert.  That is an 

acknowledgment that the relief they seek here would not 

provide them any redress except in connection with other 

reductions that would be obtained elsewhere, and that we 

think means that this is a classic case in which the 

injuries are not the product of the defendants' conduct 

but of the collective independent actions of numerous 

third parties not before the Court. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the Court clearly 

understood that in Massachusetts v. EPA and said that it 

was enough, and I would think under traditional standing 

principles the standing there was actually harder to 

find because one had to go through the EPA first.  One 

had to say the EPA should regulate, and then the EPA 

would regulate, and then the question was would that 

reduce emissions levels?  Here the EPA is out of the 

picture.  The action is much more direct. 

 MR. KEISLER:  But there, Your Honor, they 

19 

were suing a defendant, the EPA, that had regulatory 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

authority over the entire country.  Here they're suing 

five separate defendants, each of whom has to be 

evaluated individually, and there is not a single one of 

them against whom the relief sought would have any 

tangible effect on the injuries that the plaintiffs 

claim here.  But we also think that Massachusetts is 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

7 

8

relevant in a completely different respect, which is the 

Court was very specific in Massachusetts about what its 

role was and what it wasn't.  The Court said:  We lack 

the expertise or the authority to second-guess the 

policy choices of the EPA, but its role there was to 

compel the agency to adhere to the statute as the Court 

interpreted it. 

 In this case, the States are asking the 

9 

courts to play exactly the role that this Court 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

disclaimed in Massachusetts v. EPA, which is to make 

those policy choices in the first instance, and they say 

that the courts can do this because the courts have done 

this in prior nuisance cases, but this case is nothing 

like any of the prior nuisance cases this Court has 

held.  It's nothing like an instance in which one State 

is complaining that another State has dumped sewage into 

a body of water that's crossed the border.  The case -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So how many States 

19 

does it take?  I think, you know, if it's three States 

20

21 

22 

23

who have made that allegation, I don't know exactly how 

you draw the line between a case like Tennessee Copper 

and this case. 

 MR. KEISLER:  It's not a question of the 

24 

quantity of plaintiffs, Mr. Chief Justice, it's the 

25

nature of the task that the Court would have to perform, 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

and this task is different because of the global nature 

of the phenomenon. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm more receptive to this 

4 

kind of argument if I know we're going to the merits as 

5

6

7

8 

9 

opposed to standing -­

 MR. KEISLER:  It -- it -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- and I recognize that we 

slip in and out of the two categories, and don't want to 

make it difficult on you.  But I take it that these 

10

arguments also go to whether there's a cause of action 

11 

on the merits.

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. KEISLER:  Exactly, Your Honor, and 

whether the Court should expand the Federal common law 

to recognize this.  The global nature of this phenomenon 

makes it different because every sector of the economy 

worldwide produces greenhouse gases, and there is no 

geographic nexus, as there was in Tennessee Copper and 

every one of the other nuisance cases, between the 

source of the emission and the victim that claims the 

harm.  And that changes what the Court has to do.  It 

means that any court or policymaker thinking about how 

to alleviate the kinds of injuries that are pled here 

has to first think what is the appropriate overall level 

of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and then 

make a comparative judgment about how the reductions 

11

11 

12 

13

that would be necessary to achieve that level should be 

allocated among all the different sectors based on the 

social good that that sector produces and what 

reductions would mean to that social good.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought your -- your 

first argument when you addressed this issue was there 

is a decisionmaker and that decisionmaker is EPA.  So 

you wouldn't get to even how arduous a task this would 

be if it was within the court's bailiwick.  I thought 

your position was that the function, this regulatory 

function, has been assigned to the EPA and not to the 

courts. 

 MR. KEISLER:  We are making both arguments, 

14 

Justice Ginsburg.  We don't think there would be an 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

appropriate Federal common law cause of action even if 

the Clean Air Act hadn't been enacted.  But certainly 

the argument is even stronger and easier because of the 

existence of the Clean Air Act and in particular because 

this Court in Massachusetts v. EPA interpreted the Clean 

Air Act so that the term "pollutant" specifically 

includes greenhouse gases, and that means that Congress 

has assigned to EPA the task of making precisely the 

determinations that plaintiffs ask the courts to make 

here:  Do greenhouse gases endanger the public, and if 

so, what regulatory consequence -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the EPA is given 

authority to regulate other pollutants, including those 

that do not go up into the atmosphere, but that does not 

prevent California, for example, from enacting stricter 

standards for its -- for automobiles in its State. 

 MR. KEISLER:  Oh, and -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So why should we say the 

8 

EPA preempts the Federal common law?

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. KEISLER:  Because this issue, and I 

would prefer to refer to it as displacement rather than 

preemption, is very different from the question of 

preemption of State law.  The Clean Air Act has a 

savings clause that preserves State authority across a 

variety of areas, but the Court in second Milwaukee v. 

Illinois cases specifically distinguished between 

displacement of State law and displacement of Federal 

common law.  It said the -- the presumption is against 

preemption of State law because of various concepts of 

State sovereignty, but because of Federal concepts of 

separation of powers, the presumption is in favor of 

lawmaking by Congress and not lawmaking by courts, and 

that means that the standard is very different.  It 

means that if Congress has addressed the problem, then 

Federal common law is displaced.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's your best case?

 MR. KEISLER:  Milwaukee v Illinois II.  That 

was the case in which the Court held that the Clean 

Water Act displaced a Federal common law nuisance claim 

by Illinois against Milwaukee and specifically said 

because Congress had addressed the problem, Federal 

common law had no role to play.  Here Congress has 

established a process and it's a process in which the 

States and the private parties here can participate. 

They can file petitions for rulemaking, they can appeal 

EPA decisions that they oppose, and it would be 

completely inconsistent with that process if they could 

also take a complete end run around it and go to court 

and ask courts to make the decisions that Congress has 

assigned to EPA.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is a merits argument, 

16 

right? 

17

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24

25

 MR. KEISLER:  Yes, it is a merits argument, 

because it says that any Federal common law action would 

be displaced by the Clean Air Act.

 Now, the -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is the consequence of that 

argument, Mr. Keisler, that there in fact is no Federal 

common law of interstate pollution claims? 

 MR. KEISLER:  I don't think there is very 

much left of any Federal common law of interstate

pollution claims, just because the field has been so 

heavily occupied by statutes.  You know, all the 

nuisance cases that the court of appeals relied on, Your 

Honor, they were in a completely different time.  They 

were at a time when the Court's view of its common law 

authority was extremely broad and its view of Congress's 

constitutional power under the Commerce Clause was very 

narrow. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, you're going to 

have to struggle with the preemption question sooner or 

later.  You're confident you can establish not only 

displacement of Federal common law, but also preemption 

of State common law, right? 

 MR. KEISLER:  It will ultimately depend on 

the state of the law at the time that such a 

hypothetical case is filed, but we would welcome the 

opportunity, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is part of the inquiry, 

19 

part of the dynamic, how imminent the Federal regulation 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

is? 

 MR. KEISLER:  I don't think so, Justice 

Kennedy.  I think the question is always what Congress 

has done, not what the stage of the EPA rulemaking 

process is.  Congress, not EPA, can create or modify or 

destroy causes of action, and that's why the Court said

7

11 

12 

13

in that Milwaukee 2 case that when Congress has 

addressed the problem that's the end of the inquiry. 

And there is no question that Congress has addressed not 

just the general problem, but the specific problem here. 

It has the statute which assigns EPA the authority to 

regulate pollutants in certain ways and pollutants have 

been defined under Massachusetts v. EPA to include the 

precise greenhouse gasses that are at issue here. 

 There couldn't be a more specific example of 

Congress having addressed the problem and assigned a 

different approach to dealing with it than letting the 

courts work it out under Federal common law. 

 The States' and the private plaintiffs' 

14 

argument is that the Federal common law will only be 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23

displaced when EPA adopts the precise regulation that 

provides the precise form of relief that they're asking 

for.  There's no case that says that and that's not the 

law. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  EPA couldn't give -­

could EPA give that relief?  We're dealing with existing 

stationary sources.  We're not dealing with new or 

modified sources. 

 MR. KEISLER:  We believe that the EPA can 

24 

consider, as it's undertaking to do, regulating existing 

25

nonmodified sources under section 111 of the Clean Air 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company

5

Act, and that's the process that's engaged in now.  It's 

announced that it will propose standards in the summer 

and complete a rulemaking by May.  Obviously, at the 

close of that process there could be APA challenges on a 

variety of grounds, but we do believe that they have the 

6 

authority to consider standards under section 111.

alleged nuisance, "global warming," itself tells you 

much of what you need to know.  There are billions of 

emitters of greenhouse gasses on the planet and billions 

of potential victims as well.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, again, that just 

goes to the merits.  You make that argument to the 

district court that your injunction is meaningless, 

equity does not require an idle act.  End of case. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I 

think it goes to both.  That is, this Court in outlining 

what the prudential standing doctrine is all about in, 

for example, Newdow has said the following at page 11: 

"Without prudential standing limitations, the Court 

would be called upon to decide abstract questions of why 

public significance, even though other governmental 

institutions may be more competent to address the 

questions and even though judicial intervention may be 

unnecessary to protect individual rights. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'll add a third thing that 

it goes to and that's Article III standing.  It's clear 

in our cases, if as you say the relief requested here 

will not remedy the complaint of these people, you don't 

have to go to prudential standing.  That it seems to me 

would deny Article III standing.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, Justice Scalia, I 

18

think that this case is best like Newdow, in which the 

Court went to prudential standing first before Article 

III.  And the reason for that is because this court in 

Massachusetts v. EPA, in analyzing the redressability 

prong of what you're asking said that the reductions 

that were sought there, if granted, would, quote, "slow 

or reduce the problem." 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'll think about it, 

9 

but Newdow was a case where we thought that this 

10

11 

12 

13

particular litigant was not directly injured.  Here the 

State said it's directly injured.  That's the 

distinction. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  More than that, Newdow 

14 

was a case of a father trying to assert a right on 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

behalf of a child, and the child herself did not want 

that right nor did her mother.  So it seems to me it's 

worlds apart, and when you describe prudential standing 

as involving generalized grievance, I thought that the 

generalized grievance was Article III.  I thought that's 

what Mrs. Frothingham's case was about; it was a 

grievance that she shared with everybody in the 

populations, so she didn't have standing. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Ginsburg, we're not 

24 

here saying that this case follows inexorably, 

25

inexorably from the facts of Newdow or, frankly, from

any case that this Court has decided.  There is no case 

in the 222 years that announces the precise rule we're 

seeking here, and the reason is because you have never 

heard a case like this before involving the quantity and 

quality of the claims sought here, the -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it seems, General 

Katyal, that there also is no case where we've ever used 

this language of generalized grievance as a prudential 

matter rather than as an Article III matter.  So am I 

wrong about that? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, I think that this 

Court has in Newdow and in Warth v. Seldin used the 

language of generalized grievances to reflect prudential 

considerations.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Newdow -- Newdow quoted 

the language of generalized grievance that came from 

Warth, but it didn't specifically pin anything on that 

language. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I quite agree with you, 

Justice Kagan.  This is not like a case in which the 

government is announcing some rule of standing that 

requires the Court to, for example, call into question 

previous precedents of this Court that reached the 

merits or something like that.  It's that this Court has 

never had a case involving this scale and scope, and we

think that the prudential standing doctrine, at least in 

a circumstance like this, which is a Federal common law 

cause of action in which the Court is already being 

asked to fashion the rules and, as Justice Scalia says, 

an equitable action in which the Court has I think 

special abilities to fashion relief if appropriate and 

not -- I think prudential standing reflects best the 

kind of tapestry of different factors. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, General Katyal, how 

about the Aiken case, because in the Aiken case I think 

the government came in and made the same argument, that 

even though the injury was concrete, it was too 

generalized and therefore there should be no standing, 

the Court specifically rejected that argument both as to 

Article III and as to prudential standing. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Right, and I think Aiken 

says that the prudential standing cases thus far have 

been about has concrete injury been shown to a 

particular person.  And we're not disputing that for 

purposes of Article III concrete injury has been shown 

21 

to at least one plaintiff, but we think that -­

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  To that extent you 

disagree with Mr. Keisler because he says there is no 

Article III?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  That is absolutely correct,

12 

13 

14

we do disagree to that extent.  We think that prudential 

standing best reflects the Court's general intuition in 

this area that when a problem is of this magnitude and 

literally involving the world, where everyone is a 

potential perpetrator, everyone is a potential victim, 

and where their own theory at page 15 of their brief and 

32 and 40 states:  "If someone contributes one drop to 

the nuisance, they can be sued. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, you don't 

usually -- your phrase is exactly what bothers me.  We 

don't usually base a decision on our general intuition, 

and the idea of prudential standing that we have 

jurisdiction of the case but we're not going to decide 

it is contrary to Chief Justice Marshall's famous line 

that if we don't have jurisdiction, we can't decide it, 

16 

but if we do, we have to decide it. 

17

18 

19 

20

 GENERAL KATYAL:  But I think that the 

prudential standing doctrine generally and the zone of 

interest test in particular really do focus on this 

question, Mr. Chief Justice, about whether or not a case 

21 

can be cut down to judicially manageable standards. 

22

23 

24 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'll give that you 

on the zone of interests, but there you're dealing with 

administrative law and a very narrow proposition.  I 

think it's Justice Kennedy's point, or at least the

point of his questions, that these issues meld into the 

merits and, at least for anyone who is troubled by the 

idea that we are not going to decide a case even though 

we have jurisdiction to decide it, maybe that's the 

better place to address it. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I'll move to that and take 

your invitation, Mr. Chief Justice.  But before doing 

so, I would say that if you're going to give me 

administrative law and zone of interest I think you 

should then give me Federal common law, which this Court 

is at its height in terms of fashioning who can come 

into court and what those rules may be. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand why you 

14 

assert that the remedy here will not provide the 

15

relief -- you acknowledge that, don't you, that the 

16 

remedy here cannot possibly stop global warming, right?

Massachusetts v. EPA the relief was allowing a Federal 

agency to regulate the entire society's carbon 

emissions.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Justice Scalia, that isn't

what the Court said.  What the Court said is that it 

would allow regulation in the transportation sector, 

which would be approximately 1.7 billion tons, and here 

they are saying 650 million tons.  And so, I agree it's 

less, but I think that the -- and one can criticize the 

reasoning in the majority, but if that -- that is the 

rule of this Court, and I think that as long as a 

slowing or reduction -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think -- do you 

think that was the holding of Massachusetts v. EPA, that 

11 

EPA can only regulate the transportation section? 

12

 GENERAL KATYAL:  That is what the Court 

13 

based its redressability analysis on. 

14

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that the holding of the 

case and -- and do you think the -- the -- the 

16 

forthcoming EPA rules can only govern transportation? 

17

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Of course not.  I'm just 

18 

saying that the -­

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course not.  Of course 

the case covers -­

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Right.  And I'm just 

24 

talking about the redressability part of the analysis, 

25

Justice Scalia.  For that the Court said that this 

24

reduction in the transportation sector was sufficient.

 If I could take the Mr. -- the Chief 

Justice's invitation to address displacement at this 

time.  We believe that we meet the State's own test for 

displacement, which is found at page 46 of their brief, 

which is:  "A Federal common law nuisance claim is 

displaced when a Federal statute or regulatory action 

addresses the nuisance."  And here you have not just the 

Clean Air Act, you have the Clean Air Act plus, a 

10

cascade of a number of different actions taken after, 

11 

Justice Scalia, the opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO:  At what point in this -- in 

13 

what point in this cascade did the displacement occur? 

14

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24

25

 GENERAL KATYAL:  We think that the Court 

doesn't really need to get into it.  And for the -- the 

reason is this:  Displacement actions are extremely 

rare, Federal common law actions are rare, so we don't 

think you should announce some sort of general standard 

for when displacement occurs.  It's a more case-by-case 

situation. 

 Here you have undoubted evidence that it 

occurred -- that it has occurred because of a number of 

different things. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  We don't know what EPA may 

do down the road, we don't know what Congress may do 

25

down the road.  So don't we have to have some idea about 

when this takes place in order so that this precedent 

may -­

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Certainly -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- be applied to the future 

6 

course of conduct? 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Certainly, Justice Alito, I 

think it's appropriate for the Court to look at what 

has -- what is happening right now.  And here's what's 

happening.  First, in December 2009 the EPA issued an 

endangerment finding, finding these greenhouse gases 

significant pollutants. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, General Katyal, suppose 

14 

that the EPA had decided not to issue the endangerment 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

finding.  Would your argument still apply? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I think that that would 

present a difficult case, because it would be the one 

like the Petitioners make, which is the Clean Air Act 

alone.  And I think that what the States themselves 

acknowledge and what the language of Milwaukee II -­

excuse me -- Milwaukee I says in it is that -- and this 

is at page 107 of the opinion:  "It may happen that new 

Federal laws and new Federal regulations may in time 

preempt the Federal common law of nuisance.  We think 

that both together presents the best and easiest case 

26

for displacement," and you have that here.  You have not 

just the endangerment finding; you have the EPA 

regulating all passenger cars, all light motor vehicles 

right now.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if I insisted you answer 

the hypothetical I gave you, what would the answer be? 

No endangerment finding.  Is there displacement? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I think that it's a -- it's 

9 

a difficult case to make for -- for displacement, but I 

10

think it could be made, for the reasons Mr. Keisler 

11 

suggests.  But I -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is it -- I don't 

want to make -- try to make a case for you, but why is 

it that much more difficult?  It's just -- I mean, it's 

sort of like the negative commerce clause, right?  The 

fact that EPA has the authority to regulate in a 

particular area means that the ball has passed from the 

courts to the agency, to the executive branch, and 

they've made an implicit decision not to regulate a 

particular question. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Absolutely.  I think that 

there's a good argument to be made.  I imagine the 

argument on the other side that you'll hear in a moment 

is that the Clean Air Act doesn't look precisely like 

the Clean Water Act in terms of forcing the agency to 

27

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess that would 

be a preemption question rather than -- rather than a 

displacement question.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I think that very well may 

be.  And with respect to that, Mr. Chief Justice, you 

had asked before about State common law causes of action 

and whether they would be -- they would kind -- the 

existence of those would somehow mean that the Court 

should either find jurisdiction or reach the merits in a 

way.  And we think that the same arguments that prohibit 

the Court from -- from -- from recognizing a Federal 

common law cause of action for displacement very well 

may be preemption questions as well that could be 

addressed down the road with respect to State common law 

16 

actions. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 And we don't think the Court should be 

troubled by the existence of a potential State common 

law cause of action.  It's just like Milwaukee II, in 

which the dissenters made precisely this argument.  They 

said:  If you don't recognize it, then the States will 

regulate it and it will balkanize and the like.  And 

what the majority said is:  That's a question for down 

the road; the question for now is has displacement 

occurred?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I understand that that's not 

the issue here, but does the government have a position 

on that if -- if New York law provides exactly the same 

public nuisance claim that is now asserted under Federal 

common law, would that be consistent? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I -- I don't think we have 

a position at this time on that.  That's I think an 

enormously complicated question we can get to at an 

appropriate time.  Our central -- our central submission 

to you on displacement is this:  That there is literally 

no precedent for the argument that they are making here, 

which is that the Federal Government has to regulate the 

precise jot and tittle, the specific relief that they 

are seeking before displacement occurs.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you have a position on 

whether there's anything to be displaced here?  Do you 

have a position on whether there is, in fact, a Federal 

cause of action? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, we think, again, the 

Court doesn't need to get into that question because 

it -- you know, the -- there are few Federal common law 

causes of action in the area of nuisance -- I mean, and 

there have been two that the Federal Government has 

filed since 1970 and three that we can find all together 

in the Federal courts of appeals, all of which have 

29

failed for various displacement reasons, and the others.

 We think none of those look anything like 

the -- the common law cause of action here.  And, so, it 

would at least require this Court to extend quite 

dramatically Federal common law to cover this type of 

situation in which everyone is a potential perpetrator 

and everyone is a potential victim.  And it would 

require the Court, in fashioning relief, to think 

through a number of things that the Federal courts 

haven't ever had to grapple with from the nature -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So, if there were -- if 

there were no Clean Air Act, you would still say that 

this suit, a suit like this, would -- would fail 

prudential standing, but you don't have a position as to 

whether there would be a claim under Federal common law? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  That is correct.  We think 

it would still fail prudential standing because of the 

quantity and quality of the nature of the problem here, 

and the multitude of different policy judgments that 

would be required -- that this Court would be required 

to undertake to adjudicate a Federal common law cause of 

action in the absence of a statute. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I'm sorry, General, 

24 

because I was understanding your answer differently, and 

25

maybe I misheard you, as saying that if there were no 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

legislation here, you doubted that there was a Federal 

law cause of action.  Is that correct?

prudential standing.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but as to whether the 

cause of action exists under Federal common law in a 

case like this, where you said it was so different from 

the other Federal common law cases that the Court has 

seen.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  I -- I -- I think I put it 

as we doubt it.  I mean, I think that it would require a 

dramatic extension, Justice Kagan, of a case like 

Tennessee Copper and the other cases that this Court has 

heard, which are essentially:  A pollutes a river or 

something and hurts B.  A here is the world and B is the 

world, and that is such a difference in scale and scope 

to pose enormously difficult questions as to whether 

this Court should recognize such a cause of action. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Same -- same hypothetical, 

assume no Federal statute, and -- and assume no Federal 

common law.  What about State law?  Does State common 

law become displaced because it's a matter of Federal 

concern?  We don't -- we don't -- we don't usually have 

preemption of Federal common law.

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well -- well, there may be 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4

arguments, Justice Kennedy -- I'm not sure if the 

premise of your question has a Clean Air Act in 

existence or not.  There may be some sort of arguments 

about displacement or preemption under the Clean Air 

Act -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The hypothetical is that 

7 

the Federal law -- Federal statutory law doesn't apply. 

8

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Then I think that again for 

9 

purposes of State common law, I think this Court would

approach that question the same way it did in Milwaukee 

II, which is to say that's a really separate 

policy-based question that the Court doesn't use to 

answer the questions about whether a cause of action 

should be recognized or whether displacement has 

occurred.  But I would point out that the States that 

have sued generally have doctrines like prudential 

standing, doctrines like political question, that may 

very well bar the reaching of these claims in State 

courts as well.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It would be very odd to 

say that there's no Federal common law, but also that 

there's no -- no displacement of State law.  That -­

that seems to me odd. 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  That's precisely the 

situation that -- that this Court was grappling with in

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we get to -- to the 

situation that now exists?  They are seeking standards 

for existing sources.  I asked Mr. Keisler, and do you 

agree with him, this is not a -- this is not a new 

source or a modified source; we're talking about 

existing sources.  Does EPA, could EPA, regulate and set 

standards for existing sources? 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Absolutely, Justice 

Ginsburg.  Let me say three things about that.  First 

is, EPA is currently regulating existing sources.  To 

the extent that a power plant is modified in any way to 

increase carbon dioxide above a certain amount -- and 

this is one of the so-called tailoring rules -- then 

those power plants right now are subject to regulation. 

Indeed, one has already had to get a permit.  These 

regulations just went into effect in January 2011 for 

existing power plants that seek to modify. 

 Second, there is a settlement agreement in 

place that commits EPA by May of 2012 to deciding how 

and whether to regulate existing power sources, the 

existing stationary sources. 

 And third, and I think most fundamentally, 

24 

there is no precedent, Justice Ginsburg, that says that 

25

the government must regulate the specific industry, the 

33

specific thing that the plaintiff isolates, in order for 

displacement to occur.  Rather, Sea Clammers and 

Milwaukee II I think make explicit that that's the wrong 

question.  And so long as the nuisance is being 

addressed -- and here the nuisance is undoubtedly being 

addressed with a panoply of different Federal actions in 

the area of global warming, and an executive order that 

says that fighting global warming is one of the 

government's highest priorities -- and concrete steps 

taken, such as the 500-page tailoring rule, the 

400-page -- the -- the other hundreds of pages that EPA 

has done with its experts to appropriately regulate 

greenhouse gas emissions, as opposed to a Federal common 

law court of action doing something which would frankly 

put you all at sea in terms of the complexity, 

16 

economics, international nature of the problem.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, could I take you 

back on that last point to another threshold question, 

which is the political question doctrine?  Because a lot 

of your arguments really sound like prongs two and three 

from Baker v. Carr, but you say that we shouldn't go 

there, that we should instead address this matter on 

prudential standing grounds.  But the political question 

doctrine actually seems more natural, given the kinds of 

arguments you're making.  So why not?

 GENERAL KATYAL:  Well, Justice Kagan, I'm 

not going to tarry too long on which different way we 

should win this case.  I think either is an appropriate 

way.

 (Laughter.) 

 GENERAL KATYAL:  But I think that the 

prudential standing doctrine is a bit narrower because 

it -- it contemplates a variety of factors, including 

the fact that this is a Federal common law cause of 

action where the Court is fashioning relief in the first 

place, as opposed to the political question doctrine 

which looks -- looks more to the standardless nature of 

the adjudication. 

 We agree that -- that the political question 

doctrine is an appropriate way to dismiss of this case, 

but we think that, like Newdow, like Kowalski, this 

Court can handle this case on prudential standing first 

and recognize that this is an unprecedented action 

involving literally the world, and it is not suited for 

judicial resolution, and that flows quite naturally from

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's not an area where

agree on, I think, the courts can't mess with the 

impeachment of a president, just -- but here the Court

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 This case rests on the longstanding 

fundamental authority of the States to protect their 

land, their natural resources, and their citizens from 

air pollution emitted in other States.  It rests on 

three propositions:  One, the interests of the States 

are harmed by global warming; two, these defendants, as 

the five largest U.S. emitters of carbon dioxide, are 

significant contributors to it; and, three, these 

defendants could take reasonable, cost-effective 

measures to reduce their emissions in a way that would 

slow the effects of global warming.

 We will have to prove these propositions,

and after we do the district court will have to 

determine whether it can frame an appropriate equitable 

injunction.  That's what discovery and trials are for. 

But this Court should not close the courthouse door to 

this case at the outset.  The common law action for 

public nuisance has been around for hundreds of years, 

has been adapted by courts to cover new environmental 

threats, and there's no reason why the courts can't do 

the same thing here.

 The defendants say there are too many 

plaintiffs, too many potential defendants, and that 

adjudication of this case will require courts to solve 

the entire problem of global warming, but that is simply 

not so.

 On the plaintiffs' side, this is about the 

States.  We are alleging the kind of injury to States 

that has been traditionally recognized by this Court; 

their lands, their citizens, their businesses are being 

injured by pollution emitted in other States.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Underwood, the -­

the relief that you're seeking, asking a court to set 

standards for emissions, sounds like the kind of thing 

that EPA does.  I mean, Congress set up the EPA to 

promulgate standards for emissions, and now what -- the 

relief you're seeking seems to me to set up a district 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

judge, who does not have the resources, the expertise, 

as a kind of super EPA. 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  It's not as a super EPA. 

4 

It's something much smaller.  It's a different question. 

5

6 

7 

8

Interstate pollution disputes have historically been 

entrusted to the courts, including the determination of 

how much is unreasonable, which is -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if we just 

9 

concentrate on I think the relief you want, you say:

22 

23 

24 

25

District court, if we pass everything else, you set 

emissions standards, you put a cap immediately, you set 

a cap, and then annually you require further reductions. 

Well, that just sounds to me like what EPA does when it 

sets emission standards.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, it's also like what 

the Court did in Tennessee Copper.  That is to say, this 

case doesn't ask the Court to decide how much, contrary 

to what Petitioners suggest, to decide how much emission 

reduction is required to solve the whole problem of 

global warming and then allocate a portion to these 

defendants.  It asks the Court to do something simpler, 

and that is to decide whether these defendants can take 

reasonable cost-effective measures that would help to 

slow the pace of global warming.  So -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  How does a district judge 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

2 

3 

4

8

decide what is reasonable and cost-effective?  There are 

considerations -- this is not a situation in which the 

emission of greenhouse gases can be totally prohibited. 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  There are other -- there are 

countervailing interests.  So how does the court -- how 

can a district court balance those interests? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, I would say two things 

9 

about that.  One, it was also true in Tennessee Copper 

10

12 

13

that it was not the case that the sulfur emissions could 

be eliminated or that the plant was to be put out of 

business.  The Court in that case ordered a reduction of 

sulfur, a quite specific reduction of sulfur emissions 

in one season and more in another season.  And how 

does -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But do you seriously argue 

this isn't -- this isn't orders of magnitude more 

complicated than that case? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  It's somewhat more -- it's 

larger.  I don't know if it's more complicated.  The way 

a court would do that is presumably the way it did it in 

Tennessee Copper.  That is, there could be expert 

testimony, there could also be evidence about whether -­

what other emitters are doing, what they do that is 

feasible and cost-effective to reduce their emissions.

In Tennessee Copper, one of the defendants settled, and 

the other was subject to an order, and it would have 

been available to the Court to look to what the settling 

defendant did for some indication of what the 

nonsettling defendant might well be ordered to do.  So 

there is evidence available from which a court could 

conclude what is reasonable. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what is the 

9 

-- what factors go into the cost-benefit analysis that 

10

11 

12 

13

would have to be undertaken to decide what level of 

emissions are reasonable in light of the threat of 

global -- global warming? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  The available technology, 

14 

the cost of that technology -­

15

16 

17 

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Obviously the 

greatest benefit to reduce global warming would be, of 

course, to shut down the power plants, right? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, we haven't asked for 

19 

that and nobody suggests that that would be appropriate. 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

It's not, any more than it was in Tennessee Copper. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because -- right. 

But I mean, across the economy, the whole problem of 

dealing with global warming is that there are costs and 

benefits on both sides, and you have to determine how 

much you want to readjust the world economy to address 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company

global warming, and I think that's a pretty big burden 

to post -- to impose on a district court judge. 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, it's also a burden 

4 

that the plaintiffs would have to bear.  That is to say,

we have alleged, and are entitled to try to prove -- and 

we might fail; that would be for the district judge to 

determine -- that "the defendants have available to them 

practical, feasible" -- I'm reading from the 

complaint -- "and economically viable options for 

reducing carbon dioxide emissions without significantly 

increasing the cost of electricity to their customers, 

including changing fuels, improving efficiency, and 

altering" -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We're dealing with 

an electric grid that connects I don't know how vast an 

area, but certainly a vast area here.  And the fact that 

they can reduce their emissions in a way that doesn't 

affect their customers is based on the fact that other 

power plants that are part of the grid will serve part 

of those -- will serve the customers' needs to some 

21 

extent. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  It may or may not be based 

on this.  These are facts that can be proven or not 

proven at trial.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, General, they're

usually facts that are determined by an administrative 

agency.  I mean, even just reading that part of your 

complaint, it sounds like the paradigmatic thing that 

administrative agencies do rather than courts.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  But if there were no agency 

and if there were no Clean Air Act and somebody was 

shooting poison into the air in a way that injured 

people in another State, the States would have the -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if there were no and if 

there were no, we would be living in a different world. 

There is an administrative agency and there is a Clean 

Air Act. 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  But those -- those are 

14 

questions about what has been called the merits or 

15

displacement.  The question of Article III standing, the 

question of justiciability, the question of political 

question, those are the same questions whether there's 

an agency or not. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We can concede that, but 

we still have the displacement argument -­

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY -- in front of us, and I 

23 

thought that's what we were addressing. 

24

25

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  We can talk about the 

displacement argument.  I just wanted to be sure that -­

I understood the question of standards to be a question 

addressed to the political question point.  And even if 

it might be desirable to have an agency set standards, 

it is not something that is beyond the power of a court 

to do. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can the courts set a tax? 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The agency -- the agency 

is engaged in that, in it right now, and that's another 

facet of this case, the potential for conflict.  The 

EPA, after acting for a while, has now agreed that it 

does have authority to classify this as a pollutant and 

it has taken the first steps. 

 One argument that the EPA -- that the United 

14 

States is presenting is the way agencies go about this 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

is incrementally, so they're starting with motor 

vehicles and then maybe they will go to new sources, and 

then they'll get to maybe where you are.  But you want 

the Court to start with the existing sources, to set 

limits that may be in conflict with what an existing 

agency is doing. 

 Do we ignore the fact that the EPA is there 

22 

and that it is regulating in this area? 

23

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, we do not ignore that. 

24 

This is a very peculiar moment in time for this case to 

25

arrive in this Court, because what is offered as 

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

displacing is something that is said to be imminent, not 

something that actually exists, and something that is 

imminent may never happen.  It was, of course, for that 

reason that I believe the United States suggested a GBR 

and we suggested that the case be dismissed so that the 

lower courts could deal with the unfolding events as 

they occur. 

 But the case is here now, and there is no 

9 

Federal statute or regulation that currently regulates 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

the emission of greenhouse gases by existing unmodified 

power plants, like the ones operated by the defendants. 

And the Clean Air Act works very differently from the 

Clean Water Act.  It did not put in place a permit 

system for all emissions when it was enacted in 1970. 

Unlike the Clean Water Act 2 years later, which forbids 

all discharges until they're authorized by permit, the 

Clean Air Act doesn't regulate anything until the EPA 

makes findings and imposes restrictions. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I suppose there 

were reasons that Congress adopted that approach, and 

21 

your suit would override those determinations. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, our suit is consistent 

with those determinations.  That is to say, the design 

of the statute leaves preexisting law in place until EPA 

steps in. 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 If the Clean Air Act were thought to 

displace the common law before any regulation occurred, 

that would mean the immediate effect of this 

antipollution law in 1970 was to reduce pollution 

control because -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How much -- how much 

regulation do you need before you would admit that there 

is displacement?  Is it -- is it a preemption analysis 

that you're adopting or a displacement analysis?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  It's a displacement 

analysis.  I believe it's a displacement analysis. 

What -- what we start from is that the States have a 

historic right to go to court under the Federal common 

law and that to -- to -- to deal with the problem of 

interstate pollution, and that that was a promise that 

they obtained, the Federal remedy, in exchange for the 

surrender of sovereignty in joining the Union.  So there 

has to be -- there's a strong Federal interest in there 

being a Federal remedy.

 Now, when the Clean Air Act was -- was 

passed, without any regulations, if it displaced the 

Federal common law, there would be no Federal law 

applicable at all, because the Federal common law would 

be displaced and there would be no Federal regulatory 

law.  The States would have recourse at that point to

State common law, as has been suggested.  That would be

 But this Court has said repeatedly, and it's 

4 

correct, that there is a strong Federal interest in 

5

6 

7

regulating this subject matter of interstate pollution 

with Federal law.  Federal common law is the default 

position, and when some -- when -- when Congress and the 

agency act to displace Federal law and put in place -­

to displace Federal common law and put in place Federal

regulatory law, that's when the displacement occurs.  So

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is -- what is 

your test for displacement?  When do we tell whether 

there's displacement or not?  Has there been some 

displacement in this case but just not total 

16 

displacement or -­

17

18 

19 

20

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  There's been displacement as 

to automobiles.  The EPA made a considered judgment 

about emissions of carbon dioxide with respect to light 

motor vehicles.  The EPA has made no judgment with 

21 

respect to stationary sources. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That sounds like -­

that sounds like preemption to me and not displacement, 

or at least preemption with another label.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, of course, there are 

some similarities between the two.  In each case we're 

talking about whether Federal -- whether one law 

substitutes for another, whether one law ousts another. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, maybe you can 

tell me in what -- to what extent displacement is 

different from preemption.  Tell me in this area you're 

going to have displacement but not preemption.  Or I 

guess it's the other way around, in which there's going 

to be preemption but not -- well, what's the difference?

 You said in response to Justice Kagan that 

if they've made a considered decision that this is the 

amount and no other amount higher or lower, then there 

would be displacement.  In what way is that different 

from preemption?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, the difference isn't

on that front.  The difference is that with respect to 

preemption Congress has to decide that it does -- that 

it wishes to override State law expressly.  Here what 

we're talking about is simply whether Congress or the 

agency has acted.  It's a little different.  They don't 

have to have in mind Federal common law.  They simply 

have to act in a way that over -- that -- that 

substitutes for Federal common law, because the promise 

of the republic really for the States was that the 

10

States would have a Federal law applicable to their 

11 

interstate pollution disputes, and until -­

have to have in mind State law for preemption, either. 

If indeed the State law just positively conflicts with a 

Federal statute, it doesn't matter whether Congress had 

State law in mind, does it?  I don't know -­

MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, but -- perhaps not.  But 

we -- we talk about, though, whether there was intent -­

that -- that preemption is ultimately a matter of 

congressional intent and whether Congress intended 

and -- and preemption should not be lightly inferred. 

It's probably the case that preemption should be harder

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you haven't told us 

how.  It -- it -- it's certainly not harder to find 

because for preemption you require congressional intent, 

whereas here -- whereas for displacement you don't. 

That's not the -- that's not the difference.  What -­

what is the difference? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, I think in this 

9 

context they probably work pretty similarly.  I would 

10

11 

12 

13

just say that in each case the question is, what is 

the -- what does the new law do with respect to the law 

that it is said to replace?  And -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think you're right 

14 

that under your theory they operate pretty similarly and 

15

I thought the whole point of Milwaukee v. Illinois was 

16 

that they are two very distinct propositions. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, they have different 

reasons for existing, that's certainly what Milwaukee v. 

Illinois said.  That doesn't mean they have to in every 

instance operate differently.  The point of preemption 

is about the Federal-State balance, and displacement is 

simply -- is about separation of powers and the 

interaction of various agencies within the Federal 

Government.  It shouldn't be surprising -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your point is that EPA,

unless and until EPA gets to the point of setting 

standards for existing sources, the court can be side by 

side with the agency; we know that the agency is 

beginning, it starts with light motor vehicles, and then 

it's moving forward.  But you say as long as the EPA 

hasn't gotten to stationary sources, the court can be 

conducting a similar function with -- one of many 

differences is that if the EPA is setting the standards 

they will set -- they will do it through notice and 

comment, everybody will be able to put in a submission; 

but the court substituting for the EPA, how does the 

court replicate that notice and comment process? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, you say the court 

14 

substituting for the EPA.  It would be the EPA 

15

16 

17 

18

substituting for the court.  That is, the default, the 

beginning position before there was legislation, before 

there was an agency, was a common law remedy.

agency, and we know that it operates in a certain way,

program underway.  But what they point to is an 

agreement by EPA to begin considering whether to 

regulate new and existing power plants.  That can't be 

enough.  The Federal common law exists for the purpose 

of giving States a remedy for interstate pollution, and 

if it's displaced when -- when the EPA begins thinking 

about it, then EPA could think about it for a long time. 

They've said when they hope to complete this rulemaking, 

but it is not uncommon for delays to -- to enter into 

such processes, and it could be a long time before EPA 

actually arrives at a judgment.  A lot can happen to 

delay or derail the fulfillment of a promise.

you have a Federal common law cause of action against

anybody in the world?  Your briefs talk a lot about how 

these are the five largest emissions producers, but I 

saw nothing in your theory to limit it to those five. 

Is there something that you think limits it to large 

emissions producers rather than anybody in the world?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes.  I think limitations, a 

limitation to substantial sources -- and I'll talk in a 

minute about what that might mean -- comes from the 

Restatement definition, from garden variety State cases 

about -- involving nuisance, and also perhaps from the 

requirements of standing itself.

 This case asks the Court to recognize that 

the States can sue the largest emitters of carbon 

dioxide.  These defendants produce 650 million tons a 

year or 10 percent of U.S. emissions, and individually 

they produce amounts ranging from 1 to 3 and a half 

percent of U.S. emissions.  There is no other company 

that comes close except perhaps for a handful of the 

next largest power companies. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're -- you're lumping 

them all together.  Suppose you lump together all the 

cows in the country.  Would -- would that allow you to 

sue all those farmers?  I mean, don't you have to do it 

defendant by defendant? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Courts sometimes -­

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Courts sometimes aggregate 

joint contributors to pollution, particularly where the 

remedy that's sought is injunctive relief.  If this were 

a damage action there would be a different problem of 

allocating to each individual defendant.  But the relief 

that's sought here is the same injunction. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you can lump everybody

together, so you can lump together all the people in the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why do you 

stop at U.S. emissions?  What percentage of worldwide 

emissions, every one of which I assume harms your 

10

clients, do these five power plants represent? 

11 

Infinitesimal, right? 

12

13 

14 

15

16

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Not infinitesimal, actually. 

I believe that U.S. emissions are a quarter of world 

emissions, so you would divide these numbers by four 

approximately.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes.  And in terms of 

determining what -- who is a substantial contributor, 

there are -- because I do think that at some point a 

company's emissions or a cow's would be too small to 

give rise to a standing or -- to either standing or a

nuisance claim, and there are various ways to draw the 

lines.  It's a familiar task for common law courts to 

decide how much is substantial, too.  But for an 

example, if the cut-off were producers of 100,000 tons 

per year, as in the EPA tailoring rule for new sources, 

just to take an example, then according to EPA's own 

technical data there would be at most a few thousand 

potential defendants. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you agree --

General Katyal began his argument in fairly dramatic 

fashion by saying we've never in 222 years had a case 

where the relief, the damages and the relief sought, 

were as broad as they are here.  Do you have anything to 

rebut his proposition?  Any case where it has been as 

broad as it is here? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, of course it depends 

on what you call broad.  There are -- there are many 

cases, small cases involving an attempt to limit 

discharges by companies.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's your best -­

21 

what's your candidate to rebut his proposition?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, I guess what I would

contributors, with or without others, and dismissing 

against small and remote contributors, I give you three 

State cases that are cited in our briefs:  A California 

case about a large mine that was sued for polluting a 

river when lots of -- lots of others polluted it and 

were not before the court. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, not as many as 

contribute to global warming? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, that's correct.  But we 

could talk about -- if we talk about large contributors 

here, then we're not talking about so many contributors. 

We could have it -- we could have it down to, to 

thousands or hundreds or tens, depending on how we

defined large.

agency makes its rule and that can be challenged in 

court, but suppose your plaintiffs lost this case on 

merits.  I take it this is not a class action, there's 

no certification of any class.  Other plaintiffs before 

another district court could launch a similar action 

against these very same defendants, right?  There would 

be nothing to preclude that?

any other obstacle to other plaintiffs bringing suits

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, the -- ultimately such 

things would be resolved by appeal and by -- by the 

circuit courts.  I mean, there are conflicts in many 

areas.  That's true about every district court 

litigation. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no, it's not, 

and it's not true of every litigation in this sense, 

that everyone is harmed by global warming.  So unless 

you limit your suits to the States, which would -- I'm 

not aware of a principled basis for doing that -- every

individual can bring -- every individual in the world if 

they can establish jurisdiction can bring one of these 

cause of -- causes of action. 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, a principal basis to 

limit -- the common -- the Federal common law of 

nuisance, as I said, exists principally for the States, 

for the reason it survived Erie was the Court spoke of 

the strong Federal interest in providing the States with 

a remedy for interstate pollution.  So there is a 

principle there. 

 And then beyond the States, plaintiffs would 

have to, to bring a common law nuisance claim as well as 

to have standing, would have to have a special injury of 

some kind that would distinguish them from the 

general -- from the general public.  The Land Trusts 

here argue that they, because they hold their lands in 

trust for the public, they have special standing. 

That's -- there's no need to reach that question.  This 

case could turn and should turn on the right of the 

States to protect their people from -- and their -- and 

21 

their land from -- from interstate -­

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, General, much of your 

argument depends on this notion that this suit is really 

like any other pollution suit, but all those other 

pollution suits that you've been talking about are much 

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

more localized affairs.  One factory emitting discharge 

into one stream.  They don't involve these kinds of 

national/international policy issues of the kind that 

this case does.  I mean, there's a huge gap, a chasm 

between the precedents you have and this case, isn't 

6 

there?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I don't know if I would call 

it a chasm, but there's a large distance between them, 

and -- but I would like to separate two things.  The 

international aspects of this are simply, I think, 

beyond -- we're not suggesting that this -- this -- that 

the Federal common law of nuisance entails relief 

against international defendants.  It does exist for 

interstate -- for conflicts between the States 

essentially.  So I would like to put those aside. 

 And then, in terms of the magnitude, well, 

there are many cases, not just one factory, the 

Milwaukee v. Illinois itself involved not just the 

Milwaukee sewage district that -- that was sued, but 

there were many other contributors to pollution in that 

21 

lake. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  In setting these standards, 

there would somebody difficult trade-offs, wouldn't 

there?  Could you just explain in concrete terms how a 

district judge would deal with those?  Let -- and just

determining the facts is going to be hard enough, but 

let's assume all the facts are proven, there's not a 

dispute about the facts.  So that if a certain reduction 

in greenhouse gas emissions is ordered, that will have 

this effect, it will increase the cost of electricity by 

a certain amount, and that will produce certain effects. 

It will result in the loss of a certain number of jobs, 

it will mean that consumers will have less money to 

spend on other -- other things.  Some people will not be 

10

able to have air conditioning in the summer.  That will 

11 

have health effects.

 How is the district judge -- what standard 

does the district judge have to decide those?  It's 

just -- what is it, just what's reasonable?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, reasonableness is the 

beginning.  I -- I've suggested already first that we've 

alleged that this can be done without increasing the 

cost to the consumers.  That may seem -- that -- that is 

a subject for proof.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Implausible -- implausible 

21 

is the word you're looking for. 

22

24

 (Laughter.) 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Thank you, Justice Scalia. 

 But a very good place to look is what other 

companies have been able to do or have done, including, 

60

as I suggested, in Tennessee Copper and perhaps in this 

area as well, companies that settle this litigation or 

companies that don't litigate but instead do adopt 

measures that haven't been widely adopted.  There -­

there is a practice to examine in the world about what's 

feasible and what's cost-effective, and that's not 

different from -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I suppose 

9 

cost-effective -- suppose your complaint is the same but

you alleged, what I get from reading these might be the 

best way to deal with the problem.  I would like the 

court to impose a tax of $20 a ton on carbon, right? 

And we bring all the polluters in, and the same injury 

that you have, everything's the same, you have 14 

experts who say this is how to get it done.  It's 

cost-effective, it will lead to substitution, it will 

actually bring about a world without global warming, and 

so let's do it. 

 Now, does the district judge, in your 

opinion, have the power to enter that order? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I don't think so. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right, now next 

question is going to be, if he does not have the power 

to enter that order, which could be proved to be 

extremely effective, and least possible harm to the 

61
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

consumer, why does he have the power to enter the order 

you want? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Because the common law of 

4 

nuisance is addressed to direct the polluter to abate 

5

6

7 

8 

9 

the nuisance. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, this will.  This is 

addressed to that.  It says abate the nuisance, here's 

how you're going to do it.  You're going to put a $20 a 

tax ton on carbon, and lo and behold, you will discover 

10

that nuisance will be abated.  And we bring in 15 

11 

economists. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Actually, the order we're 

asking for is less intrusive than that.  We ask the 

defendants to abate the nuisance, we ask the court to 

order them to abate the nuisance by some amount, 

informed by what information is available about methods. 

And then -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why is it less 

19 

intrusive -­

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

MS. UNDERWOOD:  Because -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- to try to get into the 

details of how an electricity company will in fact run 

its operation, than to say all you have to do is make a 

change in the dollar sign that you charge for your 

product?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, because we're not

would get into the details, that would figure out for 

themselves what the best way was to meet these standards

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wish Justice Breyer had 

made this argument in the EPA case.  I don't think the 

EPA case -­

(Laughter.) 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  And of course it's true that 

if you conclude that the Federal statutes displace the 

Federal -- and the Federal regulations displace the 

Federal common law either now or in the future, then 

under Ouellette, the same Federal statute that replaces 

Federal common law will revive source State common law, 

because of the savings clause in that statute, because 

of a choice Congress made; and that result, while less 

-- less respectful of the Federal interest in providing 

Federal law to govern these disputes, would nevertheless 

leave common law courts in the business that they're -­

of attempting to address pollution problems. 

 The suggestion has been made that the EPA 

24 

has entered the field of greenhouse gas, and that's 

25

enough, but it isn't just one field.  It only seems like

one because the EPA once said the whole subject was off 

limits and beyond their jurisdiction.  Once that 

obstacle is removed, there still remain a series of 

programs under the statute, a series of kinds of sources 

that need to be regulated.  The Clean Air Act regulates 

by substance and by source.  It's a collection of 

statutory programs, and taking action under one program 

can't displace the common law as it applies to matters 

outside that program.

 It may well be that there will be a 

regulation soon that displaces, but it would be very 

surprising if this Court concluded that the promise of 

regulation is enough to displace the Federal common law 

as distinguished from the actuality of it.

 The Court has suggested that a court might 

impose standards that would conflict with what the EPA 

is doing, but there's really no reason to think that 

would happen because if what a court sets out to do is 

find out what feasible methods there are for reduction 

and then order the defendants to make reductions that 

are feasible, that's a much less taxing inquiry, a much 

less demanding inquiry than the EPA is likely ultimately 

to make. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if the EPA comes up 

with a different number?  Would it -- than the one you 

64
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

speaks, the EPA's rule will displace the Federal common 

law.  We're talking entirely -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And will displace the 

judgment that has been obtained under Federal law? 

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  If -- it would presumably 

provide a basis for the defendant to go back to the 

court and -- and vacate the judgment or alter the 

judgment to comply with regulations, should that happen.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  And the court says 

16 

no? 

17

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  That's what appellate courts 

18 

are here for, isn't it? 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess, just 

to follow up, what is the appellate court reviewing?  Is 

it reviewing the reasonableness of EPA's judgment or the 

continuing validity of the injunction it entered 

previously?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  The continuing validity of 

65
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

3

the injunction it entered previously because once the 

EPA -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that seems to be

a displacement of the normal process of administrative

law, which we would review the agency's determination of 

6 

how best and to what extent to regulate the emissions.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  On a different litigation 

track, it is -- would also be possible to challenge the 

EPA's regulatory judgment, but in the case in which a 

judgment had already been entered, it is the ordinary 

litigation track to, if -- if intervening events make 

equitable relief no longer equitable, to go back to the 

court and ask the court to modify its injunction. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.  And I guess 

that's the central problem.  Once you turn it over to 

litigation, it's an entirely different set of standards 

that would regulate emissions as opposed to the 

standards that would apply with respect to an agency's 

determination.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I don't think it's a 

different set -- yes, one set of standards for reviewing 

an agency's determination, but the ultimate standards 

that are reached are going to be a level of emission 

reduction through either process.

 When the agency speaks to the question, the

Federal common law is displaced.  When it doesn't, and 

during what could be a long period of time when it 

doesn't, the States are entitled to a Federal law 

governing their dispute.  So we urge this Court to keep 

the Federal courts open to States exercising their 

historic power to protect their land and their citizens 

from air pollution emitted in other States.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. KEISLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Just a few points. 

 First, with respect to the merits and what 

it would involve to adjudicate this case, Justice Kagan, 

it is a -- there's a reason that this issue is so 

fraught and difficult in international negotiations and 

at the EPA and in the halls of Congress, and that's 

because it requires policymakers to allocate burdens 

among critical social goods in favor of important 

environmental considerations; and the remedies that are

energy.  And the problems with courts attempting to 

replicate what's going on in those venues are not simply 

the matter is complex, although of course it's extremely 

complex, but there is no legal principle here to guide 

the decision.  It's a question of trade-offs, how the 

country wants to balance the projected environmental 

risks and benefits against the projected economic 

benefits and costs. 

 If Congress enacts a statute providing a 

standard, then our political question argument goes 

away.  It's not that this is permanently off limits to 

the judiciary.  It's that it requires a standard.  And 

in a big intractable issue like this, Congress can often 

create an orderly framework for consideration within a 

statutory context, which it has done in part by enacting 

16 

the Clean Air Act.

 And the final point I would make my friend 

and I come at this really from opposite angles, in the 

following sense, which is the plaintiffs say that this 

is a deeply historically rooted cause of action with a 

very strong and ancient pedigree, and therefore it can't 

possibly present justiciability problems, under 

standing, political question doctrines; and we say that 

the very powerful standing and political question 

obstacles that we think are apparent on the face of this 

68

are a signal that this is nothing like the historical 

cause of action that they've relied on. 

 To classify climate change as a tort would

trigger a massive shift of institutional authority away

from the politically accountable branches and to the 

courts, which we think would be inconsistent with 

separation of powers, and for those reasons we ask that 

the Court reverse the judgment and direct that the case 

be dismissed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,

Mr. Keisler, counsel.  The case is submitted. 

 (Whereupon, at 11:28 a.m., the case in the
