CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first this morning in Case 16-399, Perry v. The Merit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Systems Protection Board. 

 

 

            

Mr. Landau. 

 

          

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU 

 

 

 

 

             

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The parties here agree that a Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

employee has a mixed case when he alleges that he was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected by an appealable civil service action and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination.  The parties dispute whether the case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ceases to be a mixed case if and when the Board decides 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the employee hasn't proven that he was affected by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an appealable civil service action.  The answer to that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is no. 

 

 

            

Whenever the Board rejects an employee's 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations that he was affected by an appealable civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service action, the Board is making a substantive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

decision on the merits of the employee's civil service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  That point has nothing to do with the Board's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction and, therefore, nothing to do with whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the employee has brought a mixed case reviewable in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

district court as opposed to the Federal Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

Here, as in so many cases, the root of the problem is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the word "jurisdiction."  Whenever the Board rejects an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee's allegations that he was affected by an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appealable civil service action, the Board labels its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision "jurisdictional."  That label is incorrect. 

  

 

 

 

 

The Board's conclusion that the employee's civil service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim fails on the merits doesn't retroactively strip 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Board of jurisdiction, just as the failure of an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged Federal question on the merits doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactively strip a Federal court of jurisdiction. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just -- just as an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

introductory question, Mr. Landau -- it's really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably more for the government than for you -- but if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government were to review, this same case could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially go from the Board to the Federal Circuit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to the Board, then to the district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is there any other scheme like that?  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there anything that the government might point to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is an analogous scheme? 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I don't think they will be able 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, Your Honor.  And certainly that detour to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit for a decision, where ultimately the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit can't resolve the case is unprecedented,

in my experience. 

 

 

5 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Certainly --

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the district court 

  

 

 

 

 

couldn't resolve the case at this point either because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the internal revenues weren't exhausted.  So if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appealability -- the civil service appealability goes to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court, then it has to go back to MSPB, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it gets to the district court only if -- if the EEO 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy has been exhausted; isn't that so? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, you raise an interesting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question, Your Honor, about exhaustion.  Exhaustion is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense.  If the government -- if you're in the district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court and the court rejects the -- the Board -- excuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me -- the court affirms the Board on the civil service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim -- again, that's really a merits determination 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that the Board has made, notwithstanding its label --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then there would certainly be a question, Your Honor, as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to whether or not the discrimination case has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhausted.  For a period --

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The government -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

government takes the position that it hasn't been in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion as a requirement.  You can't get to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

district court on a discrimination claim without 

   

 

 

 

 

exhausting your internal remedy. 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  It could take that position, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Your Honor.  And, arguably, they did -- there certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be a fight about exhaustion at that point, whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

or not having presented the case to the MSPB in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first instance was exhaustion.  But, if not, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even under -- under the government's own scenario, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district courts deal with unexhausted claims every day 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and have mechanisms for dealing with that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The district court could hold the case in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abeyance, for instance, and send the case -- and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require the employee to exhaust in the agency, but that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't mean that the case doesn't belong in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court in the first place.  That's really a --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of a remedial point.  Once you wind up in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court, our whole point here is that this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed case, so you should be in district court in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first place as opposed to the Federal Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I -- you could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

go to the district court right away simply by skipping 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the MSPB; right? 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely.  And that's one of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the problems with their argument, Your Honor, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under -- under that point, one of their main arguments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that the scheme is set up to create a uniform system 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- uniform jurisprudence of civil service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appealability decisions.  But that argument doesn't work

on its face precisely because, as Your Honor just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

stated, you don't have to go the MSPB route to do this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think you're right that it -- it's a problem.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just can't figure out who it's a problem for.  The --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- I mean, if you're concerned about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences of what the MSPB might do, you can skip it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

altogether and go -- go to district court right away; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Yes, but you certainly don't --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You -- you would have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaust before you go to the district court.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't just go from the decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct, Your Honor.  No, I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

think that's correct.  But there's two --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that -- that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that takes place -- I just want to make sure I've got 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the flow here right.  That takes place before you get to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that fork in the road; right?  If this -- this is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed case in which you file your complaint with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency --

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and then you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

go either to the district court or to the MSPB. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct.  You can --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, before you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

do that, you have to exhaust; right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  No.  The -- the -- filing your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint in the agency EEO is the exhaustion mechanism 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the agency.  The alternative exhaustion mechanism is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to go to the MSPB.  So you have the two paths there. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The point that I was making earlier, Your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, just to be clear, is that you can have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation where you go straight from exhausting in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency EEO your mixed case.  So the mixed case also can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be exhausted in the agency EEO. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That -- and in that determination -- this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7702(a)(2) -- the EEO -- the agency EEO also has to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a determination under (a)(2)(1) about the Board's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  So there has to be an appealability 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination made by the agency EEO, but we know that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the agency EEO decisions always go straight to district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  They never go to the Federal Circuit.  So it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't possibly be that there's this desire for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniformity of a -- a law of appealability in the Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit if one of the two avenues -- the -- the agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EEO avenue never sends you near the Federal Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  If you had chosen to go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly to the district court, if you had bypassed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Merit System Protection Board, would you be able to

raise in the district court the question whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

alleged removal was proper under 7 -- 7513, whether it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- would promote the efficiency of the service, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would you have at that point only the discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim? 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, Your Honor, just to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear, you -- in any of these mixed cases, you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaust somewhere, either in the MSPB or in the agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EEO.  So in -- in either scenario, you -- we can see 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you have to exist -- excuse me -- you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaust. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But say -- say you exhaust 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the agency EEO. 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Yep. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you still have your civil 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

service claims that you can bring in district court? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely.  That's the 

  

  

 

 

mechanism.  I would --

    

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The government says not, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't cite anything when it says not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  And we'd point out a footnote 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in our reply brief that we find that a very surprising 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assertion in the government's brief, because that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly wrong.  You don't lose your civil service claim. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The statute very clearly, 7702(a)(2), sets forth the

agency EEO as an alternative to the MSPB for exhausting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed claims. 

 

            

And so I -- I don't know where that idea 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

10 

came up, but we --

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. --

raises a question I have for you.  Seem -- seems to me 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that both sides agree on the premise that mixed cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can go to the district court, so the district court can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicate some civil service disputes. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Where in the statute is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that provided?  I look at 7703(b)(2), and it speaks of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases of discrimination filed under Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination laws go to district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  That's a -- right. 

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And then I look at the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

standards of review.  And the standard of review for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit talks about normal agency, APA-type 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review, in (c) --

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- which makes sense for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

civil service claims. 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  The only standard of 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

review mentioned for district courts is de novo --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- which makes sense for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination claims, but not for civil service claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that might tag along in district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So but -- by what -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority does a district court ever have the power to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hear a civil service claim? 

   

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Just to -- just to start with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the latter part of your question, Your Honor, the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, as is often the case, is not the most carefully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafted.  There is no question -- in fact, the direct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding of this Court in Kloeckner is that mixed cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to the MSPB. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But putting aside 

  

 

 

 

Kloeckner --

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- looking at the plain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

language --

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- of the statute --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- if you could just help

me with that. 

 

 

12 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Sure, sure. 

  

 

 

Well, I -- the -- there is no question, even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before Kloeckner, that the statute sends cases of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination -- basically, cases go from --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I would have thought cases 

    

 

 

 

 

of discrimination under Federal discrimination statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

are cases of discrimination under Federal discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes --

 

            

            

disputes. 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- and not civil service 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Right.  They call them that. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

You are absolutely right.  The case -- it calls them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in the statute.  But if you look, then, at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

title of 7702, Your Honor, it has -- I'm looking here --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's called Actions Involving Discrimination. 

 

 

 

 

            

So 7703, which I think is what you are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

referring to, 70 -- the exact language in 7703(b)(2), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases of discrimination subject to the provisions, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe that's the language you just read --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Shall be filed under --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Shall be filed, right. 

  

 

 

 

 

And then it sends you, though, shall be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed -- you know, subject to the provisions of 7702

shall be filed under -- and -- and what that is really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying is you file those cases as a standalone 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

complaint; in other words, you are not seeking review of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency action at that point.  When you have one of these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases of discrimination -- and, again, when you go to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the title of 7702, it's called Actions involving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination. 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right. 

  

 

MR. LANDAU:  So 70 --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But why -- I'm sorry for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking up so much time, I apologize. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

My last question:  Why does "subject to" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean it has to meet the standards of 7702 rather than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a claim that's subject to the test of 7702? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, it is.  I guess it -- it 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all sends you to the same place, though, that you all --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think the point is that when you have a discrimination 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim, you wind up in district court.  I think the text 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the statute -- 7703(b)(2) sends you to 7702(a)(1) --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or 7702, and those are the actions involving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination. 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But it's always only 

  

 

 

 

 

actions of discrimination filed under Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination statutes. 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  But what we're talk -- right,

because you have a claim on that.  But we're talking 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about such cases -- such claims within the contour of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

mixed case, which is also a case that involves a civil 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

service claim. 

 

            

It seems to me there could have been two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways to set up this regime.  You could have had a regime 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where all the civil service claims go to the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit, and all the discrimination cases go straight to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court.  But the Congress decided that it wanted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to event -- prevent claim splitting.  So it wanted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees -- because they often come -- often employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the same -- have both of these, and it wanted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create a regime, a sensible, efficient regime that would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

allow employees to bring them together. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you a question 

   

   

  

 

 

about the language of 7702(a)(1)(A) and (B), which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the provision that specifies the jurisdiction of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MSPB. 

            

            

            

action." 

            

            

So, subparagraph A says: --

   

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Yes, sir. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- "Has been affected by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And subparagraph B says, 

   

  

 

 

"Alleges that a basis for the action." 

   

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

So what should I read into the different language used 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

in those provisions?  The second one, B, certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns allegations, but it -- A doesn't say alleges 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he has been affected by.  It says, has been maybe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected -- in fact, affected by. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, you are exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right.  The government says that you should draw a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negative inference from the absence of the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"alleges" in A, and, you know, I think that, in truth, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is their strongest textual argument. 

 

 

 

 

            

But --

 

            

it? 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What's -- what's wrong with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  But what's wrong with it is, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court reiterated as recently as SW General last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

month, whenever you're talking about this kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negative implication, it has to be a sensible one, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to ensure, as a Court, that Congress really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to say no to the other one.  And I think here, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the text and structure of the statute tell us that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the A has to refer to allegations. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

As we said in our brief, there's another provision, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7513(d), that says -- and it -- excuse me.  7513(d) says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an employee against whom an action is taken under this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section is entitled to appeal to the Board.  That,

again, has to be an allegation.  And -- and that is, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

course, the way our law generally works.  As we pointed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out in our brief, the Federal question statute doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say alleges.  It just says if you have a Federal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

Our proposition is very much that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislates against the backdrop of what I'll call the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bell v. Hood principle, that when -- that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction of an adjudicatory body is triggered by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations, and the ultimate failure of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations on the merits doesn't retroactively strip 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that body of jurisdiction.  And the negative inference 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to which you've alluded and to which the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes the point is not enough to say to Congress to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throw that all out the window and to create a scheme 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where it sends you -- going back to Justice Kennedy's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first question -- on this kind of needless frolic and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detour to the Federal Circuit --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't -- I don't see 

    

   

 

 

 

the -- the needless frolic.  This question of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appealability has to go someplace.  You say it goes to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court.  The other side says it goes to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit.  But in -- in this case, you -- your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination claim is fully protected, isn't it, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you have to go to the -- to the Federal Circuit on

the civil service claim?  You can still go to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

district court with your discrimination claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  That 

  

  

 

 

 

is true.  But that is not a reason to say that we should 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take a detour to the Federal Circuit.  You -- it -- it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is true, and the government is correct, that they're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying we lose -- everybody agrees that we have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimate right, we will ultimately wind up in district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court on the discrimination claim. 

 

 

 

 

            

So the real question is, did Congress create 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a regime where, on the way to the district court, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to go way up to the Federal Circuit to adjudicate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just this one appealability question.  And the answer to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, we think, in light of the text is no. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You -- you're being generous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to the government, Mr. Landau.  The government says that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's only by regulation that they will toll the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination claim and that they could get rid of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation tomorrow.  And then the discrimination claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would not be tolled, and you could run out of time on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it; isn't that right? 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I think even you are being 

    

 

 

 

 

 

generous to the government, Justice Kagan, because I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think they say that some of these regulations don't even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily apply, and they even invoke equitable

tolling in one of the footnotes to their brief.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think some of the regulations in -- refer to 7702, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their whole theory says that 7702 never comes into play 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all if the MSPB ultimately concludes that the suit --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

the civil service action fails on the merits, if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have the appealable civil service action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Landau, does that not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

suggest that this detour to the Federal Circuit may not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be what's prescribed by the statute and that, again, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bifurcation should take place and discrimination claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should go to the district court in the first instance --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  We -- well --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- rather than hang around 

  

 

 

 

 

 

waiting in the Federal Circuit?  Hopefully -- hopefully, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a regulation that might or might not say that those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are tolled? 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  But, Your Honor, I -- I think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

the point is bifurcation -- you are absolutely correct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the statute -- or -- or let me make clear -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute wants to avoid bifurcation by allowing employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to bring these claims together.  In other words, that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is one of the --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  My question is just where. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Oh.  Oh.  Well, I think the 

   

  

  

  

 

 

question is, if you look at 7703(b)(1), it says --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

it's -- it's call -- 7703 is judicial review of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

decisions of the MSPB.  And then it says, except as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided in subparagraph (B) and paragraph (2) of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection, they go to the Federal Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the background rule is that all appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from MSPB decisions go to the Federal Circuit, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the exception is what's important here.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception is cases of discrimination, so that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting that you have cases of discrimination that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are before the MSPB. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Cases of discrimination? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Discrimination, subject to all 

  

 

 

 

 

this, are cases that can still be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Keep going.  Keep going. 

  

  

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  -- subject to the provisions of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

section 7702 of this title, shall be filed under section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

717(c). 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right. 

  

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right.  But -- but the -- so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to look, what is a case of discrimination 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to the provisions of Section 7702 of this title? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You also have to ask what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are cases of discrimination filed under 717, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

court. 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct.  Correct.  And so 

  

  

  

 

 

that -- I -- I think I am maybe emphatically agreeing 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

20 

with you and --

MR. LANDAU:  Okay.  Good.  I hope so, too. 

    

  

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm not really sure. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  I -- I -- I think I am.  I 

    

   

   

   

  

 

think -- again, I think everybody agrees that when you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a case of discrimination, it has to go to wind up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in district court.  I think, you know, the -- the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question here really is that the government insists that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under --

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  The question is where is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the detour to the Federal Circuit that you also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anticipate and seem to agree can happen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

sorry. 

            

MR. LANDAU:  No, we don't.  I'm -- I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, but you say -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is whether it's tolled while it's sitting in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal Circuit. 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  No, no, no.  I -- I do -- I was 

    

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

asked a question whether or not the tolling was enough

Alderson Reporting Company

to -- the government's position basically is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

tolling is enough to say that you shouldn't worry about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to the Federal Circuit because the discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim will be tolled. 

 

 

 

            

Our point is, okay.  The -- that somewhat 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

solves the government problem, but you shouldn't have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to the Federal Circuit at all.  We're not the ones 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pushing the tolling by any means.  I'm sorry if I was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not clear on that.  That's the government's theory. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because the government, instead of having a case, what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they want to do is have two disembodied claims that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow floating around together, and they concede that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal Circuit can only address the civil service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim. 

            

But our point is, this isn't individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims.  These are cases -- these are mixed cases that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress has joined and they are trying to rend them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asunder, and to have these disembodied things going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate places, and -- and that, I think, is the -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heart of it here. 

 

 

 

            

Again, I think that the critical -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

critical point here is that the word "jurisdiction" is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being misused.  I don't think anybody would disagree 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that if the -- if there weren't even allegations on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face of the complaint, that that would be a -- that that

would give rise to a serious civil -- civil service 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action.  That is a jurisdictional problem. 

   

  

 

 

22 

I think the problem here is that the Board is making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- the classic kind of mistake that this Court has for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 years been trying to correct, of the profligate use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the word "jurisdiction."  And it is saying, when we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide on the merits -- for instance, in this case, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided the settlement here was voluntary, so you gave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up all your claims.  That is a substantive determination 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the merits.  The Board is labeling that determination 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional.  That's what's getting us into this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whole mess, that the Board is calling these decisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are actually substantive, jurisdictional. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Does that 

  

  

 

 

 

mean that a finding that this suspension or furlough 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't of the required number of days, is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional?  Are you -- or are you just arguing that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this situation involving a settlement agreement is not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

actually jurisdictional? 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, we're saying that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or that any ruling where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the Board says we don't have power to hear this case --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well.  We're saying that --

jurisdictional?

decides -- if you -- as long as the complainant alleges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that is one of the serious civil service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions, if the -- if the Board rejects --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  First, let's -- let's go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to the suspension. 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You need to have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

suspension of a certain number of --

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  14 days, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  And let's 

  

  

 

 

 

assume that the person only was suspended for 13 days. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct.  Okay. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In fact, the extra two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

days that they thought they served was taken off of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical leave. 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  For some reason it 

  

 

 

 

 

didn't fall.  Is that a jurisdictional? 

   

  

 

 

            

it could --

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  No.  No.  Because they --

  

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You think that any 

  

 

 

 

 

dismissal, whatever the basis --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  As long as it has been alleged, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's enough to trigger the Board's jurisdiction, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

it --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But as long as the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

person thinks the Board can hear this? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, as long as the person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleges that, just as you can -- in Bell v. Hood, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person brought what turned out to be a Bivens claim in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1946, and this Court said there is jurisdiction over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that claim.  The fact that the claim fails on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits, which it did in 1946, is not a reason to say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there was not jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's a strange use of 

   

  

 

 

 

the word "merits," because generally, merits is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication of the actual claim, i.e., I was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

discriminated against or I was furloughed improperly, 

   

 

 

 

 

not that a Board doesn't have the power to hear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something.  That's generally considered a merits --

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  But, see, I think the Board did 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have the power to -- to hear that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well, look, it is --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're absolutely right. 

  

 

 

 

Every court has -- or every entity has the power to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine their own jurisdiction, so there is a circular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem to this argument. 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  And your point is --that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

started with, Your Honor, is particularly powerful here,

in a case of constructive discharge, where there is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete and total overlap between the merits of his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims and what they're calling a jurisdictional 

   

 

 

 

 

determination.  Because they're saying, hey, you gave up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all your claims in a settlement agreement.  This is all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntary action. 

 

            

That is the whole ball of wax, both for his

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I ask --

   

  

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  -- discrimination claim. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I just ask a simple 

   

   

  

 

 

question?  What happens if you had gone to the district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court first?  If you were permitted to, as you did. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, yeah, we would have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaust, either in the agency EEO or through the MSPB, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then what we would ask the court to do --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume you went to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the agency. 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you then went to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to the district court. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What happens to the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How does that get 

  

 

 

 

 

reviewed and by whom? 

 

 

 

26 

            

MR. LANDAU:  It gets reviewed in district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court.  And I think this goes back to a question that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Gorsuch asked earlier, that the standards of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review is oddly written in 7703 -- I can't remember if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was (c). 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  (c). 

  

 

MR. LANDAU:  Because it doesn't refer to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court's standard review of the civil service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  But, of course, just to be clear, that is true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for cases where mixed cases involve substantive civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service issues and procedural civil service issues, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody agrees that those go to district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So we're not asking this Court to break any new ground. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's --

 

            

make it up. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, just to continue to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Well, no.  I mean, just -- Your 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, again, I think the fact that it's not there just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't -- doesn't mean that it's not supposed to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the statutory scheme --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Just because it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

there doesn't mean it shouldn't be there.  I agree with 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you, but it's not there.

MR. LANDAU:  It's not there.


  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All right.


  

 

 

27 

MR. LANDAU:  But then the part -- again, you


  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face a textual imperative cutting both ways, because the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

text clearly does send some of the -- send these mixed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases to district court in cases involving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination claims. 

 

            

So the question, then, is, what standard of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review should apply to the civil service component of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mixed case when it arrives in district court.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe that was Justice Sotomayor's question. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and the answer to that is all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts that have addressed the issue, have held that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the same arbitrary and capricious standard of review 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that applies to agency action, generally, and that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit would apply to this, because -- because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are reviewing agency action. 

 

 

 

 

With respect to the civil service claim, the adjudicator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- the main adjudicator is that the -- the Board 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- you're just getting agency review of that.  With 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the civil -- with a discrimination claim, the main 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicator is, in fact, the district court, and you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just exhausting on your way there. 

 

 

 

 

 

I see that my light is on, and I'd like to reserve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance of my time

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Fletcher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Federal Circuit generally has exclusive 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction to review the MSPB's decisions.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Section 7703(b)(2) carves out an exception that sends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed cases to the district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That exception doesn't apply here, because 

 

 

 

 

 

the Board concluded the Petitioner does not have a mixed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, and then dismissed without deciding anything else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As a result, Petitioner, unlike the plaintiff in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Kloeckner, is not seeking to bring a mixed case into the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal courts.  Instead, he's seeking --

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's what --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's what the -- the Board 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, but we don't know that, right?  Isn't it for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court to make exactly that determination? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I think what the Board 

   

  

 

 

 

 

said is that he doesn't have a mixed case, and that has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shaped what he is asking the courts to decide.  So he is

not seeking further processing on his mixed case.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants a Federal court, either the district court or the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  He still -- he still thinks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

he has civil service claims, in addition to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination claims. 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  And the only thing he wants 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court to do, and I think this is clearest on page 18 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the reply brief, he wants whichever court it is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either the reviewing court or the district court or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit, to decide to reverse the Board's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision that he didn't suffer an appealable action and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send the matter back down to the Board for further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings on both his discrimination claims and his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil service claims. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's because the 

  

 

 

 

 

Board didn't -- said that it was not reviewing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits of his civil service claims.  But he still thinks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he has civil service claims and discrimination claims, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so he is rejecting the idea that the Board -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board has said it's not a mixed case, but he think it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still a mixed case. 

   

 

            

And the question is, who decides that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because if it is a mixed case -- yes. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  If it is a mixed case, it's

going to go back to the MSPB --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's going to go back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- to the district court, eventually. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Exactly.  It's going to be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

processed by the MSPB as a mixed case.  If he doesn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

win there, he's going --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I don't see that, 

   

  

 

 

 

Mr. Fletcher, as addressed by this statutory language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you talk about.  You know, you talk about 7702, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as Justice Alito said, you said (a) says, "has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected," and (b) says -- alleges that a basis for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action was discrimination.  But all 7702 does, is it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defines a category of cases, these mixed cases, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what defines them, that it -- that the employee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been affected by a certain kind of action and makes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a certain kind of allegation and it says, well, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board decides that.  And then 7703 says that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

afterwards, it goes to the district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But what is left completely unaddressed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is the question of who decides whether this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed case as defined by 7702.  7702 doesn't tell you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  It's a -- it's a -- so -- so where in the statute 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do you think it tells you who decides whether something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a mixed case as defined by 7702? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, for purposes -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

question could come up at different points.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

question for which it's relevant here is the question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does this appeal go to the Federal Circuit, or does it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to the district court?  And for that purposes, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think there are basically three options for who decides. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One option that no one has advocated --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm just asking you -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, you point to this language.  This language doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get you there.  I'm just asking whether you have other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language to point to that suggests that the "who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decides" question ought to be in the Federal Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, let me first take a run 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

at you on this language, because I think what it does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, as Justice Alito pointed out, is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee's allegation is sufficient as to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination content --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, it obviously --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- but not as to the other. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, it obviously makes a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

distinction between allegations and -- and being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected by an action, but only -- all that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision does is it defines what a mixed case is, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says the -- the Merit System Protection Board will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide that mixed case. 

 

 

 

            

And the definition of a mixed case has one

element, which is an actual thing, and another element, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is an allegation. 

 

 

 

32 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this is only the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statement that the Board will address mixed cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It doesn't say anything about what happens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if there's a dispute as to whether there is a mixed 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, who gets to decide that question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  And the only point I'm trying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to make is that I think -- it may not answer that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question definitively, in your view, but I think the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact -- it cuts against my friend's answer, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we should take the employee's word for it; that if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the employee alleges he has a mixed case, it ought to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated as such for purposes of these questions, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute makes an allegation sufficient only as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of two elements. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

way -- that's the way the system works, generally.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, there are all sorts of statutory programs where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are prerequisites to a proceeding.  You know, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Clean Water Act, you know, you can only proceed if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they -- the company is discharging water into navigable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters, but the system always works by the fact -- it

has to start with an allegation. 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

            

That's the -- you know, the -- the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision does say "alleges" and the other doesn't, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's hard to see how -- the -- the system doesn't turn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on preexisting facts.  The way it -- you answer facts is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have an allegation, and then you have a response and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all that. 

 

            

So I don't think the fact that it -- A did 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not use the word "alleges" can really be that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant. 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I think our system does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

work that if you have a provision that a tribunal, a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, an agency, whatever, can hear a certain kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, by necessity, when someone comes in and claims to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have that sort of case, you have to take their word for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it; at least insofar as you have to hold proceedings to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure out if they're right. 

 

 

 

 

              

I think our point, though, is that when you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have jurisdictional allegations like, say, diversity 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, or any other number of other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional elements and you then have factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings or legal proceedings to test the sufficiency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of those jurisdictional allegations, if they're found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lacking, then the result is that the case is dismissed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for lack of jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And -- and that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

and, normally, that you can appeal that, and -- and have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a choice to seek a review of it.  And you're talking 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about matters that are, I think in a majority of the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, brought pro se. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  That's right. 

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And we've -- we have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had -- I won't say difficulty, but we've had a lot of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases trying to decide whether something is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional or procedural.  And it's not always an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

easy question.  And to suggest that people, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing these things pro se will be able to understand, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, that's jurisdictional, but it may actually be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional in the sense of being a claims processing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule as opposed to substantive jurisdiction.  I -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

think you're putting a huge burden on the -- on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system. 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  And so let me say a couple of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

things about that.  The first is that this is the sort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of jurisdiction in the abstract.  Our rule turns on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language that this Court focused on in Kloeckner, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says you have a mixed case if you've been subject to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of action which you can appeal to the Board. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's all we mean by "jurisdictional." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the second point, I take your point that

many of the employees who proceed through this process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are pro se, and that's why the process takes steps to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protect their rights. 

 

 

35 

            

At the end of every Board decision is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisory about appeal rights.  And when, as in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, the Board concludes that it doesn't have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction because the action wasn't appealable, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advises the employee that their right to seek review is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Federal Circuit. 

 

 

 

            

So I take the point that this is a rule that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees may have to handle on their own. But the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system helps them through that. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the whole point of this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme, generally -- and we have said this, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears on the face of the statute -- is to make sure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the employee doesn't have to claim-split. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so we've said when the Board dismisses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your claim on the merits, you can take it to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court.  And we have said that when it dismisses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your case on procedure, you can take it to the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  You can do everything in the district court, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have to split it up, do one thing in the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit and one thing in the district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And now, for this one category of thing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which you call "jurisdictional," Mr. Landau says in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

case it looks an awful lot like a merits determination, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

but anyway, for this one category of thing, we're going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to treat it differently, we're going to insist that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

split your claims and -- and not bring the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination claim in the Federal Circuit because you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't bring it there, but instead you have to go to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit on your CSRA claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Justice Kagan, I disagree 

   

  

 

 

that this is claim-splitting.  We are not taking just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the case.  He is not taking just the civil 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service claims to the Federal Circuit again. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I -- I point to reply brief page 18 where he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explains that if the reviewing court, be it the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit or the district court, concludes that the Board 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was wrong on the appealability question, both parts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case are going to go back down to the Board for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further processing.  So this isn't the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the claim -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

temporary claims-splitting.  It's -- you know, you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to put your -- your discrimination claim on the back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burner and proceed with respect only to your civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service claim and decide, you know, whether the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board can -- can review that or not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Right.  And --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's a kind of

claim-splitting.  I mean, you can say eventually it will 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

all get into the same place, but eventually can be can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a long time.  And as I said before, your 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

37 

discrimination claim may have lapsed by then, and you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't guarantee that it will survive.  And so that seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me something which is -- is -- you know, really cuts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against the way this scheme works in the vast majority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of cases, and the way we have said it should. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  But I think the only thing --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

none of that is unique to our rule.  I think, even under 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's rule, you're going to have a threshold 

   

 

 

 

 

 

dispute about was this an action appealable to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board.  Under Petitioner's rule, that threshold dispute, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's going to be a detour to the district court to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide that threshold dispute.  And if the district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court concludes that the employee did not have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appealable action, then the employee is going to need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some sort of tolling rule or something to forgive the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the missing of a regulatory deadline, because that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

employee has not properly exhausted a pure 

   

 

 

 

 

discrimination claim. 

 

            

            

So I think I --

   

   

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  May I ask 

   

  

  

 

 

you that question.  I -- I was following your argument 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

in your brief until I got to footnote 3 on page 23.  You

know which one I'm referring to? 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I do. 

    

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So there is -- you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying that the regulations that provide, essentially, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for tolling, that there's no statutory basis for them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Are you saying -- or at least not --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  Not 7702(f), yes. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you saying that 

  

 

 

 

 

there isn't another one, or that this regulation is open 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to challenge, and if it is, then nothing gets tolled? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  No, certainly not.  I think 

    

  

 

 

 

the general rule -- the EEOC has general rule-making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority for the processing of federal employment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination claims, including mixed cases through the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative process. 

 

            

It's general rule, even apart from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular one that we're relying on here, is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deadlines are subject to tolling and waiver and other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorts of provisions.  And so I think, even apart from 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the specific authority in 7702(f), there would be room 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a tolling rule like this one. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

I think the Ninth Circuit's decision in 

 

 

 

 

 

Sloan v. West, which is one of the early pre-Kloeckner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases that looked at this question, concluded that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of tolling would be required as a matter of

equitable tolling. 

 

39 

            

So again, on the tolling issue, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

either side is going to need some sort of tolling rule, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I think there's plenty of room to make that sort of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling rule once it gets sorted out, which forum the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It is odd, though. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

It is odd that the only category of cases that you say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to go to the Federal Circuit through the MSPB are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cases in which the MSPB thinks they don't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Well --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You have two cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here, and one was come together, and the one they say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no, no, that's got to go to the MSPB and the -- I mean, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's got to go to the Federal Circuit because we need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniformity are the cases where they don't think there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a claim under the Civil Service Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I actually think I 

    

   

 

 

 

understand that that may seem logical from -- from one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

angle.  I actually think it makes a lot of sense when 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you think about why Congress made the exception for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed cases to begin with. 

 

 

 

 

            

Generally, all board decisions go to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit because we want uniformity, we want the

efficiency of just a single layer of judicial review. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

We carve out mixed cases because those cases include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims of discrimination.  Employees have a right to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

trial de novo on their discrimination claims, and you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously can't get that in the Federal Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But here -- and again, I go back to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature of the question that the employee is presenting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the Court:  It is not a discrimination claim on which 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there will be a trial de novo.  It is just the discrete 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question:  Is this an appealable action? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Everyone agrees that that question is just a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of Federal Civil Service law, of the sort that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal Circuit answers every day in non-mixed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, and that district courts rarely, if ever, answer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Then why --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that label, 

  

 

 

 

jurisdictional -- I mean, as I see it, the -- and the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee says, these adverse actions were taken against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me, I was suspended, and then I was forced into early 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement.  Those are adverse actions. 

  

 

 

 

            

And then the MSPB said, but you surrendered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those claims.  That's ordinarily like a release.  It's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

like a defense.  I don't see how it gets to be 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional. 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I think this is most clearly

laid out on page 4A of the Petitioner Appendix in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

D.C. Circuit's opinion.  It explains that the board's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

general view, which has been upheld by the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit, is that a voluntarily-accepted action is not an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

adverse action that's subject to the Board's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

So here, take the resignation.  Petitioner 

  

 

 

 

 

facially resigned or retired his employment.  The board 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only has jurisdiction over removal.  And so the board 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has said, ordinarily, obviously, we wouldn't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction over retirement, but if you can show that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you were coerced into retiring, we'll treat that like a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive removal, within our authority to hear; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'll treat that like an appealable action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think the -- the rule that's at issue 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here -- and I just want to point out, even if you don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree with me on this, that's not really the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented in this case.  The case comes to the Court on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the premise that this was decided on appealability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grounds. 

            

And even if you disagree that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular ground is, in fact, an appealability ground, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lots of them are.  Lots of them may be the cases, like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor pointed out, where there's a question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

about was this a suspension of more than 14 days or not, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

or is this an employee who is entitled to civil service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protections or not. 

 

 

42 

            

            

So the --

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Fletcher, the -- the one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing about this case that seems perfectly clear to me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that nobody who is not a lawyer, and no ordinary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer could read these statutes and figure out what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are supposed to do. 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And this isn't -- this isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your fault. 

 

            

Now we'll decide this case, and that will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make things clearer.  There still will be all sorts of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions. 

Can't something -- can't something be done about this? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  This is a case that's about, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

at bottom, not very much substantively, right?  No 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter which side wins, Mr. Perry will, in the end, get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a decision if he wants it in the district court on both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the questions. 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So what can be done to clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up this?  This is unbelievably complicated.

point that this is a complicated statutory scheme, or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your point that it's going to remain so whatever the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court does with this case.  I think the agencies are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing the best that they can by providing Notices of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appeal rights. 

 

            

And here, you know, Petitioner was advised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your appeal right lies in the Federal Circuit, here's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how to file that appeal, here's the deadline for filing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that appeal, here's information about how to file that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Who wrote -- who wrote this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute?  Somebody who --

  

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- takes pleasure out of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pulling the wings off flies? 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I think Congress was trying 

    

 

 

 

 

to balance and mesh together two systems, the Civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Service system and the anti -- and the federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination laws.  And it will find --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but the way --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way you end up, though, is a situation where, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peculiarly, the MSPB has jurisdiction because uniformity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is desirable in a particular area.  Even though it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have -- it can't enforce uniformity as a matter

of substantive law, and we held in Kloeckner it can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce uniformity as a matter of procedural laws. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And you made these arguments in Kloeckner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

and lost on procedure, and now you're saying, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction is different so we can make the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments there. 

 

            

In terms of accessibility of the statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and simplicity, it would seem wiser to prevent that type 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of, you know, splitting the -- well, whatever. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I -- I don't think --

   

   

  

 

 

 

the Court did reject those arguments in Kloeckner.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it rejected them, though -- I'm not going to tell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court what it meant in Kloeckner.  As I read 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote 4 of the opinion, it doesn't say -- it doesn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deny that Congress was interested in uniformity and an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

efficiency judicial review, it just says that the text 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreclosed the argument we were making in Kloeckner. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you please tell 

  

 

 

 

 

me, besides this voluntary settlement issue, what else 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is jurisdictional?  What else besides something that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't match 7512, the furlough and suspension? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if we go down your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

route, and I'm writing that opinion -- which I hope not,

but if I were --

   

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

45 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- what would I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

tell the practicing bar about what the board labels as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional really counts as jurisdictional? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I think you would tell them 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that it's yolked to the text that this focused on in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kloeckner, which is Section 7702(a)(1), which says that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be a mixed case, you have to have been affected by an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action which you can appeal to the board. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in Elgin, this Court explained that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions that you can appeal to the board generally are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined by the kind of action which you've suffered, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a removal or suspension and so forth, and the kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee that you are:  Are you a -- a civil servant? 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Are you preference-eligible?  Are you otherwise in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

category that's entitled to these protections and given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights to appeal to the board.  That's what's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So there's --

  

 

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- mean by --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- a whole lot of cases 

   

  

 

 

 

 

besides what I thought, 7512.  There's also cases having 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to do with whether you're a defined employee or not. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  That -- that's right.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

think 7512 only applied to certain categories of

employee.  And I think that gets to the point of why it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that Congress might have wanted to keep these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions in the Federal Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

46 

            

And this gets back to your question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice.  It's absolutely right that in some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases Congress sacrificed that interest in uniformity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it wanted to pursue other values, because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to protect employees' rights to trial de novo. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the -- the point that I want to get to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here is that the particular type of dispute at issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, an appealability dispute, doesn't implicate those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons that caused Congress to sacrifice uniformity in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other contexts. 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Fletcher, when we're 

  

 

 

 

 

talking about folks knowing where to go and making it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easier on them, can you help me with the same question I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had for Mr. Landau?  Which is (b)(2), as I read it, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talks about cases of discrimination filed under Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination laws go to district court, and everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else goes to the Federal Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, that would be a nice clean rule; right? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Individuals would know that their civil service disputes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to the Federal Circuit and discrimination claims go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to district court.  We have to add a lot of words to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute on standards of review for the district court if

they're going to be reviewing administrative actions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

We have to ignore the standard of review that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prescribed by the statute for the district court de novo 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it comes to certain claims that would come before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  We have to worry about all this equitable tolling 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well, and a regulation that may or may not say what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government says it says. 

 

 

 

 

            

Wouldn't it be a lot easier if we just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

followed the -- the plain text of the statute?  What am 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I missing? 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  So I -- I think it might be a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

simpler system, but it would be a system that would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require the sort of claim-splitting that Justice Kagan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred to earlier in a much more serious way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think also I agree with you that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute doesn't expressly provide for district courts to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide civil service claims.  I think it's fairly 

    

 

 

 

 

 

read -- it's not elegantly drafted -- but I think it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairly read to allow that.  And let me give you a couple 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of reasons --

 

 

            

            

reasons --

 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Where? 

  

 

MR. FLETCHER:  Let me give you a couple 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Where? 

  

 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes.

language? 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Not reasons.  Where in the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

48 

MR. FLETCHER:  Absolutely. 

  

 

So we start with the general rule that says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- in Section 7703(b)(1) that says, "Except as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided in paragraph 2, a petition to review a final 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

order or a final decision of the Board shall be filed in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal Circuit." 

 

 

            

The provision that we've been talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that says you can bring a discrimination case in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court is an exception to that rule, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests to me that what you're doing is seeking a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review of the Board's decision, which, of course, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included civil service claims. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It doesn't say that.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

says -- the except clause says, "Cases of discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed under Federal discrimination laws."  That's what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it says. 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  But let me -- let me just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote the language.  It says, "Cases of discrimination 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to the provisions of Section 7702 of this title 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall be filed under the applicable antidiscrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws." 

              

A case of discrimination subject to 7702 is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined as a mixed case that includes both

discrimination and other components. 

 

 

 

49 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Where? 

  

 

MR. FLETCHER:  In Section 7702 itself, where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it says a case of discrimination subject to --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But that -- that just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

raises the question what "subject to" means, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and you're equating "subject to" with "meeting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the test of."  But "subject to" can also mean subject 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to.  It can be tested under.  Not that it meets the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test, but it can be tested under, right?  That's often 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how Congress uses that phrase. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I understand.  I -- I 

    

    

   

 

 

may not be grasping in that sense.  I understand that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you might use it to say this is true, subject to some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other provision that might qualify it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right. 

  

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I don't think that's how 

    

 

 

 

 

Congress used it here. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It may or may not qualify, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not that it does qualify. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I guess --

    

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Often, it's used in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sense, right? 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I'm not sure that it --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I can agree with that.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Really?  Why not?  You 

  

  

  

 

 

50 

just gave me a good example. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Then I think maybe I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

misunderstanding the question.  I -- I agree sometimes 

    

   

 

 

 

Congress says the rule is you go to district court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to, in this case, you can go to some other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribunal.  So it's describing an exception. 

  

 

 

 

 

              

I think that that's not what it's doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  Here, it's using that as a description --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Do you have any authority 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for that proposition? 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Kloeckner, which I think 

   

  

 

 

says, you know, this is a --

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Besides Kloeckner. 

  

 

 

Anything else? 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Kloeckner certainly 

  

 

 

 

says it, but beyond Kloeckner, I mean, merits cases 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that have been -- have been going to district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court for years prior to Kloeckner; isn't that right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  That's right.  Kloeckner, in 

  

  

 

 

 

footnote 4, said that in the Federal Circuit's decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Williams in 1983, which is sort of the first that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided this.  And every court that I'm aware of since 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then has followed it. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  This would be a kind

you can have a revolution in this kind of case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

51 

            

yes. 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  It would be a big change, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So when it goes to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court -- well, here, first, you could go to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court at the beginning.  You can treat it as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination, but then you can't bring the civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service part. 

 

            

So now we want to bring both.  And we go to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the MSPB.  And then we -- okay.  Now, again, we -- we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take an appeal and we go -- we have to go to the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit --

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and in -- in the MSPB. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We then can -- if they kept it for 120 days more, we go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to the district court.  Remember that.  Then, by 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way, if they decide against us, we go right to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court.  Remember that. 

  

 

 

            

Now, in the two cases I said to remember, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the district court has them, does the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court decide both the discrimination issue and does it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review the civil service issue?

that question has to be yes. 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Otherwise, you're going to 

  

 

 

 

 

bounce, bounce, bounce. 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I don't think that's right. 

    

 

 

 

 

I think those are -- those are provisions that you've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described that give the employees options to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

short-circuit the administrative process in the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, no.  I -- no, you're 

    

  

 

 

 

 

not following me.  I think I'm agreeing with you.  I'm 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying your answer has to be right, because, otherwise, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you again get the civil service part -- I mean, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination part done.  Then it would be back over at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Board again and it would never end.  And this poor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee, who is already hungry and thirsty and been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going on for quite a while, would just have another 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loop-around to go.  Am I right? 

   

  

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I think so.  Let me just 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

articulate it to make sure we're on the same page. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Our view -- and this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- certainly not all the courts of appeals have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreed.  But our view is that if an employee invokes the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions of Section 7702(e) --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and then he goes to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court. 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Does he get review of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil service claim in district court? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Absolutely, yes. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And so 

  

  

 

 

 

sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't.  Okay. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So but --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see where you're going 

    

 

 

 

 

there.  And my question --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- the question, 

  

 

 

 

Mr. Fletcher, is a contested one. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Absolutely.  I wanted to make 

    

  

 

 

 

that clear.  Yeah.  It's a contested one that we've lost 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

in a number of circuits.  I -- I think it's a contest --

that our position follows from the reading of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, which -- and this is 7702(e).  It's on page 20A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

of the appendix to our brief.  And it says that if an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee invokes one of these 120-day rules, he is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to file a civil action to the same extent and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the same manner as provided in the list of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So just as a matter of pure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

simplicity, if we could get there, why, if they're going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide in the district court, I guess, under an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary AD-law set of standards, they're going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide in the district court the civil service claim as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, and you will have nonuniformity in a whole bunch 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of cases where the MPSB decided no, why not bring this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one in too?  Because this one in too would give you the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

added uniform -- it -- it -- there's no more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disuniformity than there is in any of the other cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And all that you have here are just what he said on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

What this case is really about is whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was a voluntary departure from the -- from the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil service or whether he was really fired. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I think, Justice 

   

  

 

 

Breyer, taking this sort of decision, this appealability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination is going to take and introduce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disuniformity into a whole nother category of issues,

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

like those I was discussing with Justice Sotomayor, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's going to do it for no good reason.  Because those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are issues that are going to be -- they're pure civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

service issues.  They're going to be adjudicated on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record before the MSPB with no de novo fact-finding --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Yeah, JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  I see that. 

    

  

 

 

 

But it isn't no good reason.  The reason is you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cutting out the extra loop, the very reason that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the district court make the AD-law decision in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases where the MPSB decided against the employee. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the reasoning is the same.  It is -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, I grant you, that much more, but that much more is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a distinction of principle. 

   

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  But I -- I think it is, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Justice Breyer.  When the MSPB has decided the case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's decided the civil service claims; it's decided the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination claims.  It makes sense to say some of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those are going to have to be decided in district court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so take all of them to district court, even though there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is some loss of uniformity. 

 

 

 

 

            

It doesn't make sense, whereas here, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have this threshold appealability question that comes up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the MSPB addresses the merits of either of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions.  And some court is going to have to decide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that question.  Some court -- there's going to have to

be a detour to some court at that threshold of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

administrative process to decide if the MSPB was right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not to let it proceed further. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in our view, it makes a lot more sense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to send that to the Federal Circuit, which decides those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions all the time and which can do it in one layer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of judicial review.  Because, otherwise --

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Might 

  

  

 

 

 

want to -- ahead. 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I was just going to finish 

    

 

 

 

 

 

out the thought that under my friend's view, at that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold point, you go to the district court.  And if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the employee doesn't like what the district court does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or the government doesn't like what the district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does, you potentially have another layer of review in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the regional circuit before you can even get to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion about whether or not this was a matter that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was properly before the MSPB. 

 

 

 

 

            

In our view, it goes to the court that has a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

body of law that decides this all the time, and it can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put it on the right track administratively much faster. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You said there has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to be a detour either way.  I understand there's a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

detour in the MSPB to the Federal Circuit under your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

57 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But where is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

other detour?  I thought the other route was straight to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court. 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  It's straight to the district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court, but keep in mind -- and, again, this is page 18 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Petitioner's reply brief -- what he's asking the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court to do.  He's saying:  District court, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

please review the MSPB's decision that I didn't suffer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

an appealable action --

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- reverse it, and send it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to the MSPB for further proceedings. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think he has to ask 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that?  Suppose he asked something else.  Suppose he 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

said, I'd like the district court just to decide this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Could he do that? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I don't think he could.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

certainly don't think he could for the civil service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims, because those are claims that have to be decided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the board in the first instance.  They're subject to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chenery-type standards. So the administrative review --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  There are times where the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

district court does it without the Board's doing it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first, right?  When the Board -- when the time period

lapses? 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  It's not in our view, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

58 

that's the contested issue, where some -- some courts do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow that to happen, but in -- but in our view, it --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it ought not happen. 

 

 

 

            

And I think, in addition, you know, to -- to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- to make the point, I think, my friend has suggested 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that some of the efficiency, from his view, actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens when the employee is wrong, when you go to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court and the district court says, no, the MSPB 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was correct, this is not an appealable action, what you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have is a pure discrimination case.  And I take my --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What happens if he went 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to the district court and said, I don't care about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board deciding this issue, voluntary or not voluntary, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just want to pursue the -- the discrimination claim? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I think if that's what he --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

if that's what he wants, he should not seek review of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Board's decision at all, because the regulation that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we talked about earlier, 1614.302(b) positions him.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he just acquiesces in the Board's decision to go exhaust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his administrative -- his discrimination claim through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ordinary administrative process, through the agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EEO, and then through the EEOC, if he wants it.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then he can go straight to district court.  So if that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

what he wants, he doesn't have to do this at all.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59 

we're here because what he wants is MSPB review of his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So under your 

  

 

 

 

 

theory, the problem is that if you don't go to the MS --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you don't go to the Federal Circuit, the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, it will all get mucked up in the CSRA business 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they can't go ahead and decide it, you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wait, and it has to go back later because of Chenery 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues and the like. 

 

 

 

            

And the other side is, well, if -- if you go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the -- if you have to go your route, it's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination claim that gets all mucked up, because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may have -- you may need to toll the complaints, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion issue may be complicated.  So it's a problem 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

either way, right? 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  I think, though -- I think he 

    

   

 

 

 

 

has our problem, too.  We -- we solve the problem that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have with his, but he has --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  By -- by the tolling 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and allowing them to start over again? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes, because -- but you need 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, too, even if you send these cases to the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  Because if the district court agrees with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MSPB, and says, you didn't have an appealable action,

first of all, the government is going to have a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong argument that he hasn't exhausted his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60 

administrative remedies because he hasn't. 

 

 

 

 

            

And, second of all, in those circumstances, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the employee may not want to proceed in district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Very often federal employees who have discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims want to get reviewed before an administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

body, like the MSPB or the EEOC, because it's easier to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigate there. 

 

            

And so here, if -- if he goes to district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, and the district court says, the MSPB was right, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't have an appealable action, you're not entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to further proceedings in the MSPB, many employees in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that circumstance might decide that they don't want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursue further proceedings in the district court.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

might decide, I want to go back and avail myself of my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative remedies. 

 

            

And what our rule does is it gets you a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quick decision from the Federal Circuit on that question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that puts the employees in a position to go back and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make that election.  Do I want to continue to pursue 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative remedies through the EEOC, or do I want 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to go ahead and get a final decision from the agency 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EEO, and proceed directly to district court on a pure 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination claim?

That's the circumstance he would have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in, if he had just accepted the MSPB's decision.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the regulations provide, if he hadn't appealed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And we think that's the same position that he ought to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be in if he goes to a court and seeks review, but is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unsuccessful. 

            

We -- we actually think it's sort of odd to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let an employee who seeks review of the MSPB's decision, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and loses, somehow skips some steps of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative process, or ends up in a different

the relevant agency's interpretation of the statute as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well.  And I omitted in my opening presentation to refer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the regulations, both from the EEOC and from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MSPB, that actually say that the -- interpret the

statute just the way we do, that the jurisdiction over a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed question turns on the allegations and not just the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62 

outcome of the -- of the civil service action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For the EEOC regulation, it's 29 C.F.R. 16 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point -- 1614.302(a)(2), and from the MSPB perspective, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's 5 C.F.R. 1201.151(a)(1).  So this is the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

government -- the agencies themselves actually interpret 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute just exactly the way we do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The second point I'd like to make is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was some allusion to this in the questioning of my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend.  The -- the procedural substantive 

  

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional lines are among the most elusive in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  And asking pro se litigants to make these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions is a fool's errand. 

   

 

 

            

And there will be -- unless you're to say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the government seems to suggest, that the MSPB's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

views on what is jurisdictional is conclusive, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot be reviewed, if they say it's jurisdictional, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is jurisdictional, then this Court, presumably, and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be drowning for years in cases regarding whether or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a particular MSPB action was, in fact, properly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

characterized as procedural, substantive, or 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional. 

              

I think our view has the simplicity of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, if you made the allegations, regardless of the

civil service action, regardless of whether or not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63 

agency accepts those allegations, you have a mixed case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that goes to the district court just like procedural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissals and just like substantive issues, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district courts handle it.  That's a simple regime for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

agents -- for affected government employees and agencies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and courts to handle. 

 

 

 

            

And, finally, as this Court said, actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in announcing Kloeckner, the government's position in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case is just too complicated to be right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank you. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the
