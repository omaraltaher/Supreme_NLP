CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument in


next No. 01-408, The Holmes Group v. Vornado Air


Circulation Systems, Inc. 


Mr. Dabney. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DABNEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This case concerns how far the Federal Circuit


can properly go in taking jurisdiction to the exclusion of


the regional circuits.


In its recent construction of its appellate


jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit has effectively taken


the position that the defendant's answer containing a


patent counterclaim acts like a super removal petition. 


The Federal Circuit says that if the defendant in a non-


patent suit files an answer that includes a patent


counterclaim, that pleading automatically removes the


plaintiff's non-patent suits from regional circuit


jurisdiction and transfers it to Federal Circuit


jurisdiction. 


According to the respondent, that same pleading


automatically has the effect of changing the substantive

law governing non-patent claims in the plaintiff's non-


patent suit from regional circuit to Federal Circuit law,


and the decision below demonstrates that these principles


apply even when a judgment is entered which doesn't


address patent law at all. 


The petitioner respectfully submits that the


decision below is antithetical to what the Congress had in


mind when it established the Federal Circuit.


QUESTION:  Well, Congress did want patent law to


be uniform, didn't it? 


MR. DABNEY:  Congress --


QUESTION:  I mean, that's why it placed the


jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the Federal


Circuit. 


MR. DABNEY:  One -- Mr. -- Your Honor, one of


the Congress' objectives in establishing the Federal


Circuit certainly was --


QUESTION:  And to the extent that you then allow


the other courts of appeals to deal with patent claims,


you're defeating that uniformity goal. 


MR. DABNEY:  Your Honor, the Congress in


enacting 1295, according to this Court in Christianson,


establishes not that every case in which a Federal patent


claim is raised automatically goes to the Federal Circuit. 


This Court in Christianson held -- this Court in

Christianson addressed the question, how do we know if a


case belongs in the Federal Circuit?  That was the


specific question raised in Christianson. 


Citing the legislative history of 1295, this


Court answered that question.  Cases fall within the


exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit, this Court


held, in the same sense that cases are said to arise under


Federal -- under Federal law for purposes of Federal


question jurisdiction. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Dabney, has the Federal Circuit


held that whenever there's a patent claim in a -- in a --


a patent issue in a counterclaim, it has jurisdiction?  Or


must it be a compulsory counterclaim?


MR. DABNEY:  The Federal Circuit has held in the


DSC Communications case that permissive or compulsory, it


doesn't matter. 


QUESTION:  It doesn't matter. 


QUESTION:  But in this case --


QUESTION:  In this case, it was compulsory. 


Right? 


MR. DABNEY:  Your Honor, it is far from clear


that the counterclaim in this case was in fact compulsory. 


The -- and the -- and the Court can see that most clearly


by looking at the answer that was actually filed in this


case, which appears on pages 94 to 98 of the lodging.  The

one thing that's conspicuously absent from the answer


filed in this case was any counterclaim for trade dress


infringement.  Well, if this was --


QUESTION:  But did -- did the court of appeals


say in this case that the -- the counterclaim was


compulsory?


MR. DABNEY:  The court of appeals did not say


that.  There's absolutely nothing in the decision --


QUESTION:  We're not talking about the trade


dress claim.  It was the patent infringement counterclaim


that was in question. 


MR. DABNEY:  The respondent has taken the


position that the patent counterclaim that it filed in


this particular case was compulsory within the meaning of


rule 13.  No court has passed on that question that --


QUESTION:  Did it not arise out of the same


transaction and occurrence which under the rules is


interpreted broadly? 


MR. DABNEY:  The subject matter of that


counterclaim was, at the time it was filed, the subject of


another pending proceeding.  And it is far from clear that


this respondent was under any legal duty whatsoever to


assert that patent counterclaim at any believable risk to


itself. 


QUESTION:  Suppose that respondent who started

his own show in the -- in the CIT -- when the defendant in


that case turns up as plaintiff in Kansas District Court


-- was it?  The -- the district court here? 


MR. DABNEY:  At the time that the present action


was commenced, the plaintiff in this action was one of


three named people whom the respondent was trying to get


an investigation started against. 


QUESTION:  No.  I just wanted to know where the


forum was.  The forum that the plaintiff is suing in is in


the Tenth Circuit. 


MR. DABNEY:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  And it's in Kansas. 


MR. DABNEY:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


Suppose the plaintiff in the suit in New York


then brings that same claim in the district court in


Kansas and says, court, please consolidate these two, and


then you don't have a counterclaim.  You have two claims


consolidated for adjudication.  Suppose that were the


case. 


MR. DABNEY:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Then, I take it, the judgment is


rendered.  There's a patent claim, not a counterclaim, but


a claim, and then the jurisdiction is in the Federal


Circuit.  Is that right?

 MR. DABNEY:  That is a hypothetical situation,


different from this case.  I would suggest that the


district court has an arsenal of remedies to decide


whether that should or should not be the outcome in that


case. 


QUESTION:  I'm asking you a question that puts


together two claims, not counterclaims, two claims.  The


district court has made the judgment that these arise out


of the same transaction and occurrence and therefore


consolidates them because it makes sense in terms of


judicial economy.  Okay.  They are processed as


consolidated cases.  There's a judgment.  Where does the


appeal go? 


MR. DABNEY:  I -- I would say in practice that


would depend in large measure on the sequence in which the


matters are tried, whether they are tried at the same


time, whether they are tried separately.


QUESTION:  Yes, they are tried at the same time.


MR. DABNEY:  Tried at the same time?  I believe


that under the question that this Court has not accepted


expressly under question 2, it would be open to both sides


in that situation to request that the district court enter


judgments which would preserve regional circuit


jurisdiction over the plaintiff's non-patent suit in the


first case.

 QUESTION:  They're both plaintiffs. 


MR. DABNEY:  I understand.  And no one in this


case -- there's no question in this case as to what the


appropriate disposition would be of any claim for patent


infringement or any judgment adjudicating any such claim. 


If the question had come up --


QUESTION:  Are you suggesting in -- in response


to my question that they would -- these two cases that


have been consolidated would then be split apart for


purposes of appeal and one claim would go to a regional


circuit and the other to the Federal Circuit?


MR. DABNEY:  It would be open to the parties to


that litigation in -- where they're both plaintiffs and


they both have filed claims, to request the entry of


judgments if they felt it was in their interest to do so,


based on the outcome of the trial. 


QUESTION:  Well, you're assuming they could have


separate judgments under 54(b).  Is that what your point


is here? 


MR. DABNEY:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


But if there were a single judgment which did


include the patent claim, then I think you'd say the


appeal would go to the Federal Circuit.


MR. DABNEY:  Not -- not necessarily.

 QUESTION:  Come on.  Give us a little bit. 


Surely, surely in that case. 


QUESTION:  Well, why not?  I mean, what are you


giving up in your case by agreeing to that?  I don't


understand that. 


MR. DABNEY:  I think it's important to


understand that when a -- when a person comes to court and


asked for a court to vary the rights and obligations of


parties, seeks judicial relief, what that person comes to


court with is a bundle of rights.  That's his suit.  That


is what he's asking the court to vindicate.  This Court


has never said that that bundle of rights, the plaintiff's


right to choose who's going to decide that claim, and what


law is going to govern that claim, can be changed at all


automatically by something the defendant pleads or by how


the --


QUESTION:  May I -- may I interrupt and ask a


kind of a basic question here? 


MR. DABNEY:  Certainly. 


QUESTION:  It seems to me that you could prevail


on either of two theories, that -- that the counterclaim


should be ignored for purposes of selecting the appellate


court to go to, or you could say that in this particular


case, you got a 54(b) judgment that had -- was totally


unrelated to patent claims and therefore, in this case,

regardless of whether we agree with Aerojet or the rest,


you should prevail. 


But you seem to be arguing that even if the


counterclaim had been decided and adjudicated on a patent


issue, that you -- it would be the same case. 


MR. DABNEY:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  You're not relying on the fact that


-- that there was a severance of the non-patent claims


under -- with a 54(b) finding, that it was a separate


claim.


MR. DABNEY:  That would provide a narrower basis


for reversal. 


QUESTION:  But you're not asking us to rule on


that basis. 


MR. DABNEY:  Well, we did in the petition, but


the Court declined to accept question 2 in the petition. 


What Your Honor asked me was specifically question 2 in


the petition for certiorari. 


QUESTION:  I see. 


MR. DABNEY:  And the Court did not accept that


question before the Court.  Hence, we're up on the broader


question of whether or not the plaintiff's well-pleaded


complaint continues to govern the basis of arising under


jurisdiction in the Federal court.


In Christianson, to decide this case, the Court

need look hardly beyond 486 U.S., page 814.  Right then


and there the Court was faced with the question, how do we


know if a case properly belongs in the Federal Circuit? 


And the Court held, we know that because Congress has told


us the answer.  What Congress said is, cases fall within


the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit in the


same way that they are said to arise under Federal law for


purposes of general Federal question jurisdiction under


1331.  The cases are legion which say that what a


defendant pleads in its answer, whether it's an


affirmative defense or a counterclaim, is irrelevant to


whether a case falls within the original arising under


jurisdiction of the Federal court. 


QUESTION:  In the -- in the context where


there's a great concern about Federal-State relations,


cases lodged in the State court being lifted out of that


State court and put into a Federal court, this context is


totally different.  It is an entirely Federal context, and


it's a question of which appellate forum it goes to.  And


it seems to me that you can't just say that what arising


under means in the original jurisdiction context it


necessarily means when we're talking about an exclusive


appellate forum for a case that's colored Federal totally. 


There's no State element in it. 


MR. DABNEY:  Your Honor, I would say two things


12

in response to that. 


In the first place, that was exactly the


argument which the respondent in Christianson made.  In


footnote 2 of Christianson, the Court expressly recited


maybe our arising under jurisprudence is irrelevant in


this case since, after all, we're only deciding whether


the Seventh Circuit or the Federal Circuit should decide


this antitrust case in which the district court


invalidated a number of patents.


And citing the legislative history that the


Congress chose, for better or for worse, to make the


referent of Federal Circuit jurisdiction the same as the


referent of district court jurisdiction under 1331 and


1338, under the page and in the passage that I just read,


this Court I believe specifically considered and decided


that notwithstanding that the outcome in this type of case


is simply which of two Federal courts of appeals will hear


a case.  Nevertheless, for better or for worse, Congress


has decided that the referent of Federal Circuit


jurisdiction is the same. 


QUESTION:  Christianson was the first time the


Court encountered this issue, and Christianson affirmed


the Federal Circuit.  The Federal Circuit said, we don't


have the appellate authority in this case.


A couple of years later, the Federal Circuit

looked at the issue again in Aerojet and it wrote an


opinion saying these are different.  In one case we were


dealing with a defense, an issue, a question, and in


another case, we've got a claim.  And for purposes of


which court of appeals it goes to, maybe the court is --


in Aerojet is saying we have to qualify Christianson's


reasoning if not -- not its result.


MR. DABNEY:  Justice Ginsburg, in Aerojet, the


Federal Circuit stated, among other things, that the


traditional prerogative of the plaintiff to choose his law


and to choose his court applies only to the trial court


level.  The Aerojet case said that the plaintiff in that


case had fully exhausted his right to choose his court and


to choose his law because he had access to a district


court forum.


This Court -- this case demonstrates how that


rationale of Aerojet is mischievous and dangerous and


incorrect.  Since Aerojet in 1989, there has been a sea


change in the Federal Circuit's approach to what law it


chooses to apply in cases such as this, and it is the


Federal Circuit's choice of law approach, adopted in the


late 1990's, which has given birth to this entire action.


QUESTION:  When you say choice of law, you're


not talking strictly about patent law, I take it.


MR. DABNEY:  Absolutely not.  This -- it's

undisputed that what --


QUESTION:  You're talking about Federal law


interpreted differently by different circuits. 


MR. DABNEY:  Precisely.


QUESTION:  It's not like am I going to choose


the law of France or the law of Oklahoma versus the law of


New York.


MR. DABNEY:  That's absolutely the case.  And


the Federal Circuit, being a co-equal court of appeals, is


fully entitled, I suppose, to fashion its own liability


rules and apply them even to claims over which it has only


nonexclusive or pendent jurisdiction.  But by doing that,


it has given rise to great incentives, which the


respondent has attempted to avail itself of in this case,


to get a case into the Federal Circuit and take advantage


of the different law of the Federal Circuit on a non-


patent claim. 


So, I would suggest to Your Honor that this


Court has never wavered from the idea that a person who


comes to court seeking relief -- there's a lot of


uncertainty in litigation.  I'm called upon to advise


clients all the time whether they should or should not


bring suit, where they should bring suit, how they should


bring suit.  The one thing this Court has said, whatever


else is uncertain in litigation, the one thing you know

is, number one, if you bring a suit, you have -- you are


absolute master to decide what law you're going to rely on


in your complaint.  That's your claim.  If I specify the


law of California in my complaint, that's my choice.  If


the plaintiff specifies the law of the Tenth Circuit or a


judgment of the Tenth Circuit, that is the plaintiff's


choice. 


QUESTION:  That's a little odd, don't you think? 


We are talking about one law, a Federal law.  It is not


quite the same as talking about the law of California, the


law of Nevada.  And wasn't one of the purposes of having


the Federal Circuit so that you would reduce the number of


disparities in -- in Federal law? 


MR. DABNEY:  Well, early in its history the


Federal Circuit seemed to be more mindful of that type of


conflict than it is today. 


It's very important that Your Honor understand. 


In the Midwest case, which fomented this whole thing, the


1999 Midwest case, that was a case that involved not just


Federal law claims, that was a case that involved claims


under Iowa State law.  And the Federal Circuit in that


case was considering whether or not a plaintiff could


properly claim trade dress protection for the shape a boat


trailer winch post.  And the district court had granted


summary judgment dismissing the plaintiff's claims not

just under the Lanham Act, but under Iowa State law.


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you don't mean that the


Federal Circuit has asserted that where you have a State


claim, that it's going to apply Federal law to that State


claim.


MR. DABNEY:  That is exactly what it did in the


Midwest case.  The Federal Circuit --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dabney, we're all quite close to


you.  I think perhaps we can hear you even if you don't


speak so quite so loudly. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  You -- you are saying that the


Federal Circuit said we have the right not only to


determine what is an answer to a Federal issue, but we


have a right to tell Iowa what the law of the State of


Iowa is?  That would be astonishing. 


MR. DABNEY:  I invite Your Honor to look at


pages 1564 and 65 of volume 175 of Federal 3rd, and Your


Honor will read there that the Federal Circuit reversed a


summary judgment under Iowa State law on the ground that


in its view the Federal patent law doesn't limit any claim


that can be asserted under Iowa State law.  And therefore,


the district court erred in not holding that Iowa State


law could protect the shape of a trailer winch post.


QUESTION:  Mr. Dabney, would you heed my

admonition?  Please do. 


MR. DABNEY:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I


apologize, Mr. Chief Justice. 


So, therefore --


QUESTION:  On -- on one point that you made


about the Federal Circuit saying, well, if it's a Federal


question, what is the Federal law?  We decide that as our


sister circuits do.  It's just asserting that it's a court


of equal dignity, that it's not under the enthrall of the


Tenth Circuit or any other circuit.


MR. DABNEY:  I am not questioning that that is


what the Federal Circuit is currently doing, and that it


-- it -- I'm not questioning it has the power to do that. 


QUESTION:  May I ask this -- just a question


about the history of what we've got before us?  Am I


correct in believing that until the Federal Circuit


changed its view and started to apply its own law to non-


patent issues as opposed to applying other circuits' law


when the case arose in another circuit, the bar generally


was totally happy with the rule that the counterclaim


would -- counterclaim alleging a patent claim would be


sufficient to give appellate jurisdiction to the Federal


Circuit? 


MR. DABNEY:  I cannot say that that is a fair


characterization of what the bar generally holds.  I

believe that the bar is very cautious in what it says


about any court in which it may appear in front of. 


QUESTION:  Is it --


QUESTION:  So, it is true that this -- this has 


become a much more important problem since they changed


the -- their rule on what they do with the ancillary


claims. 


MR. DABNEY:  It has much greater practical


significance now.  But the fact of the matter is that the


arising under basis --


QUESTION:  The jurisdiction rule is the same in


either event. 


MR. DABNEY:  Is -- is the same.  We have a


bright line test.  How do we know whether a case belongs


in the Federal Circuit or in any Federal court?  You look


at what's presented on the place -- on the face of the


plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint.  You don't inquire


into the plaintiff's motives or -- or spin-out theories as


to why the plaintiff is doing what it's doing.


QUESTION:  Well, may I ask a question? 


MR. DABNEY:  Certainly. 


QUESTION:  Not -- not your case certainly, but


we had a case called Cardinal Chemical Company v. Morton


International in 1993, which seemed to say that a patent


law counterclaim could serve as an independent basis for a

district court's original jurisdiction.


MR. DABNEY:  That's not how I read Cardinal


Chemical, Justice O'Connor. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. DABNEY:  Cardinal Chemical was a straight-


up patent infringement case.  The defendant in that case


asserted two -- at least two things in -- in response to


the claim of patent infringement.  The defendant in


Cardinal Chemical said, your patent is invalid, and


therefore I'm not liable.  And then, as many defendants do


nowadays, the defendant in Cardinal Chemical says, I also


want a counterclaim for declaratory judgment that your


patent is invalid.  One of the reasons why I want that is


so that if you, the plaintiff, decide to pull the plug on


your suit, I can stay in court on my counterclaim.  And


that was what came up and that was the issue. 


However, it's very clear that since at least


1990 the source of a district court's power to hear a


counterclaim like that is in 1367, supplemental


jurisdiction.  The district court unquestionably --


QUESTION:  Not 1338? 


MR. DABNEY:  Not -- absolutely not.  1367. 


So --


QUESTION:  What is -- what is -- taking a case,


Mr. Dabney -- and this has come up I think again and again

-- where you have a counterclaim that would qualify for


Federal jurisdiction whether under 1331, 1338, whatever,


that for whatever reason, the main claim drops out, maybe


because it failed -- fails to state a claim.  The


counterclaim, whether it's an antitrust claim, patent


claim, copyright claim, stays in Federal court and it's


not supplemental to anything.  It has its own


jurisdictional base.  It's a Federal claim.  And if it


weren't a Federal claim, it couldn't stay there because it


would have nothing to pend to. 


MR. DABNEY:  I don't believe that's a correct


statement of 1367.  I believe that a Federal court can


retain --


QUESTION:  Are there not many, many cases in the


district court, blessed by the courts of appeals, where


exactly what I've described happens?  The main claim drops


for whatever reason.  There's a counterclaim that would


qualify independently for Federal jurisdiction.  The court


will adjudicate that.  But if it has a counterclaim that


would not independently qualify, it is not likely to hang


onto that case.  Right?


MR. DABNEY:  That is what happens --


QUESTION:  Because -- because the only Federal


peg is gone.  And pendent jurisdiction is exercised when


there's a tail that's attached to a dog, but when the dog

is gone, the tail doesn't stay. 


MR. DABNEY:  Yes.  But in that situation,


Justice Ginsburg, you're not talking about nullifying a


plaintiff's choice of law and forum through the -- the


assertion of a well-pleaded complaint.  If a plaintiff


asserts a defective complaint and shouldn't --


QUESTION:  The question I asked you is you said


that what had been going on for years before there was


1367 codified, all of a sudden that independent Federal


claim, be it an antitrust claim, a patent claim, suddenly


becomes shrunken to a supplemental jurisdiction rather


than having its own jurisdictional peg. 


MR. DABNEY:  I don't know that the legal


significance of the source of a district court's power to


act in that situation has ever been a subject on which any


legal consequences followed so that the body of law that


developed on that would have any precedential significance


in this situation. 


The fact -- the critical distinction between


this situation and the one Your Honor is positing is that


in the situations Your Honor is talking about, you're not


talking about a plaintiff who had a well-pleaded complaint


who he prevailed on being ousted of his chosen court and


forum.  I don't believe that the appropriate disposition


of a counterclaim in that situation sheds any light on

what should happen to a plaintiff who files suit under


non-patent law and wins, and the plaintiff doesn't seek


relief under Federal patent law.  The plaintiff doesn't


care what the defendant does with other claims the


defendant has.  If the respondent wants to have a patent


counterclaim, go to the Federal court or litigate a


Federal patent counterclaim in the International Trade


Commission, more power to it. 


This suit was brought to get preliminary


injunctive relief against threatened, imminent,


irreparable harm to the plaintiff's business which was


granted.  There was a preliminary injunction that was


issued in January of 2000, which remains in effect to this


day upon the posting of a $100,000 bond.  The plaintiff


had every right and entitlement to go into court, to plead


his claim in the way that the plaintiff thought would best


accomplish the plaintiff's objectives.  That is a


prerogative which this Court has said over and over and


over again is the plaintiff's right.  No well-counseled


plaintiff could possibly file a lawsuit without thinking


what court is most likely to give me the relief that I'm


seeking.  That's not forum shopping.  That's good


lawyering.  And that's what happened in this case.


QUESTION:  And what about a defendant who would


just love to have -- not particularly litigious, has a

claim, a good claim, asserts it as a counterclaim, goes


into the district court because that's where it belongs? 


I just don't understand why the rule that would apply to


the district court carries over to the specialized court


of appeals if you are, in fact, dealing with a patent


claim that's been adjudicated. 


MR. DABNEY:  This Court has held and the -- the


congressional choice of the arising under referent for


Federal Circuit jurisdiction clearly recognized that there


will be many, many times when patent law questions and


patent law issues, including the issue of validity, will


be decided not just in the regional circuits, but in the


State courts. 


Would it really have mattered in Lear v. Adkins


if the defendant in that case hadn't just said, the


contract is invalid because the patent is no good and


there's no consideration, if it had filed a counterclaim,


as was done in Cardinal Chemical and said, I want a


declaratory judgment that the patent isn't valid?  No


legal consequence should follow from that. 


And in the real world, Justice Ginsburg, if a


defendant really is concerned about maintaining its access


to the Federal Circuit, the defendant will file his own


suit, as Your Honor suggested in that --


QUESTION:  This defendant did.

MR. DABNEY:  The respondent -- and -- and it was


free at all times to pursue all available remedies in that


forum and that's not -- that's not even in question at


this point.  But just as the respondent was free to choose


a forum that it thought was most favorable to it, which,


by the way, would have been subject to Federal Circuit


review, so was the petitioner.  And the petitioner filed


suit in accordance with the rules.  It got a judgment.  It


won, and it's had its judgment taken away by a court that


clearly does not have jurisdiction to hear the


controversy.


If there's no further questions, I'd like to


reserve the rest of my time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Dabney. 


Mr. Gowdey, we'll hear -- hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER W. GOWDEY


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. GOWDEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In light of the colloquy that we've had, I want


to make a preliminary point and then a couple other


starting points.

 The first is that there's absolutely no issue


that the Federal Circuit has failed to follow this Court's


precedents and, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out


previously, correctly anticipated this Court's holding in


Christianson. 


And to respond to a question that Justice


O'Connor raised, in the Cardinal case, this Court did say,


in this case Cardinal properly invoked the original


jurisdiction of a district court by way of its patent


counterclaim.


QUESTION:  Mr. Gowdey, do you think the court of


-- the Federal Circuit's opinion here is entirely


consistent with footnote 2 in our Colt opinion? 


MR. GOWDEY:  In the which opinion, Your Honor? 


QUESTION:  In -- in our Christianson v. Colt


Industries? 


MR. GOWDEY:  I think -- I think that the


position that the Federal Circuit has taken this Court is


completely consistent with Christian v. Colt.


QUESTION:  And -- and with footnote 2 therein?


MR. GOWDEY:  Yes.  And -- and I say that because


of the reasoning and the procedures and the -- and the


considered exhaustive review that the Federal Circuit made


in Aerojet or the Christian v. Colt case.  They started


their Aerojet decision saying that the question was of

exceptional importance and, because of that, sat on their


choice en banc.  They exactly framed the question in that


case, which was whether --


QUESTION:  Mr. Gowdey, may I suggest that you


raise that a little higher?  The podium.  I'm having some


trouble hearing. 


QUESTION:  We had the opposite problem.  The


first counsel had a very loud voice and yours is very


soft.  So --


MR. GOWDEY:  I -- I do have a soft voice and I


apologize. 


They framed the question in Christian v. Colt --


in -- in Aerojet as being one where you do not have a


patent issue as the complaint, but you have a patent


counterclaim coming in.  And in that case, it was a


compulsory patent counterclaim.  Should that be a


sufficient basis for giving exclusive appellate


jurisdiction to the Federal Circuit?  They answered that


it was. 


The Aerojet opinion is -- is well-crafted.  It's


a thoughtful opinion.  It goes through analysis --


QUESTION:  Well, that's -- that's this CAFC's


ruling on its own jurisdiction.


MR. GOWDEY:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  In the Aerojet case.

 MR. GOWDEY:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  So, in effect, we're trying to decide


whether that's right in this circumstance. 


MR. GOWDEY:  That is absolutely correct, Your


Honor. 


They -- they looked --


QUESTION:  But it does seem to be unlikely, does


it not, that where the counterclaim raising the patent


issue hasn't been dealt with and what we're dealing with


is an appeal from this injunction which was rendered in


the plaintiff's suit below -- why should the CAFC get into


it at all?


MR. GOWDEY:  Because we should look at


jurisdiction for an appellate court at the time of the


pleading stage of the case, Your Honor.  And at the


pleading stage, you have the complaint and you have the


answer and counterclaims --


QUESTION:  I would think it would have to be


considered also in light of what's happened in this case. 


I don't see why you would be so limited necessarily.  It


seems so odd that this appeal would go to the Federal


Circuit.


MR. GOWDEY:  I -- I don't think it's odd, Your


Honor.  I think that you have to establish appellate


jurisdiction at the beginning of a case so that as a case

proceeds, if there are interlocutory appeals that -- that


are going to happen, where is it that they should be


properly directed?  And there should not be a conundrum as


-- as to that.  And if you look at the claims in the case,


if you look under 1338 and 1295, talking about civil


actions and claims, the jurisdiction of a Federal Circuit


should -- should be decided by what claims are pled.


QUESTION:  Well, what case of ours do you think


most strongly supports your view of this jurisdictional


question? 


MR. GOWDEY:  I -- I think you have to look at


Christian v. Colt and the fact that in that case, the


decision said it should be adapted to 1338.  I think the


Aerojet decision that comes along after that and its


exhaustive review of Christianson makes clear that -- that


you should look at claims.  And as you're adapting 1338 to


the patent situation --


QUESTION:  Mr. Gowdey, I -- I think Aerojet


makes a whole lot of sense if -- if the issue before the


-- the court there and the issue before us here were what


makes sense.  Then -- then Aerojet may -- may well be


right. 


But -- but it seems to me that the issue really


before us is what does section 1295 mean.  What was it


understood to mean when it spoke of a claim arising under


29

any act of Congress relating to copyrights and trademarks? 


And that's a different question.  And when you have a long


history known to every first-year law student that a case


arises under a certain law, if the well-pleaded complaint


invokes that law and does not arise under that law if --


if a counterclaim invokes it, I find it hard to believe


that anyone would interpret the statute, written with that


magic language, in any other way. 


Now, it -- it might well be the case, as you


argue, that another disposition is more sensible for the


Federal Circuit.  But we have to deal here with what


Congress said, and the -- and the whole issue is whether a


claim arising under an act of Congress isn't magic


language that -- that the whole legal community has known


for many years, which means you have to have a well-


pleaded complaint invoking it. 


MR. GOWDEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  And that's what I think we said in


Christianson.


MR. GOWDEY:  Well, in Christian v. -- in


Christianson, however, there was no counterclaim.  That --


that issue was not before the Court.  That issue has not


yet been addressed by this -- by this Court, which is why


I think looking at the Aerojet decision and looking at the


review that it made of Christianson is important for this

Court to -- to undertake and to look at.  There were --


QUESTION:  Not just Aerojet, but I would like


you to pursue that because my understanding is the same as


Justice Scalia's.  You started out by saying, in response


to the Chief Justice's question, that footnote 2 applies. 


I take it that means we now have an issue that does not


just concern patent law.  It concerns all of Federal


jurisdiction. 


You then said we look to what is filed in the


district court at the complaint stage.  Again, all of


Federal jurisdiction.


You then say that all these other cases involved


a well-pleaded complaint and an answer.  This one, though,


involves a well-pleaded complaint and a compulsory


counterclaim.


MR. GOWDEY:  Yes --


QUESTION:  I agree.  So, I look up Wright and


Miller, and Wright and Miller says it is not sufficient


for the Federal question to enter the case as a


counterclaim asserted by the defendant.  Now, he didn't


just make that up.  He has dozens of citations.  So, at


that point I think QED.  You lose.


Now, why don't you?


MR. GOWDEY:  Well, for the reasons set forth in


Aerojet.  First, had the --

 QUESTION:  Aerojet, to my way of thinking, just


said it's a counterclaim.  It's not a defense.  Okay, I


accept that.  But I still have Wright and Miller and all


the cases they cite.


MR. GOWDEY:  And -- and I think most of the


cases that I'm aware of that talk about counterclaims are


removal cases.  That's where you have a -- a State/Federal


issue.


QUESTION:  Are what -- what kind of cases?


MR. GOWDEY:  Removal cases, Your Honor, where --


where you -- and there is no issue of federalism here. 


The -- the petitioner properly brought a case in -- in the


Federal district court in Kansas.


QUESTION:  Then you're -- you're now defeating


your first concession which was with footnote 2 in


Aerojet, that we are to deal with this case exactly as if


it were a removal case because it's a question of all


Federal jurisdiction, not just patent.  The word is


arising under.  That's in fact -- I flag it because that's


what frightens me.  I thought that if all that were at


issue here were patent cases, we weren't going to make a


big mistake either way.


MR. GOWDEY:  Well --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  But once you tell me that this

involves all cases of removal, I suddenly get quite


nervous about departing from well-settled law. 


MR. GOWDEY:  Then -- then I must retract it.  It


does not -- it does not involve all cases of removal. 


This is a patent case, and -- and I think we're talking


about patent issues and whether the Federal Circuit has


proper jurisdiction of claims in a case involving patent


issues.


QUESTION:  Well, then that means we interpret,


under your view, arising under in different ways in the --


in the patent statute and in -- in the Federal


jurisdiction statute. 


MR. GOWDEY:  I -- I think that arising under is


not to be interpreted in a different way, but I think as


this Court said in Christianson, that it should be adapted


to 1338.  It should be adapted to 1338 because, under


1295, Congress was interested in getting as many patent


claims to the Federal Circuit as it could. 


QUESTION:  But certainly Christianson gave no


intimation that the phrase, arising under, should be


interpreted differently in the statute conferring


jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit as it has


traditionally been in 1331.


MR. GOWDEY:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Is there a difference in interpreting

a different way and adapting? 


MR. GOWDEY:  I -- I think it's a question of --


of looking at claims that are pled in a case.  If -- if


you look at the second point of Chief -- Chief Judge


Markey in Aerojet, he was -- he was taking a -- a look at


claims.  And a patent claim, as Justice O'Connor pointed


out earlier, has its own separate, independent


jurisdictional base under 1338.  Once you find that a


patent claim comes in under 1338 with its own


jurisdictional basis, under 1295 that is an appeal-


directing mechanism that Congress put into place. 


And -- and I think that if you go again to


Aerojet, as Chief Judge Markey pointed out in his first


reason for why the patent counterclaim should be


considered arising under and give appellate jurisdiction,


had that counterclaim been filed as a complaint, there's


no question that -- that Federal Circuit jurisdiction


would have been invoked. 


QUESTION:  But that's -- you can say that by


analogy to 1331 too, that although you can have a -- a


compulsory counterclaim will not change the result there. 


It still goes to Federal court if -- if the well-pleaded


complaint doctrine is applied.  You could say, well, the


compulsory counterclaim could have been in its own right a


case of Federal question, but that doesn't change the

rule.


MR. GOWDEY:  It does not change the rule.  I


believe, Your Honor, you're talking about removal cases. 


And certainly if -- if you have --


QUESTION:  But why does it make a difference if


we're talking about removal cases?  Because the language


is exactly the same.


MR. GOWDEY:  Because I think in a


Federal/Federal situation where there is no federalism,


there is no issue with respect to States' rights and


States' claims.  And -- and we're not talking about a -- a


reading of 1338 or 1295 where you -- where we're concerned


about somehow taking away the essence of -- of a State


court to deal with State court actions.  And -- and we're


not talking about that.  This Court does not need to, I


think, even go there. 


We're talking about a situation where you have a


Federal question that has been properly presented in a


Federal court.  Original jurisdiction has been applied.  A


-- a patent counterclaim comes in that has its own


separate jurisdictional base under 1338.  The question


then is, from an appellate standpoint, has Congress set up


and dictated an appellate-directing mechanism with 1295? 


And I think they have.  And they recognized when they


said, as long as jurisdiction was based in whole or in

part under 1338, that not all of the case would have to be


patent cases.  It could be part of it. 


And once you have the nexus between a district


court having original jurisdiction under 1338, 1295


directs that that appeal -- for the patent cases, 1295


directs that appeal should go to the Federal Circuit.


I -- I think the basic purpose of -- of the


well-pleaded complaint rule was -- was to avoid the -- the


sort of State/Federal conflicts.  Since that's not here,


then there is -- is no reason to say that there should be


a compelled disregard of -- of counterclaims.  And where


Congress' intent was to get as many patent claims as


possible to the Federal Circuit, again --


QUESTION:  But you -- you can say, I think, that


when Congress used the term, well-pleaded complaint, its


intent was to have the same sort of analysis as there is


in 1331. 


MR. GOWDEY:  I -- I think the language is the


same.  But again, going back to what this Court --


QUESTION:  Congress didn't use it -- Congress


didn't say well-pleaded complaint.  It said -- it said


arising under.


MR. GOWDEY:  Yes, Your Honor. 


And I think, as this Court said in Christianson,


by adapting that under 1338, there are -- there is a way

to accomplish both the jurisdictional goals and the intent


of Congress of getting patent claims --


QUESTION:  But you are giving arising under a


different meaning for appellate purposes.  You are


including the counterclaim, a different meaning from


original jurisdiction where, as Justice Breyer read,


everybody agrees that for original jurisdiction purposes,


counterclaims don't count.


MR. GOWDEY:  I -- I think --


QUESTION:  You're suggesting they do count for


appellate jurisdiction.


MR. GOWDEY:  I'm suggesting that they do, and


I'm suggesting that Congress recognized that in 1295 where


-- where, unlike petitioner, I -- I think when -- when a


plaintiff comes into court, clearly he has his choice of


-- of what Federal court to go to, what State, and so on. 


Under 1295, once you have patent claims in a case, I think


Congress set up an appellate-directing mechanism that --


that does not make it a litigant's choice.  It defines


where it goes. 


QUESTION:  Suppose you did do that, which -- I


mean, suppose you took Justice Stevens' concurring view in


Christianson, which was a view that would come closer to


doing what you want.  It would make sense.  You'd look at


the -- look at the case after it's decided in the district

court to see where -- whether there's a patent claim. 


You'd still lose here, wouldn't you? 


MR. GOWDEY:  Well, I think Justice Stevens


actually goes farther than we need to go because --


QUESTION:  Well, why farther?  Because I would


go just as far as he went.  You went just as far as he


went.  You look at the whole thing after it's decided.


MR. GOWDEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  Now, how could you go further than


that? 


MR. GOWDEY:  Well, I'm saying he -- he went


further.  He -- he's saying, I believe, that you could


even look at -- at Federal Circuit jurisdiction being --


being shown where you have amended a complaint later on,


that you could get a patent issue under that -- in at that


point. 


In -- in this case here, there was a patent


issue that came in at the pleading stage.  And so that --


that's the distinction that I -- that I would see.  That's


why I'm saying you don't have to go so far as -- as to say


you look at the well-tried case.


QUESTION:  Was there patents issue adjudicated


at all here?  And there was not a judgment.  The judgment,


the 54(b) judgment, was on trade dress alone?


MR. GOWDEY:  There has not been a patent ruling

yet, Your Honor.  We didn't get that far.  We haven't --


QUESTION:  So, there's not only the no judgment,


but no adjudication? 


MR. GOWDEY:  No adjudication, not even any


discovery, Your Honor.  So -- so, we have a patent -- a


patent case that has, in essence, a -- a very young one,


that has not gotten very far except for the fact that we


have this preliminary injunction from Judge Brown in


Kansas.


QUESTION:  I think it would be consistent with


Justice Stevens' opinion to say you look to see what was


adjudicated.  His concurring opinion suggests that.  And


if what was adjudicated was the patent claim, whether it


were a claim or a counterclaim, then that's what should


count.  If what were adjudicated were a trade dress claim,


then that's what should count.


MR. GOWDEY:  1338, however, talks about civil


actions, and civil actions goes -- goes back to a


description of being all claims for relief.  We would say


that you should look for the claims that are made for


relief at the time the case is -- is being pled.  That is


the point at which I think you should have appellate


jurisdiction being decided so that as interim or


interlocutory appeals happens, you know appellate court it


goes to.

 If you waited until you -- you saw what was


actually tried in a case and, as Justice Stevens


suggested, you waited even to see if the -- if a complaint


would be amended subsequently after the pleading stage,


earlier -- earlier disposition of interlocutory orders


might go somewhere else, and appropriately so. 


QUESTION:  If the district court has to decide


which of two different circuits' laws you're going to


follow, I guess he knows what the case is going to look


like at the end -- or she.  Maybe -- maybe the trial judge


doesn't because the trial doesn't know which circuit to


follow, so he doesn't know how it's going to come out. 


MR. GOWDEY:  Well, but if -- Your Honor, if --


if --


QUESTION:  It's a circular analysis. 


MR. GOWDEY:  If -- if you're looking at the


claims that are pled at the pleading stage, the district


court judge will know what appellate court will -- will


apply certainly under the Aerojet rule, which -- which


again would -- would place appellate jurisdiction at the


Federal Circuit if you have a well-pled patent


counterclaim coming in at the pleading stage as part of


the defendant's answer.


QUESTION:  But you will -- you will have the


situation then in which the district judge is -- is going

to have to defy the law of his circuit on a -- on the non-


patent issue.


MR. GOWDEY:  Perhaps that's a more difficult


question.  I think the Federal Circuit, being a sister --


sister circuit to the rest of the regional circuit courts


of appeal, certainly would make an effort to apply the


appropriate regional circuit law to non-patent issues.


QUESTION:  Well, the claim is -- and I -- I will


be candid to say I'm not in a position to -- to evaluate


this claim because I haven't gone back and looked at -- at


many of the cases on it to find out what's really going


on.  But I mean, the claim is made that the Federal


Circuit is not doing that.


MR. GOWDEY:  Well, I think the Federal Circuit


is making an attempt to look at its -- its historical base


for decisions with respect to those issues that relate to,


in effect, patent law issues.  Now, the way I read cases


coming from the Federal Circuit, they're making an attempt


to apply law of their own where they find either there --


there is conflict or where there has not been a well-


grounded set of policies or law to decide an issue.  Where


the regional circuit has laws that are not affecting


patents, my reading is the Federal Circuit is applying


regional circuit law in an appropriate way as they see fit


from panel to panel.

 QUESTION:  That's what it used to do.  You say


they -- you think it's still doing that?  It's still


following circuit rule on non-patent law issues?


MR. GOWDEY:  I think they are, and I think as


the -- the court was started in 1982, and by -- by that


measure, it's a relatively young court.  Aerojet has been


around half of its lifetime since 1990.


QUESTION:  Well, I understand at the time


Aerojet was decided, they did that.  But I thought there


was a recent -- in the last year or 2, they had taken a


different view and were applying their own law as opposed


to the Tenth Circuit law in this case on the non-patent


law issues. 


MR. GOWDEY:  Certainly in Midwest, they -- they


were -- they were taking a look at trade dress law because


of the interrelationship trade dress has on the Lanham Act


with patent issues.  To that extent, they certainly were


looking at new law and saying where there is an


interaction of laws and holdings with respect to patent


issues, that that is an area that they -- they can and


perhaps should get into. 


QUESTION:  But that seems somewhat inconsistent


with the last part of 1295(a), which in effect says that


when it's a non-patent law issue, they -- the 1291 and the


1292 and 1294 shall apply.

 MR. GOWDEY:  Are you talking about the exception


of 1295, Your Honor? 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. GOWDEY:  Certainly that's a two-part


exception, and where you have other claims pending, you


can still have jurisdiction under 1338.


QUESTION:  Okay.  So, now the trial judge has to


say, well, there may be two circuits involved here.  One


is my own circuit and it's not related, and so the Federal


Circuit won't control, but if it's somehow related to the


patent claim, then the Federal Circuit would -- so, this


-- this is a further metaphysical exercise.  This -- this


is great for the legal profession actually. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. GOWDEY:  It keeps all well employed, Your


Honor. 


I -- I think that where -- where there are


issues that relate to patent law, certainly they -- they


will be looking to Federal Circuit precedent to help them. 


Where there are non-patent law issues, it's the regional


circuit law that can and should control.  And -- and I


think that as the court develops in time, there will be --


there will be a larger body of law that -- that will help


district circuit judges in that regard. 


As respects this case, however, where -- where

we have a patent counterclaim, I think the Aerojet


decision and looking at what went on before Christian --


Christianson, looking at -- at the Christianson decision


itself and the analysis that that court did with Chief


Judge Markey speaking for the whole court en banc, very


carefully and thoughtfully gives a legitimate basis for


why a Federal Circuit should have jurisdiction over cases


where there is a well-pleaded compulsory counterclaim at


the district court level. 


Chief Judge Markey also noted at 895 F.2d at


742, in all events, the Supreme Court did hold in


Christianson or in any other case that for all cases and


circumstances only the complaint and never a counterclaim


can serve as the basis of district court jurisdiction. 


And under section 1295, the basis of district court


jurisdiction is for this Court an appeal-directing


mechanism.  And I think that's where 1295 really is -- is


important and the interconnection with -- with 1338.


If there are no other -- no other questions, I


thank the Court.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Justice Kennedy, there is no difference between different


interpretation and adaptation.  The respondent's position


would call for this Court to retreat from Christianson and


to adopt some special interpretation of arising under


unique to 1338(a) that deviates from the arising under


language as it was clearly adopted by Congress in 1295.


Secondly, with regard to the question of -- of


Federal Circuit choice of law, what Mr. Gowdey stood here


-- I just would call -- call Your Honors' attention to


page 94a of the joint appendix which is the district


court's opinion in this case in which the district court


says, Vornado -- that's the respondent -- contends that


this change in the law exception is met because in Midwest


Industries, the Federal Circuit expressly rejected the


Tenth Circuit's Vornado I holding, ruling instead that a


claim for trade dress protection was not barred by the


fact that a product configuration has been claimed as a


significant inventive element of the patent.  As part of


its ruling in that case, the Federal Circuit abandoned its


prior practice of applying regional circuit law on


questions involving the relationship between patent law


and other Federal law rights and said, quote, henceforth,


we will apply our own law to such questions. 


There is no doubt whatever that the Federal


Circuit has recently and radically changed how it

adjudicates trade dress claims, and it was the opportunity


to try to take advantage of the -- of the Federal


Circuit's view of trade dress protection which was before


the Court in the TrafFix case, and rejected by the Court


in the TrafFix case, which drove the case that's currently


before the Court, which isn't to say that the Federal


Circuit can't do that.  But by doing that, whatever


legitimacy could have been before it, even as a matter of


common sense, Justice Scalia, in derogation of clearly


expressed congressional intent, in 1989, the Federal


Circuit has done a 180 degree U-turn in its approach to


its choice of law in these matters.  And therefore, the --


a critical underpinning of the Aerojet principle has been


completely wiped out.


QUESTION:  You're -- you're telling us that this


is unqualified.  I think Mr. Gowdey said that the


relationship language is -- that it's -- it's only in the


intersection of patent law, not just any -- any question


that comes along. 


MR. DABNEY:  That -- it is the issue that was


before this Court in the TrafFix case.  It is a question


of how far State law, how far Federal law can properly go


in allowing a company like the respondent to claim


unregistered, judge-made --


QUESTION:  And I don't see what the Federal


46


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Circuit meant when it said the relationship between patent


law and other Federal rights.


MR. DABNEY:  The Federal --


QUESTION:  Questions involving the relationship


between those two.  The Federal Circuit has interpreted


that to be unlimited? 


MR. DABNEY:  The Federal Circuit has taken the


position that -- I'm sorry.  My time is up.  May I answer


the question? 


QUESTION:  Yes, briefly.


MR. DABNEY:  The Federal Circuit has taken the


position that Federal patent law does not create any right


to copy or use anything, and therefore, it was wrong for


the Court in Midwest to say that Iowa State law could not


protect that. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Dabney.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
