 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAMIEN M. SCHIFF 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 (10:03 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

1
2
3
4  first this morning in Case 10-1062, Sackett v. The 
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12  because 4 years ago the Environmental Protection Agency 
13  issued against them a compliance order charging them 
14  with violations of the Clean Water Act, requiring that 
15
16  predisturbance wetlands condition, and imposing upon 
17  them the threat of tens of thousands of dollars per day 
18  in civil fines if they did not immediately comply with 
19  the order.
20
21  never been offered a meaningful opportunity for judicial 
22  review of the compliance order, an opportunity that they 
23  are guaranteed under the Due Process Clause and the 
24  Administrative Procedure Act.
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, there would have 

they restore their property to its alleged 

 But in these 4 years, the Sacketts have

 MR. SCHIFF:  Justice Scalia, the fine would 
only have been attributable to the statute itself.  But 

1  been a daily fine with or without the compliance order, 
2  wouldn't there, if they were indeed in violation of 
3  the -- the Act? 
4
5
6  with the compliance order in effect, essentially, the 
7  Sacketts are now subject to double liability.  They can 
8  be held liable for the statute as well as for actions 
9  inconsistent with the compliance order.
10
11  understanding is that each day your clients are subject 
12  to $37,500 of fines for the violation of the statute, 
13  and an additional 37.5 for violation of the compliance 
14  order.  Is that the way you understand the penalties 
15
16
17  is -- it is in fact, I might add, how the EPA 
18  understands the penalty provisions.  In its brief at 
19  pages 30 and 31, they essentially concede that the 
existence of the compliance order does subject the 
20
21  Sacketts to liability for both violations of the statute 
22  as well as violations of the compliance order. 
23
24  did say that there would be no independent liability 
under the -- for violation of the compliance order. 
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the court of appeals 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Mr. Schiff, your 

scheme to work? 

 MR. SCHIFF:  Yes -- yes, Justice Kagan.  It

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. SCHIFF:  That is correct, Justice
 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What -- what kind of 

held liable for both, that there is a distinct civil 

1  That is, unless there was a violation of the statute,
 
2  there would be no penalty for violation of the
 
3  compliance order.
 
4
Ginsburg.  The court held that as a predicate for any 
5
6  liability for a compliance order violation, there must 
7  be first a finding of a statutory violation.  But that 
8  doesn't change the fact -- even according to the Ninth 
9  Circuit, doesn't change the fact that one can still be 
10
11  liability that is traceable only to the compliance 
12  order. 
13
14  review are you seeking?  I mean, one thing you could say 
is you dispute that this property is subject to the Act. 
15
16  That might be a question that's reviewable.  Do you seek 
17  more than that?  Do you seek review at this stage of 
18  anything more than whether the property is subject to 
19  the Act?
20
21  of that jurisdictional question as it is incorporated 
22  into the compliance order.  The compliance order is the 
23  agency action for which we believe the Sacketts have a 
24  right of review under the Administrative Procedure Act. 
And our challenge under the APA to the compliance order 
25

 MR. SCHIFF:  No, Your Honor, we seek review

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me, what
 

1  is precisely that there is no jurisdiction and,
 
2  therefore, there has been no statutory violation.
 
3
4  would be the scope of your holding?  How would -- how
 
5
6  this part of your case, what would the rule be? 
7
8  restaurants all the time and say:  Unless you fix this, 
9  I'm going to give you a citation.  Fire inspectors, the 
same thing.  And I'm -- I'm wondering how your general 
10
11 
theory or your general principle that you want us to 
adopt would fit with that rather routine type of 
12 
13 
enforcement? 
14
15
16  as -- as creating a right under the APA for review 
17  because a health inspector has come onto your property. 
18  All we're arguing is that the compliance order is a 
19  final agency action; it has stopped the Sacketts home 
building; it has imposed upon them significant civil 
20
21  liability; and, therefore, they should have a right 
22  under the APA --
23
24  is under the APA.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, this is under -- this 

 MR. SCHIFF:  Well, Justice Kennedy, we do 

not believe that what we are articulating extends as far 

would -- if you could write the opinion for the Court on

disobey their order, you're not subjected to any more 
substantial liability than -- than you would have been 
subjected to had they not issued the order.

2  your argument. 
3
4  -- and we should emphasize that we believe that the 
Sacketts' due process rights can be satisfied by 
5
6  allowing their APA cause of action to go forward. 
7
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me there --
8  there's another distinction, a more significant one, 
9  between routine inspections by fire marshals or -- or 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16
17  Justice Scalia.  That's -- that's the principal 
18  distinction between the compliance order in this case 
19  and many of the agency actions that the EPA has set 
20
21
22  imposed each day was not the $37,000, but was $10?  If 
23  you don't comply, you know, we can bring an action any 
24  time to enforce this, and you'll be subject to the 
25

statutory maximum, but during the period, the additional 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the sanction 

 It isn't the order that -- that produces 

any -- any new fine, is it?

 MR. SCHIFF:  Mr. Chief Justice, I don't 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it might go to 

under Bennett.  The -- the fact that the fine is only 

enforcement action.  I understood your argument to be 
that there was a significant extortion impact from the 
fact that these were such significant fines -- double, 
as you say -- that you could rack up for 5 years.  But 
if it's only $10 a day, that takes a lot of the wind out 
of your sails, doesn't it? 

1  sanction for the -- under the administrative order, or 
2  the compliance order, is $10 a day.

16
17  Mr. Chief Justice, in addition to the independent 
18  liability that the compliance order imposes, there are 
19  other legal effects.  Even if the compliance order had 
no independent liability, there are other legal effects 
20
21  that even EPA has conceded to.  For example, the 
22  existence of the compliance order makes it materially, 
23  substantially more difficult for the Sacketts to apply 
24  for an after-the-fact permit.  A higher --

fines, there is -- attributable to the compliance order, 
there is still the fact that the Sacketts cannot 
independently initiate, cannot trigger, review of the 
compliance order.

2  The -- once an compliance order is issued, an 
3  after-the-fact permit is -- can only be applied for 
4  under the "clearly appropriate" standard in the Corps's

6
 But -- but, Mr. Chief Justice, in response 
7  to the question, yes, of course, the amount of the fine 
8  certainly factors into meaningfulness of review.  It 
9  factors into coerciveness.  But even if there were no

17  more difficult situation where there are no fines?  It's 
18  conceded that there are fines, isn't it? 
19
20
21  unto the day the evil thereof.  We don't have to 
22  consider more difficult cases. 
 But, as I understand it, you can get review

 MR. SCHIFF:  Well, Justice Scalia --

context of the permitting process.  The compliance order 
is the order that has caused the deprivation, that has 
imposed upon the Sacketts this double liability. 

1  order to get that would be to fill in, as the order
 
2  requires you to do, which is something like, what,
 
3  $27,500 or so?

17  Engineers, no? 
18
19  Your Honor, but the Sacketts could never get review of 
that issue within the context of the compliance order, 
20
21  which is, of course, the -- the agency action that has 
22  caused their harm.  Moreover, there's frankly no 
23  guarantee that the Sacketts could even get into court

 MR. SCHIFF:  That issue might be raised, 

very well say, well, you know, we don't believe that 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How long does it take to 

1  there are wetlands on the property; and so, we're not 
2  going to issue you a permit.  And, therefore, there is 
3  nothing for the Sacketts to then litigate over in 
4  Federal court.
5
6  get one of those after-the-fact permits? 
7
 MR. SCHIFF:  There -- there is a study, Your 
8  Honor.  In terms of averages, I think it's about a year. 
9  But there's nothing in our record that would show 
necessarily that the Sacketts are eligible for a 
10
11 
nationwide permit.  But more importantly is the fact 
that the permitting process doesn't provide review of 
12 
13 
the burden of the deprivation that the Sacketts are 
enduring right now.
14 
15
16  understand what exactly you might get from the Army 
17  Corps of Engineers.  Obviously, they might give you a 
18  permit, and I take it that cuts off liability; you can 
19  do what you're hoping to do.  They might say you don't 
get a permit because these are wetlands.  Can they do 
20
21  something in the middle, which is:  It's kind of hard 
22  for us to tell; you're on your own? 
23
24  saying we're not going to issue a permit because we 
25

don't believe there are wetlands on the property, they 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could the -- I don't 

 MR. SCHIFF:  Very much so.  In addition to

for a permit. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that what -- is that 

1  could also say, under the regulations that even EPA 
2  cites in its brief, that we're not even going to 
3  entertain your after-the-fact permit application while 
4  the compliance order is still outstanding, meaning that 
you will likely have to comply, be fully deprived, with 
5
6  everything the compliance order says, allow EPA onto 
7  your property, requiring significant expensive 
8  restoration of your property to its alleged wetlands 
9  state, before you even have the privilege of applying 
10
11
12  what's critical, Mr. Schiff?  If that were not true, if 
13  you could go in, even with the compliance order on your 
14  property, and get an adjudication of whether you had 
wetlands in the context of an after-the-fact permit 
15
16  proceeding, would that be sufficient? 
17
 MR. SCHIFF:  No, it would not, Justice 
18  Kagan, because, again, the fact is that the -- the 
19  compliance order is -- well, the permitting process is 
an entirely separate agency action.  It's -- it's an 
20
21  agency action that the Army Corps goes through.  The 
22  Sacketts could get no review of the -- of the compliance 
23  order. 
24
25

You're getting review of the question that you care 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why does that matter? 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do they issue permits when 

there are no wetlands?  I thought it was a permit 

1  about, which is the question whether you have wetlands 
2  on your property.  And if they said you don't have 
3  wetlands on your property, here's a permit, your 
4  problems are finished.
 MR. SCHIFF:  Justice Kagan, the difficulty 
5
6  is that that judicial decision would have no impact and 
7  would not remedy the deprivation that the Sacketts are 
8  currently enduring. 
9
10
11  allowing you to do something on wetlands which otherwise 
12  would -- would not be allowed? 
13
14  Justice Scalia.
15
16  there's -- that it's not a wetland, what do they -- what 
17  do they do?  They do nothing?  Is that it? 
18
19  Corps would simply say there's nothing to permit because 
20
21
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then the compliance 
22  order would automatically be vacated?  I mean, doesn't 
23  the compliance order presume that they are wetlands? 
24  Hasn't the agency already made that determination?
25

there are no wetlands to fill.  But the difficult --

 MR. SCHIFF:  That's my understanding.  The 

 MR. SCHIFF:  The difficulty, 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. SCHIFF:  That's -- that's correct, 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, if they decide that 

Official 

apply for a permit, is the Army Corps of Engineers going 
to decide whether you -- whether it's wetlands?  Isn't 
it presupposed if you're applying for a permit that you 
-- you need one because there's -- they are wetlands? 

1  Justice Kennedy, is that we're talking about two 
2  agencies.  And this -- this is really the -- why -- one 
3  additional reason why the permitting process is -- is an 
4  inapt solution to the Sacketts' problem.  The Sacketts 
have been injured by EPA, by the compliance order.  And 
5
6  now --
7
 JUSTICE ALITO:  That seems very strange for 
8  that -- for a party to apply for a permit on -- on the 
9  ground that they don't need a permit at all.  If you 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  is to force the Sacketts to go through a process. 
17  They've been injured by the EPA, by a compliance order, 
18  and they're told they must initiate an entirely separate 
19  administrative action with an entirely different agency 
in order to get indirect, tangential, possible review of 
20
21  the compliance order that has turned their world upside 
22  down for the last 4 years. 
23
24  cannot provide meaningful judicial review to the 
25

Sacketts.  That's why the Administrative Procedure Act

19  in violation of the law.  Wouldn't you go in and say

17  a wetland.  And then the EPA brings an enforcement 
18  action.  They have to establish it's a wetland.  Don't 
19  they just attach a copy of the decision?
20
21  Mr. Chief Justice, because, for one, the standard of 
22  review would be different.  It would be -- under the

jurisdictional issue like that. 

 MR. SCHIFF:  No, you're correct, 

1  I'm back to Justice Scalia's question.  This -- it 
2  struck me as a purely legal, jurisdictional issue:  Are 
3  these wetlands or not?  And I don't know why you would 
4  give deference to the agency's determination on a legal 
5
6
7  Mr. Chief Justice.  I mean more in terms of the 
8  substantial evidence standard that usually supports 
9  agency action under the APA.  But -- but certainly here 
the Sacketts also contend, regardless of questions of --
10
11 
of Rapanos and connection to navigable waters, the 
Sacketts contend that there are no wetlands at all on 
12 
13 
this property, and that ultimately is -- is, of course, 
a factual question that would be informed by what's in 
14 
the record.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If they're wrong about 
18
19  that, if there is a finding in the APA process that 
these are wetlands, is that the end of it?  Or within 
20
21  that, the context of that review, can you say, well, 
22  they are wetlands, but only to a minor extent, and these 
23  conditions were onerous and -- and far more than 
24  necessary to protect the wetlands?  Can you argue that 
25

in the APA review?  Or is it just up or down:  Wetlands, 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But to go back to the Chief

Official 

 MR. SCHIFF:  No.  I mean -- Justice Kennedy, 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Who would review that 

that the compliance order would still be invalidated if 

1  you lose; not wetlands, you win.  That's it? 
2
3  we would argue that, even if there are wetlands on the 
4  property, which we do not believe there are, that --
5
6  there were not a significant nexus between the -- the 
7  alleged wetlands on the property and some navigable 
8  water in the vicinity.  But -- but --
9
and where?  Going back to Justice Kagan's question of --
10
11  let's assume you went through an APA process, and they 
12  found it was wetlands and that the compliance terms 
13  were -- had a substantial nexus.  What happens when you 
14  go into an enforcement action?
 MR. SCHIFF:  Well, at that point, then both 
15
16  sides get to create a new record, consistent with what 
17  the Ninth Circuit held.  That --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, the Chief Justice's 
18
19  suggestion that there would be preclusion you do not 
20
21
22  that the standards of review would be different, 
23  preponderance of the evidence in a civil action as 
24  opposed to substantial evidence in the APA, it would 
25

agree with? 

 MR. SCHIFF:  No.  In addition to the fact 

also be the fact that -- that, even as the Ninth Circuit

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, does anything get 

 MR. SCHIFF:  I'm sorry, Justice --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does anything get 

factual findings that there's a substantial nexus 
between the remedy ordered and the violation -- would 
that get estoppel? 

1  understood a civil action, when it goes forward, both
 
2  sides have an opportunity to create a new record or
 
3  to -- to establish by a preponderance of the evidence
 
4  the elements of -- of the offense.

5
6  estoppel? 
7
8
9  estoppel?  Assuming it's not a legal question, would the 
10
11 
12 
13
 MR. SCHIFF:  It -- it would be difficult to 
14  imagine a case of estoppel, because, again, in the APA 
15
16  compliance order is issued.  And so, the records are 
17  always going to be different, because the civil action 
18  will build upon that administrative record.  And then, 
19  secondly, in terms of the differing standards of review, 
I suppose one could find a -- a purely factual question 
20
21  perhaps that -- where the standards of review wouldn't 
22  matter, or a purely legal question, but --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This wouldn't be a problem

really the dual nature of this process that creates the 

The agency didn't make that up, right?  The statute 
provides for compliance orders, and it calls them 
"compliance orders," doesn't it? 

1  before actual suit by the -- by EPA to hold you liable 
2  for violating the Act.  Then you'd just have one -- one 
3  suit, and the -- the issue would be clear as to what 
4  burden the agency has to sustain.  But it's -- it's 
5
6  difficulty, isn't it? 
7
8  extent it is, of course, the process that -- that 
9  Congress --
10
11 
12 
13 
14
even if the Sacketts on remand don't get their ideal 
15
16  mode of judicial review, something is frankly better 
17  than nothing.  They have been told for 4 years they 
18  cannot build their home.  They have been threatened with 
19  ruinous civil penalties.  And, to date, they have had no 
20
21
22  enforcement action.  I mean, perhaps if Congress had 
23  written the statute differently to allow for some sort 
24  of judicial review that the Sacketts could -- could 
initiate for a compliance order, that might -- that

favor of judicial review of final agency action; we have

17  that go to whether these are wetlands or not are going 
18  to be decided giving substantial deference to the 
19  agency's determination of the facts, right?
20
21  Justice Scalia.  And that --

23  that, you might still think you can win when the EPA 
24  finally brings a -- a civil action seeking to impose a 
penalty, where the burden will be on the EPA without --

 Oh, now the Sacketts get judicial review but

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 MR. SCHIFF:  That -- that is correct, 

 Mr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve the

 I'd like to begin with the question of 

Sacketts are subject. 

provide separately for penalties for violating the 
statute and penalties for violating the compliance 
order. 

1
2  double penalties because I think it helps to clarify 
3  exactly what the compliance order does and does not do 
4  in terms of altering the legal regime to which the 
5
6
 The compliance order is intended to specify 
7  the violation that EPA believes to have occurred and the 
8  measures that EPA believes are necessary in order to 
9  achieve prospective compliance.  And the statute does 
10
11 
12 
13
14  the Court, we acknowledged in our brief that the 
Government reads the statute to allow the legal 
15
16  possibility of double penalties; that is, up to 37,500 
17  per day for violating the statute, up to 37,500 per day 
18  for violating the compliance order.  I think that's 
19  really a theoretical rather than a practical --
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

The order itself says that.  It says you don't do it, 
you're going to get penalized up to 32.5, which is now 
37. 

 MR. STEWART:  Well, that language in the 

order would have been accurate even if the statute

necessary to achieve compliance, and if you don't do it, 

 But the reason I say that it's -- the double 

penalties as a theoretical possible -- let me say that 

1  didn't authorize penalties for violating the -- the 
2  order itself.  That is, even if the statute authorized 
3  penalties only for violating the Act, it would have been 
4  accurate for EPA to say we believe this is what is 
5
6  you will potentially be subject to these civil 
7  penalties; namely, civil penalties for violating the 
8  statute. 
9
10
11  again.  If there were no provision for penalties for 
12  violating the compliance order, only penalties for 
13  violating the statute, EPA could accurately have said we 
14  believe that the following steps are necessary in order 
to achieve prospective compliance with the Act, and if 
15
16  you don't do these things, you will be subject to the 
17  following penalties because you will then be in 
18  violation of the Act and you will be subject to the 
19  penalties --
20
21
22  didn't follow that.  What is your response to the 
23  assertion that you're subject to double penalties? 
24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Stewart --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you don't 

 MR. STEWART:  They have the authority to do 

that.  I guess the other thing I would say is the 

1  the Act; two, for violating the compliance order. 
2
 MR. STEWART:  The first is it is a legal 
3  possibility.  We're not aware of any case in which a 
4  district court has ever imposed penalties of greater 
5
6
7  doubt that -- you don't doubt that they have the 
8  authority to do that? 
9
10
11  possibility that penalties would be increased doesn't 
12  distinguish this scheme from the sort of regime that 
13  Justice Kennedy referred to or the sorts of regimes that 
14  we've discussed in our brief.  That is, it's very common 
15
16  warnings to regulated parties:  We think you're 
17  violating the statute.

 MR. STEWART:  We have not adopted a policy 

to that effect.
 

 And I guess what I -- I do want to
 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So, it's more than
 

you're saying.  You're saying that we may ask for more, 
but it's unlikely courts will actually provide for more. 

1  seek anything more than the penalty for the underlying 
2  violation?  It will not seek an additional penalty for 
3  violation of the compliance order? 
4
5
6
7  clarify --
8
9  theoretical, then.  I don't really understand what
 
10
11 
12
 MR. STEWART:  I guess the two -- I don't 
13  know that we have ever asked for more than the 37,500 
14  per day.  Now, I think it is often the case what -- that 
what district courts will do is, within the 37,500 
15
16  statutory maximum, they will say we are imposing a 
17  greater penalty for the period after the compliance 
18  order was issued because it shows greater culpability to 
19  continue with the violation after you've been warned.
20
21  order that distinguishes it from all manner of other 
22  agency warnings. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, your order could have 
23
24  read, it could have read -- "Notice is hereby given that 
25

 But that's not a feature of the compliance

Act may subject Respondents to civil penalties. 

 It's quite specific that it is violation of 

1  Order" -- cap "O" -- "may subject Respondents to, one, 
2  civil penalties" of up to 32.5 -- now 37.5 per day. 
3  That's how it reads.  It could have read:  Violation of 
4  or failure to comply with the Environmental Protection 
5
6
7  -- failure to comply with the foregoing order, which 
8  includes not letting -- filling in immediately and so 
9  forth.  It says what it says.  It's the violation of the 
order that -- that the additional penalties are attached 
10
11 
to. 
12
13  that violating the order could as a realistic matter 
14  cause the penalties to be greater within the statutory 
maximum.  But, as I was saying, in many situations, 
15
16  agencies give warnings to regulated parties:  If you 
17  keep doing this, you may be subject to penalties. 
18
19  theoretical matter double the penalties.

6  theoretical possibility in our opening brief, the 
7  Sacketts seemed to be entirely unaware of it.  That is, 
8  all of the Sacketts' calculations as to the penalties to 
9  which they would be exposed if they continued to engage 
in their present conduct were premised on the idea that 
10
11  37,500 was the statutory maximum.  But the main point I 
12  want to --
13
14
15
16  sleep before they read your brief? 
17
18
19  that's really my point, that the one thing the Sacketts 
have never argued is, if it were just the 37,500 per day 
20
21  for violating the statute, we would be willing to build 
22  our house and take our chances, but once you double 
23  that, we're not willing to take the risk any longer,

person has been warned --

1  their argument today, either. 
 MR. STEWART:  Right. 
2
 The one point before I move on that I do 
3
4  want to make clear is, in a wide variety of contexts, 
agencies will issue warnings to regulated parties that 
5
6  they are believed to be in violation of a statute.  And 
7  it is common under schemes where the amount of the 
8  sanction is up to the judge's discretion that penalties 
9  will -- may be greater for conduct that occurs after the 
10
11
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, but those 
12  situations are slightly different because the Act 
13  doesn't specify any specific remedies that apply to any 
14  specific property.  It just says you violate the Act by 
15
16  the Act by not removing the fill and not planting trees 
17  and not doing this or doing that.  What it says is you 
18  violate the Act if you don't comply with the compliance 
19  order that tells you to do those things.  So, it's a 
very theoretically different violation that's going on. 
20
21
 One is in the affirmative act prohibited by 
22  the statute; that's the violation of the statute.  And 
23  the other is the violation of the remedial steps that 
24  the compliance order is the only thing that has set 
25

filling in wetlands.  It doesn't say that you violate 

forth. 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. STEWART:  I don't think that's correct, 
1
2  Your Honor.  First, as to of the requirement in earlier 
3  versions of the compliance order that herbaceous plants 
4  be planted, et cetera, those were removed from the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But those are not in the 
5
6  statute.  They're permitted by the statute, but they're 
7  not set forth as requirements under the statute. 
 MR. STEWART:  EPA's view of the statute is 
8
9  that -- without regard to the issuance of a compliance 
order, once fill material is deposited in waters of the 
10
11 
United States, EPA's view of the penalty provisions 
would be that the violation continues for as long as the 
12 
13 
fill remains in the wetlands.

15
16  to remove it. 
17
18  specifically -- and the Act doesn't specifically tell 
19  the person to remove it, but that's our interpretation 
of the statute.  And it's either right or wrong.  That 
20
21  is, if we're wrong about that, if the only days on which 
22  penalties can be assessed for violating the statute 
23  itself are days on which fill was actually discharged, 
24  then the provisions of the compliance order that

into account not just the days on which fill was 
actually deposited but the days on which fill remained 
in the wetlands.

10
11 
12 
13 
14 
 And Petitioners have specifically expressed 
15
16  agreement this morning with that view of the statute.  I 
17  think the view of the Petitioners' amici is to the same 
18  effect, because in many of the amicus briefs there are 
19  calculations of the very large penalties to which people 
20
21  orders, and they're all premised on the idea that every 
22  day fill remains in the wetlands --

11

19  order dealing with the planting of plants, which is the 
primary one that was eliminated in the final iteration 
20
21  of the order, is really removed from what the Sacketts 
22  have been complaining about.  That is, the Sacketts --

in there stuff that is simply not required by the EPA.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's what you

15
16  how the statutory scheme is supposed to operate, we 
17  ought to look not just at the opportunities that were 
18  available to them at that moment but the opportunities 
19  that they had forgone already.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I ask you --
20
21
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Stewart, if you --
22  if you related the facts of this case as they come to us 
23  to an ordinary homeowner, don't you think most ordinary 
24  homeowners would say this kind of thing can't happen in 
25

the United States?  You don't -- you buy property to

$75,000.  And, by the way, there's no way you can go to 

1  build a house.  You think maybe there's a little 
2  drainage problem in part of your lot.  So, you start to 
3  build the house, and then you get an order from the EPA 
4  which says:  You have filled in wetlands; so, you can't 
build your house.  Remove the fill, put in all kinds of 
5
6  plants, and now you have to let us on your premises 
7  whenever we want to.  You have to turn over to us all 
8  sorts of documents, and for every day that you don't do 
9  all this, you're accumulating a potential fine of 
10
11  court to challenge our determination that this is a 
12  wetlands until such time as we choose to sue you.

14  say is, as a matter of standard EPA practice, the 
compliance order would not be the first communication 
15
16  from the agency that would alert the landowner to the 
17  belief that there was a violation.  The record in this 
18  case does not make clear whether that agency practice 
19  was followed in this case, but EPA's typical practice is 
to alert landowners through prior communications that a 
20
21  violation is existing --
22
23  from the EPA says we think that your backyard is a 
24  wetlands; so, don't build.  So, what do we -- what does 
25

 MR. STEWART:  Well, the first thing I would

the homeowner do, having bought that property?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, what 

 MR. STEWART:  At the time that that sort of 

letter is issued, there's no compliance order, and 

the landowner is supposed to do -- the agency says, 

 MR. STEWART:  Well, once that --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, all right, I'm just 

1
2
3  going to put it aside as a nature preserve. 
4
5
6  there's no impediment to an after-the-fact permit.  That 
7  is, at that point, the landowner could ask for a permit 
8  and --
9
10
11  because you didn't apply for a permit, you're in trouble 
12  because you didn't give us a chance to say whether we 
13  were going to take away your constitutional rights or 
14  not; so, we can do it.
 MR. STEWART:  Well, the first two things I 
15
16  would -- the first thing I would say is it's not simply 
17  a hypothetical means of challenging CWA coverage to seek 
18  a permit.  That is, in both SWANCC, Solid Waste Agency 
19  of Northern Cook County, and Carabell, which was one of 
the two companion cases that this Court adjudicated in 
20
21  Rapanos, that was the way that the suit got into Federal 
22  court. 
23
24  were denied, they sought judicial review of the permit 
denials and argued, inter alia, that there was no need 
25

 The landowners applied for permits, they 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 The second thing I would say is it's often 

complying with some sort of deadline or some sort of 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I'm --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose the Corps of 

1  for a permit because the relevant tracts were not waters 
2  of the United States. 
3
4  the case that judicial review is contingent upon 
5
6  prerequisite, and once a person has missed the deadline, 
7  that person may as a practical matter be in the same 
8  position as if judicial review had not been made 
9  available at all.
10
11
12  Engineers agrees that it's not a wetland, and its basis 
13  for refusing to issue the permit is we don't give a 
14  permit; you don't need a permit.
 MR. STEWART:  It would issue a letter either 
15
16  to the effect that there was no wetland or that it was a 
17  wetland that was not covered by --
18
19
20
21 
22
23
24  action?  I'd like some clarification here.  The Corps's 
regs say the Corps will accept an after-the-fact permit. 
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that binding on --
 MR.  STEWART:  Yes, we --

Protection Agency? 

 MR. STEWART:  Yes, we would --

initial corrective measures are made. 

 And then, just to be safe, they say that no 

1  I mean, one after -- if they applied tomorrow, the day 
2  after getting this order, you'd run up against the reg, 
3  which says we won't give you any after the fact -- we 
4  won't even consider this matter, until any required 
5
6
7  permit application will be accepted unless the Corps 
8  determines that concurrent processing of an 
9  after-the-fact permit application is clearly 
10
11
 So, I looked at those two things and said, 
12  of course, you can't apply to the Corps of Engineers; 
13  they're not going to accept it unless you have a very 
14  unusual case.  So, I expect you to tell me why I'm wrong 
15
16  applications has the Corps of Engineers accepted.  Maybe 
17  there are a lot.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And yet -- so, here you're 
1

3  review, and then the second thing you say is that this 
4  isn't final.  So, I read the order.  It looks like about 
as final a thing as I've ever seen.  So, tell me why I'm

3  on whether their lands fell within the statute?  They 
4  did ask for a hearing, and the EPA said no.
5
6  hearing, but I think that would be characteristic agency 
7  practice; that is, when the agency is exercising what is 
8  essentially its prosecutorial function, that is, warning 
9  regulated parties we may do -- we may sue you if you

11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  thing I do want you to tell us is -- EPA has three 
choices.  It can go to a compliance order; it can issue 
20
21  an administrative -- trigger an administrative penalty 
22  when -- where there would be APA review; or it can bring 
23  an enforcement action.  How does the agency decide which 
24  of those three routes it's going to take in a given 
25

don't do the following things.  It would be quite common 
for enforcement personnel to entertain informal 
overtures from the regulated party or his legal 
representative, but I think it would be extraordinary, 
for instance, for a U.S. Attorney's Office to grant a 
formal hearing to a potential criminal defendant in 
order to discuss the -- in order to resolve the question 
criminal charges should be brought.  But --

 MR. STEWART:  I think the -- the agency's 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what about this 

internally within EPA subject to judicial review?  When 
does it use that as opposed to a compliance order? 

1
2  normal practice would be to issue an administrative 
3  compliance order before initiating judicial proceedings. 
4  That is, the statute doesn't require it, but the EPA 
ordinarily would not commence a lawsuit without first 
5
6  giving the regulated party one final opportunity to come 
7  into compliance. 
8
9  administrative order that -- the administrative order 
10
11 
12
 MR. STEWART:  It could use that.  It would 
13  typically use that for violations that it perceived to 
14  be less serious.  The statutory cap on penalties is much 
lower than the cap in the judicial enforcement actions. 
15
16  I think it would probably be the case that it would 
17  issue an administrative compliance order in those 
18  situations as well. 
19
20
21  compliance order does say is, even if you comply, you 
22  are still not immune from the possibility of enforcement 
23  proceedings with respect to past violations.  And I 
24  think that's --

2  Compliance order procedure? 
3

think most agencies regard it as within their ordinary 
5
6  authority to enforce the statute to send less formal 
7  communication. 
8
9
10
11  Sacketts, in our view, this is a warning; we believe 
12  you're in violation of the Act; and you'll be subject 
13  to -- you are subject to penalties of 37.5 per day for 
14  that violation; and to remedy the violation, in our 
15
16  know, pine trees on the lot.  It could do that? 
17
18  that mechanism.  And --
19
20
21
 MR. STEWART:  We would certainly argue there 
22  would be no review of that.  And if the Court said that

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there anything you've 

 So, the only thing I -- left in my mind here 

got by -- I mean, I'm -- you've got me now into the 

1  fact that penalties can be imposed for violation of the 
2  order itself, an opinion along those lines wouldn't 
3  suggest that. 
4
5
6  area; we're applying the APA; and the question is Abbott 
7  Labs and is it final?  Well, here there doesn't seem 
8  anything more for the agency to do, and here the -- the 
9  person whom the order is directed against is being hurt 
10
11
12  is the order itself does say come in and talk to us 
13  about this.  Which may suggest it isn't final.  So, do 
14  you have any information on that point?  That is, have 
you looked up or has the EPA told you that really when 
15
16  we issue these things, in fact people come in and we 
17  modify them X percent of the time? 
18
19  that.  Now --

24  the landowner does approach EPA.  Now, it's--

encompass both the cases in which the landowners came in 
10
11  and talked to EPA and those in which they just complied. 
12  I'm sorry. 
13
14  that -- that some communication occurs before this 
compliance order.  And my guess would be that most of 
15
16  the back and forth between the agency and the person 
17  does happen before the compliance order rather than 
18  after. 
19
20
21  well, they can, but they can do that with respect to any 
22  administrative action.  So, am I wrong about that?  That 
23  really the back and forth here takes place before the 
24  compliance order issues rather than after?
25

 And the notion that the person can come in 

after the compliance order and say you were wrong --

1  as a matter of typical agency practice that there would 
2  be an invitation well before the compliance order was 
3  issued to come in and give your side of the story.  And 
4  you're probably right that, if we got to the point where 
a compliance order was issued, then the likelihood that 
5

16  were saying if we were troubled by the additional

18  we were troubled by that aspect of the order alone, and 
19  you haven't dealt with the permit issue after the fact, 
20
21
22  one of which may be more troubling rather than less 
23  troubling, is to say that if you're troubled by this, 
24  then there are a lot of other things that might be 
troubling as well because it's often the case that 
25

what would be your approach to the case then? 

 MR. STEWART:  Well, I guess the two things,

question of negotiating because it doesn't say 
negotiating about changing the order; it says 
negotiating about amending the order.  And -- so, this 
is not just a warning, is it? 

1  warnings are issued to regulated parties, and it's often 
2  the case that if the regulated party continues with the 
3  conduct after receiving the warning, the penalties may 
4  be enhanced.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  This is not a warning.  I 
5
6  mean, really all you have to do is look at it.  I was 
7  quite moved by the fact when I looked at it, it didn't 
8  say a warning.  It said this is an order.  It looks 
9  extremely formal.  I even overstated in your favor the

19  obligations.

21  declaratory judgment if prosecution is threatened and

2
3  held that there is no constitutional bar to that and 
4  that a declaratory judgment remedy can be made available 
5
6  cause a huge upheaval in the practices of many agencies

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, in -- maybe with an

13  as this which shows that the agency does intend to 
14  prosecute, why wouldn't you be able to bring a

16
 MR. STEWART:  Again, I don't think that 
17  there would be any value to agencies or to regulated

19  to say less than what they really mean.  That is --

18  argument made clear, Petitioners share our view that the 
19  administrative compliance order would be subject to 
review if it's reviewable under a deferential standard. 
20
21  And if the Court held that the order was not arbitrary 
22  and capricious, that still wouldn't eliminate the 
23  possibility that if we pursued an enforcement action --
24
25

having the force of law and that the basis for 
challenging it was a purely legal ground.  And one of 
the reasons that we think judicial review of the 
administrative compliance order within this scheme would 
make no sense, would be out of keeping with the rest of 
the statutory regime, is that it wouldn't solve the 
problem. 

 As the discussion in the first part of the 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in concrete, Mr. 

Stewart --

51
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- how would it work? 

judgments, and those are --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But as far -- as far as 

question is, is this wetlands or is it not?
 

 MR. STEWART:  It's more than just is it
 

 MR. STEWART:  -- the Petitioners could argue 

1
2  that they weren't actually in violation. 
3
4  You say it's a lesser standard under the APA.  But the 
5
6
7  wetlands.  It's are these wetlands that have the
 
8  requisite connection to traditional navigable waters?
 
9  And that can turn in part on factual and scientific
 
10
11
12  the EPA is concerned, they're finished with that 
13  question.  This is not something that, well, we might 
14  look at it again tomorrow based on new evidence.  The 
15
16  has been made. 
17
 MR. STEWART:  I think they have reached that 
18  conclusion for now.  I don't think it would be accurate 
19  to say that we have done all the research we would want 
to do if we were going to be required to prove up our 
20
21  case in court.  And that's really the second half of 
22  the -- the problem, that if Petitioners' claim were 
23  reviewable and a court held EPA didn't do sufficient 
24  investigation based on the record before it at the time, 
25

determination that these are qualifying wetlands -- that 

there was no sound basis --

1
2  here even more outrageous:  We -- we think now that this 
3  is wetlands that are -- that qualify; so, we're going to 
4  hit you with this compliance order, but, you know, when 
we look into it more thoroughly in the future, we might 
5
6  change our mind.

8  prosecutor, any enforcement person, would want to be 
9  better prepared when a case actually went to trial than 
10

14  make a finding that there's a violation.  You're not 
15
16  willy-nilly and it's not going to act on sufficient 
17  evidence in -- in sending a letter that says we find you 
18  are violating the Act. 
19
20
21  second part of the point that I was going to make is, 
22  even if a court found that we didn't have sufficient 
23  evidence before us at the time the administrative 
24  compliance order was issued and that the order was 
therefore arbitrary and capricious, that wouldn't

you've looked at it.  You hope you have a sufficient

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAMIEN M. SCHIFF

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SCHIFF:  Mr. Chief Justice, unless the 

 And they think that the purpose of this, the 

might be thousands of these things, and they can't 

they'll have a hard time -- or a harder time -- in each 
of these cases subjecting it to judicial factfinding. 

1
2  Court has any additional questions --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I do, actually, because I 
3
4  see their point better than I did.  This, I think, is 
what they're worried about:  They're worried that when 
5
6  you get judicial review of this kind of order, the court 
7  doesn't refer on factfinding that isn't made on a 
8  record.  The substantial evidence test applies to 
9  factfinding made on a record, or 556/557.  And so, 
10
11 
12
13  purpose of this procedure given to them by statute was 
14  to call it -- the shots in favor of them, because there 
15
16  prepare all that formal thing.  Now, I -- I see that as 
17  a -- as a -- now I understand their concern.  I'm not 
18  saying they're right.  I understand their concern. 
19
way to accommodate their concern that also accommodates 
20
21  judicial review?  Or are we just in a kind of -- they're 
22  in a Hobson's choice, in a sense. 
 MR. SCHIFF:  Well, Justice Breyer, the 
23
24  difficulty is essentially of EPA's own creation.  I 
25

don't understand why -- why EPA would want the power to 

 So, if you want to comment, is there some 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  They want the power because 

they have thousands of these things.  They investigate 

1  issue compliance orders that, as the Court has 
2  recognized, are -- are tremendously coercive.  And not 
3  have --
4
5
6  it, and they find the facts.  They think it's 
7  sufficient, but judicial factfinding is carried out 
8  before a judge who doesn't have their experience, et 
9  cetera, and, therefore, there is a risk of incorrect 
decisionmaking, at least too -- under the statute, it 
10
11  would be too pro-homeowner rather too pro-environment. 
12  That's why it's more of a dilemma than I thought. 
13
14  the fear of it being too pro-homeowner is in fact 
15
16  We're not talking about -- about the agency being forced 
17  to sort of --
18
19  is only entitled to deference when in fact it has made a 
record.  When it hasn't made a record, maybe there's no 
20
21  reason to give it deference. 
 MR. SCHIFF:  You're correct, Justice Scalia. 
22
23  If there is no record, certainly there's by necessity no 
24  substantial evidence, and in that case, the compliance 
25

protected by the fact of the APA standard of review. 

 MR. SCHIFF:  I think, Justice Breyer, the --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but maybe the agency 

order would be --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there cases in the 

courts of appeals or the district courts where 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, they might -- the 
1
2  might change their -- their system here, if you -- if 
3  you win this, and provide for various kinds of pre-order 
4  procedure or post-order procedure where they'd be open 
to change.  I see a number of possibilities.  I can see 
5
6  their dilemma.

9
10
11  landowners, having received these notices or compliance 
12  orders, have said that there's a taking of the property, 
13  inverse condemnation? 
14
15
16  believe held in Riverside Bayview, a takings claim under 
17  the Clean Water Act is not considered ripe until a 
18  permit application has been -- has been attempted. 
19
20
21  fact, one could see that a compliance order might 
22  potentially have a total taking effect in this case. 
 But certainly, at this point, we are willing 
23
24  to let EPA have the power.  Yes, let EPA administer the

 Now, if a compliance order is issued, then 
the permit application might be off the table.  And, in

Honor, but -- Justice Kennedy, but, as this Court I

couldn't you have gotten the legal determination that 
you wanted through that process? 

1  landowners a fair shake, too.  Let them have their day 
2  in court to contest what the agency has done. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Schiff, I take it -- the 
3
4  Government agrees that there's not much of a chance that 
you could get an after-the-fact permit, but its view is 
5
6  you should have gotten a before-the-fact permit.  And 
7  putting aside the weirdness which Justice Alito points 
8  out of making you go get a permit for something you 
9  don't think you need a permit for -- putting that aside, 
10
11 
12
 MR. SCHIFF:  We -- Justice Kagan, we don't 
13  deny that by applying for a permit and having the Corps 
14  make a decision on the permit that that's one way to get 
into court.  But the difficulty for the Sacketts and 
15
16  for, you know, the thousands of folks in this country 
17  who are recipients of compliance orders is that that's 
18  small or no solace once EPA has already acted, you know, 
19  once EPA has made the finding of violation and then 
20
21
22  saying is, as long as you knew that your lands were 
23  potentially wetlands, you could have gone in from the 
24  get-go and -- and sought a determination that they were

not wetlands through the permit process.
