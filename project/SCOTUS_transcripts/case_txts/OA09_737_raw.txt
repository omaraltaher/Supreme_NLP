 Denial of summary judgment is not reviewable 

on appeal after trial, especially where the decision 

depends on whether the evidence on the merits of the 

claim is sufficient to cross the legal line for 

liability.  In this case -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry to 

interrupt so quickly, but that especially, I take it -­

I take it, is a concession that there's a difference 

between claims for qualified immunity based on evidence 

and claims that are based on law.

 MR. MILLS:  Well, there's a difference 

between defenses that depend on the evidence at trial. 

What I would say about qualified immunity is that, to 

the extent any court of appeals is going to enter 

judgment based on qualified immunity, it needs to 

understand the conduct of the officials in the case. 

3

And so you're always talking about the evidence of that 

conduct. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, of course there's

always -- there are always facts.  There are often

disputed facts.  But suppose the issue is whether or not 

this right -- and maybe there are two rights here -­

this right was clearly established.  That's -- that's an 

issue of law. 

 MR. MILLS:  That is -- that is an issue of 

law, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And doesn't that fall 

within the "except" clause that the Chief Justice was 

talking to you about, which you haven't had much time to 

fill out, I understand.

 But -- well, if you're going to say -- and 

it's really not whether the summary judgment is -- is 

appealed.  That's a little bit -- it's whether or not 

the issues resolved by the summary judgment motion are 

appealable.  I read into your response, or implied from 

your response, what the Chief Justice did, that maybe 

sometimes the summary judgment motion, say, on an issue 

of law is sufficient to preserve the issue. 

 MR. MILLS:  Well -- and that gets to what I 

24 

think is the heart of the split in the circuits and the 

25

confusion, is that every circuit recognizes a very

general rule that where the evidence at trial moots that 

at summary judgment, we're not going to review the 

summary judgment decision. 

 Now, a number of courts said:  Well, wait a 

second; there are summary judgment issues that don't 

depend on the evidence, and we're -- those are typically 

called questions of law.  And Respondents point to a 

number of good examples in their brief of defenses such 

as statute of limitations, pre-emption, and the like, 

that indeed very often don't depend at all on the 

evidence at trial.  The difference with qualified 

immunity is that qualified immunity requires the court 

to look at the evidence of the claim itself. 

 Now, statute of limitations, for example, is 

actually quite different, because in statute of 

limitations -- let's suppose Michelle Ortiz filed her 

suit 20 years late.  It would not matter at all how much 

evidence she adduced of the Respondents' misconduct.  It 

would be barred by statute of limitations.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So Mr. Mills, what then 

is the difference?  You point out, quite rightly, 

summary judgment looks to what evidence there was, and 

the question for the court is:  What could the plaintiff 

prove?  When we get past trial, the issue becomes:  What 

has the plaintiff proved? 

5

 So, what was brought out at trial?  What was 

the record at trial that was larger than the record at 

summary judgment?  Because if there -- if there was 

no -- no new fact presentation, no more ample fact 

presentation, then it wouldn't matter.  It would be the 

6 

same body of evidence, right? 

7

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

 MR. MILLS:  Well, I think that's largely -­

largely right, Justice Ginsburg, and here's an example 

of what did change in this case.

 At the summary judgment stage, what we had 

were affidavits of the Respondents discussing their role 

in relation to this case, with no comment whatsoever 

about what the consequences would have been had 

Ms. Jordan immediately reported the first sexual 

assault.  The record was bare at summary judgment from 

16 

Respondents' perspective on that -- on that point. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

24

25

 At trial, under cross-examination, 

Ms. Bright testified that Respondent Jordan indeed 

violated prison policy by not reporting it and then, 

very crucially, also agreed that the second, more 

violent assault would have actually been precluded had 

that report taken place. 

 Now, that's -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this gets to what 

troubles me about this case.  Although the Sixth Circuit 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6

8 

9 

referred to summary judgment in its opinion, it seems to 

me the Sixth Circuit actually reviewed the evidence at 

trial and determined that the defendants were entitled 

to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence at 

trial. 

 So I don't know why this case actually 

presents the question on which cert was granted.  It 

seems to me it presents a question of -- a purely 

factual question in the end, whether there was -­

10

whether judgment as a matter of law was appropriate. 

11 

And you never raised the judgment as a matter of law. 

12

13 

14 

15

 You never raised in the court of appeals, as 

I understand it, the argument that the defendants' 

ability to object to the entry of judgment as a matter 

of law was waived because they never filed a Rule 50(b) 

16 

motion.  Isn't that right? 

17

 MR. MILLS:  Well -- well, there's a couple 

18 

points in there that I need to address. 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 First, I think that you are exactly right. 

What the Sixth Circuit did here is it -- it reviewed a 

summary judgment decision, but it did peek ahead to the 

trial evidence, and it said it was doing that.  I think 

that highlights the fundamental problem of reviewing 

summary judgment after the trial.  The Sixth Circuit is 

implicitly recognizing it would be illogical to look at 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

that summary judgment record, those affidavits, and then 

ignore this cross-examined testimony of what -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose we were to 

4 

hold that they -- that they couldn't review the denial 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

of summary judgment.  The case is remanded to them, and 

they say:  Okay, well, we made a slip of the pen when we 

referred to summary judgment in the prior decision.  We 

really were saying that the defendants were entitled to 

judgment as a matter of law, and, although there wasn't 

10

a Rule 50(b) motion, that was waived because it wasn't 

11 

raised on appeal. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 So we are -- we come back to exactly where 

we are now.  All we've done is to correct a slip of 

the -- what was arguably a slip of the pen, perhaps 

motivated by their belief that the Rule 50(b) issue is 

jurisdictional.  But it really is not under our cases 

distinguishing between jurisdictional questions and 

claims processing questions. 

 MR. MILLS:  And I agree with that last 

point.  But here's the problem and here's why it isn't 

just simply a slip of the pen that can be fixed by 

remanding.  Even if this was not summary judgment 

whatsoever and it was, as Respondents say, essentially a 

Rule 50(a) review, that conflicts with an entire line of 

this Court's decisions leading into Unitherm, which 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

makes clear that the court of appeals absolutely lacks 

the power to review the sufficiency of the evidence 

where that question wasn't ruled upon by the district 

court.  And so the court of appeals here, regardless of 

any sort of forfeiture argument, absolutely lacked the 

6 

power to consider it. 

7

8

 The additional point about your -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's not the point 

9 

that you've made here.  I mean -- and that isn't the

point on which we granted certiorari. 

 MR. MILLS:  That's right, and I think -- I 

think what I just said about the 50(b) point is that I 

think it highlights that this really was a summary 

judgment review by the Sixth Circuit of -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, Mr. Mills, if I could 

just understand your answer to Justice Alito.  You 

concede that the Sixth Circuit opinion is using the 

record built on the whole trial and that that's a 

different record from the record that existed at summary 

judgment; is that correct? 

 MR. MILLS:  I do concede it, except to the 

extent that I concede they did an adequate review of the 

record.  But I -- I concede that point.  For the example 

-- for example -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So they have that first 

9

8

paragraph where they suggest that they're ruling on a 

summary judgment motion.  Then they go through an entire 

opinion that talks about the facts and the record.  And 

there are very few citations, but your understanding is 

that when they talk about the facts in the records, 

they're talking about the post-trial -- I mean the 

record that has been built up as a result of the trial? 

 MR. MILLS:  There are -- there are certainly 

9 

a number of instances where they definitely are talking

about the trial.  I do think it -- it is even muddy the 

extent to which they are incorporating trial facts 

versus summary judgment facts.  The example I gave about 

this point where Ms. Bright conceded on cross that Ms. 

Ortiz indeed would have been separated and the assault, 

second assault, precluded, it's one of two things: 

Either the Sixth Circuit's reviewing summary judgment 

and picking a couple of trial facts it thinks helps to 

review and missing the facts, or it's doing -- it's 

looking ahead at these trial facts and because -­

particularly because the district court never weighed in 

on that, on a Rule 50(b), it's botching the record.  And 

it goes to the heart of this Court's cases from Cone 

v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper in 1947 up through 

Unitherm, which says we have to have the district court 

review the sufficiency of the evidence before the court 

10

of appeals could even have the power to possibly 

consider -­

Rule 50 motion is not jurisdictional.  You are in 

essence claiming it is.  You're saying they lacked the 

power, but Justice Alito's question to you said they 

don't, that they've misread the fact that this is not a 

jurisdictional motion.  So address that question:  Why 

is it jurisdictional as opposed to a claim processing? 

 MR. MILLS:  Your Honor, I -- I am not 

disputing that the Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to 

consider the case.  But I am making a distinction among 

jurisdiction and power, and it's the same distinction 

actually the Tenth Circuit employed in a case called 

Williams v. Gonterman, which is cited in our reply 

brief; I think it's at page 10.  This exact issue came 

up, where the verdict loser said:  Wait a second; this 

issue's been forfeited.  The Tenth Circuit, reading 

Unitherm, reading the debate between the majority and 

the dissenters, who said plain error and those doctrines 

should apply, said:  We lack the power to review this; 

we have jurisdiction, but we lack the power to -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The claim processing 

rules, we have said that, unless you object, the court

doesn't lack power.  Since you didn't object below to a 

-- a argument that Rule 50(b) precluded consideration by 

the court of appeals, why wasn't that argument waived 

before the court?

 MR. MILLS:  It's not waived because, while 

the general principle is that claims processing rules 

are indeed subject to waiver and forfeiture, this 

particular context, as this Court has made clear, that 

the word "power" is not an accidental use.  It's been 

used in all of these cases. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why is it -- I mean, 

power -- jurisdiction is power, power to proceed in a 

case.  But we are in an area where there are many, many 

cases of this Court that distinguish the Rule 50(a), 

50(b) from the run-of-the-mine claim processing rule 

because in the background is the Seventh Amendment 

Re-examination Clause.  That's the whole reason why 

there is this 50(a)-50(b) litany, why the verdict loser 

must repeat the 50(a) motion, after -- after the 

verdict. 

 So I'm surprised that you're using the word 

"power." You're not referring to any of that history 

which stems from a constitutional provision, the Seventh 

Amendment.

 MR. MILLS:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, you're 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

2 

3 

4 

5

9 

absolutely correct, and I think that footnote 4 of 

Unitherm goes right to your point.  In footnote 4 of 

Unitherm, the Court explains that the very reason a 

court of appeals lacks the power, lacks the power to 

review that question, is because it is essentially, as 

in Unitherm, going to be as a court of appeals reviewing 

the conduct -- the sufficiency of the evidence, without 

a district court ruling on the question.  And this Court 

said in Unitherm that that raises serious Seventh 

10

Amendment concerns.  This case is actually a very good 

11 

example -­

12

13 

14 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Mills, I got you 

started on this, but this -- none of this is the 

question on which we granted review, is it?

 MR. MILLS:  Well -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  We didn't grant review to 

decide whether a court of appeals can consider judgment 

of a -- judgment as a matter of law where there isn't a 

50(b) motion and no argument is made that the -- that 

issue was waived by failing to make the motion.  We 

21 

didn't grant review on that. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. MILLS:  And, Justice Alito, that 

highlights another important point about this exchange, 

and that is that Respondents in the Sixth Circuit did 

not suggest that the Sixth Circuit did have the 

13

15

authority to take the summary judgment question and then 

look ahead to trial facts.  And so, the Sixth Circuit 

has taken the summary judgment decision and then acted 

without authority to look ahead at the trial facts.  And 

so if the argument is that we have forfeited a 

pre-emptive argument to the Sixth Circuit that it 

couldn't do this frankly very unorthodox approach, I 

don't think that that's a proper invocation of 

forfeiture even regardless of the point about power.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What -- are you saying 

then that if we explain to the Fifth Circuit -- to the 

Sixth Circuit, that the record they must look at is the 

trial record, so it's different from the summary 

judgment stage, if we told them that, then maybe they 

would look at the evidence differently, even though they 

16 

purported to look at the trial evidence? 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. MILLS:  Well, I think if that order were 

given, they would indeed do that.  But I would still 

come back to the point that there is absolutely no basis 

on which they would have the authority to do that.  And 

the point is, in the Unitherm line of cases, that if you 

don't have a district court ruling on the very question, 

the question here of whether their conduct, as they say, 

crossed a constitutional line, you're circumventing the 

district court's role in the entire process.

 As this Court has explained repeatedly, a 

requisite of a court of appeals reviewing that evidence 

that went to the jury is that the district court first, 

who has the feel of the case, who saw the witnesses, who 

saw Respondent Bright on cross-examination, first have 

the opportunity in the judge's discretion to grant a new 

trial -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, if you're right, then 

9 

there has to be a remand to the Sixth Circuit with 

10

11 

12 

13

instructions to send the case back to the district court 

to ask the district court what -- whether it thought the 

evidence was sufficient? 

 MR. MILLS:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  I 

14 

think that the best way to see this case is it's indeed 

15

16 

17 

18

a review of the summary judgment decision.  That's the 

only decision by the district court that had to do with 

qualified immunity. 

 The Sixth Circuit expressly invoked an 

19 

exception to say:  We can review summary judgment after 

20

21 

22 

23

the trial because it's qualified immunity; and the 

Eighth Circuit said that's okay and we say that's okay; 

we're looking ahead at trial facts. 

 And I think what this Court can and should 

24 

conclude is that it's improper to review the summary 

25

judgment decision after trial because the facts have

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And your argument is that 

where a --the district court denies summary judgment on 

a qualified immunity issue that is based even purely on 

an issue of law, there can't be a review unless that's 

renewed -- there can't be appellate review unless that 

purely legal question is renewed in a Rule 50(b) motion. 

That's your -- that's your argument? 

 MR. MILLS:  That is my argument, with a 

couple key pieces -- first of all, they could, of 

course, take a collateral order appeal, but if they 

proceed to trial -- and here's -- here's sort of the 

fundamental point about qualified immunity.  Sure, there 

are purely legal questions in the qualified immunity 

inquiry.  Was the right clearly established?  But to 

enter judgment, to enter judgment, whether it's the 

district court or the court of appeals, that court must 

know what the conduct is. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But what if the facts are 

utterly undisputed?  There's a videotape of exactly what 

went on.  Nobody has the slightest disagreement about 

the facts.  The only question is whether the right was 

clearly established, and the district court rejects that 

at summary judgment.  What benefit -- what is the point 

of saying that the defendants have to raise that same 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

issue again in a Rule 50(b) motion?  It's utterly a -- a 

pointless exercise. 

 MR. MILLS:  Well, it's certainly a less 

4 

compelling case than this one where the facts indeed 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11

12 

13 

14 

15

change.  But I would say that there -- it's not utterly 

pointless because the 50(b) motion still invokes all the 

protections that this Court has described where the 

district court, who had the feel of the case, gets the 

first chance to consider whether a new trial should be 

granted -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Mills, when -- when 

Unitherm talks about the district court feeling the case 

and having a feel for the case, it's talking about 

having the feel for the evidence and for the facts.  The 

whole rationale of Unitherm is based on the evidence, 

16 

the facts, not on purely legal questions. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

 So suppose we disagree with you about the 

reach of Unitherm.  Suppose we say Unitherm doesn't have 

any application to purely legal questions.  What would 

that mean for your case?  Which part of your claims were 

purely legal and which part were instead founded on the 

facts, in which case you would have a better Unitherm 

argument? 

 MR. MILLS:  It -- it would still mean you'd 

have to reverse in this case, and I think in 

17

Justice Alito's hypothetical perhaps, perhaps not.

 But in this case, as -- as Respondents 

themselves say, the question here is actually very 

simple.  It's whether their conduct crossed a 

constitutional line.  And the point is that, even in the 

qualified immunity inquiry, the question is:  Does the 

conduct -- and that's conduct in one way at summary 

judgment and another way at trial -- does that conduct 

cross a clearly established constitutional line?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't understand, 

counsel, how your argument -- that in every case you 

need to know the facts, every qualified immunity case 

you need to know the facts, and those only come out 

after trial -- is consistent with our recognizing that 

you can have a collateral order appeals denial of 

summary judgment.  In other words, you can consider 

qualified immunity without knowing how the facts are 

going to come out at trial, which is why we allow you to 

have an appeal before trial.

 MR. MILLS:  You're absolutely right.  And at 

summary judgment, officers are entitled to invoke 

immunity, and they're entitled to take that immediate 

appeal.  And it's typically -- well, required under 

Johnson v. Jones that it be what this Court's called a 

question of law.  The defendants assume the facts

against them, and they say to the court of appeals, it 

may be a purely legal question, like this isn't -- this 

is clearly established or isn't clearly established. 

But to -- to say whether that line is crossed, I mean, 

as recently as Iqbal, this Court explained -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- so you're 

just saying your case on qualified immunity isn't like 

that case; is that all? 

 MR. MILLS:  Well, I'm saying it -- it's like 

that case to the extent that the court still has to 

understand, if it's going to enter judgment, what the 

conduct was.  Even if it's looking at purely legal -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't 

14 

have to know what it was.  It assumes it to be what -­

15

16

17

what the plaintiff claims it was. 

 MR. MILLS:  That's right. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  At the summary judgments, 

18 

you give the benefit of the doubt to the plaintiff. 

19

20

 MR. MILLS:  That's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So there's always a factual 

21 

element to the -- to the ruling. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. MILLS:  That's right.  And I -- I think 

that bolsters my point.  There is always a factual 

element to the ruling.  And so, when you go to trial and 

you put on a trial that is all about Respondents' 

19

conduct and you have them under cross-examination and 

that evidence grows of their misconduct, then we're 

talking about a situation where -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's never going to be any 

better than what you assumed.  It's never going to be 

any better for the plaintiff than what you assumed at 

the summary judgment stage.

case -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  For -- for -­

MR. MILLS: -- for the plaintiff.
 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why was that?
 

MR. MILLS:  And it was -- one example I gave
 

earlier:  Ms. Ortiz, before trial, didn't have knowledge 

of what would have happened had Mrs. Jordan not violated 

prison procedures and immediately reported the first 

assault.  On cross-examination, however, Mrs. Bright, at 

page 242 of the trial transcript, said:  "The second 

assault, the violent assault, would have been 

21 

precluded." 

22

 Now, it seems to me, again reading the cold 

23 

transcript -­

24

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's -- just finish: 

Because if Ms. Jordan had reported the incident that she 

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

2 

3

was required to, they would have put Ms. Ortiz in 

segregation automatically; is that it? 

 MR. MILLS:  Not that they would have put her 

4 

in segregation, but that they would have taken steps to

separate her from the officer, whether that meant 

removing the officer from the location or putting her in 

another cell.  The important piece of that is not only 

did it change from summary judgment to trial; the Sixth 

Circuit got it entirely wrong.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you have an 

obligation in opposing summary judgment to, in your list 

of disputed facts or facts that preclude summary 

judgment, to put all that in.  And why didn't you put 

the point you are raising now in the opposition to 

summary judgment? 

 MR. MILLS:  That's not something Ms. Ortiz 

17 

would have knowledge of.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the -- we know that 

24

disputes that the other side is saying are undisputed, 

and the fact that you prevail on one doesn't meant that 

you didn't have an obligation to put in your opposition 

the others. 

 MR. MILLS:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I just 

can't see how Ms. Ortiz would have an obligation to put 

in some fact that's outside of her knowledge and, 

frankly, something that came out when a Respondent caved 

in a bit on cross-examination. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  How would you put the rule 

about when you have to renew a motion?  You move for 

summary judgment.  Can you say this?  You've looked up 

the treatises and so forth.  If the motion for summary 

judgment involves either a question of fact or a mixed 

question of fact and law, it has to be renewed.  If it 

involves neither of the others, neither of those two 

things, but it's a pure question of law and not mixed, 

it doesn't have to be renewed. 

 MR. MILLS:  I think that's -- that's a fair 

24 

way to state it.

25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any authority for

that?  I mean, is there any -- it seems to be roughly 

what you're trying to argue, roughly.  At least it seems 

to me a rule that would make sense.  Is it that -- what 

do you find related to that?  It seems to me that must 

have been thought about before this minute.

16 

17 

18

 MR. MILLS:  Yes, indeed.  I think it has 

been thought about.  I think it's been thought about 

really by every circuit when they recognize the very 

basic principle that the real evidence of a case is the 

evidence at the trial, and what that means is that, if 

the evidence at trial goes to the question at summary 

judgment, whatever that legal issue may be, it's 

illogical to ignore exactly what happened at trial and 

go back to summary judgment. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but let's imagine it 

19 

has nothing to do with qualified immunity.

20

21

22

23

 MR. MILLS:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  A bread-and-butter case. 

 MR. MILLS:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You can't appeal a denial 

24 

of motion for summary judgment.  But there's a trial and 

25

the lawyer forgets to renew the motion.  So sometimes

he's lost it; I guess sometimes he hasn't.  I would 

think he would have lost it if it's a mixed question of 

fact or law or if it's a pure question of fact that the 

answer turns on.  I would think he hadn't lost it if in 

fact it's a pure question of law.  But is that the basic 

6 

hornbook rule out of this context? 

7

 MR. MILLS:  Yes, I think it is.  I think it 

8 

is the basic horn rule -­

9

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, Mr. Mills, if that were 

the basic hornbook rule, your claims are all matters of 

11 

fact or mixed questions of fact and law? 

12

 MR. MILLS:  Our claims are mixed questions 

13 

of fact and law, yes.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  There are no purely legal 

issues? 

 MR. MILLS:  There are purely legal 

components to those inquiries; there's no doubt about 

it.  Again, a purely legal question might be what is the 

constitutional right; is it clearly established?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's what I'm 

asking.  I'm asking is -- is -- are the questions that 

you have those sorts of questions, or are they factual 

inquiries that would fall on the other side of 

Justice Breyer's line?

 MR. MILLS:  At the end of the day, these are 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

factual inquiries in which you have to understand the 

officers' conduct.  All I'm saying is that the second 

component to establish immunity or anything else does 

include always a pure question about whether the right's 

clearly established.  But there is no doubt that, to 

assess whether that line has been crossed, you have to 

understand what the facts are. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  The -- what's -- determining

what is a mixed question is notoriously difficult.  What

about the -- the situation where the -- the ruling is, 

assuming certain facts to be true, the -- the right was 

not clearly established?  Now, is the fact that certain 

facts are assumed to be true enough to make that a mixed 

question?

 MR. MILLS:  Yes, it is, because that's a 

classic sufficiency challenge at Rule 50, to assume 

the -- that's what Rule 50 requires.  Assume the facts 

against you after the verdict's come back and now say, 

you know what, Your Honor, it was insufficient.

 I'd like to reserve my time.

 As I think the discussion has already 

demonstrated, Ms. Ortiz's question presented hinges on a 

false assumption.  That assumption is that the Sixth 

Circuit was reviewing the summary judgment order as the 

6 

final appealable order in this case. 

7

8 

9 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Except that it begins, 

2(a), "Although courts normally do not review the denial 

of a summary judgment motion after trial on the merits, 

10

the denial of summary judgment based on qualified 

11 

immunity is an exception to this rule."  And that's -­

12

13

 MR. MIZER:  And -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's the opening.  That 

14 

sets the stage for what follows.

 MR. MIZER:  And -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, it may be that 

everybody, including the Sixth Circuit, misapprehended 

the rule because there are some cases that depend on an 

assessment of the record and some cases that don't, but 

that's not what the Sixth Circuit said. 

 MR. MIZER:  I think that the Sixth Circuit's 

word choice in the sentence that you just read was not 

perfectly clear, but -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Mizer, you asked 

for an appeal of the summary judgment motion, so they

 MR. MIZER:  Actually, Your Honor, the 

summary judgment motion was only one of several orders 

listed in the notice of appeal.  And the Sixth Circuit 

brief was very clearly couched as an appeal from the 

verdict, which at the bottom of the prior page of the -­

of the petition appendix, from where Justice Kennedy 

just read, the bottom of page 7a, the Sixth Circuit 

calls it an "appeal from the jury verdict."

 And then the Sixth Circuit, at petition 

appendix 2a and throughout its opinion, refers to "trial 

evidence." 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, Mr. Mizer, then you 

14 

must concede that this opening sentence that

21 

22

Justice Kennedy just quoted is wrong.  Courts normally 

don't review the denial of summary judgment motion after 

trial on the merits, but when the summary judgment 

denial is based on qualified immunity, there's an 

exception.

 MR. MIZER:  I think that what the Sixth 

Circuit meant there was that the issue of qualified 

immunity raised at summary judgment was preserved.  I 

don't think its word choice was perfectly clear, but I 

think other -- other phrases in the Sixth Circuit's 

opinion make clearer that what it was doing was viewing

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that we should -- I 

think what that means to me is that you really ignore 

whether it was raised at summary judgment.  If you're 

going to look at the evidence at trial, what do we look 

at, at trial, to see that the claim of qualified 

immunity was preserved? 

 MR. MIZER:  It would -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because it's a little

11 

judgment record when you're not.

15

16 

17 

18

 MR. MIZER:  Well, and I don't think the 

Sixth Circuit was saying it was reviewing the summary 

judgment record, and that would have been not 

appropriate.  What it was doing was looking at the whole 

record.  And a legal issue doesn't have to be raised 

post-trial in order for it to have been adequately -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But surely it has to be 

19 

raised post-trial if your legal argument is:  Look at 

20

the facts; the facts of this case as proved do not 

21 

support liability. 

22

23

 I mean, I would have thought that was a 

classic instance where you do have to make the motion. 

That's the whole point of having to renew it.

are never going to be able to prove that my client

now, and it doesn't show my client crossed the

 Doesn't he have to renew it?

 MR. MIZER:  Yes.

 MR. MIZER:  But that's been -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, how is yours one bit 

different?  Because what you're saying is that the 

evidence, when you look at it, will show the facts are 

such that there must have been qualified immunity under

 MR. MIZER:  The difference, Your Honor, is 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company

that this Court's case law concerning -- the Mitchell 

line of cases concerning collateral order appeals in the 

qualified immunity context divides qualified immunity 

claims into two halves.

 There are evidentiary sufficiency-based

qualified immunity claims, and there are legal claims.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, that -- that is 

right, and I find it, in the context where that already 

matters, whether they're appealable as a collateral 

issue already very difficult and complicated to sort 

out.  Now, what you want us to do is take that 

difficulty and continue it on in terms of when you can 

appeal and when you can't. 

 Some qualified immunity claims are purely 

legal.  Some are purely factual.  Some are in the 

middle.  Wouldn't it be easier if we just said:  Here's 

the rule from now on; you've got to renew them all in a 

50(b) motion.  And that makes it a lot easier for the 

trial courts and the appellate courts to figure out when 

they have to -- when they can consider it and when they 

21 

can't. 

22

23 

24 

25

 I understand your argument that it makes a 

difference.  I think it's a good argument, because some 

don't depend on the facts.  But going forward, it just

 MR. MIZER:  Well, first of all, I think 

that, because it is a difficult question, it should have 

been raised by Ms. Ortiz properly, and she hasn't raised 

the 50(b) argument properly.  But even if the Court were 

to reach it, I think the clearer rule is to map the 

Johnson line onto the sufficiency of the evidence line, 

otherwise -- for 50(b) motions.  Otherwise, then -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The Johnson line isn't much 

of a map, is what the Chief Justice is suggesting.  It's 

a mess.  It's very hard to sort those things out.  Why 

-- why should we double the difficulty by -- by bringing 

it in at the -- at the Rule 50 stage as well?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And, in fact, you did. 

You did move under 50(a).  This whole case is here 

because apparently -- well, what reason was it that you 

didn't make the 50(b) motion?  You told the court under 

50(a), after all the evidence was in but before the case 

went to the jury, that the jury would not have a legally

sufficient evidentiary basis to find for Ms. Ortiz. 

That was -- that was your motion. 

 You were saying:  Court, there was no

basis.  That was the motion that you made, recognizing 

that the judgment -- the question is whether there is a

 MR. MIZER:  And that argument is a different

species of argument than the argument on which -- than

the -- than the reasoning on which the Sixth Circuit 

resolved the case, which is, even assuming all the facts 

as given by Ms. Ortiz and taking -- treating those facts 

as uncontroverted, still there was not a violation of 

clearly established law.

 And under Johnson v. Jones and Mitchell, 

that is a different question than from the question of 

whether or not particular conduct has been proven. 

As -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then what you're 

saying is you didn't even -- you didn't need to make the 

50(a) motion, that that was just an unnecessary touching 

base with Rule 50(a)?  Is that what you're saying? 

 MR. MIZER:  That is our position, yes, Your

Honor, because a legal issue is adequately preserved

the -- given all of that, that claim as assumed, still, 

the Harlow line of objective legal reasonableness has 

not been crossed.

because the jury doesn't resolve the Harlow objective 

legal reasonableness question.  Instead, the jury

those facts as a given for purposes of the Harlow 

question.

 And -- and, in this case, I think there's an 

example of this distinction.  There was very much 

disputed at trial the question of whether Ms. Ortiz told 

Ms. Jordan the name of the guard who had assaulted her. 

And that fact was disputed at trial.  We -- we didn't 

move for 50(b) over that factual dispute, and so we 

16 

couldn't appeal on that question. 

17

18 

19 

20

21

22

 But what we did appeal was that, taking that 

fact as assumed for purposes of -- of  the qualified 

immunity question, still qualified immunity was 

warranted. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then explain to me what 

-- you made a 50(a) motion.  Why did you -- was there a 

reason for making the 50(a) motion and not following it 

up with a 50(b) motion?

 MR. MIZER:  I'm not aware of a reason, Your 

Honor.  But at pages 4 to 5 of the joint appendix, I 

think it's clear that there were two different types of 

arguments being made at the 50(a) stage.  One argument 

was a dispute over facts.  The other argument was, even 

if we don't dispute those facts, still Ms. Ortiz's 

arguments haven't shown a constitutional violation. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How could you -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's -- it's very clear 

from Rule 50 that 50(a) and 50(b) go together, and the 

explanation, as I indicated when Petitioner's counsel 

was speaking, is the Re-examination Clause of the 

Seventh Amendment.  So I think every first year 

Procedure student learns 50(a), 50(b) go together, and 

there's a historic reason why you must back up a 50(a) 

motion with a 50(b) motion.  They're not -- they all -­

they all ask the same question.  The Rule 56, the Rule 

50, 50(b), they all ask:  Is there sufficient evidence 

to warrant a jury finding, whatever.  They all ask that, 

but they ask -- ask it on the basis of a different 

record:  the summary judgment record, the trial record, 

and the jury verdict. 

 MR. MIZER:  But still, Your Honor, I think 

24 

the question of whether particular conduct has been 

25

proven is a sufficiency question, and that differs in

nature from the question of whether, taking that proven 

conduct as a given, assuming it to be true, without -­

without questioning the correctness of the plaintiff's 

version of the facts, that the -- then the Harlow 

question is a separate question. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you know of any case 

holding that you don't have to couple a 50(a) motion 

with a 50(b) motion depending upon what's in your 50(a) 

motion?

 MR. MIZER:  I am not aware of any case, no, 

although I am aware of cases, including the K & T 

Enterprises case from the Seventh -- or sorry -- from 

the Sixth Circuit, that we cite in our brief, which says 

that legal claims, purely legal claims, may be raised in 

judgment as a matter of law motions under either 50(a) 

or 50(b), but that 50(b) is not required with respect to 

those motions. 

 And so -- so the 50(a) motion here was a 

19 

belt-and-suspenders -- belt-and-suspenders effort, but

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could -- could you 

articulate for me the line that you see between assuming 

all of the facts and it's not enough as a matter of law, 

and a sufficiency claim.  And -- and let's break out the 

two claims:  one against Ms. Jordan, one against Ms.

 On a due process claim against Ms. Bright, 

there are two prongs, I think, to your argument.  One is 

that, as a matter of law under Sandin, putting her in 

solitary confinement did not violate any -- any 

constitutional right.  And then there's "she didn't 

retaliate" part of your claim. 

 The two seemed mixed up to me, below.  And I

court you were saying that, if she retaliated in putting 

her in segregated confinement, it doesn't matter whether 

there is a Sandin violation or not; she couldn't do the 

retaliatory act; is that correct? 

 MR. MIZER:  The -- the Sixth Circuit held in 

this case that the retaliation claim is a different 

claim from the due process claim, that it would be based 

on -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The First Amendment.

 MR. MIZER:  Our position is that the Sixth 

Circuit got it right, and Ms. Ortiz hasn't appealed to 

this Court on that holding, that as a -- as a matter of 

law under Sandin, placing an individual in segregated 

confinement does not amount to a due process violation 

vis-à-vis the -- the ordinary conditions of prison 

confinement. 

 I also have an answer, Justice Sotomayor, to 

your question about the -- the jury instruction request.

It's in document 84 in the district court record.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, you -- you refer to 

Sandin.  There are some extra things about the 

confinement here.  She was shackled, she was ill, and 

nobody attended to her. 

 MR. MIZER:  The -- the medical treatment 

claims were dismissed by the district court at summary 

judgment because Ms. Bright did not participate and did 

not have any knowledge of -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, is -- on the 

question of whether this treatment was punitive rather 

than just protective custody. 

 MR. MIZER:  And, again, on the question of 

24 

punitiveness, the Sixth Circuit held that that was not 

25

preserved -- that claim was not preserved by Ms. Ortiz. 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company

And she has not petitioned to this Court for review of 

that holding by the Sixth Circuit, and so the only 

question is the square Sandin question of whether 

segregated confinement is an atypical and significant 

hardship vis-à-vis the routine conditions of -- of her 

6 

confinement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, wouldn't it be 

this, the segregated confinement in this case, not at 

large?

 MR. MIZER:  The -- again, the Sixth 

Circuit's holding was that Sandin answered that -- that 

question as a matter of clearly established law.  And 

since Ms. Ortiz hasn't petitioned for review of the 

merits of that question, I'm not sure how it's presented 

to this Court. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Mizer, is it your 

understanding that -- that Unitherm was based on Seventh 

Amendment considerations, or was it based on prior 

decisions that in turn were grounded on considerations 

of fairness to the verdict-winner, namely the 

opportunity, when a -- a motion for judgment as a matter 

of law is made after the verdict, to move for dismissal 

without prejudice or move for a new trial? 

 MR. MIZER:  I think Unitherm was more 

squarely the latter, although it -- the Court did refer 

39

to the Seventh Amendment in responding to Justice 

Stevens's dissent.  And the Seventh Amendment concerns I 

don't think are implicated here, because it is well 

established that legal claims like qualified immunity 

are not for the jury to resolve.  And so taking -­

taking the case away from -­

7

9 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then you're -­

you're saying the category -- the mixed claim -- as 

Justice Breyer proposed, if it's a purely legal claim, 

10

then you're right.  If it's a mixed claim, then you're

wrong.

 MR. MIZER:  And I think those -- those 

categorizations are -- are fairly slippery and would be 

difficult to apply, as I think the Chief Justice 

suggested.  And so the guidance that is clear is the 

guidance that already exists from Johnson v. Jones, 

which is that there are -- there two types of qualified 

immunity claims, and if you're assuming the facts to be 

true as the plaintiff posits them and you're not 

controverting particular conduct, then you're in the

legal -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Mizer, just -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  One -- one way to make the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but we've been 

through this.  I think it was Justice Alito who gave the 

hypothetical -- suppose that everybody agrees on what 

happened; the question is whether or not the right's 

clearly established.

 MR. MIZER:  And that is this case. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's a pure issue of 

12 

law. 

13

 MR. MIZER:  And, as this Court has called 

14 

it, that's correct and that is this case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is that -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, is it this case, Mr. 

Mizer?  Take the deliberate indifference claim.  The 

question is whether the conduct amounted to deliberate 

indifference.  Why is that any different from asking 

whether a particular kind of conduct amounted to 

negligence, which in a previous case this Court said you 

had did have to make 50(b), a 50(b) motion in order to 

preserve?  That was in the Johnson v. New York case. 

 MR. MIZER:  It's different, Your Honor, 

because the -- the prong of the analysis in the

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

10

deliberate indifference conduct that the Sixth Circuit 

was looking at was the objective prong of whether or not 

the response was reasonable.  So assuming all of the 

worst of -- of Ms. Jordan's intent, as proven by the 

trial record, and assuming the worst of what she did or 

didn't do, still her response was as a legal matter 

objectively reasonable, and that was the Sixth Circuit's 

holding. 

 And so, therefore, because that's a legal 

inquiry, there was no 50(b) requirement even if Ms. 

11 

Ortiz had preserved the 50(b) argument. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 The -- the -- Ms. Ortiz has also posited 

that a collateral order appeal is a requirement in order 

to preserve a qualified immunity claim.  That argument 

is clearly foreclosed not only by the broad agreement 

among the circuits but also by this Court's decisions in 

United States v. Clark. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  When you go back -­

19 

you're the one who has read these cases pretty 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

thoroughly, and as I looked at it, I -- with the 

incomplete knowledge, I would have thought that 

Justice Ginsburg's statement of it is basically right. 

What Rule 50 is about is sufficiency of the evidence. 

And 50(a) involves we're saying it won't be sufficient. 

And 50(b) involves it wasn't sufficient.  Then you could 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company

have the Chief Justice's rule.  It would work perfectly. 

2

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

 But apparently there's a Second Circuit 

case, and some things in the treatises, that says 

sometimes Rule 50(a) is being used for some other 

purpose.  And that's what seems to be going wrong.  Like 

if you have a pure question of law, you ought to be 

outside 50(a); you ought to be doing some other thing. 

You know, a question like:  Was there collateral 

estoppel that means that he couldn't say he was a 

10

policeman because they litigated this 4 months ago? 

11 

That's a pure question of law.

 So, what are these cases and that exception 

in the treatise about?  What are they thinking of?  What 

kinds of instances do they think come under 50(a) that 

aren't sufficiency of the evidence? 

 MR. MIZER:  The -- the courts have said that 

you had can raise in a judgment as a matter of law 

motion legal arguments like the statute of limitations, 

collateral estoppel, pre-emption.  Very often those will 

be -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Suppose we could say 

this:  That when a lawyer uses 50(a) to make the kind of 

motion that does not involve sufficiency of the evidence 

but rather, in fact, could be made without 50(a), under 

those circumstances, he doesn't have to say 50(b).  How

question. 

 MR. MIZER:  The -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  I -- why do you

11 

applies to evidentiary stuff?  I mean -­

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

there is no -- no legally sufficient evidentiary basis 

for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that 

issue.  Well, if it's as a matter of law, no amount of 

evidence would ever allow a -- a jury verdict in that 

direction.  Surely, that falls within -- within (a) -­

MR. MIZER:  And that -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- even though evidence has 

nothing to do with it.  No matter what the evidence is, 

this is simply a matter of law.  No jury, no reasonable 

jury, could find for that party on that issue.  I don't 

read this as being purely a -- you know, a provision

it applies to the absolute rule of law as well.

50(a) and 50(b) motions were required for all matters of

that be a bad outcome as a matter of law? 

 MR. MIZER:  Because, Your Honor, the 

Rule 50(b) motions would then become miniature -- or not 

even miniature -- full-blown appellate briefs.  And the 

rule in the Southern District of Ohio at the moment, for 

example, is that 50(b) motions are 20 pages long.  If -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, the answer is it's a 

-- it's a pointless gotcha rule.  That's -- that's -­

isn't that the answer?  It's a pure issue of law, and 

the district court has already said:  I ruled on this on 

summary judgment; don't bother me with this again.  And 

we're going to say, well, you still have to raise it in 

a 50(b) motion?  What -- that'd be -- that's -- that 

there's no point.  We might as well say that the lawyer 

has to stand on his head when the motion is made or jump 

up and down three times. 

 MR. MIZER:  That's correct, Your Honor.  And

therefore, you don't have to sort out whether there -­

 MR. MIZER:  Because, Your Honor, the -- the 

district courts have never insisted, nor do the rules 

insist, that the district courts get multiple cracks at 

a legal question.  And the parties -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- the purpose of 

50(b) -- Justice Alito brought out that it's not simply 

the historical background of the Seventh Amendment, but 

in that same line of cases, the Court gave a practical 

reason.  And the practical reason related to the 

district court, that if the motion is made after the 

jury comes in, the district judge would have the 

opportunity to exercise her discretion to grant a new 

trial.

 Let's take -- is it Ms. Bright -- where the 

Sixth Circuit said that, well, maybe there could have 

been a retaliation claim, but the plaintiff didn't make 

it.  The district judge, given the chance, might have 

said:  I would exercise my discretion to allow the 

plaintiff to have a new trial on this retaliation claim. 

I thought it was before -- before the court and it was a 

good claim.  The Sixth Circuit thought it wasn't. 

 I mean, the purpose is to get the district 

24 

judge into the picture to exercise the district judge's 

25

discretion on the very question. 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

 MR. MIZER:  But if a claim is not in a case, 

Your Honor, then there's no discretion as to whether or 

not to give it to the jury.  And so, just as the 

qualified immunity question doesn't -- doesn't belong 

with the jury, so, too, a claim that hasn't been 

6 

adequately pressed doesn't go to the jury.

 And so we're not talking about questions 

that should and can be resolved by the jury.  We're 

talking about legal claims that the jury has no business 

deciding at all. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Your case, anyway, is a 

case, judging from what they wrote, which -- I'm back to 

where I started -- the mixed questions and the 

fact-based questions are you really have to renew your 

motion.  And reading your opinion, it seems to me it's 

filled with determinations of fact.  They're reviewing 

what the jury did and could have found, and on the basis 

of what they could have found, they say you're not 

entitled to -- or you are entitled to qualified 

immunity. 

 So this would seem like a hornbook case 

where you have to make the motion, and if you have to 

make the motion, you didn't; and if you didn't, you 

don't go back and review the facts as the motion on the 

basis of the facts as they were before the trial.  End

 MR. MIZER:  Again, I would disagree that 

that's what the Sixth Circuit said because of the 

language at the bottom of page 7a of the petition 

10

appendix, where they clearly say that it's an appeal 

11 

from the verdict.

 And so because it's demonstrably not true 

that they were treating the summary judgment order as 

the final appealable order here, the question presented 

by Ms. Ortiz is not actually presented by this case. 

And the further arguments that a 50(b) motion was 

required here under Unitherm were never made in the 

Sixth Circuit and not made in her opening cert petition. 

And so that argument also is not presented by this case.

 And so I think the clear resolution is to 

dismiss the case as improvidently granted, but if the 

Court were inclined to the view that the merits should 

be reached, then the clear rule that we posit resolves 

the case, which is that orders made by the district 

court along the way in the course of a district court

proceeding are adequately preserved for appellate review 

from the final judgment once they are pressed and passed

 If there are no further questions -­

 MR. MIZER:  Once they are pressed and passed 

on by the district court.  And the qualified immunity 

claim here was pressed and passed on -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you're saying that if 

there's anything in the record of the trial that 

indicates that the judge ruled on the issue, there need 

not be a 50(b) motion? 

 MR. MIZER:  That's correct, Your Honor.  And 

the lower courts, I think, are well-equipped to assess 

whether or not an issue has adequately been pressed and 

passed on in the district court. 

 That has been the settled rule of appellate 

19 

reviewability, and I don't think that it should be 

20

21 

22 

23

changed by imposing a Rule 50(b) requirement for 

anything other than a sufficiency of the evidence 

motion. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I just want to be 

24 

clear.  Your answer to Justice Kennedy had the caveat 

25

that except for the issue we addressed in Unitherm.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. MILLS 

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. MILLS:  Thank you. 

 The -- one thing that's important about the 

Sixth Circuit's language when it said it was reviewing 

summary judgment, the single decision it cited was the 

Eighth Circuit's decision in Goff v. Bise.  Now, in that 

-- in that decision, the Eighth Circuit said, yes, we 

can review this after trial even though it was summary 

judgment, because it's qualified immunity, but the 

Eighth Circuit actually ignored the trial evidence.  It 

actually did this seemingly illogical step of just 

looking at the summary judgment evidence as-is. 

 Now, I think what that shows is the Sixth 

Circuit was definitely reviewing summary judgment, but 

it, implicitly at least, recognized that would be 

entirely illogical.  So it tied its decision to the only 

decision by the district court on qualified immunity, 

52
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

summary judgment, and said:  We've got to look at what 

really happened in this case.  And so they looked ahead. 

 Now, the reason the question is adequately 

4 

presented is because I think the Sixth Circuit's 

5

25

decision shows this entire debate about Unitherm and 

whether this was a quasi-50(a) review is the -- one of 

the precise reasons the Sixth Circuit hinged its 

decision on summary judgment. 

 I think it was quite aware that an appellate 

court, since at least 1947, in Cone, cannot review the 

sufficiency of the evidence at trial and overturn the 

jury's verdict.  And so the Sixth Circuit said:  Wait a 

second; we can look to the summary judgment record. 

Now -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the rule that you 

want us to adopt to answer the question presented?  You 

asked us to take cert on a question presented.  What's 

the answer you want us to give on the question 

presented?

 MR. MILLS:  Yes.  The answer is that a party 

may not appeal the denial of summary judgment after 

trial. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In no circumstances? 

 MR. MILLS:  I would say that the clearest 

rule is to say in no circumstances.  That's the position 

53
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

of the Fourth Circuit.  You say, if you want to 

challenge a judgment, simply make your motion. 

 But I would add that whichever way this 

4 

Court goes, the decision here has to be reversed, 

5

6 

7 

8

because there's no doubt that the legal issue of 

qualified immunity at summary judgment depended entirely 

on the officers' conduct at trial. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your rule, in 

9 

response to Justice Sotomayor, would basically require 

10

anyone who has an assertion of qualified immunity to 

11 

take their collateral appeal or interlocutory appeal. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 MR. MILLS:  It would only require it, Your 

Honor, to the extent that they wish to challenge that 

decision on the summary judgment record.  I'm not at all 

suggesting that that appeal is required to preserve the 

issue of immunity.  It's easily preserved, but to the 

extent a trial occurs on the officers' conduct -- and 

the officers want to say, wait a second, we're still 

immune -- that evidence even at trial is insufficient 

for liability.  You've got the right to preserve your 

immunity issue, but you have to have the district court 

consider the question. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So they are put to a 

24 

choice whether or not their qualified immunity claim 

25

rests entirely on law or might turn out, as you say it 

54
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

did in your case, to have some factual aspect? 

2

3

 MR. MILLS:  That's right.  And they -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's kind of 

4 

a tough choice to put them to, isn't it?

5

6 

7 

8

 MR. MILLS:  Well, they have an absolute 

right to take that immediate appeal, and -- and they 

chose not to. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So they have to take 

9 

the immediate appeal, and when they do so, they lose the 

10

11

12

13

right to appeal at the end? 

 MR. MILLS:  No, they do not. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why is that? 

 MR. MILLS:  They do not because if they lose 

14 

the appeal and they go to trial, you've got a new case. 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

You've got -- I shouldn't say a new case.  You've got 

new evidence of conduct.  And so there's no loss of the 

issue of immunity.  It's just that it turns on the facts 

from the trial. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You've assumed -- you've 

assumed all the evidence in their favor at the summary 

21 

judgment stage. 

22

23

 MR. MILLS:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you really think that 

24 

this is a realistic scenario where there's going to be 

25

even more evidence against them than -- I mean, you're 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

assuming the evidence against them.  There's going to be 

even more evidence against them than they assumed at the 

summary judgment?  That's not going to happen very 

often.

 MR. MILLS:  It happened here. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

 MR. MILLS:  Thank you very much.
