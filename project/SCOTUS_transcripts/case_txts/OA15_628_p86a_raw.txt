ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDRA A. E. SHAPIRO 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

please the Court: 

 

 

11 

            

In case after case -- McNally, Skilling, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

McDonald, to name just a few -- this Court has construed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal criminal statutes narrowly to avoid serious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separation of powers and vagueness problems. 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

This case presents those same constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

concerns, but to a far greater degree, because no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute defines the elements of the crime.  The Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should limit this crime to its core, as it did in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Skilling, and that core is the insider's abuse of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confidential corporate information for personal profit. 

 

 

 

 

 

Unless and until Congress enacts a definition, the crime 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be limited to trading by the insider or its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functional equivalent -- equivalent where the insider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tips another person in exchange for a financial benefit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose in this case the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

person with the inside -- inside information, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother with the inside information, had himself traded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the securities, and then gave the proceeds to his --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what was it?  His older brother?  Would that have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

violated 10(b)? 

 

6 

            

7 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what's the difference, 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

if the insider trades and gives it -- makes the proceeds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a gift, or if he just says, you do the trade; here's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

gift? 

11 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  The difference, Your Honor, is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

that the transaction -- the securities transaction is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete when the insider trades.  And this is a statute 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that doesn't even mention insider trading, much less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tipping or personal benefit.  And so in that instance, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it wouldn't be covered, and he can do whatever he wants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the money. 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Justice Ginsburg was 

  

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

setting up the question, isn't he -- in -- in her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance where the tippee does the trading, the tippee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is just an accomplice.  This is standard accomplice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

stuff. 

23 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  No, Your Honor.  This -- the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

statute -- this is a case where we have to take a step 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back and look at the fact the statute doesn't define the

elements.  It doesn't even mention insider trading, much 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

less tipping, and the -- the -- whereas Dirks and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chiarella before it make clear that not all trading on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inside information is unlawful.  And what makes it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful is that the insider is doing it for personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gain, whether trading himself and profiting on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information by doing so, or whether it's by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumventing that rule, as discussed in Dirks, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially giving the information to someone else so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he can get a financial kickback.  That's --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe I'm missing --

  

 

 

 

 

 

maybe one of us is missing the import of the question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Are -- are you suggesting that if two people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get together, one of them has inside information and he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says to the other person, why don't the two of us -- why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't you trade on that, and then you and I will split 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proceeds, that that's not covered? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  That is covered, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, okay. 

  

 

 

 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  I'm sorry.  What I meant was 

   

  

  

 

 

 

that if the insider -- as occurred in this case, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's undisputed in this case -- did not act for any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial gain, did not make any money at all, that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's not covered. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Don't you think that his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

brother's statement -- when he was asked about trading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by Maher, the younger brother, he said, I owe somebody 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money.  Isn't that most naturally read to be either give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me the money to pay this person back or give me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information that lets me pay him back?  Isn't that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always the quid pro quo of a gift, that you believe that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you give someone a gift, it's going to cost you one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way or another? 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

            

You're going to give them something of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

value, or you're going to substitute money for the gift, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or you're going to do something that saves you money by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving the tip. 

 

 

13 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, Your Honor, I think the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

problem with that is that virtually anything would --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any disclosure would then amount to a gift, and this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has been crystal clear that -- that not any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosure leads to a violation --

   

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's true, but then 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

comes the government's suggestion that the disclosure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to be for a personal benefit or a personal purpose, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there has to be a reason you're doing it, not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accidentally, not -- not unknowingly, but something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're doing because you want to receive some benefit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

from it. 

 

25 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, in this case, it's quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

clear that Maher, the -- the insider brother, didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive any benefit at all, and indeed the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court and the SEC made that clear.  He did not do this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for any kind of self-benefit, and I think the evidence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the record, even construed in the light most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable to the government, as it must be, demonstrates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that at most, the insider got the scant benefit of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting his brother off his back.  This was not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willing transfer of inside information.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why do you say "scant"? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, Your Honor, I think we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

12 

have to get back to the fact that this --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, my bigger question is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

why -- why do all the disclosure forms we have to fill 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out?  They have a lot of relatives.  You have to put, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like, your minor children, your wife.  And in giving 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gifts, you have to disclose your minor children, your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

wife. 

19 

20 

21 

              

I mean, why are the statute books filled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with instances where the public wants to know, not just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how you might benefit, but how your family might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

benefit? 

23 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, Your Honor, the statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

books are filled with rules like that, but Section --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because --

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

MS. SHAPIRO:  -- 10(b) --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, I realize it 

   

  

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

doesn't, but I mean, I'm looking for the reason why. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And of course I can suggest a reason.  Because they 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

think very often, though it depends on families, to help 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a close family member is like helping yourself.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not true of all families --

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

10 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- but many, it is. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. SHAPIRO:  I think that the important 

    

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

thing here is that the statute doesn't address this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And Congress could certainly pass a statute --

   

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

benefits? 

15 

            

16 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you think it addresses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. SHAPIRO:  No, the statute --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, the statute 

    

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

doesn't, but there's a long history, and the person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

who's been defrauded, I take it, or the object of deceit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the company whose information you use.  And when you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use their information, which you shouldn't, and tell it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to someone, you're hurting them.  And then there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subset of cases that we prosecute.  And the subset of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases we prosecute are the cases where, having used that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, you use it to benefit yourself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the question, I take it, is when you use 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

it to benefit a close family member, is that, in effect, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefitting yourself.  Cecil B. DeMille said -- or maybe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jack Warner -- rule of relativity:  Never hire a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relative.  You could have -- you could have that view, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but you also have the view that helping a relative is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

helping yourself. 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

            

Now, that seems to me where we are in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, and the law is filled with instances where they do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem to think it's the same.  And there are a lot of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases here that think it's about the same, so why isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

it? 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, Your Honor, there aren't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a lot of cases, and the only cases that this Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided are Chiarella, Dirks and O'Hagan.  The only case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in which the Court held for the government was O'Hagan, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the insider was making his own profits to the tune 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of $4 million. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Shapiro, you're asking 

  

 

 

 

 

us to ignore some extremely specific language in Dirks, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which of course, was decided quite some time ago.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm just going read in Dirks. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Court is talking about when it would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper under the statute to convict somebody for insider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trading, it's because there might be a relationship 

   

 

 

 

 

 

between the insider and the recipient, or an intention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

10 

to benefit the particular recipient.  And then it goes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on to say, "When an insider makes a gift of confidential 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information to a trading relative or friend," and then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the last paragraph of the opinion, where it's really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summing up everything that it's done, the Court says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"The tippers received no monetary or personal benefit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nor was their purpose to make a gift of valuable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information to the tippee."

So there's a lot of language in Dirks which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

is very specific about, it's not only when there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quid pro quo from the tippee to the tipper, but when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tipper makes a gift to the tippee, and in particular a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relative or friend. 

 

 

14 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  That's right, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

Dirks does mention gifts, but I don't think that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  More than mention.  This is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

17 

like half their holding. 

 

 

 

18 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, I don't -- don't agree, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

Your Honor.  Dirks mentions gifts in two places, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- I believe that it's dictum, and that the holding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the case is -- is far different.  And dictum should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be used to be the basis for criminal liability when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have a statute that doesn't address --

   

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't know what 

    

 

 

 

25 

"dictum" -- what "dictum" means.  The court is very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

11 

1 

clearly setting out a test here.  And this is part of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

the test. 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it's certainly not 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

dictum in Dirks when the Court says, "Thus, the test is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the insider personally will benefit directly or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirectly from his disclosure." 

 

 

 

7 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  I agree with you, Justice 

    

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

Kennedy.  And in fact, the Court goes on to then say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right after that, "Absent some personal gain, there has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been no breach of duty to stockholders."  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

personal --

 

12 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We're talking about 

  

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

benefit and personal gain.  And Dirks says there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit in making a gift.  Now, it's -- it's true in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law of gifts, we don't generally talk about benefit to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the donor -- I can -- other than in gift tax, but that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for different reasons. 

 

 

18 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  No.  In fact, the opposite. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

In -- in most areas of the law, a gift is supposed to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that is not intended to benefit the giver. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it's critical in this area, and I think the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Securities Industry Association brief illustrates this 

 

 

 

 

 

point, but many of the other briefs do --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Except, as Justice Breyer 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

points out, you certainly benefit from giving to your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12

family. 

2 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, I -- just to -- I want 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

3 

to be very clear about --

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It ennobles you, and in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

sense it -- it helps you financially because you make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them more secure. 

 

 

7 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, I want to be very clear 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

about the test that we're proposing, because I do think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's going to capture a number of these families' 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations.  The point is the line has to be clear, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's family or anyone else that the disclosure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is being given to.  And under the pecuniary gain test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we propose, certainly there will be many cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the government can introduce evidence showing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of financial interdependence that will illustrate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the insider does benefit financially from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosure.  I'm sure that's going to be true in most 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations involving spouses, and many other situations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving close relatives. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Shapiro, let me give you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a hypothetical.  Let's suppose I would like to give a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

gift to a friend of mine, but it's just too expensive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for me to give it.  And then I pass a coworker's desk, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I see a hundred dollar bill sitting there, and I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

take the hundred dollar bill; and now I can give a gift 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

1 

that I had wanted to give, but I couldn't. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

2 

            

Now, have I benefitted from stealing the 

   

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

hundred dollar bill? 

 

 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, you have.  And why 

  

  

 

 

 

 

should the issue be any different if, instead of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stealing the hundred dollar bill off my coworker's desk, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I instead steal information and give the gift of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information rather than give a gift of cash? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, there's certainly going 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

to be some situations involving gifts that will be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered.  So for example, if I have a tradition every --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

once a year at Christmastime to give a household 

   

   

 

 

 

 

employee a bonus, and one year I decide to give her a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tip instead, that would certainly qualify.  It's going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to depend on the nature of the evidence and whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a -- a --

   

   

18 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think what I'm suggesting 

    

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

by the hypothetical is that we all have our own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests and purposes behind giving gifts.  Some of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those might be very practical and pragmatic.  Some of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them might be more altruistic.  But we give gifts for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual interests and purposes. 

 

 

 

24 

            

And here, I'm stealing corporate 

 

 

 

 

25 

information.  It's essentially a kind of embezzlement or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

conversion.  I'm stealing information to give a gift to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

somebody I know.  It might be, as in this case, a family 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

member.  It might be a friend.  And I benefit from that 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

because -- I mean, it's the -- I personally benefit. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

It's the exact opposite of using corporate information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for corporate purposes.  I'm using it for my own 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

personal purposes. 

 

8 

            

 

MS. SHAPIRO:  But, Your Honor, that would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

true in virtually any instance one could think of where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an insider disclosed confidential corporate information, 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's in a business setting, or, as is often the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, a mixed social and business setting.  Analysts 

   

  

 

 

 

 

talk to company insiders all the time, and it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essential to the free flow of information to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marketplace that that occurs.  And if --

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wait a minute.  First of 

   

  

  

 

 

17 

18 

all, that's no longer true.  There's regulations that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

stop that, talking to analysts. 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

But talk about the culpability question. 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

Why is it any less culpable to give your close relative, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who you've been supporting every month for your entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life, so instead of giving him, one month or two months, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that regular one hundred dollar bill, you choose to give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him corporate information.  That's Justice Kagan's 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

example. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

            

Why is that person more culpable than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

person who just -- a relative comes and says, it would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be nice; I need some money.  And you give him a tip 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead of the cash. 

 

 

 

5 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  I think the issue is that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

there has to be a clear line.  We're dealing with a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime that was never defined by Congress.  None of these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words are in the statute. 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But Congress doesn't 

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

define what's deceptive or manipulative or -- what's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third word? -- what defrauds.  It has general words. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Don't devise a scheme that does these things.  The law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has for ages said that the failure to -- to speak when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're obligated to; i.e., an insider who doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclose that he's using your information is an omission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's been, classically, a fraud. 

   

 

 

            

So I don't understand why you keep saying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that the law doesn't define this. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Because, Your Honor, the law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

says nothing about insider trading, and as the Chiarella 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court said, the statute provides no specific guidance, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nor does the legislative history.  And any -- this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very similar to the honest services fraud crime, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeed, before that statute was enacted, the mail fraud 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute that existed before the McNally case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

            

The statute talked about fraud.  The honest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

services fraud statute talked about fraud, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided no specific guidances to what would violate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

And this Court held that the statute needed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

to be construed narrowly to ensure that there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear line.  Other countries have insider trading laws, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and all of those laws use words like "insider" and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

define under what circumstances a person is violating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the law by trading. 

 

 

 

10 

            

This Court has repeatedly held that there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

no general duty to refrain from insider trading.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's essential that the market participants understand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the line is crossed and when it's not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

            

16 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- well --

    

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Breyer. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I agree with that.  But it 

    

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

seems to me the analogy is the antitrust laws, very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vague statute.  They've been around a long time. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Exactly what's criminal and what's civil and so forth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been developed by courts over a long time.  This 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute's been around since the '30s, and we have courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developing law in it.  And I believe the marketplace 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

pays a lot of attention to that.  And virtually every 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, I think, but this one has held that this does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extend to a tipper giving inside information to a close 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

relative.  And it seems to me -- and I'm giving you a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance to respond to this, that -- suddenly to take the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minority statute here -- or to take the Second Circuit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is what I'm thinking of -- is really more likely to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change the law that people have come to rely upon than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is to keep to it. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I just want to get your view on that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, I don't think so, Your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

Honor, and I think some of the amicus briefs illustrate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there's been a tremendous amount of murkiness in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Securities Industry Association.  In particular, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has had a lot of trouble -- its members have had a lot 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of trouble determining when they can and can't use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market information of this sort.  And regulation FD, by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way, is very clear that it does not purport to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change the antifraud laws.  And the regulation itself 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides that a violation of regulation in FD does not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in and of itself constitute insider trading under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

10(b) --

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that -- that addresses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not there's an initial breach.  Here, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume there's an initial breach.  The question is:  How 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

far out does liability extend?  And it seems to me that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you're saying doesn't quite address the problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

we're discussing. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

1 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  No, Justice Kennedy, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

agree with that, because what this Court has repeatedly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held in a number of cases going back to the Santa Fe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case is not every breach of fiduciary duty violates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 10(b), and it has to be a fraudulent breach. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the question of whether it's a fraudulent breach 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

depends upon whether the insider is doing the disclosing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in exchange for personal benefit.  That's the test. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

It's not simply whether there's any old 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

breach of fiduciary duty.  Indeed, one could argue in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Dirks case that the insider there, Secrist, was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breaching his fiduciary duty. 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If Dirks is the test, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

it certainly was phrased as a test and that's how Judge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ray could have understood it, if it is the test, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case falls within it because it's a gift, right? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  I don't agree with that, Your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  I think that the facts of this case show that --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there may be many family circumstances where this would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a gift, but I think the facts of this case show that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the insider was not -- he was being pestered by his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother and pressured to release the information.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't even know he was trading until later in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process.  And even then the largest trade in this case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involves a situation where he immediately called his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

19 

brother back and begged him not to trade, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother said he wouldn't.  So I don't agree with that, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

Your Honor. 

 

4 

            

But I think it is essential in order for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

there to be a clear line that the Court hold that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insider must personally benefit in a concrete way unless 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and until Congress -- if that's an under inclusive test, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress can act.  Congress can change the law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And why isn't it a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

benefit, if you said the brother was pestering him so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now his brother is happy?  He's no longer being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pestered.  Isn't that a benefit? 

   

  

 

13 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Well, if that's a benefit, 

   

  

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

virtually anything is, and then the Court would be going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to the rule that expressly rejected in Chiarella, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaffirmed in Dirks, and even in the Omega case, that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that any general duty not to refrain from -- to refrain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from insider trading. 

 

 

19 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you agree that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the -- you phrased it in terms of a concrete personal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit.  I take it you agree it doesn't have to be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purely financial?  The example is the government gave a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preference for a child in college admissions, romantic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

favors.  The personal benefit you say just has to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tangible and concrete, but it doesn't have to be money, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

right? 

2 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  It doesn't necessarily have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

be money.  It has to be something concrete. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except your defining 

  

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

limit?  It has to be tangible? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  It has to be tangible.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have to be cash.  It has to be something that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either immediately pecuniary or can be translated into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

financial.

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we disagree with you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because of the gift language of Dirks, how else could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you suggest to limit liability?  What other ways are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there to take care of someone who -- closer cases that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist?  Lisser has given us one proposal.  What's yours? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Besides the fact it has to be a tangible benefit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  I don't think there's any 

    

 

 

 

 

other test that the Court could provide that wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially be a judicial expansion retroactively of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute that doesn't address the question in violation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the separation of powers.  I think that the other 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing that I would like to come back to, which we talk 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about in the briefs, is the fact that there's a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogous situation with respect to the private right of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action in 10(b), which was also created by the courts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and this Court has repeatedly held that in that context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

which is not in criminal context and does not involve a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk to a person's liberty that the Court must narrowly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construe the statute and not expand it further, and it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for Congress to decide whether to expand it further. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I think that --

   

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4

6 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Shapiro, here is not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

question of expanding it further.  You're asking us to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cut back significantly from something that we said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several decades ago, something that Congress has shown 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no indication that it's unhappy with, and in a context 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in which, I mean, obviously the integrity of the markets 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are a very important thing for this country.  And you're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking us essentially to change the rules in a way that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threatens that integrity. 

 

 

15 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  No, Your Honor, I don't think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

we're asking you to change the rules.  This Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only addressed this question once.  I don't think the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

gift language is -- is the holding of the case.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding of the case is that the insider has to get a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal gain.  The point of the test in the case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which, again, ruled against the government, is to ensure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that what's captured is something that is essentially a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumvention of the test the Court discussed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chiarella where the insider is improperly profiting from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

the information. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

And with respect to the integrity of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And Chiarella really

markets --

wasn't an insider.  He was the printer that -- he had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the information, but he was -- he didn't have any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fiduciary duty to the corporation. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  That's correct.  I was 

    

  

 

 

referring to the discussion in the case about when a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty would arise.  And the Court in that case held that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was no duty, but that a duty would have arisen if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he had been an insider in the company whose shares were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at issue.  And the reason for that is that the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held that it would be a fraud to exploit the information 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for his personal trading profits because he had a duty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to those shareholders and a duty to speak and either 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclose or abstain from trading. 

 

 

 

 

            

With respect to the integrity of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

markets, getting back to your question, Justice Kagan, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that that is clearly a policy question, and it is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a very complex policy question.  It is not one nearly as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simple as the government would like to have the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe.  And I think there's extensive literature cited 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in our briefs and some of the amicus briefs which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illustrates that's there's a robust debate among 

   

 

 

 

 

academics, regulators, market participants about what --

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

what should be -- whether insider trading should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulated at all, but more importantly to what extent, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and how do you do that while ensuring that there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient free flow of information to the markets that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this information can actually work its way into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

price. 

7 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I wasn't suggesting that 

   

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

there was -- there are easy answers to the question of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what contributes to the integrity of the market.  I was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting that it's a reason for caution in changing a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30-year-old rule that everybody has understood and lived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by, and that -- that Congress has shown no indication 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's unhappy with. 

 

 

14 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  Your Honor, may I reserve the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

15 

remainder of my time for rebuttal? 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.  Thank you.

Under a pecuniary gain limitation to the

could parcel it out to favored friends, family members

and acquaintances who could all use it in trading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without the knowledge of the public or the investors on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other side of the trade.  This would be deleterious 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the integrity of the securities markets.  It would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injure investor confidence, and it would contradict a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33-year-old precedent of this Court that was designed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

announce the circumstances in which material nonpublic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information possessed by an insider could not be used. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Isn't it something of a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

stretch to say that the circumstance you describe more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

widespread on dissemination are all gifts? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So some of them may be gifts. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Some of them may be to obtain a reputational benefit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that might translate in the future into pecuniary gain. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Some of them might actually involve a quid pro quo.  My 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point is that under Petitioner's theory, when they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gifts, in other words when the information is given out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a romantic partner or to a struggling child who's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

having difficulty making it, or as in this case a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother who at one point actually was offered money by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the insider but turned it down and preferred the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, those things would not be criminal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But not everything 

  

 

 

 

 

is a -- is a gift just because it's disclosed.  I mean 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

a -- social acquaintances, you know, that people say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

25 

we're all going away for the weekend, why don't you join 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us?  I can't, I'm working on this Google thing, or 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like that, and it means something to the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  You wouldn't call that a gift.  You'd call it a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

social interchange.  And maybe it's, you know, something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he should have been more careful about saying, but it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite different than a gift.  And it seems to me that, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

however you read Dirks, it certainly doesn't go beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

gifts. 

10 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So I -- I don't disagree with 

   

   

  

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

that, Mr. Chief Justice.  There is a difference between 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a breach of a duty of confidentiality with respect to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, and the kind of breach that was defined by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the SEC in Cady, Roberts and incorporated into the law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of securities fraud in this Court's decisions in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chiarella and Dirks. 

 

 

            

And it has two elements to it.  The first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element is that the information was made available to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the insider for a corporate purpose and not for personal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit or personal use. 

 

 

 

            

And the second is that the insider is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing it for the purpose of obtaining a personal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

advantage, either for himself or somebody else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So then the 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

social -- casual social interchange I -- I hypothesized 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

1 

would not be covered under your interpretation? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  It would not be a personal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

benefit.  Now, it might give rise to liability on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the tippee if there was an understanding between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the parties, the insider and the tippee, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conversations of that kind would remain confidential. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's hazy -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

kind of a hazy line to draw, isn't it, between something 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you characterize as a gift and something that would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be characterized as social interaction, isn't it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

all. 

13 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  No, I don't think it's hazy at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it depend how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

close a friend -- the friends are going away for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weekend, how close the friends are? 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  There may be --

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If it's -- then I --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I want to give him a gift, because we've been great 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friends for so many years, as opposed to I just want to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell him why I can't come? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So the burden is on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government to show that the information was given for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of trading and that it was in breach of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fiduciary duty.  And in most of these cases, there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence of any legitimate corporate purpose for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

27 

1 

disclosure whatsoever. 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But the difficult part is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6

for a personal advantage, at least to me.  And the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is what counts if the tipper gives inside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information to a member -- a family member or friend? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

When is it for a personal advantage, and when is it not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a personal advantage? 

   

 

8 

            

9 

            

10 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So I think that --

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do we decide? 

  

 

 

 

MR. DREEBEN:  I think, Justice Breyer, that 

    

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

whenever information is given, it's inside information; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's given by an insider to another person for that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person to be able to profit on it, something that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insider himself is forbidden to do. 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

            

17 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So if you know --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. DREEBEN:  It's covered. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  If you give it to your --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

anyone in the world, and -- whom you happen to know, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you believe that that person will trade on it, that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a personal advantage. 

   

 

21 

            

22 

            

23 

            

24 

            

25 

advantage? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes? 

  

 

MR. DREEBEN:  -- because --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the personal 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

28 

1 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  You have taken valuable 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

corporate information --

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

MR. DREEBEN:  -- and you're giving a gift of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

that information to a person to enable them to profit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So what is the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

personal advantage that you received? 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  The advantage that you receive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

is that you are able to make a gift with somebody else's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property.  And I think that, to the extent that the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court used the word --

 

 

 

 

12 

            

13 

advantage? 

14 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That is a personal 

   

  

 

 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Breyer, let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

step back for a minute.  What the Court was trying to do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Dirks was separate out when an insider was breaching 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his fiduciary duty by providing information and when he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not.  And the line that the Court selected tracks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the basic duty of loyalty in corporate law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  It doesn't seem to me that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your argument is much more consistent with Dirks than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

Ms. Shapiro's. 

 

23 

24 

25 

            

Now suppose someone, the insider is walking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down the street and sees someone who has a really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unhappy look on his face and says, I want to do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

something to make this person's day.  And so he provides 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the inside information to that person and says, you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make some money if you trade on this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

5 

            

Is that a violation? 

   

 

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  And I'm trying to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

explain why that is.  I think that Dirks adopted the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic line that sets forth in the duty of loyalty, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is well established, that when you are given something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for corporate purposes, you may not use it for personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  And that was exactly what the Court adopted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

in --

 

12 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If they did that, why did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

they use the word "advantage"?  The -- you keep going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to the -- the part that everybody concedes:  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tipper is using information he shouldn't use in a way he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't use it.  Okay?  Conceded. 

  

  

 

 

17 

            

Now, it's the next step of what -- when is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

he liable, and what the words are is when he uses it for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a personal advantage.  And it sounds to me, as you are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying -- and you said this -- whenever the tipper knows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the person, to him, he -- who he gives the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information might well use it to trade. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  No.  I did not say that, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

24 

Justice Breyer. 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What did you say? 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

MR. DREEBEN:  Let -- let me clarify this. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

MR. DREEBEN:  What the Court said in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

MR. DREEBEN:  -- was that it was drawing a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

            

4 

Dirks --

 

5 

            

6 

            

7

11 

line between people who had information for corporate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes and used it consistently with those purposes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and people who had access to corporate information made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available to them only for corporate purposes and used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it for personal benefit. 

 

 

 

12 

            

And it gave a number of examples.  And I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

think that the way to understand Dirks is to synthesize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the various examples the Court gave to understand the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle underlying the decision. 

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

            

18 

            

19 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

MR. DREEBEN:  The examples --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Go ahead. 

  

 

 

MR. DREEBEN:  The examples include direct 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

quid pro quo --

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

MR. DREEBEN:  -- profiting, paid clearly a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

personal benefit. 

 

24 

            

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

MR. DREEBEN:  It also includes something far 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

less tangible:  Reputational benefit that will possibly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

translate in the future into financial advantage. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

And then it clearly included in the category 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

of things that were not appropriate corporate purposes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving a gift to somebody, and it explained why.  If you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give a gift of information to somebody for trading, it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is equivalent to the insider using the information to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trade himself, and then making a gift of the profits to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

a recipient.

23 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you are -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are arguing for an exact relationship between, not for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate purpose and for a personal benefit.  Is there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

any area that something falls in the middle of that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's -- it's not for a corporate purpose, but it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also doesn't qualify for a personal benefit. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Whenever you're talking about how you define 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal gain/personal benefit, you say this was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given -- not given to him for a corporate purpose. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is it an exact parallel? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  I think it -- I think it is, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So any disclosure of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

any confidential information is actionable under that to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

you --

 

25 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  No. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

1 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- because it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

not given to him to disclose. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  No.  That is the difference 

  

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

between the breach of a duty of confidentiality, which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

may have to do with the corporate officer's duty of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care, as distinct from the duty of loyalty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Give me the example 

  

 

 

 

 

of something that is not for a corporate purpose but is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also not for a personal gain, under your view. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  When there's no knowledge that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the individual to whom you're going to give the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information is trading, there's no breach of the Cady, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Roberts duty.  So in your hypothetical of the social 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conversation, the government would not seek to hold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable somebody who was loose in their conversations but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had no anticipation that there would be trading. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not interested 

  

 

 

 

 

in who the government would seek to have liable.  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interested in what the rule is going to be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  I'm equating the two, 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice.  I'm not --

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This Court has not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

equated the two. 

 

 

24 

            

(Laughter.) 

25 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  I understand.  But I think 

    

   

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

that -- that the -- the rule that we're asking the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to adopt is really a rule that tracks the basic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles of duty of loyalty that lie at the base of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Dirks opinion. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

And I realize that the Dirks opinion used 

   

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

language in it; it used a variety of formulations: 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Personal benefit, personal advantage, personal gain. 

 

 

 

 

 

But the examples that the Court gives, gave to support 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that doctrinal analysis, I think lead to the conclusion 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that what Justice Powell was trying to do in the opinion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was to distinguish cases in which somebody was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate officer, and they used the information for an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate purpose; maybe somebody went out and traded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on it afterward --

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Dreeben, I'm -- I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

not sure that your solution is going to clarify much of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this area, because now I think the fight is going to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over what was the reason that the tipper gave for giving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

the tip. 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

              

I mean, in this very case, there were three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons for breaching the rule of confidentiality.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first, to -- for Maher to become more knowledgeable of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the health care industry.  Under your reading, if he had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no knowledge his brother would trade, that was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

actionable; correct? 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

1 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, correct, Justice 

  

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

Sotomayor, but that also was not information that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flowing from the insider to his brother.  What we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged in this case were the circumstances --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  I'm talking about 

  

  

 

 

 

that there are three examples of breaching 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

confidentiality. 

8 

9 

10 

            

The first was to -- for him to become more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledgeable of the health industry. 

 

 

 

 

            

The second was to help the father with his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

medical care. 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

            

And the third, the one you charged, was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving of information, knowing that his brother was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to trade on it. 

 

 

 

 

            

How do you draw the line among those three? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All three were for personal reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  No.  But the only one that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

involved knowledge or anticipation of trading were the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances in which the brother was basically funding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

his --

 

21 

22 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you have --

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  -- older brother's securities 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

trading. 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if all he did it for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was to get information for his father, had no idea that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

1 

2 

his brother was trading, he would not be liable and his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother wouldn't be liable. 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  I agree with the first, not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

4 

with the second. 

 

 

5 

            

If I could explain just briefly for just a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

second.  There are two theories of insider trading.  One 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is classical insider trading where an insider who's been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given the information for a corporate purpose trades on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, or tips somebody else to trade on it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The second theory is misappropriation.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

if the older brother in this instance was given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confidential information under a circumstance in which 

   

 

 

 

 

there was an understanding that there would be no use of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that information for personal benefit or under the SEC's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current Rule 10b5-2, which defines these kinds of close 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

family relationships, siblings, parents and children, 

 

 

 

 

 

husbands and wives, as being relationships that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

typically ones in which secrets are protected, the older 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother could be charged with misappropriating 

 

 

 

 

 

information from the younger one. 

 

 

 

 

            

But here we're concerned with the insider's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal benefit.  And my suggestion, I think --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it -- but the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defendant here is not the insider, and -- and we've been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about the two brothers.  How far down the line 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

do you go?  Because Salman is not -- he's a relative by 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marriage, but he's -- he's not -- he gets the money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from -- I mean, he gets the tip from the first tippee.

4 

            

5 

            

6 

continue? 

7 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How -- how long does it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, tipping chains can --

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

can go quite a ways when the information is passed, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the limitation on when the government can charge these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases is a limitation of proof.  We need to be able to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show that the tippee, perhaps at the end of the chain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be more difficult than the ones earlier in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chain, had knowledge that the information originated in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a circumstance in which there was a breach of fiduciary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty for personal benefit. 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Had knowledge or 

  

 

 

 

17 

should -- should have known. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  No, with -- in a criminal case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

we have to show knowledge.  Now, we can rely on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conscious avoidance.  That's a very classic instruction 

   

  

 

 

 

that the Court clarified in Global-Tech about how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledge can be inferred when someone deliberately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoids confirming facts of which they -- or should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aware, but that involves a personal culpability that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

takes care of I think the concern that criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

37 

1 

liability will extend forever.  It won't. 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let's look at -- on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

other side, if you think about the tipper now.  You've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used a couple of times the phrase "knowledge" or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

"anticipation." 

6 

            

7 

            

8 

            

9 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That there would be trading. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So is -- is that something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

more than he thinks there could be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- he thinks there -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

mean, he thinks there would be?  Is it as strong as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

that? 

15 

            

16 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me give you this example 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

because that -- this goes to that, this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

 

So the person with the inside information 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

has had a few drinks at the country club and is talking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to some friends and discloses the inside information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to the friends.  And one of the friends then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trades on the information. 

 

 

 

23 

            

Now, what would you have to prove as to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

mental state of the tipper and the tippee?  As to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tipper, would you have to prove that he knew that one of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

1 

2 

3 

4 

the friends would trade on the inside information or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he was reckless as to whether the friend would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trade on the inside information, he knew this was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person who was in the stock market? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

And as to the tippee, what would you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

prove?  That the tippee knew that the insider knew that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he was going to trade on the information?  What would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to prove? 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  As -- as to the tip -- as to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

the tipper, we submit that an element of the Cady, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Roberts duty is that the insider anticipated that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person to whom he gave the information would trade. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now, he --

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is anticipated the same as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

he knew he would? 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  I think that knowledge, 

    

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

anticipation, understanding is the language that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second Circuit has used to describe it all -- all fits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

the bill. 

 

20 

            

We're talking here about a gift of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

21 

information --

 

22 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it's not enough.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

23 

like, well, I think he might or --

   

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  No, it's not enough. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- or, you know, I'm sort of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

1 

betting that he would, but I don't really know. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Now, in a criminal case, we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

need to show a breach of the fiduciary duty.  We're also 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to have to show an intent to defraud, fraudulent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent, and we're going to have to show willfulness in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order to obtain a criminal conviction. 

   

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why do you want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

put knowledge of the -- knowledge that it will be used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for trading as part of the breach of fiduciary duty?  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you do that, then you have to prove that the tippee knew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the tipper thought it would be traded. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, and I don't think that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a very difficult burden because in most of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations, it's obvious why it's being done. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why can't you put it in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the intent to defraud? 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  It goes to intent to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

defraud --

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why -- why make it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the breach --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Because Dirks did.  Dirks did. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Dirks adopted the Cady, Roberts formulation of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breach of duty, which to go back to it again, it is of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the transmission of information that was made available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only for a corporate purpose, for personal benefit, with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

1 

2 

the intent and knowledge that the individual is going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trade.  Now, it doesn't --

  

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't say it -- it has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

a sentence here which is exactly what's hanging me up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and exactly what I thought you were going to answer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before you got cut off. 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

The sentence is:  "The elements exist also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

when an insider makes a gift of confidential information 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a trading relative or friend." 

   

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That doesn't sound as if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

the writer of those words had in mind any person in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world.  Now, in each instance you have to know that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person would, in fact, use the information to trade, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't say any person in the world.  It says a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trading relative or friend. 

 

 

 

17 

            

18 

            

19 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, but --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So I want --

   

  

 

 

MR. DREEBEN:  -- this isn't a portion of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

opinion, Justice Breyer. 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No. 

  

 

All right.  So I should read the whole 

   

  

 

 

 

 

23 

opinion, and --

 

 

24 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  No, I'm -- it's a portion of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

25

of the concrete circumstances, objective criteria that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will allow the government to establish that the purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the disclosure was for personal benefit as opposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the SEC was concerned about, that people would use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ostensible business justifications to explain why the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information was being given out and the SEC was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned this is going to create a quagmire of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

subjective analysis.  And the Court's response was to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

give examples in which the objective criteria would help 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish.  And the confirmation of this, I think, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer, is that at the end of the opinion, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portion that Justice Kagan read earlier today, it's on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 667, it's where the Court analyzes why Secrist and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other insiders at Equity Funding had not occasioned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability for Dirks. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What can I read -- now I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

want you to tell me what I can read to get the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation of Dirks that the majority of lower courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have followed.  It seems to me the Second Circuit has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not read it as you're reading it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  For after all, they came to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the opposite conclusion.  And are there circuits that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have read it just as you had, said you walk down the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

street.  You find anybody, you don't even know him, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

he does keep saying trading, trading, trading, trading, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you tell him, and therefore you know that he will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely trade.  Now, in other words, an anonymous person, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very far, just what you're arguing, what are the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits that follow that? 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  I'm not -- this case does not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

involve that situation.  This case involves --

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I realize this case --

   

  

 

 

 

 

9 

I'm trying to get it clear in my mind. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  This involves the classic, 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

prototypical situation that actually arises in the real 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world and gets prosecuted. 

 

 

 

13 

            

There are very few cases that involve this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

hypothetical of somebody distributing inside 

 

 

 

 

15 

information --

 

16 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not worried about that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

I'm not worried so much about this case.  I a.m. worried 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about line drawing, and you want to draw a line so that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend, relative, doesn't matter, and -- and before I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

write those words, I'd like to know what circuit courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have followed that approach? 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So I think that there aren't a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

lot of cases that don't involve friends or family 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members.  I think the -- the case that most closely 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tracks the analysis that I think best explains Dirks is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

the Seventh Circuit in SEC v. Maio.  It's cited in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  It does involve two people who were close 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friends, because ordinarily those are the circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in which people decide to risk criminal liability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give out inside information so that somebody else can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1

profit. 

7 

            

But the Court makes the statement in it that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

there was no corporate reason, there's no legitimate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why one friend who's an insider at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation is giving information to a third person, he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't have to give information at all.  So why did he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do it except for what the Court concluded fits within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Dirks language? 

 

 

14 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

situation where close friends or whatever and one says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I want to tell you what I've been working on, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty interesting, but tells him, says, but whatever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you do, don't go buy stock.  You can't do that.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against the law. 

 

 

20 

            

21 

situation --

 

22 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Right.  And that is a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're not going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

to prosecute that situation when the tippee goes and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes $100,000 on it? 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  The tipper in that situation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

is disclosing information in the context where he has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made an express statement, and I'm assuming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understandings between the two that the information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not be used.  The tipper is not liable for insider 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1

trading.

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

The tippee who then trades may be charged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the misappropriation theory for having taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information from a relationship of confidence or an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

express statement and an agreement not to use the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, and the fraud there is between the tipper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the tippee, not between, as here, the tipper and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people to whom the tipper owes a fiduciary duty. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This is explained in the SEC's Rule 10b5-2, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which helps define the kinds of relationships that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support a misappropriation theory of liability. 

   

 

 

 

            

But I think, Mr. Chief Justice, what this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

illustrates is we are not urging a theory in which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tippers are per se liable every time inside information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is disclosed.  This isn't a revival of the information 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

theory that was rejected in Dirks.  And I think what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes that most clear is that there are situations in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which inside information can be legitimately revealed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even when it is known that it will occasion trading, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't violate the insider's fiduciary duty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Dreeben, I think 

   

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

45 

you're taking this way out of existing law.  Are you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to suggest that tippees aren't routinely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecuted when tippers don't know that they are going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to trade?  I think they are, and most often it's because 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you claim that they should have known it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

confidential information. 

 

7 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  In a criminal case, we're not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

8 

claiming that.  The SEC in a civil case --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's plenty --

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

there's a legion of cases I read for this -- preparing 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for this argument where the government has said --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that there are, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

Justice Sotomayor, because I don't think that that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

what we're -- we're certainly not making that submission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case.  And I think that the cases that we are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying and the jury instructions that we are obtaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplate that the disclosures to a trading relative 

   

 

 

 

 

 

or friend.  And that is the heart of the gift theory. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So I don't think that I'm departing from the way that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

the --

 

21 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're going to let 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

go of the guy that Justice Alito -- the guy on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

street who looks dejected is not my friend or a close 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relative, but I give him a tip and say, go trade on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  It will make you a lot of money. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

46 

That person -- that tipper would not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. DREEBEN:  He would, Justice Sotomayor, 

  

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

liable. 

3 

            

4 

5 

6 

for the very reason you yourself articulated.  In that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation, there's a gift of information to someone with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the intent that the person trade.  Now doesn't --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's irrelevant 

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

whether it's a friend or family member? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  My submission is that the best 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way to understand Dirks is that it goes to a breach of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fiduciary duty, which would not be limited to two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories like that.  And I don't think that Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Powell, in articulating this species of personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit, was attempting to rely on it.  I was trying to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain this before to Justice Breyer. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

At the end of the opinion where the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely says that Secrist is not liable because he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't make any financial advantage, it goes on to say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nor did he make a gift of valuable information to Dirks. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now the Court didn't say, well, Dirks wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a close friend.  Dirks wasn't a relative.  Therefore 

   

  

  

 

 

 

he's out of the picture. 

 

 

 

 

            

The Court applied gift analysis in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation precisely because the line that the Court was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to draw was between the appropriate use of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

1 

corporate information and the inappropriate use. 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Dreeben, I get your --

   

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

your theory and why it doesn't make any particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference.  And indeed, in that same paragraph where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court says relatives or friends, the Court, just a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence before, just talks about an intention to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit a recipient --

   

 

8 

            

9 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  Right. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- without any sense of who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

that recipient has to be. 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

On the other hand, as you say, almost all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

these cases are relatives and friends. 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And things might look 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

different if we had a case that was not a relative or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend.  And why not separate out that strange, unusual, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hardly-ever-prosecuted situation and say we're not 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing with that here?  We have nothing to say about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

it. 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  I'm fine with that.  We are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

not seeking the Court to go beyond Dirks.  These are the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases that actually do arise in the real world.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is one case that involves a guy who was an insider who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tipped his barber, and the district court said, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the barber and the insider weren't close enough, so that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

it didn't count under Dirks.  I think that's wrong.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think that there's a good principle for it.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court --

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So is there a difference 

   

  

 

 

 

5 

between friend and acquaintance, as you're talking? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

Tell me. 

 

7 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So this is precisely the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

reason why I think it doesn't make sense, from a point 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of view of principle or application, to draw a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction that's based on words in the opinion that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court didn't actually articulate when it applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them to the very situation before it.  There is more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nebulous features about relationships, once you confine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it to undefined terms as friends or -- or relatives. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But this case clearly doesn't indicate --

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicate that at all.  It's in the heartland of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insider trading prohibition.  It's one brother to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

another brother.  There's a very close relationship. 

   

  

 

 

 

The record is replete with all of that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Court doesn't have to deal with further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outlier cases, and it doesn't have to reconceptualize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dirks, or even interpret it in the way that I have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

synthesized its analysis, in order to conclude that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strict pecuniary gain limitation is inimical to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of the securities laws and inconsistent with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

the doctrine that the Court has announced and applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for 33 years. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

And with the exception of the Second Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

in the Newman case, lower courts haven't had any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficulty applying it.  There has been a couple of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

outlier cases, as I mentioned, involving barbers.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

almost all of these cases involve situations in which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a pretty good explanation for why the tipper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be providing information for the tippee in breach 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a fiduciary duty. 

   

 

11 

            

And in cases when there is a legitimate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

corporate purpose alleged for the disclosure, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceivably may have been the concern of the Newman 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, Dirks already addressed that, too.  It said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when there's an ostensibly legitimate business 

 

 

 

 

 

justification proffered for the disclosure, people are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not going to be wandering around in the dark trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort out a subjective intent.  There will be objective 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

factors from which the relevant purpose, the personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose, can be inferred. 

 

 

 

            

And that's the portion of the opinion in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the Court goes through examples of what those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objective circumstances will be.  It includes the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

intention to benefit a particular person, and it very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically includes the gift situation.  If the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

feels more comfortable given the facts of this case of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaffirming Dirks and saying that was the law in 1983, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it remains the law today, that is completely fine with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

the government. 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

              

I think that there are cases in which it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be clearer and more beneficial to adopt the rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if there's no corporate purpose, the disclosure to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyone is a breach of a fiduciary duty.  But if the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court is more at home with the language that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually used in Dirks and wants to reaffirm it, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should do so. 

 

 

12 

            

Clearly, Congress is aware of this line of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

cases.  It has never disturbed it.  It has actually 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated the words "insider trading" into Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10(b).  It's not like this is a stranger to Congress. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And when it applied the 10(b) prohibitions to security 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

swap agreements, this is a well known area of the law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the submission of the government is that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should reaffirm it. 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so a tip here like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the one we're concerned with, the requirement is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that tippee know that the information came from a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insider?  Is that --

  

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  He has to know it came 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from an insider in breach of a fiduciary duty and for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

personal benefit, as I've been articulating it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Conscious avoidance can be used to establish that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledge.  The person doesn't have to know all of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

details of exactly what the breach of fiduciary duty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was.  There has to be enough information so that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

tippee didn't know.  And --

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is recklessness used? 

  

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Recklessness is not enough for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a criminal case, no.  We need -- we need to show 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledge in order to establish the breach of fiduciary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty.  We can and we do rely on conscious avoidance.  To 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the extent that the tipper understood that the tippee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would trade, that's a requirement of knowledge.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

not a requirement that the person intend that the tippee 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trade.  It's just an understanding and knowledge that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

would happen. 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

The tippee has to have the knowledge of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breach.  Oftentimes this can be inferred from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumstantial evidence.  This is a perfect example of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

it.  The Petitioner in this case was the -- was the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother-in-law of the insider.  He knew that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

information was coming out of Citigroup.  He knew that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was no legitimate reason for it to be disclosed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from his brother.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SHAPIRO:  The government's argument to 

  

 

 

 

 

this Court illustrates precisely the dangers with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaving a statute -- without having a statutory 

   

   

 

 

 

definition.  The government now says, for the first time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in its merits briefs and in its argument to this Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that somehow Section 10(b) and Dirks embody a duty of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loyalty standard that's nowhere in either the statute or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Dirks case. 

 

 

            

Indeed, they never argued this to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court, not to the Ninth Circuit, not in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief in opposition, nor in the Newman case.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts of Newman are actually inconsistent with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard that the government purports to propose, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the government claims that it will insist that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the insider has to have an intention that the tippee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trade.  And if you look at the facts of Newman, you'll 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see that the undisputed evidence was that with respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

53 

to the Nvidia company tipper, there was no evidence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that insider knew his acquaintance from church was going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to trade on the information.  And likewise, there wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any evidence that the other insider was aware that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyone would trade.

insider also illustrates that sometimes it's not so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear whether someone has a corporate purpose or a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal purpose, because sometimes purposes are mixed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In that instance, the insider was speaking with an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analyst who was checking his financial model, and as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence in the case shows -- this happens every day in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the markets -- the government argued that he was also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking career advice from the other individual who was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a college friend, but there's no indication there that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he knew he was going to trade. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

And furthermore, the government's argument 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

is completely inconsistent with Dirks.  The facts of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dirks, and it was undisputed on the record, are that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insider secrets disclosed the information.  He was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

seeking to expose a fraud, but he intended that Dirks 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would share the information with his institutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clients so that they could trade and drive the price of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the stock down.  And the Court expressly rejected in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote 27 a test almost identical to what the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

government is proposing here.  "The SEC," the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, "appears to contend that an insider invariably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violates the fiduciary duty of the corporation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shareholders by transmitting nonpublic corporate 

 

 

 

 

information to an outsider when he has reason to believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the outsider may use it to the disadvantage of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shareholders."  And the Court rejected that argument. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

And later in the footnote, the Court talks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

about the dissent's argument.  And the dissent argued, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court said, by perceiving a breach of fiduciary duty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whenever inside information is intentionally disclosed 

 

 

 

 

 

to securities traders, the dissenting opinion will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

achieve the same result that the Court had rejected in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chiarella and rejected again; that is, effectively, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parity of information rule.  So the government test is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent with Dirks. 

 

 

17 

            

Furthermore, as I believe Mr. Dreeben 

   

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

mentioned, one of the points in the section of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion that discusses the test is the concern that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts shouldn't have to read the party's minds as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this element of the offense as opposed to scienter, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent the government claims that there's an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentionality element to the breach of duty, that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violate that suggestion in the Dirks case as well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

And finally, with respect to the whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

55 

remote tippee concept in Petitioner in this case, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case Petitioner had no idea why Maher Kara was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosing information to his brother.  The only thing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the record shows is that there was testimony that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Michael told him the information came from the brother. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There was no evidence he had any idea why, and as I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe Justice Sotomayor pointed out earlier, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were three different reasons at various points that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information was disclosed.  One was so that he could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

educate himself about the science of the work that he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was doing.  One was so that they could discuss potential 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drugs for their ailing father.  And then there was the

third phase. 

 

14 

            

But there was no evidence whatsoever that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

Petitioner had any idea why the information was being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

disclosed. 

17 

            

And finally, with regard to the point about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

the congressional statute, the fact of the matter is, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress could be said to have --

 

 

 

 

 

 

20

22 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish your 

  

 

 

 

MS. SHAPIRO:  -- if Congress could be said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

to have ratified anything, all it could be said to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ratified is that there is an insider trading ban. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's no indication that Congress ever ratified the
