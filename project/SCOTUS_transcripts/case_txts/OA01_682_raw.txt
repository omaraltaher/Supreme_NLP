CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-682, Kay Barnes v. Jeffrey Gorman.


Mr. Robbins.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ROBBINS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The Eighth Circuit held in this case that a


private plaintiff may obtain punitive damages in an action


brought against municipal government defendants under


section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and title II


of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 


Although the court of appeals identified


substantial evidence in the legislative record that


Congress never intended this result, it thought that this


Court's decision in Franklin against Gwinnett County


Public Schools left it little or no choice in the matter. 


As the Eighth Circuit read Franklin, once a cause of


action has been created or inferred, it presumptively


carries with it all common law remedies, including


punitive damages, unless Congress has specifically said


otherwise.


QUESTION:  Mr. Robbins, did any -- did the

petitioners raise the Newport case at any time below?


MR. ROBBINS:  No. 


QUESTION:  Why not? 


MR. ROBBINS:  The -- the party --


QUESTION:  I mean, it looks like the most


obvious source of law on this topic.  What's going on


here?


MR. ROBBINS:  In the lower court, my client took


the position that it was, in fact, an arm of the State,


not an arm of the municipal government.  For various


factors -- it cited various factors that in its view


warranted an Eleventh Amendment immunity, not a City of


Newport immunity.  The court of appeals, in the decision


being reviewed before this Court today, rejected that


argument.  We have not separately sought certiorari on


that decision.


But I -- I do want to add on that point, Justice


O'Connor, that in our view it would be a mistake to take


respondent's suggestion that because my client took that


position in the lower court, that this Court should


therefore turn a blind eye to the City of Newport


doctrine.  It seems to us that it's quite analogous to a


situation in which a litigant, for example, decided to


argue only legislative history in the lower court and then


before this Court -- and then someone said, well, you're

therefore constrained not to look at the words of the


statute.  That seems --


QUESTION:  It doesn't change the issue, I take


it.


MR. ROBBINS:  It does not change the issue.  The


position the client took below was always that punitive


damages are unwarranted for a variety of reasons,


including a reason that we are now urging by virtue of the


client having lost the Eleventh Amendment immunity issue


below. 


QUESTION:  Was there a reason?


QUESTION:  And I suppose it's not like an


immunity from suit that can be waived.  It's -- we use the


term immunity, but it's not that sort of immunity. 


MR. ROBBINS:  Exactly.  It -- it is exactly the


sense in which it was used in City of Newport as a


background principle of law that Congress is assumed to


have taken into consideration in enacting the actual test. 


And we --


QUESTION:  Doesn't the Eighth Circuit allow you


to argue in the alternative?  I mean, you couldn't have


said we have Eleventh Amendment immunity and -- and if we


don't, we're a municipality, and therefore Newport


applies.  You could have done that, I suppose. 


MR. ROBBINS:  I -- I think counsel could have

taken that measure.  They didn't, but I don't think that


it -- that that amounts to a waiver. 


QUESTION:  What are we supposed to do then? 


Because it seems to me that you're arguing there are two


possibilities.  One possibility is no one gets punitive


damages no matter who he sues, and the second is that,


anyway, a person who sues a municipality can't get


punitive damages.  Your second argument may be a lot


stronger than the first.  So, am I supposed to go to the


second argument that nobody has argued in the courts below


at all, bypassing them, or am I supposed to go to the


first argument which has enormous implications well beyond


this case? 


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, I think the answer, Justice


Breyer, is that we have urged both arguments.  I think we


-- we could prevail on the basis of either presumption.


I -- I would, however, tell you why I think the


Court ought to address the broader issue and that is


because, given the construction of Franklin that the


Eighth Circuit took in this case, there is no good reason


to believe that were City of Newport called to their


attention, they would have come out any differently.  The


Eighth Circuit took Franklin to say that unless -- given


that there's a cause of action, whether explicit --


whether express or implied, that must necessarily carry

with it all common law remedies unless Congress has said


otherwise, which it rarely does --


QUESTION:  Well, the Eighth Circuit said


appropriate remedies.  So, don't we have to look at what


appropriate means in this context?


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, I think that -- that's the


language from Franklin.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. ROBBINS:  And we think Franklin is properly


confined to compensatory remedies for the reasons we've


said in the brief.  The Eighth Circuit's view of


appropriate, however, Your Honor, was that it is


synonymous with whatever the common law has traditionally


made available by virtue of State law, by virtue of


Federal law, by virtue of the entire corpus of law.  And


whatever you can find on the books is, therefore,


appropriate within the meaning of Franklin, as the Eighth


Circuit saw it, and that, Justice Breyer, to return to


your question, is a doctrine of enormous capacity. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Robbins, I don't understand why


you say if this Court says Newport or Fact Concepts,


whatever you want to call it -- it says, a municipality is


immune.  Period.  That takes care of your case, and if the


Court -- this Court were to say, Eighth Circuit, you


overlooked the fact that municipalities are immune and

therefore in -- in this case you are wrong, and we


reverse, now, that takes care of your client.  Right?


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, I -- I think it does.  If --


QUESTION:  And why should we in your case, where


there is a clear ground, not decide it on that basis?  Why


should we go to the next case that doesn't involve a


municipality?


MR. ROBBINS:  Let me say two things with respect


to that, Justice Ginsburg.  First of all, the last thing I


want to do is talk the Court out of ruling for my client


on any ground. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. ROBBINS:  So, if the Court believes City of


Newport is sufficient -- and we think it's quite powerful


-- we'll certainly be glad of that result.  But let me say


two more things about it. 


The first is even City of Newport requires


looking to the next step and asking, okay, that's the


presumption.  It's a strong presumption.  Is there


specific evidence in the statute that overcomes it?  For


all the reasons we've said in the brief and I'd be glad to


turn to, the evidence in this statute is quite


extraordinarily compelling that, to the contrary, punitive


damages were foreclosed. 


Second, I -- I wish I could be as confident as

the Court's -- as Your Honor's question suggests, that


were this case to return to the Eighth Circuit with


nothing but a ruling about City of Newport, you know, in


its sails, that the Eighth Circuit would take that mandate


and take it and -- and come out differently.  I'm not


quite so confident about that because of the sweep of how


they read Franklin.


QUESTION:  If the Court --


QUESTION:  We would -- the -- the broader


position would be -- would be taking the case on the same


basis that the Eighth Circuit decided it.  Right?  On the


broader ground.


MR. ROBBINS:  I think that's correct. 


QUESTION:  And there -- this is not a


constitutional matter. 


MR. ROBBINS:  No. 


QUESTION:  So, the doctrine of -- of observing


the narrowest possible constitutional ground does not


apply here.  Right? 


MR. ROBBINS:  No.  Quite -- quite the contrary. 


The question presented is what do these statutes mean


after all. 


QUESTION:  So, this would be an opportunity to


-- to do what the Court is supposed to do, and that is


clean up confusion below on the meaning of a statute, and

the broader confusion is certainly much -- much more worth


clearing up than the narrower confusion.


MR. ROBBINS:  Right, and I might say one of the


matters we've pointed to in the petition for certiorari


is, in fact, that this misconstruction of Franklin is not


confined to this case, to this statute, and certainly to


the Eighth Circuit.  It is a wide-ranging, I think, over-


reading of what this Court said -- not just meant, but


said -- in Franklin itself.  And perhaps I might just turn


briefly to that initial question.


It seems to us, for several reasons, the Eighth


Circuit has badly misunderstood what Franklin says.  It


doesn't cover punitive damages.  That's the short of the


matter.  Punitive damages were, after all, not sought by


the plaintiff in Franklin, but more to the point, the


premise of Franklin against Gwinnett County was drawn from


Bell against Hood and the cases that underlie Bell against


Hood, and that is an explicitory, compensatory rationale. 


The idea in Bell was that courts have an authority --


QUESTION:  Explicitory? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. ROBBINS:  I'm sorry? 


QUESTION:  Did you say explicitory? 


MR. ROBBINS:  Good heavens, I hope not. 


(Laughter.)

 QUESTION:  I like it though.  It's good. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, what -- what I certainly


meant to say is that Bell and Hood stem from a line of


authority that says that courts have the authority, the


inherent authority I -- I had meant to say, when -- when


charged with the construction of a statute to make good


the wrong done.  And that is about as clear a statement of


a compensatory rationale as you could have. 


Franklin did not suggest that a plaintiff who


has been made whole, as Mr. Gorman was to the tune of $1


million in compensatory damages, including $150,000 in


pain and suffering, has a right inferable through a


statute that speaks not a word to the matter, to an


additional presumption of punishment. 


QUESTION:  Well, did the compensatory damages in


this case include damages for humiliation, or am I wrong


about that? 


MR. ROBBINS:  I -- I do not -- I have not seen


an indication that it included that.  I --


QUESTION:  In -- in this -- is the jury


instructed in this jurisdiction that compensatory damages


include damages?  Of course, pain and suffering, but is


that also humiliation?  I thought humiliation was covered


as part of the compensatory award.

 MR. ROBBINS:  I -- we have included the


instruction, Justice Kennedy, at page 72 of the joint


appendix, and I do not find a specific reference to that. 


I'd be glad to see if I can --


QUESTION:  Well, I guess it -- it goes to the


make-whole point.  Assume a jurisdiction where humiliation


is not part of the compensatory award, could the argument


be made, well, in order to make the person whole, you must


give punitive damages because it includes damages for


humiliation?


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, I guess I'd be inclined to


-- to think about that in a case in which somebody had


argued that below or here.


QUESTION:  But it wouldn't achieve that.


MR. ROBBINS:  But -- but --


QUESTION:  It wouldn't achieve that.  Would it,


Mr. Robbins?  I mean, you -- you would not tell the jury,


you know -- you're telling the jury, punish this person if


you think he deserves punishment.  You're not telling the


jury, by the way, humiliation damages are not available,


and therefore give this fellow as -- as much humiliation


damages, calling them punitive damages, as --


QUESTION:  But I want you to assume -- and I


believe this is the law in many jurisdictions -- that


punitive damages are given in part to ease the -- the --

it's smart money in order to ease the -- the pain that the


person suffers, et cetera. 


MR. ROBBINS:  Right.  I -- I don't want to


quarrel with the hypothetical, Justice Kennedy.  It may


very well be that pain and suffering already embraces that


concept.  In many jurisdictions, pain and suffering is not


compensable as a compensatory damages.  And it may be that


in the jurisdictions to which Your Honor adverts, punitive


damages are used to supplement a compensatory regime that


falls short of pain and suffering, which is not the case


here.  This man received $150,000 --


QUESTION:  I understand. 


MR. ROBBINS:  -- for the category called pain


and suffering and he was made whole.  And there's no


suggestion that he wasn't made whole.


The suggestion is that my clients should be


punished, and that is something as to which the statute


provides absolutely no --


QUESTION:  Well, that's true, but the statute


doesn't say specifically about whether to give an


injunction, about whether you could give a trademark


remedy.  I mean, normally what the decisions have been of


the Court under Franklin -- I'm simply focusing you on


their main argument.  Under Franklin, the courts decide


there either is an ordinary private right of action, et

cetera, or there isn't.  And if there is, you take it as


it is, ordinarily.  And if there isn't, there's nothing.


MR. ROBBINS:  Well --


QUESTION:  Why should we divide up, in other


words -- there's this amount of the common law action, but


not that amount.  There's -- why -- how do we know that we


have the two-witness rule or the -- or the parol evidence


rule?  I mean, there are lots of controversial things in


common -- in common law actions --


MR. ROBBINS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- that private people can bring. 


So, why separate out from that whole package suddenly


punitive damages?  That's --


MR. ROBBINS:  Precisely because this is not a


common law action.  This is a Federal statute --


QUESTION:  All right. 


MR. ROBBINS:  -- as to which --


QUESTION:  So, which one shall we separate out? 


Just punitives or what?


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, as to which Congress has


spoken.  It has adopted title VI remedies that are quite


robust, which come with title VI regulations that are


enormously detailed, freighted with due -- levels of due


process that are quite unusual.  And yet, we propose to


overlay a punitive damages remedy that comes with none of

those protections.  It would work an extraordinary anomaly


to layer punitive damages on a regime like this.  This is


not, after all, a question that is committed to the courts


like some of those doctrines.  The parole evidence rule


may in some jurisdictions have originally been enacted or


not. 


But the fact is this is a statute, and Congress


spoke rather clearly to what it -- it wanted the statute


to accomplish.  And some of the things it expressly said


cannot live with the things that respondent proposes to


import into it. 


And let me just say one other thing, and I


noticed that my white light on, as -- I do want to reserve


some time for rebuttal. 


This is also a Spending Clause statute, and I


know this gets back to a -- a threshold issue that both


Your Honor and Justice Ginsburg suggested perhaps the


Court could pretermit.  I think it would be a mistake,


given that the task is to construe the statute, to ignore


the fact that it was enacted pursuant to a contractual


regime in which punitive damages historically and for a


variety of sensible reasons are especially inappropriate. 


And if there are no questions, I -- I would like


to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Robbins.

 Mr. Garre, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. GARRE:  The statutes at issue in this case,


section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and title II of the


ADA, do not sanction the award of punitive damages which


are, by their definition, damages in excess of that


necessary to make good any wrong done. 


Now, there are several -- both section 504 and


title II derive their remedies expressly from title VI of


the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which operates as a


condition on the receipt of Federal financial assistance. 


And it seems to me that -- to us that there are several


facets of the title VI statutory scheme which make it


particularly inappropriate to infer a punitive damages


remedy.


The first is, is that title VI, although it's


silent with respect to a compensatory remedy, expressly


provides for punitive and regulatory measures in the event


that the violation of its nondiscrimination provision.  In


particular, the statute provides for a termination of


Federal funding, which this Court has itself recognized is


a very severe -- severe remedy that can have a powerful


deterrent effect.

 In addition, the statute authorizes


administrative enforcement actions, actions that -- in


which the regulatory agencies, who have responsibility for


enforcing section 504 and title II, can take remedial


action, order remedial action, short of funding


termination. 


Now, the second aspect of title VI and title VI


statutory scheme it seems to us to be quite pertinent is


that punitive damages are themselves antithetical to


Spending Clause legislation like title VI because the


availability of unbounded punitive damages awards can


actually have the effect of diverting resources from


achieving the important objectives of the underlying


spending programs. 


QUESTION:  Tell me.  I just can't recall.  Have


we held that punitive damages are available on the Bivens


action?


MR. GARRE:  We think the Court addressed that in


passing in the Carlson v. Green case, and we think that


that -- the discussion of punitive damages in that case is


properly regarded as -- as dictum in that case.  But --


but --


QUESTION:  So, do -- do I infer from your --


from your response that it is the position of the


Department that punitive damages should not be awarded in

Bivens cases? 


MR. GARRE:  Yes, but there are two distinctions


between Bivens and this case. 


First, in the Bivens context, there aren't


statutory penal and regulatory measures that can be used


like funding termination or administrative enforcement


actions to take deterrence measures when -- when needed to


deter violations. 


And second, in the Bivens context, this Court is


giving effect to a constitutional tort that it alone has


recognized.  In -- in this context, the Court is


purporting to ascertain Congress's intent in enacting


section 504 in title II.


QUESTION:  What about 1983?  This Court has said


that punitive damages are available. 


MR. GARRE:  That -- that's correct, Justice


Ginsburg.  And -- and first of all, if I can make two


points -- first, in that context, again, there is no


express statutory penal or regulatory measures that


Congress created to provide deterrence as it did under


title VI, the remedies at issue in this case. 


And secondly, what's important, we think, about


the Smith case, in which this Court recognized a punitive


damages remedy under section 1983 -- is that in that case,


the Court didn't start with the presumption that punitive

damages were available and simply look to see if Congress


had said otherwise.  And that's the presumption that the


court of appeals applied in this case. 


Instead, the Court purported to engage in an


inquiry of Congress's intent and -- and focused on the


fact that when -- when Congress enacted section 1983, it


made very clear that it was adopting a special species of


tort liability looking to the -- the State common law at


the time which provided for punitive damages there.  So,


we think that the section 1983 case is quite different


than this case.  The Court --


QUESTION:  But you -- and you rely on the heavy


gun in statutes like title VI, title IX.  That heavy gun


is so heavy that it's never used.  I mean, in the case


that we will hear tomorrow, the statement was made, well,


yes, it would be a drastic sanction to withdraw Federal


funds, but in 30 years it hasn't happened.


MR. GARRE:  Well, first of all, it does happen. 


It happened in the Grove City case that came here, and I


could point Your Honor to additional examples in which the


termination funding mechanism has been used.  Now, to be


sure, it -- it's an unusual remedy and it's a harsh


remedy, and simply because it's not used in more cases


doesn't mean that it doesn't have a deterrent effect. 


QUESTION:  Under the Rehabilitation Act, it has

been used under 504? 


MR. GARRE:  Yes.  I could point you to -- to one


case.  It's -- it's not a case cited in the brief.  It's a


court of appeals case, Freeman v. Cavassos, 939 F.2d.


1527, which is one example. 


But -- but again, the -- the Federal Government


-- Congress gave the Federal Government and the Federal


agencies authority to enforce these provisions short of


funding termination.  The -- the agencies receive


thousands of complaints each year under title II and


section 504.  And they investigate those complaints


commeasurate with the seriousness of the allegations


raised in those complaints, and they are successful in


negotiating compliance agreements, ranging from informal


agreements to formal settlement agreements, in which those


alleged to -- to have engaged in discrimination agree to


take corrective measures to eliminate discrimination and,


in some cases, to pay monetary sums. 


Now, the -- the Federal agencies have entered


into more 300 of those agreements under title II alone in


the past 8 years.  So, there is an administrative process


in place.  It's statutory -- statutorily created by


Congress, and we think that that process itself counsels


heavily against judicial inference of punitive damages.


Or in addition, to return to the -- the Court's

Franklin case, the Franklin case is grounded on the notion


that the Federal courts have the authority to provide a


remedy when necessary to make good the wrong done.  That


principle has no application to and has never been


extended to punitive damages.  It would be a quantum leap


for this Court to extend the Franklin principle to


punitive damages.


Punitive damages, the Court has recognized, are


both quasi-criminal, unpredictable, and at times have a


devastating effect.  Those characteristics of punitive


damages make them uniquely suited for careful legislative


judgment.  Congress in section 504 and title II has not


made any legislative judgment that punitive damages should


be available, and therefore, this Court should reverse the


decision below. 


If there are no further questions. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Garre.


Mr. Nelson, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. NELSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This case presents the issue of whether Congress


foreclosed awards of punitive damages when it enacted the


rights of action to enforce section 504 of the

Rehabilitation Act and title II of the ADA which together


prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities


in the provision of public services.


The text, structure, policies, and legislative


history of the ADA disclose no prohibition on the award of


punitive damages.  Absent such a prohibition --


QUESTION:  Well, if -- now that the Eleventh


Amendment immunity issue is gone, don't we have to deal


with City of Newport?


MR. NELSON:  Well, I think the answer to that,


Justice O'Connor, is no.  Had the defendants wished to


preserve the ability to argue for immunity on City of


Newport, they were free to do so in the lower courts.


QUESTION:  Well, do you say that we are


precluded from considering that authority as we resolve


this case? 


MR. NELSON:  No, I don't say --


QUESTION:  No. 


MR. NELSON:  -- you're precluded from it.  It's


-- it's a --


QUESTION:  No.  So, are you going to deal with


it then? 


that. 


MR. NELSON:  Yes.  I -- I do intend to deal with


I'd like to start by dealing with -- with the

issue of whether there's a punitive damages remedy at all


because I think then the Newport issue really is secondary


to that. 


And the starting point with respect to the


availability of punitive damages I think has to be this


Court's decision in Franklin.  And it's useful I think to,


instead of looking at -- at arguments about what underlies


Franklin, to look at what Franklin said.  Quote:  "the


general rule, therefore, is that absent clear direction to


the contrary by Congress, the Federal courts have the


power to award any appropriate relief in a cognizable


cause of action brought pursuant to a Federal statute."


QUESTION:  Franklin wasn't dealing with punitive


damages, was it? 


MR. NELSON:  That's right, Mr. Chief Justice. 


Punitive damage was -- was not the form of relief that was


being addressed in Franklin.


QUESTION:  And appropriate relief does not sound


to me to be consistent with your beginning premise which


was that unless Congress forecloses the remedy, we must


give it. 


MR. NELSON:  Well, I certainly don't mean to say


that -- that in any particular case, the Court must give


it unless Congress forecloses it, but if Congress has not


foreclosed it, it's potentially available if, in view of

the policies of -- of the particular statute, it's an


appropriate remedy and in view of the conduct that's being


addressed.  Specifically, under this Court's decisions,


punitive damages are an appropriate remedy where there's


willful -- a willful violation or reckless disregard of --


of the legal entitlements of the plaintiff. 


QUESTION:  Well, what do you make of the -- the


argument that the whole touchstone for damages here is


504, which is essentially the -- the spending power -- the


-- the -- a statute resting on the spending power?  The


closest analogy to that is with contract, and you don't


get punitive damages from contract. 


MR. NELSON:  Well, there -- there are two


answers to that.  The first is that the touchstone is not


simply 504, but also the ADA, which is not a Spending


Clause enactment at all.  The second is that --


QUESTION:  But that referred to 504 for -- for


-- in effect, for its remedial scheme. 


MR. NELSON:  To the extent that -- that what it


-- what it says is that the remedies available, the


remedies being a private right of action -- and that does


not necessarily, however, import a limitation imposed on


that remedy from above by the Spending Clause that doesn't


inhere in the -- in the nature of the statute itself,


assuming that the Spending Clause does impose that

limitation, which I don't concede, and I'll get to in a


moment. 


But this Court actually addressed a similar


situation in the Darrone case.  The issue there was the


remedies available under section 504 for a case of


employment discrimination, and 504 in turn incorporates


the remedies available under title VI.  Title VI said


there is no remedy available for employment discrimination


under title VI except with regard to a Federal program


where the funding is for employment purposes.  This Court


said that by incorporating the title VI remedies, section


504 did not incorporate that limitation on the remedial


scheme that had nothing to do with the policies underlying


section 504 which were to eliminate discrimination against


the handicapped more broadly.


Similarly, under the Americans with Disabilities


Act, the -- the purpose of that act is to extend even


further than 504 the prohibition on and the remedies for


discrimination against persons with disabilities.  And to


import into that statutory scheme a limit on relief that


-- that would pull it back and -- and restrict it to


what's appropriate on a Spending Clause measure would be


inappropriate under, I think, the mode of analysis this


Court used in Darrone. 


But in any event, even if one looks only at


25

section 504, the Spending Clause analogy to contract


doesn't limit remedies available to contractual remedies. 


This Court I think made clear, both in Franklin and then


more recently in Davis v. Monroe County, that although the


obligation that an entity may undertake under the Spending


Clause is contractual in the sense that it's voluntary and


it has to be clearly stated what the substantive


requirements you're subjecting yourself to when you accept


Federal funding are, that that does not carry with it the


notion that you're limited to a, quote, "contract" remedy.


In Davis, what the plaintiff sought in her


complaint was punitive and compensatory damages for


injuries that had been inflicted on her.  She, of course,


was not a party to any contract.  What she was seeking was


quintessentially a tort recovery, and this Court held in


Davis that as long as the requirement that the conduct was


intentional, it was a violation that was -- that -- that a


person in authority had knowledge of and had -- had


allowed the situation to go forward, that if those


conditions, which were Spending Clause conditions under


the Gebser decision -- if those conditions were met, you


could go forward and obtain the type of tort remedial


relief that the plaintiff was --


QUESTION:  Well, you say -- you say she wasn't a


party to the contract.  She -- she was a beneficiary of

the contract, surely.  I mean --


MR. NELSON:  Well, you could, I suppose,


analogize her to a third party beneficiary, but to suggest


that --


QUESTION:  And contract actions were original


tort actions.  It's easy to characterize a contract action


as a tort action.  Right?  It's just assumpsit.


MR. NELSON:  Well, and in fact --


QUESTION:  I -- I'm not sure a whole lot hangs


on --


MR. NELSON:  -- that -- that argument can go the


other way, too, because the States are broadly recognizing


that -- that malicious and bad faith breaches of contract


carry with them tort remedies.


But I'll give another example.  This Court in a


couple of decisions, Wright v. Roanoke Housing Authority,


and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association, held that


under Spending Clause enactments, obligations can be


imposed on the recipients of funds that are enforceable


that create enforceable rights under section 1983.


And this Court has repeatedly held, most


recently I think in City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes,


that 1983 is ever and always a tort remedy.


QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Nelson, why don't we look


specifically at this context, which is the ADA, and the

anomaly that when Congress thought about punitive damages,


as we know it did in the employment part, it provided for


them with qualifications and with caps on amount.  So, it


would be passing strange, would it not, that when Congress


is explicit about punitive damages, it contains them, and


it when it says not one word one way or another, they are


unlimited because that's -- as I take your argument to be,


under part 3, there are the caps and the qualifications,


but under part 2, it's public service, no limitation.


MR. NELSON:  It's under title I that the caps


apply, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that what that


illustrates is not -- not the point that -- that Congress


didn't intend to provide these remedies.  You have to look


at -- at the timing of the enactments and the background


of those changes to the -- in the Civil Rights Act of


1991.


As the ADA was originally enacted, title I,


consonant with title VII, didn't provide a damages remedy


of any kind.  It didn't provide an entitlement to any


legal forms of relief.  It was limited to equitable relief


following the -- the title VII model. 


No such limitation has ever been placed on title


II.  In title II, Congress simply incorporated by


reference an action for legal remedies that this Court had


already recognized to exist.

 Now, then in 1991, Congress expanded the relief


under title I of the ADA, as well as under title VII of


the Civil Rights Act for the first time ever to allow a


damages remedy, either compensatory or punitive, for


employment discrimination to which those statutes applied.


And what that illustrates is simply the history


that Congress has been very wary about providing broad


damages remedies in the employment discrimination area and


in 1981, it relaxed that unwillingness to some degree, but


then placed a cap on it.  But in title II, it's quite


clear, from the original 1990 legislation, that Congress


didn't impose that circumscribed set of employment


discrimination remedies on title II.  So, by expanding


title I, that doesn't either limit title II or imply that


title II was ever intended to be limited. 


QUESTION:  Am I right that title III says no


punitive damages?


MR. NELSON:  Title III says no punitive damages


at all as part of a -- of a remedial scheme that is


similarly circumscribed to -- to title I, although in


somewhat different ways, a remedial scheme that under


title III doesn't make a private right of action for


damages of any kind available to an individual plaintiff. 


Under title III, it's only the Attorney General who can


ever sue for any damages, and then when Congress -- it --

having made a -- a damages remedy available to the


Attorney General, it then went on to say, and under this


statute, damages doesn't include punitive damages.


I think to the extent that sheds any light on


title II at all, we know that in title II, Congress knew


that it was creating a damages remedy.  That it didn't


limit those damages, as it did in title III, when it


created that limited damages remedy through the Attorney


General, is, if anything, an indication that no limitation


was intended.


QUESTION:  Why?  Why?  Because -- why -- why


would somebody want to -- title II has to do with actions


against a government basically, doesn't it? 


MR. NELSON:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  So -- so, I thought punitives are


primarily designed to compensate an individual who's not


going to be compensated.  It's just a way of wielding a


very big club against the people who behaved badly.


MR. NELSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  Now, why would you want that big club


to be wielded against private people in limited amounts,


but when you get to a government which, after all,


represents the entire public, you say the sky is the


limit?  Newport would suggest where the government is


involved it's less reasonable to assess punitives than

where a private individual is. 


MR. NELSON:  Well, I think the -- part of the


answer to that is the whole structure of the ADA remedial


scheme indicates an intention to make broader remedies


available against public entities than private entities to


begin with.  That's why, when the ADA was originally


enacted, there were all these limits placed on title III,


no compensatory damages even, limits on title I against


private and public employers, not even any compensatory


damages.  Clearly, in title II, everyone agrees that


Congress made available a remedy there that is much more


extensive than it made against private employers or


private offerors of public accommodations.


Now, why Congress did that I think is -- is


perhaps somewhat obscure, but it seems to relate back to


the entire history, starting with the 1964 Civil Rights


Act, where Congress was very hesitant about imposing broad


remedies against private actors, possibly in part due to


the -- the effectiveness of their lobbyists, which --


which may have been greater in this instance than those of


-- of public employers and entities. 


But for whatever reason Congress did it, it's


clear that Congress did enact broader remedies under title


II than under those titles that are applicable to --


QUESTION:  But that's an anomaly too because in

title -- title III, which is the -- the title that imposes


-- title I is the one -- employment.  Right? 


MR. NELSON:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  And are government employers liable


for punitive damages under title I?


MR. NELSON:  No, they are not. 


QUESTION:  So, your -- your notion that -- that


the government is not well representative in the


legislature -- here is a title that says, private sector,


you're going to be stuck.  You're going to be subject to


punitive damages, but not government entities.


MR. NELSON:  Well, that -- that was -- that was


what happened in the 1991 round.  Presumably the -- the


Congress there obviously did made -- make a considered


choice not to impose those remedies on -- on public


actors.


But I think, you know, to step back even


further, one has to look at the fact that both section


504, by virtue of the 1986 Rehabilitation Act amendments,


and the ADA, by virtue of -- of section 502, are subject


as a general rule to the principle that -- that Congress


very deliberately said public entities, and in particular


States, are going to be subject to the full range of


remedies that are available against private defendants. 


Congress did that explicitly in both those -- both those

statutes.


And I think what that indicates is that there


has been a considered judgment in these statutes that,


especially in the area of the provision of public


services, Congress wants broad remedies to be made


available against the public entities that are subject to


it.  It's true that Congress made a different judgment in


1991 when it extended the -- the remedies for employment


discrimination.  But except for that provision of the


statute where public employers were given a special


exemption, the rest of the statute evinces an -- an


intention by Congress that public entities not get special


exemptions. 


QUESTION:  But doesn't that seem rather


perverse?


MR. NELSON:  Well, I think it -- it seems -- it


seems to me that -- that one can look at it either way. 


It's perverse if you're a public entity; it's not perverse


if you're a business entity that feels like anti-


discrimination laws trench on the -- the freedom of


businesses to operate in the way they want to operate.


I think what Congress has done with respect to


discrimination against persons with disabilities, first in


making the 504 remedies available against recipients of


Federal funds, and then in making the title II remedies

available against public entities, is -- is Congress has


made a judgment that says, we think discrimination against


persons with disabilities is particularly objectionable


when engaged in by the government, just as in the


fourth --


QUESTION:  But -- but your -- your Newport case


certainly suggests that traditionally public entities are


treated differently than private entities for the same


conduct if you're talking about punitive damages.


MR. NELSON:  That's certainly true.  And -- and


what I think is distinctive about Newport, to begin with,


here I do believe that -- that if the Court were to


considered that under these statutes there is a punitive


damages remedy available generally, and then the question


is should these particular defendants be freed from it


under a City of Newport rationale, that -- that it's fair


for this Court to hold the -- the defendant to the rule


that it generally applies, which is that if you want to


argue something like that, raise an issue like that, you


should do it in the lower courts. 


But even looking beyond that, what we have in --


in these statutes is in the --


QUESTION:  About the issue, are you -- are you


suggesting that it is not included in the question


presented?

 MR. NELSON:  No, I'm not making that argument. 


QUESTION:  Then -- then did you in your brief in


opposition point out that this was not properly raised in


the lower courts? 


MR. NELSON:  Yes, that was pointed out in the


brief in opposition. 


QUESTION:  I want to be sure you -- suppose that


we did look at the Newport issue.  I'm not saying that we


should, but suppose we did.  And suppose that you lost on


your point that it should be waived or deemed waived. 


What would your -- is there any response to their claim on


the merits that -- that Newport makes clear that they are


not liable in punitive damages?


MR. NELSON:  Yes.  I think -- I think that --


that the first response is that through the Rehabilitation


Act amendments of 1986, which are codified at 42 U.S.C.,


section 2000(d)(7), and also in section 502 of the ADA,


which is codified at 42 U.S.C., section 12202, those


provisions are fundamentally incompatible with the notion


of Newport immunity.


And I want to just start by expressing my


understanding of what Newport immunity is in light of this


Court's decision in -- in the Vermont Natural Resources


case.  It's not specifically an immunity that is municipal


immunity.  It's an immunity or a -- or a general

presumption against awards of punitive damages against


State and local governments as a class.  And -- and what


it says where it operates is that those defendants as a


class have an exemption against a particular form of


relief that is otherwise available against private actors.


In the Rehabilitation Act amendments and in


section 502 of the ADA, what Congress said expressly is


that as to remedies against States, which are one of the


entities entitled to the Newport presumption, they're


subject to the same remedies under the statutes as are any


other private or public entities, meaning if you can get


it against a private entity, you can get it against a


State.  And that takes away the fundamental premise of


Newport, which is that governmental entities as a class


are entitled to a special exemption.  What these statutes


say is that governmental entities as a class are entitled


to no special exemption.  And the City of Newport issue I


think simply goes away. 


I'd also suggest that one of the fundamental


premises of City of Newport is not present under these


statutes, and that is that there's an adequate alternative


deterrent.  And -- and in this case, what we're talking


about when we're talking about punitive damages as a


deterrent, to answer Justice Kennedy's question earlier of


Mr. Robbins, in this case the compensatory damages award

did include pain, suffering, humiliation, and mental


damages.  So, we're not talking about punitive damages


here as a surrogate for some component of compensatories. 


We're talking about it as a remedy designed to provide a


deterrent that will assist in -- in Congress's goal of


eliminating discrimination against persons with


disabilities.


And in -- in Newport, this Court looked at the


1983 remedy and said, yes, punitive damages are an


important element of deterrence with respect to civil


rights violations that are subject to section 1983.  But


we have a better deterrent which is the availability of


punitive damages against individual defendants who


actually make the decisions to carry out the -- the


wrongful acts that 1983 is responding to.  Now, whether


that judgment is -- as to which is more effective, is


correct or not, that's the line the Court drew in Newport.


But under these statutes, that remedy is not


available because section 504 and title II of the ADA make


quite clear that they provide remedies only against the


entities.  There's no right of action against a -- an


individual under title II of the ADA or under section 504


of the Rehabilitation Act.  So, with respect to these


statutes, deterrence against the entity is all you've got


and all you can rely on.

 And that's yet another reason why Newport's


policies are inapplicable here.  And Newport was very


clear that beyond looking at the immunity, as -- as it


used the term, of municipalities as a -- as a sort of


standard to try to determine what the legislature was


thinking about when it enacted the statute, the Court was


also going to look at the policies of the particular


statutes to determine whether or not immunity from


punitive damages accorded with those policies.  And given


the distinctions between the ADA and section 504, those


policies are not served here by immunizing the -- the


defendants against punitive damages on -- under a Newport


rationale. 


I'd also like to get back for a moment, if I


could, to the -- the notion that what's going on in


Franklin is limited to compensatory remedies and that --


that the idea of -- of punitive damages as one of the


normal modes of relief offered by the Federal courts is


not really what the Court was talking about in Franklin. 


I think that's inconsistent not only with Bivens where in


Carlson v. Green this Court, I think, held that punitive


damages are available in Bivens actions because, as one of


the ordinary remedial mechanisms available to the Federal


courts, they were particularly appropriate for the redress


of constitutional violations.

 The reason I say that that's a holding is the


issue in Carlson was not whether there was a -- a right of


action for any relief at all under the Eighth Amendment. 


It was conceded that -- that the plaintiff could get


injunctive relief against an Eighth Amendment violation if


there was a pervasive --


QUESTION:  Mr. Nelson, last year in -- in the


Alexander case and this year in the Malesko case, we've


indicated that we're taking a much more critical look, I


think, at these kind of claims than we ever did in


Carlson.


MR. NELSON:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't


think that that's -- that that's quite right with respect


to -- with respect to the evolution of this Court's


doctrine.  I think what the Court said, in -- in


particular in Sandoval, was that -- that the Court had


backed away from the notion that for every right, there


has to be a remedy and had gone to the -- the Court v. Ash


notion, that what we're looking for when we're trying to


determine whether a right of action exists is


congressional intent.


But that was true at the time of -- of Franklin


as well and the Court in Franklin said that's a separate


question from what relief you get when it's conceded that


there is a right of action to begin with.

 And similarly, in Malesko, this Court said,


we're not going to recognize a right of action against


this particular entity.  The question, when it's clear


that Congress has made a right of action available, as it


is here, and what form of relief is appropriate, is a


different matter. 


QUESTION:  Well, but what -- what you're arguing


basically is that every one of these things is fixed in


time permanently not just as to its holding, but as -- as


to language in it.  And what I'm trying to suggest is that


that is not always necessarily so, that the Court may take


a slightly different view some -- now than it did 10 years


ago.


MR. NELSON:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think


that's clearly -- that's clearly true.  And the question


that -- that we as -- as lawyers are trying to -- to deal


with is -- is how, in light of changes in precedent and --


and changes in evolution of the Court's doctrine over


time, what aspects can we pull out and -- and hold


constant or -- or use to make arguments as to what the


rule remains. 


And to me, looking at Franklin, which was a case


that -- first of all, all nine Justices concurred in the


holding at the time.  Second, it came at a point where


this Court had already evolved far away from the every

right must have a remedy doctrine and was looking very


specifically at whether or not Congress had intended to


allow a right of action.  But what the opinion for the


Court said and even the concurrence said was when it's


crystal clear that Congress said there's a right of action


here, does -- do we infer limits on our ability to provide


appropriate relief when Congress hasn't given us guidance


on that subject? 


QUESTION:  And didn't say anything about whether


punitives would be appropriate relief because all Franklin


involved was compensatory damages.  Before that, it was


thought that there were no compensatory damages under


spending statutes.  To clarify that, they used the phrase


appropriate relief.  So, we've never had any holding that


under Franklin punitive damages would be appropriate. 


MR. NELSON:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 


On the other hand, the Court has certainly held that


punitive damages are appropriate in implied statutory


rights of action, the most notable being section 1981


which, unlike section 1983, is an implied right of action. 


Section 1981 doesn't say anything about creating a right


for anybody to go in and get enforcement, and the Court


has held not only is there a right of action there, but


held as recently as the Pollard case, which I believe was


last year, that under 1981 the scope of relief includes

punitive damages. 


I think that what that reflects is the Franklin


principle, that when there's a cause of action, when it's


a cause of action such as these, that is, essentially a


tort remedy, that the traditional range of relief that's


appropriate for such rights is provided.  And that range


of relief includes punitive damages.


And -- and again, the issue in this case is not


whether on the facts punitive damages are appropriate,


because that hasn't yet been decided, but whether ever


punitive damages are appropriate under this statute.  And


I think Franklin speaks to the question not in its express


holding but its rationale which -- which I believe has


survived down to the present. 


Unless there are any further questions, I will


leave it at that. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Nelson. 


Mr. Robbins, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ROBBINS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


Let me turn -- go back for just a moment to the


1991 act because I think its -- its significance here is


terribly important and quite a bit different from


respondent's characterization.

 The 1991 act amended title I of the ADA and also


the Rehabilitation Act to provide a capped punitive


damages remedy available only to -- only to


nongovernmental entities.  This case obviously involves an


uncapped award, indeed an award four times the size of the


cap, applied only to governmental entities and not in an


employment setting.  That's more than simply anomalous. 


It is, I think, completely implausible for reasons that I


think go beyond what -- what Mr. Nelson has described to


you.


The fact is title I was enacted in its original


form at the very same time that Congress was considering


the 1991 legislation.  Everyone in Congress knew that when


they enacted in title I that there shall be the same


remedies as title VII -- everyone knew that at that very


moment laying before another committee in Congress was the


very legislation that is being characterized as the 1991


legislation, as if it happened much later.  These happened


simultaneously and everyone knew that punitive damages


were around the corner.  In my view, when you look at what


Mr. Nelson called the timing of the enactments, you really


have to read title I as if it enacted a punitive damages


and capped and targeted and calibrated.


Title III also has a penalty provision. 


Although it forbids punitive damages, to go back to

Justice Ginsburg's question, it has a civil penalties


provision.  So, the thing that is remarkable about


respondent's position and the position you would be urged


to adopt is that although title I of the ADA has a limited


punitive damages provision applicable only to employment


cases and exempting the government, and although title III


has a civil penalties provision applicable only to public


accommodations, title II, which is silent, shall have an


unlimited punitive damages provision which can be applied


against governmental entities.  And it is against


governmental entities and only governmental entities that


title II applies. 


And City of Newport, I should add, doesn't


change just how anomalous that is.  The Rehabilitation Act


amendments go not one step in the direction of overturning


City of Newport.  The Rehabilitation Act amendments say


only this, that the States shall be liable for whatever


remedies are applicable to other public entities or


private entities.  It doesn't tell us what those shall be,


and in our view punitive damages aren't available against


anybody under title II.  So, it -- it hardly advances


respondent's position to say that there shall be


applicable to the States whatever is applicable to anyone


else. 


The other thing is, what are those other public

entities if not, among other things, municipal governments


like my client?  By carving out, in other words, municipal


governments, the 1986 amendment is a very strange way to


overrule the doctrine in -- in City of Newport, and I


would respectfully suggest that it does no such thing.


Let me -- let me end with this point.  And we


haven't -- we haven't mentioned the history of judicial


interpretation of title VI and section 504, which had


never -- never, not once -- ever been construed to permit


punitive damages at any of the times in history that these


statutes were meticulously amended and -- and previous


remedy provisions incorporated going forward. 


But I do want to end with where Mr. Nelson


began.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Robbins. 


MR. ROBBINS:  Perhaps not.
