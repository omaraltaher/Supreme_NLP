CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next on 01-417, Robert J. Devlin versus Robert A.


Scardelletti.  Spectators are admonished, do not talk


until they leave the courtroom.  The Court remains in


session.  Mr. Goldstein.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it


please the Court:  This is a case about the right to take


an appeal.  Over Petitioner's objections, the district


court confirmed a class action settlement that


substantially reduces Petitioner's individual pension. 


The Fourth Circuit held that Petitioner nonetheless may


not appeal to argue that the district court abused its


discretion in rejecting his objections.  Our principal


submission is that, as Justice Kennedy explained in oral


argument in the Felzen case, Rule 23 class members such as


Petitioner are bound by the district court's judgment and


thus are parties to that judgment with the right to appeal


from it.  Because the Government, although seated at the


opposite side of the table, actually agrees with us that


class members are bound by the judgment, that objector


appeals identify important legal errors, and that they

also deter collusive settlements, I will leave to the


Solicitor General's representative any arguments to the


contrary that my friend Mr. Gold may make.


QUESTION:  Can I test your thesis that u are


bound by a judgment, you are a party to it? I mean, there


are cases where someone who has allied with a party and


has used the same attorney and has maybe had some input


into trial strategy, that that person will be bound by the


judgment, but as far as I know, we have never allowed, no


court that I know of has ever allowed such a person to


take an appeal on the ground that well, since you would


have been bound, you are a party.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Scalia, I think it


depends on what we mean by bound.  There are different,


more expansive notions of collateral estoppel and res


judicata.  What I'm talking about here is that the


judgment operates directly upon the class member.  And let


me be clear that our position is not to move beyond that. 


Our position is not that it's sufficient to be a party,


but that it is a necessary condition.  It is also


necessary, and this is an important point for the


distinction between appealing from an approved settlement


and for appealing a litigated judgment.


QUESTION:  You say that the judgment operates


directly upon the class member, as if we are talking about

some sort of physical thing, but how is that operation on


the class member different from, say, what might be res


judicata or collateral estoppel in some other case?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, the


difference is that while you can have an application of


collateral estoppel or res judicata that extinguishes a


right to pursue an action, what I'm talking about here and


let me put it in very practical terms.  The Petitioner had


a pension and that pension went down 40 percent when the


district court in this case approved a settlement that


said the COLA provisions of the pension plan are null and


void, and that's the kind of direct operation I'm talking


about.


Now, there is an unsettled area of the law


stretching to precedents dating from the 1850s, the


so-called quasi-party cases.  We don't think it's


necessary to apply those here because unlike a Rule 23.1


class member in the context of a derivative action, we are


directly bound by the action.  We are not talking about


extinguishing a right of ours, for example, to sue on


behalf of a corporation.


QUESTION:  You are bound because a judge


determined that you had an adequate representative.  I


agree with you that every person in that class is equally


affected and indeed there is no opt out of this class that

we are dealing with.  But the determination has been made


that you are represented by someone who is an adequate


representative of all members of the class who will fairly


and adequately represent the class.  So as long as the


representative will fairly and adequately represent the


class, why isn't it the end of it?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, that's a good entry into


the purpose and function of Rule 23(e).  What happens is


that at the point that it's acknowledged by the


Respondents here that at the point settlement is agreed


to, the class representative and be opposing named parties


joined forces to oppose objections, and that continued at


the stage of the case where you have to decide whether or


not to take an appeal.


QUESTION:  Well, Rule 23 what?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  23(e).


QUESTION:  And where do we find that?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That would be in the appendix of


the Council of Institutional Investors, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  It's not in your brief?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Whereabouts in the Constitution of


Institutional Investors?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  (A)(4) of the appendix to that


brief.

 QUESTION:  Thank you.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And I'll read it very briefly


for the Court's benefit.  A class action shall not be


dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court


and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall


be given to all members of the class in such manner as the


court directs.  Now, let me detour for just a moment.  The


Court will notice it noticed in the Felzen case that this


rule doesn't actually explicitly provide for objections. 


The advisory committee notes make clear that that was the


intent of this provision, and in fact amended Rule 23(e)


which will go into effect next year explicitly provides


for the right to state objections. 


To return to Justice Ginsburg's question, what


happens is that this rule recognizes that the class


representative is not speaking on behalf of the objectors


at the point an objection is taken.  They in fact litigate


actively for the settlement.  Mr. Gold here is on behalf


of the class representative in this case and goodness


knows, he will argue that we have no right to take an


appeal.


The rule, 23(e), provides an opportunity for us


to come in, advise the district court of a problem with


the settlement.  Our point is that nothing in these rules


contemplates that the objector's role would be

extinguished at the district court, that someone uniquely


in the context of a class action, who is bound directly by


the judgment and participates as of right in the district


court, would only participate at the district court.


QUESTION:  But do you agree that you must


intervene in the district court, or do you say you don't


even do that?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, we say we do


not have to do that, that there is nothing about this


Court's precedents --


QUESTION:  Why not? That is, if this is open


under the language, it seems to me there is no real


difference between the parties as a practical matter,


except you want to say the person all the time, no matter


what, can bring an appeal, and they want to say what you


should do is intervene and that gives the district judge a


chance to act in an unusual situation as a kind of


safeguard to make sure that it is fair. 


I mean, this person could be anybody under the


sun.  It could muck up the litigation for everybody else. 


The extra time involved might be important, and it might


be totally unfair, given the prior history, to allow this


individual to bring the appeal.  So all they are saying is


that the judge should have a chance as a gatekeeper to


make that determination.

 Now why not, if it's open under the language,


say there is a little more conservative position, gives us


a chance to not get things mixed up?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, let me, there are two


parts to the question.  The first is, is it open under the


rules and second, why wouldn't it be a good idea to adopt


it if it were? As to the first, it is not open under the


rules, and let me take you again to the particular rule in


question.  That would be, it's suggested, rule 23(d)(2),


and this rule says that the district court may in


appropriate circumstances --


QUESTION:  Where are you reading, where are you


reading from?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I'm going to read from (a)(3) in


the carryover to (a)(4) of the same appendix of the


Council --


QUESTION:  And where are you starting on (a)(3)?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  At the bottom of the page D,


orders and conduct of actions.  Your Honors, it says in


the conduct of actions to which this rule applies, the


court may make appropriate orders and then I'm going to


jump to 2.  This is the suggestion of the other side: 


requiring for the protection of the members of a class or


otherwise for fair conduct of the action that notice be


given.  So there is a suggestion, where it follows, notice

be given, and then there is a class that says -- I'll just


continue to read it: 


In such matters the court may direct to some or


all members, of any step in the action or of the proposed


extent of the judgment, or of -- and this becomes critical


-- the opportunity of members to signify whether they


consider the representation fair and adequate.  And then


the clause:  to intervene and present claims or defenses


or otherwise come into the action.


Our point is as follows, or is several fold. 


The first is that this is a different notice from the


23(e) notice.  This is a discretionary notice that courts


can employ in some cases, and I think it deserves to be


emphasized that in the 35 years since 1966, not a single


court has read this provision in the way that's suggested


by the other side, that it's mandatory that there be an


intervention for a screening function.  The particular


reason is that this (d)(2) notice refers to intervening to


present claims or defenses, and that the not what an


objector seeks to do.


An objector says there is a settlement on the


table, I have a legal objection to it, it's either


unlawful, as in Amchem, or it's unfair as in this case,


and so it's a different kind of intervention.  So I don't


think it's open and no court has ever suggested that it's

how the rule should be interpreted.  Now, assume the Court


disagrees with me, Justice Breyer, why isn't it a good


idea? It doesn't accomplish anything.


What happens is this.  You move to intervene,


the intervention motion is denied, so you appeal that, so


you haven't really gained anything.  What you have done is


turn the objection into the application of the abuse of


discretion standard.  You just added another layer on top


of it because then the court of appeals has to decide


well, did the judge get the intervention motion wrong? If


that was an abuse of discretion, then we'll reach the


merits.


QUESTION:  What if the court grants your motion


to intervene?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, then you


haven't accomplished anything either.  All you have done


is permitted an appeal that under our theory would be


permitted anyway.


QUESTION:  Could we, could we go back just one


step.  You don't have to intervene to be an objector. 


That's very clear, isn't it?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And I thought that your basic


argument was whatever your status is in the district


court, that's what your status is on appeal.  If you can

go into a district court, which is extraordinary, usually


the district court doesn't let anybody come in without


having intervened, but to object to a settlement, you


don't have to do anything except say judge, I'm an


objector.  You don't have to be an intervenor.  And I


thought that your basic argument was whatever status you


have in the district court, that you can come in and


object, then you have that same status on appeal.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  I had taken an implicit


premise to Justice Breyer's question that I'll come back


to.  This case will illustrate your point, Justice


Ginsburg.  In this case, we objected to the settlement. 


We moved to intervene.  That intervention was denied.  It


is perfectly clear that if that intervention is properly


denied, and as to our attempt to come in and take


discovery, disqualify class counsel, that's not within the


question presented.  It's not here at the court. We would


not have that power as an objector. 


As an objector, we have only the right to pursue


our individual objections, which is the distinction I take


it you are drawing.  Justice Breyer, I took the implicit


premise of his question to be well, why don't we intervene


for that limited purpose? And that's I think what I took


Justice Breyer to be getting at.  He is saying what's the


big deal.  Can't the district judge maybe help us out in

some cases where we might have a lot of different


objectors and give you a limited intervention right.  That


is akin to the rule that is applied by the Seventh


Circuit, and that is preserved by the question presented


within the petition.


Now, the Government adds a patina on top of that


that Justice Breyer referred to, and that is don't merely


have pro forma intervention, but allow the district judge


to actually do something and screen out the people we


don't want appealing.  So I came back to Justice Breyer


and I said I don't think it will actually --


QUESTION:  You have gained something.  I mean,


normally the judge would grant it, but let's say he


didn't.  It would be some pretty good reason.  Maybe it


would be very unfair, etcetera and you say well, he will


just appeal that.  That's true.  But it's quite a


different matter as an appellate court to decide whether


the judge abused his discretion there than to have to go


through what could be 15 years' worth of litigation to


figure out whether this settlement nor the circumstances


is a fair one.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Breyer, let me draw a


distinction.  My point is not that in an extraordinary


case, that a district judge is faced with dozens upon


dozens of objectors; the case has become completely


14

unmanageable; this is an important settlement to implement


immediately; that a district court couldn't in that case


exercise discretion under the broad language of subsection


23(d).  My point is that in the mine run of class actions,


in every case, we don't need to be doing this.


QUESTION:  Well, what discretion would the


district court have if your theory is right, Mr.


Goldstein, that an objector doesn't even have to


intervene? I mean, in a very complicated case the objector


simply says I object, I'm not a party.  What can the


district court judge do?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, I believe that under the


language of the rule --


QUESTION:  Of what rule?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Of subsection D, and let me


return to the introductory clause, Mr. Chief Justice. 


There is a, sort of the broad phrasing because we have all


kinds of class actions.  Justice Ginsburg pointed out we


don't have opt outs here but in D 3 cases we might.  Just


in the broad phrasing in the conduct of actions to which


the rule applies, the court may make appropriate orders. 


And I think the court of appeals would be very sympathetic


to a district judge faced with an extraordinary


circumstance of lots of adverse objectors. But I think --


QUESTION:  So you are saying that I am reaching

out and bringing you into the case in spite of the fact


you haven't moved to intervene?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice. 


No.  What I'm reacting to is Justice Breyer's suggestion


that if there are actually a lot of objectors in the case,


and it's become a mess, we have a district judge who says


look, what in the world is going to happen with this case


on appeal.  I'm going to try and help the court of appeals


out.  My point is that I do believe that the district


judge in that circumstance would have the discretion to


say to the intervenors -- excuse me, the objectors, say to


the objectors, look, if you all are going to take an


appeal, we are going to have to handle this here and try


and create some organization.


QUESTION:  How does he give jurisdiction over


people that are simply on the outside; they are not


parties; all they are doing is objecting?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice. 


They are parties.  This is a rule 23 class action under


Sosna vs. Iowa.  At the point of class certification, they


have come, they are both bound by the judgment and they


have availed themselves of the court by appearing and


making an objection.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Let's assume we agree with


you.  What does the judge then do? Does he say I'm going

to let X and Y speak for the rest of you, and I will not


hear separate objections from the others?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, no.  I think the judge


clearly is going to hear objections from everyone.  The


question is is the district judge going to exercise some


gatekeeping determination about who goes up on appeal. 


But Justice Souter, I could not agree more.


QUESTION:  How -- how can -- I'm lost.  How does


he exercise gatekeeping on who appeals?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Souter, that is our


fundamental point, is that, let me just distinguish again


with the Court whose position is what.  We don't agree


with this suggestion.  It wasn't employed here.  We think


it's entirely unnecessary. I'm trying to achieve --


QUESTION:  No, but you are suggesting it as an


alternative to Justice Breyer's suggestion that maybe to


avoid chaos, you ought to have discretionary intervention,


permissive intervention, and if you've got to avoid the


chaos, then I assume the judge has got to be able in


effect to limit what some parties objecting can do in


favor of what other parties, letting other parties


objecting speak.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Souter, I agree with


you.  I don't know exactly how this is supposed to work. 


It has never come up in 35 years since the rule was

amended fundamentally in 1966.  So far as we can tell,


neither a federal district judge for a state trial court

extraordinary case.  I don't endorse this proposal --


QUESTION:  Mr. Goldstein, I was very surprised


to hear you say you agree with Justice Souter when he used


the word permissive intervention.  I mean, even the


Government agrees with you that if you must intervene, you


would be an intervenor of right, not a mere "permissive,"


because you are bound by the judgment.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, I didn't focus


on that word in Justice Souter's question.


QUESTION:  I retract my adjective.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And so that's quite right.  Now,


let me just put on the table, Your Honors, the fact that


we, here at the Supreme Court, the brief suggests oh, this


will be so easy.  District judges will always allow these


sorts of interventions.  This Court's opinion in Crown,


Cork & Seal makes quite clear that isn't true.  This judge


said look, here's what's happening.  And this is Chief


Judge Motz in our case, said, I'm not going to let you


intervene but if I'm wrong in rejecting your objections,


you have got an appeal.  That's how it has worked in


several circuits without any difficulty at all, with the


court of appeals having been confronted with any need for

the district judges to act as a gatekeeper. 


And let me pick up, Justice Souter, if I might,


on the specific problem that you identified and that is


the district judge picking out one appellant versus


another.  There is the grave difficulty that in one


appellant goes up and the others are not permitted to


intervene in appeal, what happens when that person


dismisses their appeal? This is an entirely untested rule.


QUESTION:  Under your theory, any objector can


appeal, I take it.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  And no matter how complicated the


case in the district court, they don't have to intervene. 


You are going to have 15 or 20 appeals.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  But it has never happened.  The


courts -- that there would be that many separate briefs,


for example, or separate appeals.  Let me tell you how the


courts of appeals deal with this problem.  They deal with


it here like they do in all multiparty litigation.  They


require consolidation.  For example, in the Second


Circuit, there can only be one appellant's brief.  The


people have to get together. 


In addition, the Rules Advisory Committee has


made a very specific point that I would like to draw to


the Court's attention with respect to the amended rule

23(e) that will come into place in 2003, and the court


says that once -- and I apologize:  The advisory committee


note, Mr. Chief Justice, this isn't reproduced anywhere,


because it's a new rule that will come into play next


year.  But the advisory committee writes, once an objector


appeals, control of the proceeding lies in the court of


appeals.  The court of appeals may undertake review and


approval of a settlement with the objector perhaps as part


of the appeal settlement procedures or may remand to the


district court to take advantage of the district court's


familiarity with the action in the settlement.  There is a


great deal of flexibility built into the process.


QUESTION:  How, in the Second and Third Circuits


has, has the procedure been you can object, everybody lets


you object, but you can then appeal without having


intervened?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  In excess of several decades,


Your Honor, and it stretches in the Ninth Circuit back to


1979, for example.  And so let me point to the Court the


language that is quoted against us from another court of


appeals is the Guthrie decision from the Eleventh Circuit,


1985, in which that court predicted that there would be


administrative difficulties, Mr. Chief Justice, with a


system that allowed objectors to appeal.  But it has been


the rule in those other courts that Justice Ginsburg

identified for several decades, and they have not


complained a whit about this.


QUESTION:  Will your rule hold for certiorari


petitions as well, so if, let's say, a named class member


takes an appeal, but then the class petitions for


certiorari, that any non-named class member can petition


for certiorari?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, Justice Kennedy.  This


court's rule as I understand it is that you had to have


been a party in the court of appeal, and so the failure to


pursue your individual objection in the court of appeals


would require, would mean that you drop out.


QUESTION:  Well, but your rule is that you are a


party.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  You are a party to the case, to


the district court's judgment.  That's correct.  But this


Court's cert proceedings turn on not whether you are a


party in the district court but whether you are a party in


the court of appeals, and I can --


QUESTION:  But under your philosophy you are a


party to the court of appeals because you are bound by the


judgment.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, Justice Kennedy.  Our point


is this.  When you appeal as an objector, as opposed to


the class representative, you appeal in your individual


21

capacity to pursue your individual objections.  That is


our position why the Fourth Circuit had it wrong in saying


that we were going to take over the case, usurp the role


of the class representative.  That's not correct.


We come into the court of appeals, Mr. Devlin


does, on behalf of himself and when his, he is the only


objector appellant that was in the court.  It is true that


he represents an organization, but his individual


objections are the only ones that are in the court of


appeals.


QUESTION:  What you are saying then is not that


he ceases to be a party, that the nonobjecting class


member ceases to be a party in the court of appeals, but


the nonobjecting class member has waived the right to be


separately represented by himself, isn't it?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And the objection, of course he


couldn't petition for cert because all he can do, he can't


question anything else in the case except his objections


to the settlement.  That's all he can pursue.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's right.  That's what rule


23 sets up.  It gives him a formal and important role in


the process.  And it's important not to let go of the


reason that exists, and that is that the Rules Advisory

Committee notes that, and, understood that these


objections are an important part of the process of


identifying legal errors as in Amchem; deterring collusive


settlements is another important role that they further.


Let me identify an additional difficulty and a


reason why you should not have an intervention rule, and


it applies, I'm trying to advise the court about rules


that intersect its decision and rules that are going to


come into place in 2003.  In 2003, assuming the rules as


proposed to be amended are actually implemented, there is


going to be a real problem with the Respondent's


suggestion and opt-outs.  Right now, in a (b)(3) class


action, we don't have the right to opt out, which I think


is a point in our favor, as Justice Ginsburg noted, but in


a (b)(3) class action you can opt out at the point of


class certification.


Under the amended rule, there is going to be a


second opt-out opportunity at the point of settlement. 


Our concern is that if you tell an objector, your role in


the case may be cut off, if the district judge makes a


terrible legal error, and the district judge then is a


screen and gets to decide whether or not you are going to


get to appeal, all that person is going to do is get out


of the case and go litigate on their own by opting out.


The one thing this Court I would hope doesn't

want is to spread out all the parties.  The point really


is to keep everybody within the individual judgment.  The


premise of the Respondent's position, it seems to me, is


fundamentally that we want a class action to be settled


and over with, just the way a lawsuit of me against


another person would be over.


With respect, I think that asks too much of rule


23.  We, this is a case involving hundreds upon hundreds


upon hundreds of people, and it's not surprising that it


can't just be settled by one person or another.


QUESTION:  Well, what's wrong with the


Government's position, which is you have the right to


intervene for purposes of appeal? Indeed you don't even


have to file your motion to intervene until after the


settlement has been entered as a judgment of the court. 


Just to make it clear that you are not someone who isn't


even a part of this class, isn't even legitimately part of


this class, you are not just somebody that walked in off


the street.  Why isn't that a problem?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because the judge already knows


that.  The only people contemplated by the Government's


intervention proposal and screening function are those who


have already stated objections at the fairness hearing,


and we know who those people are.  If they weren't members


of the class and they weren't proper appellants, we would

argue no.


My point about all the different hypotheticals


spun in a couple of pages in the government's brief where


it discusses the screening function is that it doesn't


actually add value and it does create collateral


litigation.  There will be a motion to intervene; there


will be mandatory disclosures; there will be the


opposition to the motion to intervene; it will be


litigated and then it will appeal.


I could see, if the courts of appeals were


actually experiencing a problem, that the advisory


committee would revisit this issue and would interpose the


district judges as a screen, but that hasn't happened.


QUESTION:  The advisory committee could solve


this either way, couldn't they, the Rules Committee?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It actually could.  And it


hasn't.  The amended rule the advisory committee notes,


note the circuit split, and suggest --


QUESTION:  Well, why hasn't it? Why hasn't it


decided this?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I think there is one good reason


and that is that the advisory committee goes through, in


cycles, of course, it revisits particular rules.  Rule 23,


rule 24.  Rule 23 we believe has no role to play, as


Justice Souter suggested, in screening appellants.  That's

the rules of appellate procedure and so it's not


surprising in amended rule 23 that they didn't take this


on.  If I could reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Goldstein.  Mr. Gold,


we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE S. GOLD


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. GOLD:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it please


the Court:  The well settled rule that we begin from and


that the Petitioners accept is that only parties to a


lawsuit or those that properly become parties may appeal


an adverse judgment.  The basic point of the Petitioners,


the point from which everything else springs, is that the


unnamed class members are parties to a class action suit. 


That premise is wrong.  In a rule 23 case, the only


litigating persons before the court are the persons who


initiate and prosecute the case as parties opposing the


class, the persons who are served with process and defend


the lawsuit as representative parties, and the persons who


move to intervene and are granted intervention.  The very


point of the class action is to provide for representative


party suits where the class is so numerous that joinder of


all the unnamed class members is impractical.


QUESTION:  But couldn't any member of the class


say judge, you looked like a representative.  I'm not

adequately represented and at the point at which I'm not


adequately represented, I have the right to come in and


speak for myself.  And isn't that exactly what's going on


here? A representative of my class is fine, until the


representative is together in a deal with the other side,


and at that point, when I object to the deal, I'm not


adequately represented.


MR. GOLD:  The -- to the extent that that is


your point, and you move to intervene to replace the


representative party, that's a motion that has to be dealt


with.  The, the "fairness hearing" and the process of the


district court --


QUESTION:  Mr. Gold, may I go back to the


statement, you said something, you moved to intervene.  If


you have seen class actions in the Seventh Circuit and the


Third Circuit, you can come in and object without


intervening.


MR. GOLD:  But that wasn't --


QUESTION:  And that, you come in and object and


you say I object to the settlement.  This representative


is not adequate to represent me to the extent of the


settlement.


MR. GOLD:  Well, but you are not saying that the


representative is not adequate to represent you for


purposes of the settlement.  Your objection is that the

settlement is not fair, proper and adequate.


QUESTION:  Well, then let me put it in your


terms, and I'm reading from page 30 of your brief.  Once a


proposed settlement is reached, it is axiomatic that the


named representative party who has negotiated the


settlement does not adequately represent either the


interests or the viewpoint of those class members opposed


to the settlement.  You say it's axiomatic and I was just


saying well, you said yourself it's axiomatic that they,


the representative at that point does not adequately


represent the class member who is opposed to the


settlement.


MR. GOLD:  In -- in the sense, Your Honor, what


we are saying is not that the class representative in fact


has not properly and adequately represented the class.  It


is that the individual can, has a proper argument for


intervention on that theory.  It isn't that the, the


individual in making objections is necessarily challenging


the propriety and adequacy of representation.


QUESTION:  But Mr. Gold, if he is challenging


the representative's fee, I think he is, which often is


what the minority member of the class objects to, the


large fee that the class representatives, the lawyers get. 


You can't say there is not a conflict there.


MR. GOLD:  I'm not arguing that there is not a

"difference of opinion" or conflict.  If --


QUESTION:  Well, you are certainly not arguing


that the lawyer adequately represents the person who is


objecting to his fee either, are you?


MR. GOLD:  No.  I am not.  No.  But I am arguing


that the making of objections, whether it is by a class


member or the, a nonclass member who is interested and


affected by the class action and the class action


settlement, as was the case in Marino, by making an


objection is not entering the case and litigating in the


case.  That is, as a party.  That is the very point of the


court's opinion in Marino vs. Ortiz.


QUESTION:  That was somebody who was not a


member of the class, right?


MR. GOLD:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  Here you are talking about members of


the class and even in this case, people who are made to be


members of the class even if they don't want to be because


they can't opt out.


MR. GOLD:  Well, they are the members of the


class but they are not parties to the lawsuit.  That is


the whole --


QUESTION:  They don't want to be.  All they want


to do is to say, as Justice Stevens suggests, you made the


settlement deal and the lawyers are getting the lion's

share of it and I want to object to that, why can't they


say that?


MR. GOLD:  There is no argument here that you


made a deal and the lawyers are getting the lion's share. 


Here the lawyers were paid on --


QUESTION:  But we're are not dealing with the


merits of it.  We are dealing with first you have a right


to come in and object, and you have agreed that you do


have a right to come in and object.  Now, the question is,


what more? And what I took to be the principal difference


between your position and the Government's is the


Government is very clear that there is a right to


intervene.  The objector would have a right to intervene


for the limited purpose of pursuing the appeal. 


You seem to hedge on it.  First you say it's


axiomatic that there is a, no longer an identity of


interest, but then I can't tell, and maybe you can tell


me.  The Government says of course they have a right to


intervene, but we want them to be orderly so they make a


motion, which must be granted.  What is your view?


MR. GOLD:  I don't understand the Government to


argue that the motion must be granted, and I'll --


QUESTION:  Do you understand the Government to


say it is intervention of right, not permissive


intervention?

 MR. GOLD:  It's intervention of, of right, but


not automatic.  Intervention of right is not a, a motion


that has to be granted without a showing.  Intervention of


right is intervention of, to file, to participate in the


litigation by doing something.  And it's our view that


since we are talking about a status to take an appeal in a


representative action, it's a motion to press a case into


court, into the court of appeals and to litigate the case


in the court of appeals as, for the class and


unnecessarily on behalf of the class.


The point of appeal --


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Mr. Gold, I


really don't understand what you are trying to convey


because there are two kinds of intervention, intervention


of right and permissive intervention.  Intervention of


right if you meet the terms, and in this case it would be


when you claim an interest, which is the subject matter of


the action, and you're so situated that the disposition of


the action may as a practical matter impaired your ability


to protect your own interests.  So I give you one example


is, well, this case.  I will lose -- my pension is going


to be, the COLA is going to be dead and gone, so I want to


protect that interest, which the settlement takes away.


Isn't that, wouldn't that be, whether I have a


good case on the merits is another question, but wouldn't

I have a right to intervene?


MR. GOLD:  You would, you have a right to


intervene, but your -- what you are doing if you seek to


intervene to take an appeal is to proceed on behalf of the


class and to invalidate and have vacated the, the


settlement agreement which is not an agreement which


either cuts your COLA, the trust, having acted --


QUESTION:  The, the Government as I understand


it says yes you have a right to intervene and you have a


right to appeal to the limited extent that you are


contesting the settlement.  That's the Government's


position.  And you are saying that's a wrong position.  Is


that --


MR. GOLD:  No.  I am not saying that that is a


wrong position.  I am saying that it is our view first of


all that it is a right position.  And secondly, we would


suggest that the, the standard for showing intervention is


not simply that you are a class member, and that you have


objections to the settlement, but also, a showing that you


have colorable objections and that in, in pressing those


objections, you are going to do so for and on behalf of


the interests of the class.  Now, that's our view of the


proper standard for the proper showing on behalf of the


intervention.  We think that that standard is exactly the


correct standard for maintaining the integrity of the

class action.


QUESTION:  Mr. Gold, that's not the standard


that applies to the right of a class member to participate


in the district court proceeding, is it?


MR. GOLD:  It isn't -- it is; it would be the


standard for a class member to intervene as --


QUESTION:  To intervene.  I'm just asking to


participate in the district court objecting to the


settlement.  Don't he have an absolute right to do that?


MR. GOLD:  He has an absolute right to


participate in the, in the fairness hearing.  But that is


not a litigating right.  He is, objectors advise the court


on their views of why the settlement is --


QUESTION:  But he has that right, whether or not


the district court may view his objections as colorable or


frivolous.


MR. GOLD:  That is true, Your Honor.  But the


making of objections is not coming into the action to


litigate, but as if your objection is a motion, which the


court passes on or not.  The court is considering a


question posed by the litigating parties, whether the


settlement agreement is fair and proper in order to be


approved.  Objectors have the right to state their views


for the court's consideration.  The courts also --

QUESTION:  Even approving the settlement in the


face of an objection is the ruling that the objection is


without merit.  It seems to me.  I don't know.  Maybe you


know something --


MR. GOLD:  No.  The objections can be of all


shapes and sizes, Justice Stevens.  They can be that the


settlement doesn't provide enough for the X or Y class and


the judge doesn't say that that's precisely what the X or


Y class ought to get, and I reject that as an objection.


The judge's role is, is the settlement fair,


proper and adequate? And the point is, our basic point is


if a class member wishes to go further and take the case


to another stage where he is litigating on behalf of the


class, he ought to be an intervenor and a party, not


simply someone who is not a party.  We think that that's


proper, whatever the right standard on intervention is,


and we believe that the standard I have articulated makes


sense in the class action.

 QUESTION:  You disagree with anything the


government said in its brief about the objector has a


right to intervene, he can do so even after judgment


within the time allowed?


MR. GOLD:  We think definitely that an objector


or even a class member who hasn't participated in the


objection process can intervene to take an appeal and to


forward the objections made in the objection process by


anyone, but we think that --


QUESTION:  Then you are disagreeing with the


Seventh Circuit.  Seventh Circuit, as I understand it,


says you have a right to intervene, but you must exercise


it when you know about the settlement, and it's too late


after judgment.  So you are disagreeing with that?


MR. GOLD:  Well, the Government -- neither, I


don't believe the Seventh Circuit has passed on the, the


propriety of intervention after judgment.  Our only point


is --


QUESTION:  It has.  It has. It --


MR. GOLD:  -- that only parties can -- no, they


said that you can intervene after.


QUESTION:  No.  The Seventh Circuit has said; it


has dismissed.  It said you have a right to be here, but


you should have intervened when you knew that you were


objecting to the settlement.  It's too late to do so after

the judgment.


MR. GOLD:  Well, the Government doesn't take


that position.  We don't take that position.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gold.  Ms. Millett,


we'll hear from you.


MS. MILLETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court.  We agree with Petitioners that


objectors who have expressed objections to settlement


agreements have important interests and often should be


allowed to appeal.  Our disagreement is on the mechanism


by which someone gets to the court of appeals.


QUESTION:  Is that a purely formal disagreement,


or are there some distinct practical advantages that you


can tell us to your rule so that the district judge, I


assume, can give some shape and direction to the appeal?


Is that the point?


MS. MILLETT:  There is a practical significance


to this process.  I think it's important to keep in mind


that class actions can come in many forms and shapes and


can involve up to, as this Court knows from the asbestos


cases, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom can


express an objection.  And it is actually incorrect and we


disagree with the argument that you will know at the


objection stage whether in fact that person even really is


a member of the class action, who has a live claim that is

covered by the class.  So what the intervention motion


process allows is, we don't think a merits determination


on the value of the objection, but we think it allows a


district court in the first instance to make a record and


address whether someone is a member of the class.


I mean, you could have a class action that's not


as discrete as this one here, but the definition of the


class is everyone employed by X corporation for a period


of 10 years.


QUESTION:  Beyond the determination that they


are members of the class, are there any further purposes


served by the intervention rule you propose?


MS. MILLETT:  Whether or not there is stale


claim.  But it, you could have objections that really


simply don't have any relevance to the issue that will be


presented on appeal.  For example, in this case, I think


as Mr. Gold said, objections come in many shapes and


sizes.  And if I could refer the Court to Joint Appendix


page 125, we have an objection that says please consider


this letter my objection.  That's it.  It gives no


elucidation to anyone on the basis for appeal.  Now, how


the court can deal with this, this deprives the district


court of any opportunity to address this concern as a part


of the settlement.


QUESTION:  You think under Petitioner's view

that person would be able to appeal?


MS. MILLETT:  That's my understanding of


Petitioner's view, without having given the district court


any opportunity, or the attorneys who are representing


that person at that point, to address this concern is part


of the fairness hearing.


QUESTION:  Well, what is the practical


difference? I mean, you take the position that


intervention is of right, is that correct?


MS. MILLETT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  All right.  Then the practical


difference is that if they move to intervene, they simply


have to come physically before the court, so the court can


flush out the objection, as opposed to merely filing an


objection saying I object in which case the court may not


see them? Is that the difference?


MS. MILLETT:  They don't have to be there


physically, in person, but there is motions practice in


district courts, and a district court would decide whether


or not they want someone there in person or not.  But


intervention rights --


QUESTION:  Well, why cannot the same thing be


accomplished by saying flush out your objection?


MS. MILLETT:  There is two answers to that. 


First of all, intervention of right doesn't mean the

district court doesn't have some final say.  But when we


need to understand, objections are coming before a


settlement has been approved, and it may well be even if


this objection is very vague, I have got enough other


objections that in fact would capture what that person is


concerned about without them having told me.  And if they


object -- the objection process, the fairness hearing is


very flexible and informal at this point and allows the


district court to gather information and make a decision


whether to approve the settlement agreement.


It would be very unworkable, and I think unwise


to adopt a rule that turns the fairness hearing, which is


supposed to focus on the settlement agreement and dealing


with serious objections, I think that's what courts want


to do, into a fairness hearing/qualifications for appeal,


where I have got to spend all my time not just deciding


whether I should approve this settlement agreement or not,


so that you would even be aggrieved, but in advance I have


to decide whether you are part of the class and someone


who could --


QUESTION:  Ms. Millett, I would be very


impressed with the argument you are making now about


having the thing run neat and tidy, but for two things. 


Are you aware of any experience in the Second or Third


Circuit that creates these, this pandemonium that you are

now describing? And second, when did the Government find


out about the pandemonium? Because in Felzen, as I recall,


you took the position that the objector can come in,


object to the settlement, and can appeal for the limited


purpose of challenging the settlement without intervening. 


What happened between Felzen and this case, and are you


basing your prediction of pandemonium on any experience in


the Second and Third Circuit that allowed objectors to


appeal for years?


MS. MILLETT:  Concrete evidence of pandemonium,


no, there is no concrete evidence that intervention is a


difficult barrier in the five circuits that have required


-- in fact, the seven circuits that require this


intervention motion.  So our position is based on analysis


of the rules.  We have an established mechanism in the


rules for dealing with deciding who will be a litigating


party, not one of the 10,000 on the sideline, but a


litigating party in a case. 


Now at the time of Felzen, we didn't have as


much experience with the limited intervention option for


purposes of appeal.  And it seems that now when we focus


on the --


QUESTION:  When was Felzen? How long ago was it?


MS. MILLETT:  It was -- I'm sorry.  I don't


know.  About seven years.  But in the intervening time,

there have been some decisions from the Seventh Circuit


that have propounded this notion, in particular, Seventh


Circuit, that have propounded, and the Eighth Circuit,


too, that have propounded this notion of limited


intervention for purposes of appeal.  And I have to say we


have also just reviewed and reconsidered our position, and


looking at the text of the rules, we have an answer to


this problem.


QUESTION:  Felzen was three years ago.  I was --


MS. MILLETT:  I'm sorry.  But the point is that


we have an answer, our position is that there is an answer


in the rules to this problem and it's limited intervention


for purposes of appeal.  And the alternative is to make up


an ad hoc rule cut out of out of whole cloth.  That seems


to collect a variety of factors that happen to have been


present in this case --


QUESTION:  May I ask you, because your time is


so limited, could you tell us what is the difference


between your view of this case and Mr. Gold's view of this


case?


MS. MILLETT:  I think, well, putting aside, we


think there is more, we don't think that the objectors are


parties but we are somewhat more sympathetic to the notion


that they have the same interests as quasi parties, I


think, than Mr. Gold is.  Secondly, and I don't want to

put words in his mouth, but my understanding of their


brief and argument here is that they would have some more


rigid scrutiny of the intervention as a right motion, and


in fact would require the person to demonstrate that they


can represent the interests of the class.


QUESTION:  May I ask you under your view of the


requirement of an intervention for purposes of appeal,


could the district judge in this case, in response to the


intervention motion that was actually filed, have granted


that relief?


MS. MILLETT:  The intervention for purposes of


appeal?


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MS. MILLETT:  Could it have, I guess the


district court would have had the power contingently to


reserve judgment.  Because, remember that motion was made


before the settlement was even distributed and notice was


given, so it would have been odd to grant intervention for


a settlement judgment that had not yet been entered and


the judge hadn't heard objections or had a fairness


hearing.  I mean district court can only say I'll reserve


judgment and I will renew or revisit this question for


limited purposes of appeal after I have judgment, if you


are still interested, if your concerns are not addressed.


In this case, the intervention was, again,

before the settlement was even distributed to members of


the class, and it was joined with a motion that asked to


strike class counsel for preliminary injunction.  And so I


think, and it hasn't been contested that the district


court was well within its discretion to deny.


QUESTION:  But you could deny it in court.  You


could say to the extent that they wanted to intervene to


contest the settlement, fine, to the extent that they want


to take discovery, it's not fine.  But to say that because


they asked for too much they are not entitled to anything,


is, I would think the Government would say the judge was


right to say they can't engage in discovery.  The judge


was right to say they are not entitled to an injunction. 


But to say that they can't intervene --


MS. MILLETT:  The district court never said that


they can't intervene for purposes of appeal because they


were never --


QUESTION:  It denied the motion to intervene,


which had many parts.


MS. MILLETT:  Well, it just said to intervene. 


The motion itself just says to intervene and then was


accompanied with this, other motions asking --


QUESTION:  So, should not the proper ruling have


been yes, you can intervene, but only for this limited


purpose, instead of saying motion denied?

adopt the rule and recognize that limited intervention for


purposes of appeal is appropriate in this context,


district courts will know that that's an option and be


able to address it or raise it with attorneys.  But the


important thing here is I think --


QUESTION:  This district judge certainly thought


that his wording on the objection, he twice said if you


don't agree, appeal it.  And the "it" was his appeal of


the settlement.


MS. MILLETT:  He said that.  He also twice told


him that he wasn't a party to the case, as well.  I think


-- the point is, you may have thought he would ask, but


our interest in this case is less the particular, we gave


the court our best judgment of how the record --


QUESTION:  Do you disagree with the Seventh


Circuit, which would require the motion to intervene to be


made prejudgment?


MS. MILLETT:  If that's how one reads -- I


assume you are talking about the Navigant opinion?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. MILLETT:  I think there is a prior opinion


and I'm sorry, the name, escapes me from, which Judge


Easterbrook also wrote, which we think adopted our


position.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Millett.


MS. MILLETT:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Goldstein, you have five minutes


remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


If I could make four points, please, about the


Government's proposal starting with its applications to


this case, because Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg


wanted to know whether we do here, assuming what happened


in the district court, assuming we were going to adopt the


Government's position, the Government does not press, so


far as I understand, any further whether or not it's


presented in this court.  We have the cert petition


identifying the motion to intervene, the discussion of the


Seventh Circuit's position.  The question is what we did


in the district court.


The argument, as I understand it, the textual


basis for the Government's rule is that under subsection


(d)(2) of rule 23 you move to intervene, and the language


of the rule is that the district court can condition your


right to intervene. 


And Justice Ginsburg, if you would adopt the


Government's suggestion, I think that's what you would


45

have to say was the appropriate result in this case, that


the district judge should have seen our intervention


motion and because he clearly did believe we had the right


to take an appeal, he should have conditioned it.


So my principal point is that whatever the Court


does in terms of its rule, we prevail.


QUESTION:  Is that still before us, I mean, the


denial of the intervention motion?


QUESTION:  I don't think that was properly


raised.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, let me


explain why I disagree.  There are, the cert petition, and


I need to distinguish between intervention for all


purposes and intervention for purposes of taking an


appeal.  In the cert petition, the question presented


flags the fact that we move to intervene and discusses at


some length the Seventh Circuit's role which we are


discussing here both in the petition and in the required


brief, and to that extent it clearly --


QUESTION:  But that's not, I don't think a fair


interpretation of the question that you have presented. 


The question is whether you have standing to appeal.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kennedy, the reason we


used that formulation is because it's the formulation that


the Fourth Circuit used. It's just picked up from the

court of --


QUESTION:  Well, we'll decide that another time.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I understand.  The only other


point, I would make, Mr. Chief Justice, about what's


fairly included in the question presented is I ask the


court to look at the question as the Government frames it,


which it only could do if it believed our position was --


QUESTION:  Well, we take it the question you


presented and your petition for certiorari, that's what we


granted.


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  Now,


the second is, I'd like to address, Justice Ginsburg, with


respect, I don't think that you got a comforting answer on


the question of whether or not this has been a problem in


the Second or Third circuits, i.e., is there a problem out


there that requires the rules to be construed --


QUESTION:  Why is it, has there been a problem


the other way? The seventh circuits that have gone the


other way?


MR. GOLDSTEIN:  But they don't, Justice Breyer. 


Our point is that no circuit applies the Government's


rule.  It's a little unfair to say that I can't identify a


problem with their rule, since no court has ever adopted


or even suggested it. 


Now, it is a problem to the extent that there


47

are circuits that require full party intervention.  That


you have to come in, you have to be a litigant in order to


take an appeal.  The problem is not an administrative one


so much as that it cuts off appeals, appeals that are


perfectly legitimate.  The rule as we understand it under


this Court's precedents is not that only named parties can


take an appeal.  That's why someone who sanctions can


appeal and that's why it's uncontested that the denial of


our motion to intervene gives us a right to appeal.  It is


persons who are directly affected by the judgment,


directly bound by something that the district court did,


and then what they can do is they can appeal to the extent


that the arguments that they properly presented to the


district court.


Now, someday, will there be unusual class


actions that require a further screen? Perhaps.  Our point


is that in an appropriate case a district court could


employ the Government's suggestion, but why we would want


to add the burden of this intervention requirement in


every single class action in order to avoid the


hypothetical possibility, that again has never been


suggested by any court, State or Federal, so far as we or


the Government have been able to identify.


The other point I would like to make, just to,


although again we believe we prevail under the


48


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Government's suggestion, is to take you back to the text


that's supposed to require this intervention, and I think


a fair reading of the text is otherwise.  There are two


different provisions for notice that we are talking about. 


The one is the D provision that I quoted midway through


the argument, and the other is E, which is the settlement


notice.  The point to recognize is that under (d)(2),


which talks about intervening to present claims or


defenses, there is no intervention requirement when it


comes to presenting objections.


And we are not intervening to present any claims


or defenses.  There is just no textual hook here.  To the


extent the Court did want to look at subsection D, with


respect, we think it's the end of that clause that says


intervene to present claims or defenses or otherwise to


come into the case.  There is nothing in the text of the


rule, there is nothing in the advisory committee notes


that indicates that anyone contemplated the intervention


to appeal.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Goldstein.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
