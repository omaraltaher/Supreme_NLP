CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this morning in case 16-327, Lee v. United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Bursch. 

 

               

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH 

 

 

 

 

 

                  

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Jae Lee accepted a plea based on his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

counsel's assurance he would not be deported.  Counsel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had it exactly backward.  The plea resulted in mandatory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

banishment from the United States. 

 

 

 

 

            

No one seriously doubts that if Mr. Lee knew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the truth about his plea, he would have rejected it, had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Sixth Circuit dispensed with this Court's totality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the circumstances test for proving prejudice and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created a categorical rule. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In -- in State courts, do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State -- are State courts mandated to follow what we do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Federal courts under Rule 11; that is to say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the guilty plea is accepted, to advise the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant of all of his rights?  I'm sure they are. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yeah.  I think in most State 

    

  

 

 

 

 

courts they do follow that procedure.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do -- do they also tell --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advise the defendant that if he or she is an alien, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there may be certain consequences to the plea?  In State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts, do you happen to know? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  I mean, in State courts, every 

    

 

 

 

 

 

court would have their own version of Rule 11, and so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're going to have some colloquy, and -- and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe those colloquies have changed somewhat since 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Padilla. 

              

I -- you know, and so one of the problems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, if you look at what happened during the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

withdrawal of the plea, everyone in the court, including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judge, thought that Mr. Lee was going to remain in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States after he served his sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I -- I don't quite see 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that in -- in --

 

 

 

 

            

that. 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Let -- let me walk you through 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- at -- at 103 of -- of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Joint Appendix, which is the beginning --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The judge, after advising 

  

 

 

 

 

him of many of his rights, says:  Are you a U.S. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen? 

            

No, your Honor. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

Okay.  A conviction on this charge then 

    

 

 

 

 

5 

could result in your being deported.  Does that at all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affect your decision about whether you want to plead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty or not? 

 

 

            

            

Yes, your Honor.


 

 

Okay.  How does it affect your decision?


  

 

 

 

 

 

              

I don't understand.


 

            

again. 

            

And then -- and then he talks about it


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  Right.  And -- and then we find 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

out later, at the 2255 evidentiary hearing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy, that when he said I don't understand, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

he then turned to his attorney, Mr. Fitzgerald, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Fitzgerald said:  Don't worry.  This is a standard 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

warning that everybody gets.  If the deportation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

consequences are not in the plea agreement itself --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, except --

  

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  -- you will not be deported. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- I'm -- I'm not sure how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much more the judge can do, and that at least argues for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our accepting midway ground of requiring Strickland 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy -- Strickland -- Strickland doubt, 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable -- reasonable probability of -- of success if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you go to a jury. 

   

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well -- well, two -- two points

on that, Justice Kennedy. 

 

 

 

6 

            

First, with respect to what he heard from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judges, what I would really like the Court to focus 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on is the sentencing hearing colloquy, which is at pages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

124 to 127 of the Joint Appendix.  And there, it's clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that everyone, even the Federal District Court judge, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believed that he was going to be released back into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States after his one year was over.  She even put 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him on three years of supervised release and told him to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give the probation officer his address once he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

released. 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  -- and that --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That goes to 

  

 

 

 

 

deficient performance.  I think we're beyond that, and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the question is -- is prejudice. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, but -- but the question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, at the colloquy, was whether he was informed at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all and how that prejudice -- to kind of combine the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response to yours and Justice Kennedy's question, what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the standard that we have here? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And we -- we start with the baseline, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is Strickland, is there a reasonable probability of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

different outcome, but that was refined by this Court in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hill.  And as we explain at length in the reply brief,

the Hill test is whether there a reasonable probability 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant would not have pleaded guilty.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here --

 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But is that --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  On that point, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say the facts here support that -- that conclusion and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go through them all, but I don't understand how you'll 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be able to distinguish any case in the future. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You say:  Well, here, he's been here a long 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

time, hasn't gone back to South Korea, has he started --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but I think someone who's just arrived might say:  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, this has been my passion my whole life to come to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States; I don't want to go back. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You know, it -- it -- I'm not sure how, at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the outset, a judge can simply say:  Oh, we don't need 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have a hearing in a case like this. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

It seems to me that there would necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to be a hearing in every case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, there would at least have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be a 2255 hearing to get those facts on the table. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But, Mr. Chief justice, what I want to emphasize is that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is an objective test, not a subjective test.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so it's not enough for a defendant simply to say:  Well, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had I known, I would have rejected my plea. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it sounds like

a subjective test.  I mean -- I don't know if it's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

hypothetically, or we can assume it's actually, the idea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that, even though the result of a trial is going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be exactly the same, there's no reasonable probability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he won't be deported, he nonetheless wants to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through the trial. 

 

 

            

Now that could be certainly characterized as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a subjective wish, not an objective.  An objective 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

person would say:  Well, it's going to come out the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyway. 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well -- well, first, let's talk 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about an example where you can see where the outcome 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be different based on objective, and then let's go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to the facts of this case and show why it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectively rational here. 

 

 

              

I -- consider a case where a defendant is 

   

   

 

 

 

new to the country.  He has no familial or business ties 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the United States; they're all to his country of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

origin, and the sentencing disparity between the plea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was offered and what could happen to him if he went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to trial is enormous.  Say it's 50 years.  It would not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be rational for that person to choose to go to trial, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they don't have the connections. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But what we're talking about here --

have to do with this, Mr. Bursch? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We often get people who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

come in and say I wasn't told about a plea, and I would 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have pled guilty.  And judges then look at the facts and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find out that the defendant was claiming he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocent, despite overwhelming evidence that he or she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was guilty. 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Rock solid evidence.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

mean, not only is there a video, there's witnesses, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's fingerprints, you name it, they're there, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants will come in and say I'm not guilty.  And we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, you know, he's foolish, he's irrational.  No 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rational human being would not take this plea, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference between 50 years and five years, and yet, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deny their motion to undo their plea because we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically say it's subjective.  This foolish defendant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to go to trial. 

 

 

 

 

            

I'm not quite sure what objectivity has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do with making a judgment whether this particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

person, under their particular circumstances, would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or would not have gone to trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, the factors you point to can support 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that subjective wish.  If the difference between going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

to jail or not is only nine months, I might say:  Hmm, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

hundred percent chance I'm going to be deported.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only benefit I get is nine months in my plea, which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is what happened here. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And there's even a one 

   

  

 

 

 

percent chance that I might be found not guilty, or at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least found guilty of possession and not something else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think I'm going to roll the dice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Exactly.  And that's why, 

  

  

 

 

 

here --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not irrational. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  It -- it --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I don't know whether 

   

  

 

 

 

--

            

MR. BURSCH:  It's irrational, and it's 

  

 

 

 

 

reasonably probable that that's the decision he would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have made if properly informed.  And I --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't think that's --

    

 

 

 

 

Mr. Bursch, I don't think that's a manageable standard. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

I -- I see a number of possible standards that could be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used here.  One is purely subjective:  What would this 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant have done?  I understand the concept; it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

creates a lot of practical difficulties. 

   

 

 

 

            

Another objective standard would be, is

there a reasonable probability of a better outcome if 

   

   

 

 

 

 

the defendant had gone to trial?  That's manageable. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's standard Strickland. 

 

 

            

But if the test is, would a rational 

   

 

 

 

 

 

defendant have in -- have gone to trial given the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence that would be -- that the defendant might face 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if convicted discounted by the probability of conviction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

versus the consequences of -- of deportation, I -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know how to do that.  It's -- it's -- because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- it depends on how a particular person values those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two things. 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it -- is it irrational 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to try to climb Mount Everest without oxygen?  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is it irrational to swim with sharks or perform on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tightrope without a net?  I mean, I wouldn't do those 

    

   

   

 

 

 

things, but people do it.  I can't say they're 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrational.  They're much less risk averse and they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

value things differently.  I -- I think --

    

   

 

 

 

            

            

standard. 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- it's an unmanageable 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  Well, I -- I think that the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

rationality standard, which you articulated in Padilla 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but not Hill, is supposed to be a low standard.  It's a

backstop to prevent the person from making the crazy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision like Justice Sotomayor was suggesting, where if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the consequences of going to trial were the death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty and they had a plea on the table where they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

could serve 12 months and then -- then be out, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true irrationality.  In most cases, like this one, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're going to be dealing with a defendant who acts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rational, and -- and it's simply a backstop. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And when you're talking about giving up any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance to stay in this country versus a 9- to 11-month 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminution in the sentencing guidelines range, I -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that's not only rational for Mr. Lee or for you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and me, but for almost anyone. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- you have very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

sympathetic facts, but suppose we change the variables a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bit.  You know, they both can -- they both are a sliding 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scale. 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So you have a much more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

serious -- the potential for a much more serious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence.  Let's say, if the person is convicted, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person will serve eight years.  And you have a person 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

who has many more ties to the country to which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person would be removed.

decide whether that's rational? 

 

 

 

            

            

irrational? 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  At what point does it become 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  Well, I think the starting 

   

  

 

 

 

point is the Hill test:  Is there a reasonable 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

probability the defendant, given all the objective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, would have pleaded guilty?  And once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you've satisfied that, then you say, well, was this a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rational thing to do?  And the Court shouldn't guess in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close cases.  Again, it's a backstop to prevent the life 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence versus a 12-month sentence defendant from doing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

something irrational.  In a case like this one, it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

easy. 

            

But courts have to do this balancing all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time.  And the genius of Strickland was that we didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take any of those factors and say we're not going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider those, which is what the Sixth Circuit did.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, you're going to look at all the circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so in your hypothetical, the length of the sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matters and the consequences matter. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Now, I want to take your --

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't this case, Mr. --

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. -- is unlike Strickland in this sense?  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland, so it's a trial error and the Court can --

can determine whether it's harmless. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But here, the plea is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a different thing.  The plea -- there is no trial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error.  And the defendant says, if I were properly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

informed, I would exercise my constitutional right to a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury trial.  And it doesn't -- the Constitution doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say I have to be rational in making that choice.  I have 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a right to a jury trial. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yeah.  We agree with that, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

because what -- what Hill made clear is that the trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process and the plea process are two different things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I'll quote from Hill.  This is 474 U.S. at 59. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whether ineffective performance affected the outcome of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the plea process.  Misadvice, as you're indicating, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg, causes a defendant to forsake their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional right to choose a trial. 

   

 

 

 

            

So it's a prejudice to the decision, Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alito, whether to invoke their right to trial in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first instance. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But that points to a purely 

   

  

 

 

 

 

subjective test, which, as I said, is conceptually 

   

 

 

 

 

 

coherent, but creates a lot of practical difficulties, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

because then the Court is going to have to try to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recreate what the defendant would have done.  And, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

course, after the defendant has been in prison for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while and is facing deportation, the person -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person, I mean, I don't know, may have second thoughts. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

15 

It's very hard to recreate that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, it's not so hard, because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Federal statute for filing a 2255 petition, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've got to do it within a year.  You know, what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened here is Mr. Lee found out, essentially the day 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he was assigned to a facility, that it was a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention facility. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But is that what you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

asking us to do, to adopt a purely subjective standard? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You say no. 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  No, absolutely not. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is your standard? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Our standard is the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

objective standard you articulated in Hill, and that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there was a reasonable probability the defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

would not have pleaded guilty. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So -- so wait. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

You -- even if it's irrational? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, we're -- we're -- we're

decision --

 

            

            

irrational. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well --

  

 

 

16 

MR. BURSCH:  -- can be completely 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it's the same question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

differently, but it's meant to be the same question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What is the precise mistake of law that you think that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Sixth -- that the Sixth Circuit -- that Judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Batchelder made? 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  Judge Batchelder in the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Sixth Circuit made the mistake of having a categorical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

test, where instead of considering all the circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectively, she looked only at the likelihood of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

success at trial to the exclusion of everything else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I'm not sure she did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  I thought that she said -- my reading of it was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she tried to follow what we've said. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, if you look --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and in particular --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in particular, she said, look, this person would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been faced with a choice.  So you started with your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

example.  In your example, it would have been nuts to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reject the plea bargain.  The guy would have ended up in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same place, deported, and he would have been in jail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a lot more time.

She says, here it's the same.  He would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

ended up being deported anyway.  The lawyer would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had to tell him, your chance of winning this trial is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

zero, near zero, close to zero, and you'll have served 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an extra -- at least an extra 9 to 11 months because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'll be in jail for 9 to 11 months more, and the same 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing will happen to you anyway.  Who would want that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It might be more than 9 to 11 months, because the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chances of departure are smaller. 

 

 

 

 

            

Okay.  So now I can repeat, and you started 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in answering the Chief Justice:  What's different about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case?  And I'd say there are factual differences 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there are legal differences.  Start with the legal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differences --

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and then tell us the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual differences, why they matter. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Starting with the -- the legal, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on page 4A of the Petition Appendix, that's where Judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Batchelder reaffirms the Sixth Circuit decision in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pilla, P-i-l-l-a, which says:  If a defendant is facing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

overwhelming evidence of guilt, then it's not rational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for them to do anything other than to take the best --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought she said only if 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the only hope for him is jury nullification.

nullification, but the test in Pilla that she followed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it was Sixth Circuit precedent, was you only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider overwhelming evidence --

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right. 

  

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  -- in that --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what we -- what you want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us to do is to add to what she said.  And what you have

focus just on one piece of the circumstances, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likelihood of success at trial.  You should consider all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the circumstances, like you said in --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's consider them all. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  And -- and --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And suppose one of them is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no hope of success at trial except jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nullification.

MR. BURSCH:  Right.  And -- and there's two 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

responses to that --

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right. 

  

 

MR. BURSCH:  -- which are kind of legal and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual.  The first is that even a -- a defendant who 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

has virtually no hope at trial -- we don't concede 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the case --

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

MR. BURSCH:  -- may still choose to invoke 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their right to trial rather than take certain mandatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

banishment from the United States for the benefit of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only a 9- to 11-month reduction in their sentencing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

range.  That is both reasonable and rational. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

The second is that there's a possibility 

   

 

 

 

 

that with informed counsel, he would be able to bargain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a plea that has lesser deportation consequences. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

And we know that, again, Justice Kennedy, going back to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

124 to 127 of the Joint Appendix, the sentencing hearing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

colloquy, even the government thought that this plea was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to result in Mr. Lee going back to his restaurant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business after his sentence was concluded.  If the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All Right.  That was a good 

   

  

  

 

 

 

point.  So imagine that your lawyers below in this very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case went to the government and said, look, everybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

20 

was under a mistake here.  Why don't you go to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court with me. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  We --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  We jointly will tell them, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the judge, that not -- what would have happened if he'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gotten good advice, is the government would have figured 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something out to help him.  The government would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged him with a -- a lesser crime.  And my guess is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you did that, and my guess is the government wouldn't do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

MR. BURSCH:  My -- my understanding is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that hasn't happened, that the government took the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position that because there was no likelihood of success 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at trial, game over.  The Sixth Circuit got it right. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We would love to have that opportunity.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that we haven't had it is exactly why there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice in this case. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your -- your -- but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your -- your rational defendant rule that you suggest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sounds almost like a jury question.  What were -- did he 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have lots of ties?  Did he have lots of families, to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Korea?  He had none?  I just don't see how, A, a -- a 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial judge can do that other than on a strictly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case-by-case basis, which is nonreviewable.  This is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just like a jury question.

MR. BURSCH:  Well, Justice Kennedy, the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

the reasonable probability and rational bases tests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are -- are not our tests; they're your tests in Hill and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Padilla.  And lower courts have been applying them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

without any difficulty --

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  -- for many years. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but as Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg pointed out, we have in -- in those contexts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we -- we have -- we have a trial, and -- and Padilla --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Padilla, I understand is different, but -- but it seems 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me that your -- you have so many subjective factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you endanger the system by having second --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second -- second thoughts, people who want the second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bite of the apple. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  But like in any Strickland 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case, when you consider all the circumstances, you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individualized facts, not subjective facts, but 

 

 

 

 

 

individualized facts that must then be looked at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectively. 

            

And -- and let's think about Hill and what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened there.  In -- in Hill, you had attorney who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave affirmative misadvice to his counsel about parole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions, and that was enough for this Court to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was ineffective assistance, but no prejudice there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

because he was unable to show a reasonable probability, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

that had he known the proper parole conditions he would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be facing, that he would have rejected the plea. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But we have the exact opposite here.  No one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denies that if Mr. Lee understood the mandatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

banishment that he was facing, of course he would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected the plea and taken his chances at trial, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they were slim. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No -- but I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

several times in your brief and here today, you talk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about -- you say well, who knows what will happen at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial.  Well, that can't be the right test because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise, there'd never be prejudice in a Strickland 

   

 

 

 

 

 

situation. 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, but --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, who knows 

    

 

 

 

 

what will happen?  Maybe the jury won't convict because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they get -- get it wrong.  Maybe there'll be a case of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury nullification.  You say in your brief maybe the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government witness will die.  I mean, it's all -- yeah, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of course you can't be certain about what's going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen, but if your test is right, then all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland cases come out the other way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  No -- no, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to draw a bright line, again, between posttrial

claims of ineffective assistance and plea-stage 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

ineffective assistance.  Because after you've had a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

trial, you can already see what the government's theory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, what the defense theory -- theories were, whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motions to suppress were granted or denied, how the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses responded under the fire of cross-examination. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You have all that data and there --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  -- and the defendant --

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you don't know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what would have happened if the attorney had not been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incompetent. 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  But --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't know what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would have happened if the attorney hadn't, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not called the witness or not presented this evidence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who knows what would have happened. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  But -- but you have this large 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data set.  And district courts are fully capable of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying:  Okay, what if this witness hadn't testified? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Would that have changed the course of the proceeding? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yes or no? 

 

 

            

But at the plea stage, you don't know any of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  You don't know what's going to happen to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion to suppress.  You don't know what's going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

happen on cross-examination.  Now --

  

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I would have thought that 

    

 

 

 

 

the -- that -- that the difference is more fundamental, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is that usually in Strickland, we are asking what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was going to happen at trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And we don't think, well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there was this 1 percent chance that the witness would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drop dead.  We put that to the side. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But here, the inquiry is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different.  The inquiry is not the outcome of the trial. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The inquiry is the outcome of the plea proceeding. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Exactly. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And the plea proceeding 

  

 

 

 

 

might be very affected by somebody saying, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given my ties to this country, given my negative ties to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any other country, given the fact that this is only a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nine-month difference in prison term, I'm going to roll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the dice for that 1 percent chance. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Exactly. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that would be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

completely reasonable thing to do, a thing that many 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

people would do. 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Absolutely.  Because that's the

kind of risk calculus that rational people --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the key is that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome of the proceeding here is not the outcome of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial, as it usually is in a Strickland case.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome of the proceeding here is the outcome of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plea negotiation. 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Exactly.  Just -- just like 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that quote that I read from Hill.  It's about --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  All of that --

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  -- that process -- the due 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

process. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- all of that is true on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the facts of this case.  But I have to ask the same 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question -- I don't want to beat a dead horse, but you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can change the facts.  So you have a defendant with more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ties to Korea.  He didn't come here as a young man.  He 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came here when he was 25 years old. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yeah. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  He still has some relatives 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and friends in Korea.  The sentence that he faces here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is much higher.  Let's say it's five years or it's eight 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years or it's ten years.  At what point -- how do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide whether it's rational. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, that's the job of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district courts applying all the circumstances.

MR. BURSCH:  I hate to keep repeating that. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what would you do as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district -- how would you evaluate that as a district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court judge? 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, the -- the -- the first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question I would do is I would ask the Hill test:  Is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there a reasonable probability that this defendant would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

not have pleaded guilty?  And if I thought the answer to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that question was no, then that's the end of the game.

test. 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that is the Hill test, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  It is. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  We've said that. 

  

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  Right.  And it's been in place 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, this is not your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  This is a test that's 

   

  

 

 

 

staring at me on page 59 of volume 474.

test. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's always --

  

 

 

 

27 

there's always a set of degrees.  I mean, whether or not 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

we talk about this rational person would have accepted, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how much of a defense and how viable is the defense? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Would 1 percent defense versus 20 percent defense, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

30 percent defense?  At some point the district court is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to draw a rationality line that they think is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable, correct? 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Correct.  And -- and it's a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

series of levers.  Every one of those factors --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if -- if there -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a defense that has a 1 percent chance, is that 

     

   

 

 

 

 

 

okay, versus one that has a 20 percent chance?  Or how 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do you even measure how rational a potential defense may 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be --

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, the --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- if the inquiry is how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

much do we know he would or would not have taken this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plea? 

            

MR. BURSCH:  We -- we think that is the Hill 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test, correct.  And I don't think anyone doubts, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

government or even the -- the district court judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubts, that had he known, he would have rejected it.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  But -- but --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

let's -- the question -- but the question that was --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- was put to you with reference to Strickland was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

in the context of what might happen at a trial with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different evidence, with different arguments.  We know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

how to do that.  Judges know how to do that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You're asking us how -- how to assess the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mindset of -- of the defendant when -- when he or she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes the plea.  That's very different. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, I -- I wouldn't say, 

   

   

  

 

 

because it's an objective test, not the mindset of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant, but the mindset of a defendant in this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular instance --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I understand 

   

   

  

 

you -- you call your test an objective test.  You --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you --

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I understand that. 

    

   

 

 

But the question is whether or not it isn't so distinct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from Strickland as to be unworkable. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  I don't think it's so distinct 

    

 

 

 

 

 

as to be unworkable.  In fact, I think, for the reasons 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan have articulated, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's actually much easier here.  Because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Justice Kagan pointed out 

  

 

 

 

 

29 

that the test that you're asking us to apply is the test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this Court says is applicable at the plea stage. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is there a reasonable probability, but for counsel's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

error, defendant would not have pleaded guilty, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have insisted on his right to trial? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's exactly what we 

  

 

 

 

 

said the standard is, and I think you're just asking us 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to adhere to that standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  I'm asking you to -- to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

re-adhere to that standard, but also to reaffirm the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland totality of the circumstances --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So -- so is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

this the mistake you say that Judge Batchelder made is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she said:  I will assume, at least, that your client 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have said I want to go to trial. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Question:  Would that have been a rational 

   

  

 

 

 

decision?  Some circuits say if there is overwhelming 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence of guilt, it's never a rational decision.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's what we say.  And you want us to say that's where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she was wrong. 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And so send it back with

could be, and my client's the guy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yeah.  And, Justice Breyer --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And so judges go back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court, do it over again, knowing that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overwhelming evidence is not always the end of the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

that's --

 

            

            

caveat. 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yeah.  Justice Breyer, 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right? 

  

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  -- that's perfect, with one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MR. BURSCH:  I would not send it back.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

think, given on these facts here, that you could --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We can't do that.  I mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

I don't see --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Oh, yeah, absolutely --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, the others, for 

    

 

 

 

 

myself, I don't see how we don't send it back.  I'm not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a trial judge.  I don't really know how trial defendants 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

react, and -- and a trial judge does know that much 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better than I. 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  I -- I think given these

probability he would have rejected it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think the district 

    

 

 

 

court said here that this defendant would have gone to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial. 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Absolutely.  That's --

  

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And what they said was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the absolute rule of this circuit is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- what led this 

  

 

 

 

 

district court judge to say I believe this person would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have gone to trial, but this rule doesn't permit me to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule in his favor. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  That's exactly right, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What happens if there's 

  

 

 

 

 

overwhelming evidence that this defendant, that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant in the case would have gone to trial if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant knew about the deportation consequences, 

 

 

 

 

 

overwhelming subjective evidence, statements before the 

 

 

 

 

 

plea was entered, but also, virtually no chance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquittal had the defendant gone to trial.  What happens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then? 

            

MR. BURSCH:  I think the defendant still 

    

 

 

 

 

gets to assert his constitutional right to trial and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't be deprived of that by ineffective lawyering.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there a possibility --

   

  

 

 

 

32 

MR. BURSCH:  If there are no further 

  

 

 

 

 

 

questions, I'll --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I mean, this is a 

    

 

 

 

 

possession-with-intent-to-distribute.  Suppose the 

  

 

defendant asks the judge, please charge the lesser 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense of possession. 

 

 

            

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And if the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defense -- the offense of possession does not carry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adverse deportation consequences.  So is it -- is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination whether to charge the lesser -- give the

plain possession -- is that in the -- in the discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the judge? 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, the -- the charges to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring are in the discretion of the prosecutor, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes not only to what charges are given to the jury, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also what pleas are possible.  And here --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if the prosecutor 

  

 

 

 

 

doesn't want to do possession, the -- the trial court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't do it?

Mr. Feigin. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The crux of a Padilla claim is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's contention that if he had constitutionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competent counsel, that counsel could have given him a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate chance at avoiding a removal with 

   

 

 

 

 

particular -- avoiding a conviction with particular 

   

 

 

 

 

removal consequences. 

 

              

A defendant can't prevail on that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim if there's nothing constitutionally competent 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel could have done to create that chance.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the case here where the lower courts found, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the words of the court of appeals, that Petitioner had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no bona fide defense, not even a weak one, and stood to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gain nothing from going to trial aside from a longer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison sentence, except for the off chance of jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nullification --

MR. FEIGIN:  -- or the like. 

  

 

 

 

 

34 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- you'll agree that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there are many possibilities where it would nonetheless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be rational for him to choose -- where -- where it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make sense for him to want a longer prison sentence, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  Let's say that there -- he has a serious medical 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

condition.  The medical care he's going to get at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Millington is better than what he's going to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wherever he's going.  He may get no medical care where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's being removed to. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

Isn't that rational for him to want to go to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial with the expectation that he'll get a longer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison sentence? 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, two points on that, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  First, when I think the Court is using the term 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"rational" here, and where it uses it in Padilla as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supplement to the "would the defendant go to trial" test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and says that the defendant has to convince the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it would be rational under the circumstances to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reject the plea, the Court is using the term "rational" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in its traditional legal sense.  When we talk about a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rational jury and the result a rational jury would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach, we're thinking of a jury that applies the law to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the facts and doesn't think about results like jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nullification or happenstance. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

As to your particular question about whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would be rational, I think in a more common sense 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

way, to want that, that might well be true, Mr. Chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

Justice, but that's not the kind of thing that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider to be prejudice for Sixth Amendment purposes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand Strickland. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under Strickland, in 

  

 

 

 

 

the typical Strickland case where you're talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the outcome of a trial, I understand that.  But we're 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

talking about something different here.  We're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about reasonable probability that he would or would not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have accepted the -- the plea agreement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  So, Your Honor, I'm not aware 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this Court ever accepting a claim that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's counsel was deficient because he didn't get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more prison time.  And I don't think that's the kind 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.  But I mean, 

   

  

  

 

 

you know, that's funny, but the -- the fact is this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation where he might well have elected to have more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison time because it would keep him in -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tennessee, close to his family, where he would be able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to visit his children, where he could even, as I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judge suggested, have some role in continuing to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to run the restaurant.

What is -- what is like life at FPC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

Millington?  I take it it's not Alcatraz, right? 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I'm not sure what level 

  

 

 

 

 

 

security is at that facility.  It is -- so I don't think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I could accurately answer your question, Mr. Chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

what is life like at a minimum security federal prison? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, the judge here recommended a particular facility 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

close to Tennessee.  I assume he -- he didn't seem to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to sort of throw the book at the -- the defendant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

right? 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think --

   

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's visitation, 

  

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  I think the premise that 

    

 

 

 

 

someone is entitled to counsel who will keep him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incarcerated in the United States is not only contrary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to anything the courts recognize under Strickland, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also contrary to our criminal immigration laws where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incarceration in the United States is the penalty for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reentry. 

              

I also the -- say -- would want to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear that there's nothing in the record to suggest that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this particular Petitioner, had he known that removal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was inevitable for conviction, would nevertheless have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

37 

opted for a conviction that would give him a longer 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

prison sentence. 

 

            

            

rest --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that might --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  What we were discussing is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about murder?  Suppose 

  

  

 

 

 

he thinks he's going to be murdered if he's sent abroad. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Same problem. 

 

            

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But, I mean, I -- the 

   

   

  

 

 

problem is that he -- which you can read Judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Batchelder's opinion.  I mean, it could be read, as he 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, that -- that if the evidence is overwhelming, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the end of the matter, and it wouldn't have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rational to -- to ask for a trial.  And now all we've 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done is think of situations where it might be.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he thinks he's going to be sent back to some country in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the world and it's going to end up he's dead, as is his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

family.  He'd rather be in jail. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Now, we're not supposed to take that into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account?  Why not? 

  

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

real disconnect between the claim the Petitioner is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bringing and the relief that he's seeking.  The reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he is subject to removal is not because of any

misadvice counsel made.  It's because a rational -- any 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

38 

rational jury, the lower courts found, applying the law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the facts, would have convicted him --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You see --

  

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  -- of dealing drugs --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that's confusing two 

  

 

 

 

 

things.  And this goes back to the point that the Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice made, is that you keep on saying what's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probability that the jury wouldn't have convicted him, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but that's not the question, and we made this clear in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hill and in other cases. 

 

 

 

 

            

The question is:  What's the -- what's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- what's the probability that the relevant proceeding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have been different?  And here the relevant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding is the plea negotiation and the plea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement.  And that's the thing that we're looking at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is did this deficient performance lead to a different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision by this -- by Mr. Lee to go to trial or not, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plea or not.  And that's all we're supposed to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at here, according to Hill. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, that has its difficulties, as 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito said.  What exactly do we look to?  How do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we draw lines?  There's no question that this is, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some cases, an uncomfortable inquiry.  But that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry we're supposed to be making, isn't it?  And you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

keep flipping it to a different inquiry, which is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

inquiry in a trial context, but not in a plea context. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  That's because, Justice Kagan, 

  

 

 

 

 

I -- I don't actually think that's purely the inquiry 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're supposed to be making here.  I don't think Hill or 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any other case in this Court's Strickland line values 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the right to go to trial --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry --

  

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  -- early in the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  This is what -- this is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hill says, Mr. Feigin.  It just says, here's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard:  The defendant must show that there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable probability that but for counsel's errors, he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to trial. 

 

 

            

That's what we're trying to determine, 

 

 

 

 

 

whether he would have insisted on going to trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, let me say a few things 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

about that.  First, right after that, Hill looks at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to go to trial through the lens of an attorney, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and whether the reasonable attorney, who's just looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the outcome of the trial, would have advised the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant to go to trial.  But also --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So to the contrary, when

Hill keeps on going, it says, you know, this -- this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant didn't care about his parole eligibility, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

we shouldn't -- we shouldn't look at the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the parole eligibility was a bad deal for him 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because he didn't care. 

 

 

 

            

So the emphasis clearly in Hill is -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what are the things that would have made a difference --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- in the plea negotiation? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, the particular 

  

 

 

 

 

defendant in Hill didn't even get to the objective part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the inquiry we're discussing today because he failed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the outset.  There wasn't even an allegation that he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subjectively would have selected a trial. 

   

 

 

 

            

But I also point the Court to Padilla where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it lays out the test from Hill and says, moreover, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant in these circumstances needs to convince the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court that it would be rational under the circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reject the plea. 

 

 

 

            

would be --

 

 

            

And finally, another good place to look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What Padilla is saying, 

  

 

 

 

 

isn't it, Mr. Feigin, is essentially, look, this is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be a case where somebody can just get up and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say this is what I would have done and the court has to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

accept it. 

 

            

No, Padilla says.  The court doesn't have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept every claim that a defendant makes.  A court can 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

41 

test those claims against a notion of rationality, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

against a notion of what reasonable people would do. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But still, the -- the essence of the inquiry is what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would -- what would have happened at the plea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negotiation, not what would have happened at the trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, with respect, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Kagan, I think, as the discussion when my friend was up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here demonstrated, I don't think a court can reasonably 

   

   

 

 

 

 

do that.  As the Chief Justice pointed out, there might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be somebody who hasn't been in the United States very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long and doesn't have the ties that this defendant has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who says, well, all my life I've been waiting to come to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States, and so it's perfectly rational for me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to roll the dice. 

 

 

 

            

The -- the last place I would look -- point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you to for the fact that trials are treated as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instrumental under Strickland, not as ends in and of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves, is the Court's most recent Strickland 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions in Cooper and Frye, which look to the outcome 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of what would have happened in the combined trial/plea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process, and in fact, find the defendant's election to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to trial was prejudicial where there was a plea offer

on the table before he went to trial that would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given him a better overall outcome. 

   

 

 

 

              

I think this makes a great deal of sense, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

42 

because if you're granting relief to defendants in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances where a rational jury would have convicted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

them had they gone to trial, you're giving them windfall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief that they couldn't reasonably have expected at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the windfall? 

  

 

 

 

You're entitled to a constitutional trial.  But putting 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that aside, you're not entitled to a plea.  You're not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to a lesser sentence.  You're entitled to go to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jail if you want to.  Isn't that what we said in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dominguez Benitez in a Rule 11 Strickland evaluation? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

We said that a court should, quote, "Not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

second guess a defendant's actual decision if it is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably probable he would have gone to trial absent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the error, it is no matter that the choice may have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foolish." 

            

Now, that's Strickland under Rule 11, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's the same inquiry.  Would he have pled guilty if he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had known this information?  And we explicitly said your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision can be foolish. 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, while 

  

 

 

 

 

Dominguez Benitez draws some analogies to Strickland,

it's a slightly different test. 

   

 

 

43 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not an analogy.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

talks about Strickland in the Rule 11 context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I think the Court made clear in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gonzalez-Lopez that the Sixth Amendment right to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective assistance of counsel actually includes the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice itself, which isn't true of the Rule 11 right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was issued in Dominguez Benitez.  Attorney errors 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and the kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error that amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is one that prejudiced the defense.  So you have to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So here we have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defense attorney who says:  I didn't know the law.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

told him he wouldn't be deported.  And if I had known 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law, I would have told him to go to trial. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So this is both 

  

 

 

 

 

prejudice in the advice and prejudice in the decision to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go -- move forward. 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, I think you have to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

also --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or not move forward. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I think you have to also look 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there was prejudice in the outcome.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually think this is clear, if we -- if you'll bear

with me for a second, if you think about an example that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

comes straight from Hill. 

 

 

 

            

So let's take a defendant where there is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

overwhelming evidence that he committed, say, a bank 

   

 

 

 

 

 

robbery:  Forensic evidence, video evidence, what have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you.  And that defendant's complaint is that his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney didn't adequately investigate.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

attorney did nothing to investigate.  He just said, why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't you plead guilty. 

 

 

 

            

And it turns out, had the attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigated, he would have come up with 20 character 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses, all of whom would have testified this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

great guy and he just needed money because one of his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children was sick.  And let's say the defendant, because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he has a sick child, would have done anything to avoid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison time. 

 

            

Under the analysis that goes from page 59 to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 60 in Hill, that defendant, even if we subjectively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believed him that he would have selected trial, is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to Strickland relief if his only chance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevailing at trial was jury nullification or some off 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance of some external circumstance handicapping the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's case. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So step back a second.  And 

   

  

  

 

 

 

I agree with you.  I can't find total clarity in -- in

these decisions.  And it seemed to me that if we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making the separation, as they made, between what you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look to, to show prejudice in a plea agreement and at a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial, both Strickland errors, it must be that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional consideration of not really wanting a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person to feel he has to give up his right to a jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial, that influences the standard.  And if it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influence the standard, I have a harder time deciding 

   

   

 

 

 

 

the cases. 

 

            

So, really, I think what we're deciding here 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is to what extent it influences the standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and -- and you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you see how I'm thinking that? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because there's a kind of 

   

  

 

 

 

just look to the plea, just look to the plea.  Don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give a damn about what happens at trial.  Well, we can't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get that extreme.  So we say, well, we'll look just at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the plea.  But if it's just overwhelming, then we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to say we're looking to the trial, too.  Okay. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If I'm right as to what these cases mean, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then we are in a world where 95 percent of the people 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and what happens to them depend upon pleas, not upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trials.  And doesn't that argue for "look to that plea"

part of the thing?  Don't worry so much about whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he'd been convicted at trial.  In other words, we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about very small degrees here.  But that factor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to me to -- to push in the direction of, if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really think he would have gone to trial, that should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the end of it, even if he's pretty irrational. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I don't think 

   

  

 

 

 

that's a good reason for under -- for unwinding reliable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admissions of guilt when we have a kind of outlier case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like this one where the lower courts were certain that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he would have been convicted at trial unless jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nullification or some other happenstance occurred. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is the answer to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lesser-included offense?  Was that -- is that out of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picture? 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  That is also out of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

picture, Your Honor. 

 

 

            

So if I could just briefly recount the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

evidence here.  On a search of his residence, they found 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

88 Ectasy pills, over $32,000 in cash, and a loaded 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rifle.  Immediately after the search, he admitted to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police, after being given Miranda warnings, that he --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yeah, I know what the --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- what the facts are. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

But isn't it sometimes a prosecutor might say, I have a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

solid case, the evidence is overwhelming, but this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nice young man and the jury might be sympathetic, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather than risk nullification, if you call it that, why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not give the jury an opportunity to convict him on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lesser, so at least there will be a conviction? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, there might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be cases where a prosecutor might say that, but the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question here is whether Petitioner has a constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

entitlement through the lens of ineffective assistance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of counsel to try to seek that kind of result.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, there is absolutely no evidence that the trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor was --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wait a minute. 

   

  

 

MR. FEIGIN:  -- inclined to --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He has a constitutional 

   

  

 

 

right to effective counsel. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FEIGIN:  And I think that --

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And if he has that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right, aren't we depriving him of that right and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to a trial, both of them guaranteed by the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution -- as I keep saying, a plea is not -- to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have his attorney try everything that is legally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permissible to try?  None of these attempts -- and your

ways for him to have achieved a nondeportation plea as a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility.  Doesn't he have a right to have someone 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

try that for him? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  No, Your Honor, not where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

48 

there's no evidence that there's any -- there was any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility of a better plea.  The government doesn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

have any general practice or policy of --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- Mr. Feigin.  I think --

    

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  Huh? 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You don't mean that.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

think -- because I think what you just said was that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no constitutional right to go to trial when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no evidence? 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Oh, Your Honor, I was answering 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the question about the plea.  I'm -- if I could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer --

 

            

            

trial. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Of course --

  

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  -- the question about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- there's a constitutional 

   

  

 

 

right to go to trial, isn't there? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FEIGIN:  There is, Your Honor, but --

there's very weak evidence on your side. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  There is, Your Honor, but I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think we protect that ex ante much more than --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

            

            

why. 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well --

  

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  -- post, and let me explain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, let me just --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- finish the question. 

  

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, you would agree that there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional right to go to trial, regardless of what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the --

 

            

Kagan, yes. 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I think I'd have to, Justice 

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- regardless of what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

state of the evidence was; right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FEIGIN:  That's absolutely correct. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Which is the question that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor asked you.  And she said, and why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't this correct? 

 

 

            

So then the question is, has there been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deficient performance?  And a person's entitlement to go 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to trial and entitlement to stare at all the various 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probabilities and to make an informed choice, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitlement has been taken away by the supremely

deficient performance.  And that should be the question. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  So, Your Honor, I think there's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

50 

several reasons why we would -- we value the right to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to trial ex ante and not necessarily in the Strickland 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, whereas I've suggested I think it's much more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome-focused. 

            

The first is that the touchstone of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland is fundamental fairness.  And we don't -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think both Strickland and Hill exclude the possibility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of jury nullification or happenstance precisely because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we don't think anything unfair has happened to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant because he's been denied the possibility --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Strickland is a very 

   

  

 

 

different case in that -- in that way.  Because what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland says is once you're at a trial, you're right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is to a fair and accurate trial.  And nullification has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing to do with a fair and accurate trial. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But this is before.  This is when you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to decide whether to exercise that right to go to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial.  And there, what you're entitled to is that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer be able to give you, in a nondeficient way, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various circumstances, the various things that you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider to enable you to make that constitutional --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally protected decision in a reasonable way. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, we protect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the right to go to trial ex ante very closely and allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

a defendant to select that result, even when it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foolish.  But the difference when you're looking at it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ex post is that you're asking a judge to both evaluate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and endorse the idea that someone would seek these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extra-legal results, like jury nullification or simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hoping that overwhelming evidence of guilt falls apart, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a reason for unwinding a reliable admission of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

guilt --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, all you're asking the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

judge to do is to say that in certain circumstances, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not beyond the bounds of reasonableness to throw the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dice in order to get an outcome -- in order to get -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order not to be deported from a country where you've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lived your whole life. 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the bounds of reasonableness rationality test is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly workable standard.  And I think in cases 

   

  

 

 

 

 

like this, it's just going to lead these --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Feigin, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

we're talking about cases like this, the circuits are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

split.  The vast majority of them do the reasonable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probability test and don't seem to have the problems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're talking about.

MR. FEIGIN:  I don't, Your Honor, but I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's not a whole --

   

  

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  I --

    

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I mean, there's not 

    

   

 

 

 

a whole lot of them. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I --

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's a handful of 

   

  

 

 

them.  The vast majority, the motion for relief are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied by the lower courts, not on the Sixth Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule, but on the totality of the circumstances.  It --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't appear as if we're overwhelmed with these. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I can't give 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you a precise number, but if you search for cases in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal and State courts in which, you know, Padilla is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited more than five times, you get about 1500 results. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I think that shows these claims are being brought 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairly frequently. 

 

            

think --

granted. 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Because defendant --

  

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  It means that any time -- I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53 

sorry, Justice Alito. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I -- finish your 

   

  

 

 

 

sentence.  I'm sorry. 

  

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  It means that any time a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant can subjectively state that he would have gone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to trial and the trial judge finds it credible, which I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think you could under pretty much any set of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, the Chief Justice pointed out -- I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry, the sentence is getting a little run on, Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alito. 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, no, that's fine. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  Then the -- then that defendant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be entitled to relief and will have a new trial, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even though that defendant, when he actually faced the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice as to whether he should enter the plea and was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balancing that against a trial, didn't have any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate chance of prevailing at a trial. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I --

    

   

 

MR. FEIGIN:  His chances were jury 

  

 

 

 

 

nullification --

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I understand the 

    

   

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

54 

argument that the test should be purely subjective. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What would this defendant have done?  There's language 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Hill that supports that.  The language that says is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it rational under the circumstances is contrary to that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as I read it, because rationality is not a matter of --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not a subjective thing.  It's objective. 

   

  

 

 

 

            

But let's say it is a purely subjective 

   

 

 

 

 

 

question.  Then I think it's a question of historical 

   

   

  

 

 

 

fact.  So you have to have a finding of fact by 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody, presumably the judge, in the 2255, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be reviewed for clear error.  Would that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't that follow? 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

you -- are you proposing a test where you just find the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact --

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I'm not proposing that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

test, but I'm -- I'm suggesting that that is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence of our saying that the test is purely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subjective.  We can't decide that this defendant would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have, as a matter of fact, gone to trial had he been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly advised.  That's a -- that's a factual 

   

   

  

 

 

question, purely historic fact.  It would have to go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to a judge to make a finding of fact on that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  You mean in this case?

JUSTICE ALITO:  In this case or in any case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  I think you could ask judges to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

make those sorts of -- of factual findings.  But I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one problem that Justice Kennedy brought up earlier is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

there's a problem there of hindsight bias, and in some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, I'm not suggesting that that's true in this case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a defendant telling things that aren't true in order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain collateral relief and having an objective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backstop where we make sure that we don't give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants a chance in postconviction review that they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

didn't originally have. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Feigin --

  

 

 

 

Mr. Feigin, routinely papers come in from a Petitioner 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

who says, my lawyer didn't do X.  Most commonly, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer comes in and says I did do X.  And most commonly, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court says the lawyer told me I did X, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the pea -- plea colloquy I asked that question and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant said yes, I understood that consequence, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and the court doesn't have a hearing. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

A ruling in our case wouldn't change those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases. 

            

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It wouldn't change the 

  

 

 

 

 

cases where the defendant comes in and says I would have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pled guilty, but the lawyer comes in and says he

insisted he was innocent.  I kept telling him the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence was overwhelming, that he should take the plea, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but he kept telling me I'm innocent.  It doesn't require 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

a hearing for a judge to say that defendant would not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have pled guilty because he was claiming his innocence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those cases wouldn't change either. 

 

 

 

 

            

Those are a good majority of the cases that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

come before district and circuit courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  So, Your Honor, what we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

talking about here is a set of cases where, as the lower 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts founds here, the only chance the defendant had at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial was jury nullification or, frankly, some stroke of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

luck that would collapse the government's case somehow. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And in that set of cases, it does not make sense to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant a defendant windfall relief that gives him an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity he could never have reasonably expected at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the outset. 

 

              

I think the --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I still go back 

   

  

 

 

 

to -- to my earlier point, which is the difference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between nine years and five and ten years is very big. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For nine months and sure banishment?  What's so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrational about going to trial? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, as I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

suggested earlier in my colloquy with the Chief Justice,

I think rationality here has its traditional legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57 

meaning, meaning looking at it through an objectively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable len -- a lens of objective reasonableness. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

And I think that makes great sense here because if that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were not the case, then I think Padilla's promise that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ruling would not really be opening Pandora's box, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but would instead be cabined by the requirement --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do we do -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do we do with all those defendants who reject pleas with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full knowledge and say a rational person must have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted -- should have taken this case.  And so you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should vacate because I didn't take my plea.  Don't look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all the facts and circumstances.  Don't look at any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the arguments because it's only a rationality test. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, we're not saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's only a rationality test here.  First of all, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- there's a threshold inquiry -- and this is where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant in Hill failed -- there's a threshold 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry that this defendant has to say I would have done 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something differently if my lawyer had given me better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advice, constitutionally competent advice.  And then, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that is what the -- then if we believe that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant is credible in saying that, we then go on to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the objective portion of the inquiry, which is the --

the -- just in your words, objective reasonableness, why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58 

can't a judge find as to a defendant that it is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectively reasonable to give up six or eight or nine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months for a shot at staying in this country rather than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being deported to a place that you don't know and where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have no ties?  I mean, you know, if somebody gave me 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that choice, sign me up. 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think of myself as an objectively 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable human being. 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

objective reasonableness means here -- again, I come 

   

 

 

 

 

 

back to the way the Court uses the term rational that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used in Padilla and the way it uses it to describe, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, a rational jury, is the application of the law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the facts and what outcome we would have reached 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there.  And I'm not sure --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's an objectively 

  

 

 

 

reasonable assessment, it's an -- it -- it would be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectively reasonable choice to exercise my right to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury trial in that context.  And that's the question, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's objectively reasonable to make a decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

different from the decision that I would have made in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this proceeding, which is the plea negotiation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  So, Your Honor, if you look at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the inquiry that way, I don't think it's acting as any

sort of meaningful check at all, because you could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59 

always make the argument that, yeah, I would have risked 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two more years, yes, I would have risked five more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years, and I don't know how a court can come in and say, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know what, that's not objectively reasonable. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the court can do it in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way that the Court has done it since 1985 when we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said that this was the inquiry under Hill.  This is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts have been doing since -- for the last 30 years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

circuit conflict that we have here shows that that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what all courts have been doing.  Another point --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's what many courts have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been doing for three decades. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I'm not saying -- I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that a court can't try to do that.  I'm saying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we -- it's very difficult to achieve reliable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results. 

            

So Petitioner has an example on page 6 of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

his reply brief of circumstances where a defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have very many ties to the United States and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just got here, and Petitioner asserts well, in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, he couldn't possibly have shown that he would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selected a trial.  But I don't think that's true.  A 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

defendant could get up on the stand and say all my life,

as the Chief Justice suggested earlier, I've wanted to

60 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This -- this is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

little -- little bit different question --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- but assume a petitioner 

   

  

 

 

 

prevails and there can be no trial because the evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is stale or something.  Can the INS still proceed to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deport this person?  Does it need a conviction given --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

given his admission at -- at the earlier plea? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Right now, there is a final 

   

  

 

 

 

 

order of removal, but that final order of removal is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on his conviction for aggravated felony. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My question is, can you do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it without the -- without the conviction? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Without the conviction for an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated felony, there would be no basis for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal.  He would be a lawful --

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There has to be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

conviction --

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  It -- to -- to make sure I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving you a complete answer, Justice Kennedy --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Sure. 

  

 

MR. FEIGIN:  -- he would need to seek some

United States. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, he would get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

61 

that, right, if the basis for the removal order was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction that's been overturned? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  He should be able -- he should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be able to seek reopening.  If for some reason the case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not reopened, he could seek judicial review of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non-reopening.  So he has various avenues in which to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could the government still 

  

 

 

 

 

make the -- the case that even though the conviction has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been set aside, it has adequate proof and it wants to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present proof of the violation in the -- in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deportation hearings? 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I don't believe it would do 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that just because it has evidence that wouldn't be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient to convict.  I don't think that's necessarily 

    

 

 

 

 

 

going to make him removable here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think if -- if a defendant's conviction 

   

   

 

 

 

 

were vacated, he -- he would not be removed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do prosecutors ever advise 

  

 

 

 

 

the court in open court that this is a deportable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense? 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I don't know whether they do 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that.  Under the new version of Federal Rule 11, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

court is required to --

 

 

 

 

62 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I know the court asked. 

    

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  The court is required to ask 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and to advise. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does counsel -- does --

  

 

 

 

 

 

does the prosecution ever comment in response to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question?  It's a colloquy between the defendant and --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and does the counsel ever --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I --

    

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- prosecutor ever 

  

 

 

 

interrupt or intervene? 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I think it's unlikely that the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor would interrupt a colloquy between the court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and the defendant in a Rule 11 context. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right. 

  

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I think prosecutors, of course, 

    

 

 

 

 

have their ethical duties, and if they see some mistake 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is being made, I'm sure they would speak up.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court is always entitled to ask the prosecutor if they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a view. 

   

            

Thank you. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Two quick things. 

 

 

63 

            

First, I don't want to lose the point that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor raised, that this isn't just keep this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plea or go to trial.  There's also the opportunity to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negotiate other plea alternatives.  And we give a couple 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of those in our reply brief, including one where there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a defendant with two-and-a-half kilograms of meth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

who was able to get a plea conviction with lessened 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deportation consequences. 

 

            

And my friend says there's no evidence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could happen here.  Well, that's because the government, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on the Sixth Circuit categorical rule, has refused 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to negotiate throughout the process. 

 

 

 

 

            

If you look at what happened at that plea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

colloquy again, even the government believed that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Lee was going to remain in the country.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact that he was willing to serve seven years here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead of just his one voluntarily rather than be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deported is strong evidence that there could have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some other arrangement, a meeting in the middle. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second thing about Cooper and Frye, my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend mentioned that in that case, you did look at what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would likely happen at trial.  Well, we don't disagree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that approach.  Under our approach, just like in

Strickland, you look at all the circumstances.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth Circuit's mistake here, Justice Breyer, is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they focused just on one circumstance, not the rest. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  This is what they say.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

says at the end there that it's alongside -- I mean, she 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says:  Alongside -- we adjoin the second to the -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a claimant's ties to the United States should be taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into account in evaluating alongside the legal merits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  She says that because that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the test.  But then what she says on page 4A of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix, in Pilla -- again, the -- the prior Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit precedent they're bound by:  We held that no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rational defendant charged with a deportable offense and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

facing overwhelming evidence of guilt would proceed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial rather than take a plea deal.  That's the problem. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So that the final thing, I think Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan nails this on the head when she says the test has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be did deficient performance lead to a different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision?  That was the -- the standard you articulated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Hill.  It's been on the books for 32 years.  Justice 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alito, I understand completely how district courts might 

   

 

 

 

 

 

struggle with that in tough cases, but they've been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing that successfully. 

 

 

            

And to the extent that there's any doubt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about whether that should be the test, Justice Breyer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

you're exactly right.  It's that consideration of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to jury trial that's being given up, the gold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard in our judicial process. 

 

 

 

 

65 

            

So we ask that you reverse the Sixth Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and hold that Mr. Lee can withdraw his plea. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank you. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
