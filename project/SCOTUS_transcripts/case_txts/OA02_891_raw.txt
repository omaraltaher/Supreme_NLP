 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Thank  you, Mr.  Chief Justice, 

10  and may it please the Court: 

11

 This is an  ERISA pension case.  The petitioner 

12  is  a  multiemployer  pension  plan. 

The  respondent 

13  plaintiffs  are  two plan  participants.  Each  accrued a 

14  pension  and took  early retirement  at age  39, and  each 

15  claimed a full pension in the form of a life annuity. 

16

 At issue  in the case is  a plan amendment.  It 

17  authorizes the  suspension of  retirees' benefit  payments 

18  during the time  that they  choose to go  back to work  as 

19  construction  supervisors. 

Before  the  amendment, 

20  suspension was triggered  only by  work as a  construction 

21  laborer. 

22

 The change  gives rise  to an  important, albeit 

23  highly technical, question about the relationship  between 

24  two provisions  of ERISA.  The  question is:  may  such an 

25  amended  employment  suspension  provision  apply  to 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

3 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  previously accrued benefits?  The plan says  the answer is 

2  yes; the participants say the answer is no. 

3

 The  expert  agencies charged  by  Congress with 

4  administering ERISA  have  also spoken  to  the  question. 

5  They say that ERISA does  authorize such an amendment, and 

6  they reached that  conclusion by construing the  two ERISA 

7  provisions in para materia. 

8

 Countless pension  plans around  the Nation,  in 

9  turn, have  relied on  the agencies'  guidance in  shaping 

10  their  plan  amendments  for  decades,  and  that  is  the 

11  principal reason that the case is so important. 

12

 QUESTION:  In  the -- in the  guidance that  is 

13  given,  does  the 

--  

has  the  IRS  actually  passed  on 

14  particular amendments? 

15

16

17

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It has,  not in formal guidance. 

 The process is that you can -­

 QUESTION:  How does it do it? 

 MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  There -- there are a couple of 

19  layers  of  it. 

The first  is  that  the  IRS publishes 

20  guidance ahead  of time.  For  about 2 decades,  there has 

21  been  something  called  the  LRM,  the List  of  Required 

22  Modifications.  It's  quoted in 

--  

it's quoted  in  the 

23  Government's brief in particular.  And that said to plans, 

24  if you're going  to adopt a plan or revise  a plan, here's 

25  what you can do.

1

2

 QUESTION:  Is this in the manual? 

 MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Then  there's  a second.  The 

3  second  step  is that  more  recently they  have published 

4  what's known as  to IRM, the Internal Revenue  Manual, and 

5  that's guidance for IRS employees. 

6

 And  then  there's a  third  level, and  that is 

7  plans can submit  their plan provisions and  amendments to 

8  the IRS  for what are  known as  determination letters  on 

9  which the IRS signs off.  And so all three of those exist. 

10

 QUESTION:  Do we -- do we have any indication of 

11  how many determination letters have been issued? 

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We don't.  I don't think  that 

13  the IRS was able to come  up with a particular number, but 

14  they did say  that their  consistent practice for  decades 

15  has been to approve this particular -­

16

 QUESTION:  Is there anything to  document that, 

17  that it's been for decades?  I mean, the manual provisions 

18  and the rest of -- of what you're describing is not -- not 

19  published.  So where do we get the 2 decades from? 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We  get that from, I guess,  two 

21  sources.  The  first is that there is the  document -- the 

22 

--  

the series of documents known  as the LRM, the List of 

23  Required Modifications, that  has guided  the plans for  a 

24  couple of decades, and it  does not restrain plans in  its 

25 

--  

it  specifically  addresses  revisions  to  plans, 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

5 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  amendments, and  it doesn't say that you can only apply it 

2  a suspension provision to benefit  payments that accrue in 

3  the future.  Beyond that, when it comes to, you know, what 

4  the  IRS does  day in  and  day out,  we  just have  their 

5  representation. 

6

 QUESTION:  Well, do you -- does -- does the list 

7  specifically say that the amendments  can -- can relate -­

8  can,  in  fact, relate  to  or  in  law  relate  to  prior 

9  accrued -­

10

11

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, it doesn't.  There --

 QUESTION:  So, it leaves that question open. 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It -- it -- literally in  its 

13  text it  does,  but  as  a  practical  matter  it  doesn't 

14  because, as  I was saying  to Justice Ginsburg,  the LRM's 

15  have addressed revisions  to plans and to  amendments, and 

16  they haven't restrained in any way the ability to apply it 

17  to previous -­

18

 QUESTION: 

But  that's  a  pretty  negative 

19  inference, isn't it? 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It's true,  but the -- the way 

21  these documents work,  as I  understand them,  is that  if 

22  there's a restriction, something you can't do, they say it 

23  expressly.  When  you -- remember, the  default rule under 

24  ERISA, of course, is that you  are allowed to adopt a plan 

25  amendment,  and  then  the 

--  

they 

--  

they  articulate 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

6 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  particular restrictions -­

2

 QUESTION:  So I -- I think it's pretty explicit 

3  when it says  that the  accrued benefit  of a  participant 

4  under a plan may not be  decreased by an amendment of  the 

5  plan. 

6

 And I don't -- the trouble I'm having is it just 

7  seems to  me utterly unrealistic  to say that  his accrued 

8  benefit has not been decreased when he used  to be able to 

9  work  as a -- as  a supervisor and  continued to draw from 

10  the plan.  Now he cannot work  as a supervisor.  How can 

11  you  -- I mean, certainly if  you placed a dollar value on 

12  his right to receive money from the plan, you would -- you 

13  would put  a higher price on  -- on the -- the individual 

14  who  has  the right  to  work as  a  supervisor and  still 

15  continue  to draw  money  as  opposed  to the  person  who 

16  doesn't have that right.  I mean, the -- the language just 

17  seems to me utterly plain. 

18

 MR.  GOLDSTEIN: 

The 

--  

Justice Scalia,  the 

19  reason that the  IRS has  reached the opposite  conclusion 

20  for  decades is threefold,  and I  will focus on  the text 

21  because that's where you focus.  But just to lay them out, 

22  it's going  to be the text, the purposes of the suspension 

23  provision, which  is section  203(a)(3)(B), and  what will 

24  best  protect  participants'  expectations. 

You  focus 

25  rightly on the text. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

 The -- the key is what is a benefit versus what 

2  is a  suspension of benefit  payments.  As I said  in the 

3  introduction, the plan participants here  earned a benefit 

4  and that is a life annuity in a service only pension.  So 

5  they were  able  to retire  and they  got  a life  annuity 

6  that's available to them. 

7

 QUESTION:  It's the  dollar amount that  they're 

8  entitled to which is the benefit. 

9

10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is --

 QUESTION:  But that means you can say, well, you 

11  know, they're still  entitled to  that dollar amount,  but 

12  they can only get it every other year. 

13

14

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That would be prohibited. 

 QUESTION:  Would that limitation be okay? 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, it wouldn't because it would 

16  violate the vesting rules. 

17

 Let me continue.  There are two parts  in ERISA, 

18  and this is set  out in your Alessi opinion in  1981.  You 

19  have to accrue a benefit and then you vest in the benefit. 

20  The  accrual is  when  you've earned  the  benefit.  They 

21  earned the benefit.  They earned their pension.  Then they 

22  had to vest in it; that is, though they've earned it, they 

23  have what Alessi  calls a  non-forfeitable right to  claim 

24  it.  And what  a suspension  provision does it  says your 

25  benefit still  exists.  Their  benefit is a  life annuity. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

8 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  It exists. 

There is  an available  stream of  payments. 

2  There's  a  stream  of payments  that  is  available every 

3  single month.  That's the accrual rule. 

4

 Then you have to vest.  You have to have a right 

5  to claim it, and that's what a suspension provision does. 

6

 QUESTION:  It's  not you that  vests.  It's  the 

7  pension that vests, isn't it? 

8

 MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  It  is your  claim to  it that 

9  vests,  Mr.  Chief  Justice.  If  I  could  give  you the 

10  language -­

11

 QUESTION:  Well,  I was  just questioning  your 

12  choice of words. 

13

 MR.  GOLDSTEIN: 

I  apologize. 

What  I  had 

14  intended to say  is that your claim to it vests.  There is 

15  a benefit  out there, this life annuity.  And the question 

16  is:  do you have the right to  claim it in any particular 

17  month?  That's the structure of section 203 versus section 

18  204. 

19

 And what a suspension provision  does -- and let 

20  me just  pause to say  the court of  appeals acknowledged, 

21  the plaintiffs  acknowledged, that  when we suspend  their 

22  benefit  payments, we  are not  decreasing their  benefit. 

23  What we're doing is that  they have sacrificed their claim 

24  to a  particular benefit in any  given month.  That's why 

25  Congress  used  the  different  language,  suspension  of 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

9 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  benefit  payments  versus  the  actual  decrease  in  the 

2  benefit. 

3

 QUESTION:  Well, they concede  that with respect 

4  to the -- the decreases that were a term of the  plan when 

5  it accrued to them. 

6

7

8  they? 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, they conceded -­

 QUESTION:  They don't concede anything more, do 

9

 MR.  GOLDSTEIN: 

No, but  the  concession  is, 

10  nonetheless -­

11

12

 QUESTION:  Well, that's no concession. 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, it  is we think,  Justice 

13  Souter.  Here's why.  What  I think  Justice Scalia  was 

14  focusing on -- and I may  be mistaken -- is that,  look, 

15  when you  withhold that benefit payment, sort of give me a 

16  break.  They're not getting  the money.  You're decreasing 

17  their benefit.  And in  the terminology of ERISA, that  is 

18  actually not correct. 

19

 QUESTION:  No.  That wasn't my point at all.  My 

20  -- my point,  which I took a  long time to make,  was that 

21  the value of your right to  money, even though you work as 

22  a  supervisor, is greater  than your right  to money which 

23  terminates as soon as you  begin to work as a  supervisor. 

24  It's a less valuable benefit. 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Fair enough. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 QUESTION: 

And  that comes  right  within  the 

2  language.  The accrued benefit may not be decreased by an 

3  amendment. 

4

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And  here is why  it does  not. 

5  The real-world value,  the sense that, look,  this is more 

6  desirable.  I would rather have  a benefit that  has less 

7  suspension  provisions  than  one  that  has  more. 

For 

8  example, hey, it's more likely I'm going to get the money. 

9  That  is not a benefit  within the meaning  of ERISA.  The 

10  benefit  is the life annuity.  It's a -- this is -- the -­

11  ERISA  is,  of  course, as  you've  often  said,  a highly 

12  reticulated statute.  There are 3,978 pages of regulations 

13  implementing it in about 6-point  font.  The terms of  art 

14  are highly, highly technical, and  the benefit is the life 

15  annuity.  It's not  just the sense  that I like  it more. 

16  And I can give you an example. 

17

 Section  203(c)  of  ERISA 

--  

and,  Mr.  Chief 

18  Justice, that  is reproduced in the yellow brief.  I don't 

19  think it will be necessary for the Court  to track it, but 

20  it is at  the bottom of 4a  and 5a.  This  is a -- of the 

21  yellow brief.  And this  is a provision under which  plans 

22  are authorized to change their vesting schedules.  And so, 

23  take an example. 

24

 There are  two ways  you can  vest under  ERISA. 

25  One  if over the  course of  7 years in  individual steps. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  Another is so-called  cliff vesting,  and that is,  you've 

2  got your benefit.  You've earned it, but until you've been 

3  in service for 5 years, you don't have any legal  claim to 

4  it  notwithstanding  that  it's out  there. 

Plans under 

5  section 203(c) are  allowed to change their  vesting rules 

6  so that if someone had  earned 2 years of vesting  credit, 

7  the  plan  can,  nonetheless,  change  to a  5-year  cliff 

8  vesting provision.  Now, that's  all very complicated, but 

9  the bottom line is  that it makes it less  valuable in the 

10  real-world sense for the plan participants. 

11

 QUESTION:  Yes, but  that -- that speaks to  the 

12  future effect  of such an amendment, and it -- when you're 

13  talking  about  getting  vesting,  you  can't  have  a 

14  retroactive -- you would not already be vested.  Does that 

15  mean  that if  somebody vested after  2 years,  they could 

16  then adopt an amendment saying henceforth it's got to be 5 

17  years and that applies to somebody who is already vested? 

18

19

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Unquestionably, yes. 

 QUESTION:  Does it really. 

 MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Absolutely, yes, without any -­

21  any doubt whatsoever. 

22

23

 QUESTION:  And what is the authority for that? 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is section 203(c).  Section 

24  203(c) explains  that if  you have  less than  3 years  of 

25  service, you  are not allowed to  object to the  change in 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

12 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  vesting conditions.  There are rules under  ERISA that say 

2  that  even though  you've vested,  you can, in  effect, be 

3  divested.  That's why it is  a very strange  structure of 

4  the -­

5

 QUESTION:  Well, they -- they wouldn't need that 

6  provision if the principle of law that you're urging  upon 

7  us existed.  I mean, the -- the whole reason, it  seems to 

8  me,  that  they had  to  make that  clear  in a  statutory 

9  provision  is  that  without it,  you  would  obviously be 

10  decreasing  the  value  of  the  plan  and  violating  the 

11  provision of whatever it is, 1054(g)(1). 

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.  That's why this is in 1053. 

13  There are two  sets of restrictions.  That  provision that 

14  I've just been describing would  not -- and I don't  think 

15  there's anybody who  really contends  it would -- violate 

16  1054, what we've been calling 204.  It would violate 1053. 

17  You have -­

18

19

 QUESTION:  Which -- which part of 1053? 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It would  violate the beginning 

20  of 1053, Mr. Chief Justice.  Let me take you  to 1a of the 

21  yellow brief, and  the paragraphs involved  would be 1 

--

22  excuse me 

--  

1053(a)(2)(A)  and  (B). 

Those  are  the 

23  places -­

24

25

 QUESTION:  Okay.  Read them please. 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes,  Mr. Chief  Justice.  The 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

13 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  beginning of (2) says, except as provided  in paragraph 4, 

2  which is not  relevant, a plan satisfies  the requirements 

3  of  this  paragraph if  it  satisfies the  requirements of 

4  subparagraphs  (A) or (B).  And subparagraphs  (A) or (B) 

5  which I'll read, give you that 5-year cliff vesting option 

6  or instead over  the course of 7 years.  A plan satisfies 

7  the requirements of  this subparagraph if an  employee who 

8  has  completed  at  least  5  years  service  has  a  non­

9  forfeitable right to 100 percent of the employee's accrued 

10  benefit derived from employer contributions.  And then (B) 

11  is the other option, the 7 years. 

12

 Now, I have  spoken and I've tried  to emphasize 

13  the difference  between a  benefit and  the suspension  of 

14  benefit payments,  but it is  also important to  deal with 

15  the two other reasons that the Government -­

16

 QUESTION:  Let me just be sure I understand that 

17  argument again, Mr. Goldstein.  This says you,  in effect, 

18  can retroactively require  a longer vesting period.  That 

19  would mean require a longer period before  you acquired an 

20  accrued benefit. 

21

22

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No. 

 QUESTION:  That was 20 -- isn't that right? 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, Justice  Stevens.  You would 

24  acquire the accrued benefit under 1054 as it accrued  over 

25  time.  What you would not do is vest in that benefit, your 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  right to the benefit is not present. 

2

 QUESTION: 

So  accrued -- the  term,  accrued 

3  benefits, applies to benefits that have not yet vested. 

4

5

6

7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's exactly right. 

 QUESTION:  I see. 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  Let me just step back. 

 QUESTION:  I'm not sure  that -- I'm not sure  I 

8  understand that, but anyway, go ahead. 

9

 MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize.  Let me just step 

10  back and explain  it then.  There are two  things that you 

11  have to  do in order  to be able  to collect  your benefit 

12  under ERISA.  It has to accrue.  You have to earn it under 

13  1054. 

14

15

 QUESTION:  Right. 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And you also have to vest in it 

16  under 1053. 

17

 Justice  Scalia, 

you 

had  intimated 

a 

18  hypothetical.  Well, look,  couldn't the  plan just  say, 

19  hey, we're  suspending your benefit  payments and wouldn't 

20  that violate  1054 because you  lessened the value  of the 

21  benefit.  The answer to that question is no.  You couldn't 

22  do it,  but -- because it  would violate  1053.  Someone 

23  would  have  vested  in  the  benefit  and  you  would  be 

24  divesting them of it. 

25

 Let me  also take you  -- because we  do contend

 QUESTION:  Vesting means -­

 QUESTION:  You're going pretty fast for me. 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sorry. 

 QUESTION:  Could  I just make sure  I understand 

6  one thing? 

7

8

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  You're saying  that a  delay in  the 

9  period  between the  time a  benefit accrues  and  when it 

10  vests is  not  covered by  204(g), but  a  reduction of  a 

11  benefit that  has already both accrued and vested is -- is 

12  not covered by it or is -- you're saying they're the same. 

13  That's what you're saying -­

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Let me -­

 QUESTION:  -- for purposes of --

 QUESTION:  Answer the question. 

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No is the -- is the short answer 

19  and  here's the longer  answer.  You cannot  decrease the 

20  benefit even if it has not yet vested.  Let's be perfectly 

21  clear.  If I -- they have a life annuity and I were to say 

22  instead of paying you $1,650 a month, I'm going to pay you 

23  $1,400 a  month, notwithstanding that they  haven't vested 

24  in it, it still violates the accrual rule. 

25

 But  when  you  come  to  the  question  of  the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

16 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  suspension of benefit payments,  which throughout ERISA is 

2  a different  concept than a decrease in benefits, when you 

3  come to a suspension -- that is, your -- your claim to the 

4  benefit  payment each month  -- I'm taking  that away from 

5  you -- that's covered by 1053.  And our point is that this 

6  plan  amendment  is -- and  the Government  agrees  -- is 

7  authorized by 1053. 

8

 I had  said that I was  also going to  go beyond 

9  the -- move from the  text to the purposes underlying  the 

10  statute  and the  protection  of participants'  legitimate 

11  expectations. 

12

 But before doing that, I do want to point to the 

13  regulation, 

Justice  Scalia,  that 

addresses  our 

14  understanding of  what it is  to decrease, and  we contend 

15  that the regulation,  which is published after  notice and 

16  comment, is entitled to Chevron  deference.  And it is 

--

17  is reproduced on  page 8a of the yellow  brief, and I will 

18  just -- it's quoted in our brief as well.  And it explains 

19  that a decrease in a benefit is something that changes the 

20  computation of  the benefit.  This  does  not change  the 

21  computation of the  benefit.  It's  not just a  rhetorical 

22  device.  It is a theme that runs throughout the provisions 

23  of ERISA. 

24

 Briefly,  with  respect to  the  purpose  of the 

25  statute and  plan's  expectations, the  critical point  is 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

17 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  that the  suspension rule  cannot work  if it  -- this  is 

2  section 203(a)(3)(B), the 1053 provision -- cannot work if 

3  it does  not apply to already accrued benefits.  The point 

4  of the statute is to get people  to move in and out of the 

5  workforce.  And  if you  are not  allowed  to apply  your 

6  suspension  provision  to  existing  retirees, you  cannot 

7  influence  them  in  response  to  current  financial 

8  conditions, the  shape of  the construction  labor market, 

9  the  shape of the current trucking market.  You have to be 

10  able to influence their decision whether or not to work or 

11  not to work. 

12

 QUESTION:  Well, that -- that as set forth in -­

13  in  your brief and  -- and you  made it sound  like a very 

14  significant, very important  power, but also you  made it, 

15  to me, sound like  it -- it gives almost no  effect at all 

16  to the anti-cutback provisions. 

17

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It does -­

 QUESTION:  I  mean, this -- this is a  sweeping 

19  authority you're arguing  for on behalf of  the plaintiff. 

20  Oh, the economy is this way and that way. 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, I think the critical point 

22  is  that  Congress  in  section  1053, in  203,  carefully 

23  limited the power of the plans; that is, it's -- the right 

24  here is to receive your pension.  That right is completely 

25  in the control of the  participants.  They can choose  not 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

18 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  to  go back  to work  or to  go back to  work.  They will 

2  receive their benefits. 

3

 In addition, the  plan is only allowed  to limit 

4  the  receipt  of  the benefit  payment  during  periods of 

5  reemployment in the same industry,  trade, or craft in the 

6  same geographic  region only  if  they work  more than  40 

7  hours of  -- a month, and a variety of other restrictions. 

8  And those showed that Congress  was cabining the authority 

9  of  plans so that they  didn't unduly restrict the ability 

10  of plan participants to go back to work. 

11

 But it  is,  I think,  absolutely  critical,  to 

12  return to  the point, that  1053(a)(3)(B), the  suspension 

13  rule, cannot  function as  Congress intended  and that  is 

14  what  the IRS concluded  if it  does not apply  to already 

15  accrued benefits.  We could  not encourage or  discourage 

16  the plan participants to go back to work or not to go back 

17  to  work and thus calibrate the  pension payments that are 

18  coming  into  the plan  if  it did 

--  

if our  suspension 

19  provision did not apply to their benefits. 

20

21

 If I could reserve the remainder of the time. 

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Goldstein. 

 Mr. Elwood, we'll hear from you. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD 

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

19 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 MR.  ELWOOD: 

Mr. Chief  Justice,  and  may it 

2  please the Court: 

3

 For  at  least 20  years,  the  Internal Revenue 

4  Service has consistently approved the amendment of pension 

5  plans to add or expand disqualifying employment provisions 

6  within the scope  of ERISA's suspension  rule, and it  has 

7  permitted  those amendments  to  be  applied  to  existing 

8  benefit accruals.  Over the years, literally  hundreds of 

9  plans have relied on the  flexibility that policy afforded 

10  in determining whether a plan -­

11

 QUESTION:  Could you address one -- one question 

12  I have?  The fact  that the -- the plan doesn't  -- or the 

13  contributors don't  lose  their  tax  deduction  does  not 

14  necessarily mean that those -- that they otherwise comply 

15  with ERISA. 

16

 MR. ELWOOD:  That is -- I think that  -- well, 

17  actually I  think that  because the  -- the  qualification 

18  provisions are coextensive with the ERISA provisions, that 

19  I think that they rise or fall together. 

20

21

 QUESTION:  Have we ever said that? 

 MR. ELWOOD:  I think that the -- the -- thing is 

22  the language  of the  -- the  provisions is  substantially 

23  identical.  The wording  is -- is basically  exactly the 

24  same.  And so I don't know that there has been a -- a case 

25  on point that  says they  could be construed  differently, 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

20 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  but I think there would be an uphill road. 

2

 QUESTION:  The Treasury Department,  of course, 

3  is interpreting  -- is  interpreting the  statute for  the 

4  purpose of deciding whether -- the income tax consequences 

5  of contributions basically. 

6

 MR. ELWOOD:  That is correct, but they have been 

7  vested  under  reorganization  plan number  four  with the 

8  authority  to  construe  the exact  same  provisions,  the 

9  corresponding provisions of  title I  of ERISA that  we're 

10  talking about  here.  And  in -- when  they issue  those 

11  regulations, they typically say we're construing both.  We 

12  use the code verbiage, but we're construing both. 

13

 QUESTION:  The  thing that runs through  my mind 

14  is I'm not sure they have the same expertise, for example, 

15  as if the Department of Labor had to give them the same -­

16  same answer to this question. 

17

 MR.  ELWOOD: 

They  have  been  charged  with 

18  interpreting  these  provisions,  the  same provisions  of 

19  title  I  of  ERISA,  the  204,  203  here  as  in  the 

20  corresponding provisions of the code.  And it would be our 

21  position  that they're  just  as  expert  because  they're 

22  exactly the same the language -­

23

 QUESTION:  But the concern at issue in this case 

24  is the ability of people to move in and out of  the -- out 

25  of the  trade, which  is specifically  a Labor  Department 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

21 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  interest.  The  Labor Department would be  more interested 

2  in ensuring  that -- that  interest is preserved  than the 

3  Treasury Department would. 

4

 MR. ELWOOD:  In any event, the -- the Department 

5  of the Treasury  has been charged with  the responsibility 

6  and because it's  identical language, we would  argue that 

7  they're entitled to  just as much deference  under that as 

8  under title I of ERISA --

9

 QUESTION:  And  the -- the Labor  Department has 

10  not adopted a position on this question -­

11

 MR.  ELWOOD:  The  Labor Department  agrees with 

12  this position.  The Labor Department, again under internal 

13  executive  branch  orders,  is  bound  by  the  IRS 

14  determinations in this regard. 

15

16

 Now, if I could get back to -­

 QUESTION:  Now, may I ask you about section 203? 

17  Because  the  respondent  says  it  governs  only  normal 

18  retirement benefits and not early retirement benefits that 

19  are at issue here. 

20

 MR.  ELWOOD: 

It  governs  normal  retirement 

21  benefits  and  their  actuarial equivalents. 

So  to the 

22  extent that  early retirement  benefits are  the actuarial 

23  equivalent of normal retirement  benefits, just reduced to 

24  account for  the fact  they're received  earlier and  that 

25  they'll be  received over a  longer period, it  applies of 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

22 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  its own force. 

2

 But again, the -- the Department of the Treasury 

3  has  taken  the  purposes  of  203 into  account  when  it 

4  construes all of the remaining provisions. 

5

6

 Justice Souter -­

 QUESTION:  May I ask you to -- to comment on  an 

7  argument  that  Mr.  Goldstein  just made? 

His 

--  

his 

8  argument was  that,  at  least  certainly so  far  as  the 

9  construction industry  is concerned,  unless this  kind of 

10  retroactive  effect could be  given, there  -- the  -- the 

11  various plans could  not protect  themselves, or at  least 

12  they -- they could not take account of -- of labor market 

13  conditions.  It would be useless to them. 

14

 My question is assume that is so.  ERISA is made 

15  for  all  sorts  of  plans. It  isn't  just  made  for the 

16  construction industry.  Is  there any  reason to  believe 

17  that  Congress  was  concerned  with  the  construction 

18  industry's labor market  problems in -- in fixing the 

--

19  the  statue in the  way Mr. Goldstein  and you  say it has 

20  been arranged? 

21

 MR. ELWOOD:  I think there  is reason to believe 

22  that Congress was  concerned with  the cyclical nature  of 

23  industries for which market -- which are covered typically 

24  by multiemployer plans. 

25

 QUESTION:  How do we -- how do we know that?  In 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

23 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  other words,  how do we know that this argument is not the 

2  tail wagging the dog? 

3

 MR. ELWOOD:  I think two things.  First of all, 

4  Congress -- several  Members of  Congress,  everyone  who 

5  spoke to  the subject during the debates leading up to the 

6  passage of  ERISA, indicated  that  the idea  here was  to 

7  promote  industrial  stability  and  to  give  plans  the 

8  flexibility, when  market conditions  warranted, to  adopt 

9  suspension provisions. 

10

 QUESTION:  Well, but you don't -- we don't have 

11  to adopt  your provision to -- to accord that flexibility. 

12  All that's  needed  is that  the plan  state,  when it  is 

13  established,  that these provisions dealing with where you 

14  can work are amendable.  Once it says that, then  there's 

15  no reduction in the value of  -- of the benefits that  the 

16  employee receives.  I mean,  it's -- it's just very  clear 

17  from  the  outset  that  these  things  are  subject  to 

18  defeasance.  All  we're  talking about  is  a  plan  that 

19  doesn't contain  that provision  at the  outset, and  then 

20  later decides it wants to change its mind. 

21

 MR.  ELWOOD: 

Actually, Justice  Scalia,  it I 

22  think explicitly indicates that it  contemplates that.  If 

23  you look at pages J.A.  46 and 64, there are  places there 

24  saying that basically if there are material changes in the 

25  suspension  provisions,  that  the  plan  will  notify 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

24 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  participants of  them.  And so  between that and  the fact 

2  that the  plan itself specifically states on page 50, J.A. 

3  50, that the plan is amendable -­

4

5

 QUESTION:  Yes, but that -­

 QUESTION:  Okay.  You're referring to  J.A. 50. 

6  Give us a minute, if you're -­

7

8

 MR. ELWOOD:  Oh, sure. 

 QUESTION: 

--  

if  you're  interested  in  our 

9  comprehending what  you're saying.  Give  us a minute  to 

10  turn to that page, will you? 

11

12

 Where on page 50 is it? 

 MR.  ELWOOD: 

The 

--  

page  50  is  just  the 

13  explanation that the plan is amendable.  Page 46 indicates 

14  that -- that there can be change in the suspension rules. 

15  It says if benefits have -­

16

17

18

19

 QUESTION:  Whereabouts are you reading? 

 MR. ELWOOD:  It's under (d)(1), page 46. 

 QUESTION:  Okay. 

 MR. ELWOOD:  (d)(1).  That's the -- basically 

20  the last sentence in the bottom three lines. 

21

 I'll  begin  earlier  than that. 

It  says, if 

22  benefits  have been  suspended  and  payment resumed,  new 

23  notification  shall,  upon  resumption, be  given  to  the 

24  participant  if  there  has been  any  material  change in 

25  suspension rules, which  we take to be  an indication that 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

25 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  the plan contemplated that such amendments could be made. 

2

3

 Justice Souter, if I could -­

 QUESTION: 

It  doesn't  say  anything  about 

4  amendments.  It just says if you had a suspension, you got 

5  -- you got to give notice.  I don't -- I don't see that. 

6

 QUESTION: 

Presumably  that 

--  

that's  a 

7  suspension provided for in the plan but the plan -­

8

 MR. ELWOOD:  No.  It says if  there has been any 

9  material change in the suspension rules, which we think to 

10  apply to  changes in when a suspension can be enacted, not 

11  that a suspension will be given in a particular case. 

12

 In addition, I just -- Mr. Goldstein has already 

13  explained a  bit why we think  the text of  ERISA supports 

14  this, but I think that its purposes -- the purposes of the 

15  anti-cutback rule  are consistent  with this  because what 

16  Congress was trying  to protect  in the anti-cutback  rule 

17  was reduction of retirement income.  And I think that that 

18  is  broadly  satisfied  in  this  case because  what  this 

19  guarantee, as we've explained, is an annuity and a certain 

20  face amount that can never be reduced in face amount.  And 

21  the  only time  it  is  not paid  to  them  is under  very 

22  narrowly  cabined  circumstances  when  they  are,  by 

23  definition,  receiving  essentially  receiving replacement 

24  income from  the same industry, the same trade or craft in 

25  the same  geographic area  that has  funded their  pension 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

26 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  plan. 

And  I  think  under  those  sort  of  narrow 

2  circumstances,  that  the  -- the  purposes  of  the anti­

3  cutback rule are satisfied. 

4

 In addition, I would like to get back to a point 

5  that Justice Souter raised. 

6

 QUESTION:  What  -- what  would happen if  there 

7  were a -- a  suspension if you were  working in any  other 

8  industry?  Suppose the plan adopted that? 

9

 MR. ELWOOD:  I think  that a plan could adopt  a 

10  suspension rule with  respect to future plan  accruals for 

11  any reemployment, but it is the Government's position that 

12  because what Congress is trying to control here was -- was 

13  basically to give  plans the flexibility so that  their -­

14  their participants would  not have to compete  or, rather, 

15  have to subsidize their competitors --

16

 QUESTION:  But what is  -- what is the provision 

17  of the statute which is -- which -- on which you rest  to 

18  make that distinction -­

19

20

 MR. ELWOOD:  That -­

 QUESTION:  -- as to  whether it's very important 

21  for the  construction industry?  Suppose  some plan  said 

22  it's for any industry. 

23

 MR. ELWOOD:  It's for section  203(a)(3)(B), or 

24  1053(a)(3)(B), which  is set forth at the  yellow brief on 

25  page -- I think it's 1a to 2a.  And there it is just -- it 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

27 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  just identifies the circumstances under which Congress has 

2  authorized the suspension rule,  which we read to be  able 

3  to be applied to existing benefit accruals.  And it limits 

4  it to  application in  the case of  a multiemployer  plan, 

5  which we've  said tend to  be industries of  more cyclical 

6  swings,  to  cases  where  it's  employment  in  the  same 

7  industry, in  the same  trade or  craft, and  in the  same 

8  geographic area covered by the plan. 

9

 QUESTION:  If this is  so central to your case, 

10  how come  it only shows up in your  -- in the reply brief? 

11  I mean -­

12

 MR. ELWOOD:  No.  It's  cited from the  outset. 

13  It's just -- it's only reproduced in the reply brief.  But 

14  the -- but the very same provision is very central  to the 

15  argument set forth in both the petitioner's brief and  the 

16  Government's. 

17

 QUESTION:  You  -- you've been dying  to respond 

18  to something I raised.  Let me give you the  chance to do 

19  it. 

20

21

22

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. ELWOOD:  Okay.  I appreciate that. 

 But I  just wanted  to clarify  one thing  about 

23  what the notice of required modifications says because the 

24  notice of required modifications basically  sets out model 

25  plan language,  and the model  plan language in  this case 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

28 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  that  existed  began 

--  

first  appeared  in  1984  said 

2  explicitly  it may be  added to  existing plans.  And the 

3  plan  language  itself doesn't  contain any  language that 

4  would carve our  existing accruals, so that  by definition 

5  it would apply to existing accruals.  And I think that if 

6  the  Treasury  had intended  it  to apply  only  to future 

7  benefit accruals, it  would have contained language.  And 

8  in fact, there are other  provisions that specifically set 

9  out that  kind  of limiting  language so  it  can only  be 

10  applied to future accruals.  So I'd say that.  It's not -­

11  I  -- I think  it's a  -- a reasonable  negative inference 

12  that can be drawn from that.  It's not going out on a limb 

13  too much.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Gossett, it's your turn. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. GOSSETT 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 MR.  GOSSETT:  Mr.  Chief  Justice, and  may it 

21  please the Court: 

22

 The Central Laborers'  Pension Fund promised Tom 

23  Heinz and Rick  Schmitt that after they  accepted an early 

24  retirement  package,  they would  be  entitled to  work in 

25  specific jobs without sacrificing their pension plans.  It 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

29 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  is a foundational principle of ERISA that participants are 

2  entitled to  rely on plan promises  such as this one.  By 

3  reneging on this promise and changing  the rules after the 

4  fact,  the  plan  violated  section  204(g) of  ERISA  and 

5  decreased  the value  of  participants' plan,  as  Justice 

6  Scalia -­

7

 QUESTION:  Let's assume I -- I agree with you on 

8  that.  The -- there's -- there's another  reliance problem 

9  here and -- and that, I take it, is the -- is the reliance 

10  upon  a contrary view taken by the IRS.  And the -- the -­

11  your  -- your colleagues on the  other side say that if we 

12  see it your way, there's  an enormous number of plans  out 

13  there  who  are  suddenly  going  to  find  themselves 

14  unqualified or disqualified, whatever the  term is.  Is -­

15  is there  a way to avoid that if -- if you are correct on 

16  the law, but they are correct about the -- the practice? 

17

18

19

 MR. GOSSETT:  Yes, Justice Souter. 

 QUESTION:  What part are we -- how does that -­

 MR.  GOSSETT: 

Under  Internal  Revenue  Code 

20  section  7805(b), the IRS  has the  right to say  that any 

21  amendment  before  the date  of  this -- of  this Court's 

22  decision in this case wouldn't  lead to a disqualification 

23  of -- of the plan. 

24

 QUESTION:  Oh, I don't  think they could because 

25  you have an answer there to question 6 which says  that if 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

30 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  you put in your original  plan a provision that would  say 

2  the employer can change the definition of who's working in 

3  his same company  over time,  as labor circumstances  call 

4  for it, that  that gives the employer discretion,  and you 

5  can't  do  it because  giving  them that  discretion would 

6  itself count as a reduction.

 Now, that's well established.  The whole  point 

8  of this -- so  you tell me how they could  write a plan to 

9  do what  you think  they should  be able  to do.  And  of 

10  course, they  should.  That's the whole point of this part 

11  of 203. 

12

 MR. GOSSETT:  No, Justice Breyer.  The -- the 

13  part -- the -- the point of 203  is not to allow plans to 

14  change the rules over time -­

15

 QUESTION: 

The  whole  point  of  203,  as  I 

16  understand it,  is that it was  something put in  there by 

17  the  Teamsters or possibly the crafts  unions so that when 

18  you  get your -- your  early retirement benefit and you're 

19  out there, don't come back to my plant.  Why not my plant? 

20  Because when you do, you will work for a low wage and that 

21  will depress the wages of other workers. 

22

 Now, I'm not going to say absolutely never.  I'm 

23  not going  to say always.  It's going to  depend on labor 

24  conditions,  and that's  why if that  purpose is  not what 

25  that part  of 203 is there for, you  can explain why it is 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1  there. 

But if  I'm  right about  why  it's there,  your 

2  interpretation  not only  disrupts 20  years of -- of how 

3  this has been administered, but also makes it unworkable. 

4

 MR. GOSSETT:  That's not why it's there, Justice 

5  Breyer. 

6

7

 QUESTION:  Why is it there? 

 MR. GOSSETT:  Section -- section 203(a)(3)(B), 

8  for starters, only applies  to normal retirement benefits. 

9  Under section 203(a) of  ERISA, normal retirement benefits 

10  are -- cannot be forfeited.  But for section 203(a)(3)(B), 

11  there would  be no situation in which a plan could suspend 

12  benefit  payments. 

So  203(a)(3)(B)  specifies 

--  

it 

13  delimits the limited circumstances in which -­

14

 QUESTION:  Put a little footnote here that I may 

15  not agree with your statement, but go ahead. 

16

17

 MR. GOSSETT:  Okay.  I -- footnote noted. 

 But the point of 203(a)(3)(B) is to say that you 

18  can  only  limit  plans 

--  

suspensions  in  two  certain 

19  circumstances.  The  -- if  you look  at the  legislative 

20  history of 203(a)(3)(B),  though, it discusses how  -- how 

21  employers shouldn't be required  to subsidize competitors. 

22  They shouldn't be  required to  -- union employers  should 

23  not have former union workers  going in for work for  non­

24  union  competitors  at lower  wages  because  they're also 

25  receiving  a  pension  benefit. 

That's  what's  rife 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

32

1  throughout the legislative of ERISA. 

2

 But  there's nothing  in  that  -- that  purpose 

3  which requires  a plan  to be  able to  change the  rules, 

4  which is what they want. 

5

 QUESTION:  That -- that would be an odd purpose. 

6  Now,  wait, you're saying  that the  purpose of this  -- I 

7  have  a -- a  plant where I  make trousers and  some of my 

8  workers have retired early.  And you're saying the purpose 

9  of  this provision is  to make  sure that my  worker who's 

10  retired  early  doesn't  go  work for  Justice  Ginsburg's 

11  plant, the trousers, some other plant.  All right? 

12

 Now, that would be very odd to have that purpose 

13  served by  the language which I  think says by -- that -­

14  that in the case of a  plan other than by an employer  who 

15  maintains the plan  -- that is,  it's talking about  going 

16  back to the same plant, isn't it?  Am I wrong?

17

 QUESTION:  All right. 

 MR. GOSSETT:  But in  the multiemployer context, 

18  it's 

--  

it's only  about  cross-subsidization.  But the 

19  bottom line is that in  either of those cases, there's  no 

20  reason  why the pension fund -- why the -- the fund should 

21  be allowed to change the rules.  The -- those -­

22

 QUESTION:  The reason is supposedly -- what they 

23  say is the reason we  want to change the rules  is because 

24  labor conditions change and whereas in this year where the 

25  plant -- where the economy is booming, I don't really have

2  back and depressing their wages. 

3

 QUESTION: 

Well, it  wouldn't be  changing the 

4  rules, would  it, if you said at the beginning these rules 

5  can be changed?  Isn't that all  your saying, that -- that 

6  the  employer  can  do it  so  long as  when  the  plan is 

7  established,  it  is made  clear  that  the rules  can  be 

8  changed? 

9

10

 MR. GOSSETT:  Not exactly. 

 QUESTION:  Then -- then  you're not changing the 

11  rules when you change the rules, so to speak. 

12

 QUESTION:  I -- I thought your brief was -- was 

13  candid,  Mr. Gossett,  and you  said  you couldn't  -- you 

14  could  not do  what Justice  Scalia just  suggested.  You 

15  couldn't say up front in the plan, we can amend it anytime 

16  back and forth the way we like.  I thought you  said quite 

17  clearly in your brief that that wouldn't work. 

18

 MR. GOSSETT:  Yes,  Justice Ginsburg.  I -- I 

19  agree completely. 

20

 The -- the  point is that there's  no difference 

21  between  a  plan provision  that  says we  can  change the 

22  suspension rules  at any  point and reduce  them versus  a 

23  plan provision that  says we can reduce  your benefit from 

24  $1,600 a month  to $1,400 a  month at any  point if we  so 

25  choose.

 MR. GOSSETT:  Both of those would -- sorry. 

 QUESTION:  I want  to get the answer  to Justice 

4  Scalia's before you lose that. 

5

6

 MR. GOSSETT:  This is -­

 QUESTION: 

Now,  I thought  that  what  he was 

7  suggesting was not  possible because of the  reason of the 

8  answer to question 6.  Am I right or wrong? 

9

 MR. GOSSETT:  The answer to question 6 in the -­

10  in the regulations is a  subsidiary answer.  I think  it's 

11  by far the less important answer. 

12

 QUESTION:  No, but I  want to know first if  I'm 

13  right or wrong. 

14

 MR. GOSSETT:  Yes.  That is an answer is that it 

15  cannot be -­

16

17

 QUESTION:  I am right. 

 MR. GOSSETT:  -- discretionary on the -- to the 

18  plan  to  cut back 

--  

to do  something  because of  plan 

19  funding. 

20

 But the more fundamental answer  is that if that 

21  were the case, every  plan could include a  provision that 

22  said  in just these words, any benefit that we've promised 

23  you in this  plan can be reduced  at a future date  at our 

24  discretion.  And if a  plan could  say that and  still be 

25  valid  under  ERISA,  the  anti-cutback  rule  would  be 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

36 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  meaningless.  Every plan would -- could say that. 

2

 So  ERISA  was  passed  specifically  because 

3  historically plans were pulling back  benefits, relying on 

4  the common law rule that  a pension is simply a  gratuity. 

5  And  the  anti-cutback rule  is  the primary  provision in 

6  ERISA  that  was  designed  to  say,  no,  when  a 

--  

a 

7  participant is promised something, that  promise has to be 

8  kept.

10  that even when it says they're promised  nothing, in other 

11  words,  that they  -- it  can be changed  retroactively -­

12  you're -- you're saying that that is a promise that's not 

13  kept? 

14

 MR. GOSSETT:  That is a promise that is kept on 

15  the most  technical level,  of  course.  If I'm  promised 

16  nothing and I'm given nothing, I -- I -­

17

18

 QUESTION:  You can't complain. 

 MR. GOSSETT:  -- one simply can't complain.  But 

19  the -- the whole goal of ERISA is  to require employers to 

20  say we're going  to -- to say we're going to give you this 

21  and -- and keep their -- their word to that. 

22

 QUESTION:  I thought  it was 203  that -- that 

23  provided  that  guarantee.  I  thought  it was  203  that 

24  prevents you  from going too far  in what you say  you can 

25  change. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

37 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR.  GOSSETT:  It  is both 203  and 204, Justice 

2  Scalia.

4

 QUESTION:  I don't see how 204 does it. 

 MR.  GOSSETT:  The -- the -- Mr. Goldstein tries 

5  to  differentiate  203  and  204  and argue  that  they're 

6  completely  distinct  beasts, the  one  not affecting  the 

7  other.  That's simply not the case.  As the IRS has said 

8  in its  regulations, anything that indirectly  decreases a 

9  benefit is equally violative of 204(g). 

10

 And it's  easy  to come  up  with -- with  plan 

11  provisions that,  quote,  forfeit a  benefit  rather  than 

12  decrease  the benefit,  but  which obviously  reduced  the 

13  value you get.  I mean,  the most obvious example would be 

14  a  -- an amendment  that says,  each month we're  going to 

15  flip a coin and decide whether or not you get a check this 

16  month.  That benefit would be -­

17

 QUESTION:  My -- my true question -- it isn't -­

18  it  isn't -- I think there's no  easy answer to this case. 

19  All right?  And I agree with you that in ordinary English, 

20  we'd call this a reduction.  But there is in 203(g) -- or, 

21  you know, the 203 part we're  talking about -- there is an 

22  obvious purpose  to do  something that  is not  consistent 

23  with the normal ERISA purposes.  It's right there and it's 

24  done for labor reasons.  And you can interpret it  either 

25  way. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

38 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 So given  the either-way possibility, in  my own 

2  mind this is where I am.  I'm telling you truthfully.  I'd 

3  say -­

4

5

 MR. GOSSETT:  Thank you. 

 QUESTION: 

--  

either-way  possibility.  Well, 

6  they've had this for  20 years.  They have regs that  are 

7  consistent  with it.  People have lived  with it.  Go with 

8  the administration.  I  mean, that's  -- all  right?  So 

9  that's  -- that's where I  -- that's what  I -- that's how 

10  I'm thinking  about it, and I'd like to hear your response 

11  to that. 

12

 MR. GOSSETT:  Okay.  I have several responses to 

13  that because it's obviously a critical point. 

14

 The -- the  first response is that  although the 

15  IRS  and  Mr. Goldstein  have  told  us  that  this  is  a 

16  longstanding Government position, the  only thing they can 

17  actually  point  to  that  states  that  position  is  the 

18  Internal Revenue Manual that dates  to 2001.  The List  of 

19  Required Modifications, the  LRM, not the IRM,  which does 

20  go back quite some time earlier, specifically says that it 

21  is designed to aid people in  drafting or redrafting plans 

22  and that the  provisions included therein could  be useful 

23  in some plans, it could  be violative in other plans.  So 

24  that's not authority by which someone can actually look at 

25  an IRS publication  and say, this  is what we have  -- the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

39 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  IRS allows. 

2

 They  say  that  they've  issued  letters 

--

3  determinations that they  have allowed these in  the past, 

4  but those  are not  due deference under  -- certainly  not 

5  under Chevron, probably  not even  under Skidmore.  Those 

6  are sort of  individual case determinations and  they have 

7  put none of these in the record. 

8

 And in any event, under  section -- code section 

9  7805, the IRS says that those can be wrong, and if they're 

10  wrong, all  it means is the plan can't be disqualified for 

11  having done  something wrong.  There's -- there are no tax 

12  implications.  The plan  can still owe damages  to someone 

13  who in fact was hurt by  the amendment, but that is itself 

14  a small cost in this case. 

15

 Mr.  Goldstein  is engaged 

--  

and more  to the 

16  point, his amici  is engaging in hyperbole  by saying this 

17  is going to bankrupt plans.  In the joint appendix at page 

18  80, the plan -- the  plan's actuary tells us that  exactly 

19  seven  people's  benefits  were  cut off  as  a  result -­

20  suspended as  a result of this  amendment.  That's  out of 

21  5,300 active pensioners, according to  the plan's web site 

22  at the  moment.  We're talking  less than two-tenths  of 1 

23  percent of people were, in  fact, cut -- suspended because 

24  of -­

25

 QUESTION:  But it's not -- if your -- if your 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

40 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  position prevails, then I take it the only way an employer 

2  can protect  himself against hard times is to say for this 

3  class of early  retirees, no  employment.  Any  employment 

4  will result  in suspension of benefits, and to say for the 

5  ones -- normal retirees are  the ones who  are restricted 

6  only with respect  to the same trade, to  make the rule as 

7  restrictive  as  possible.  I  think  that your 

--  

your 

8  interpretation forces  the employer  who wants  to protect 

9  against hard times to take that view.  Is that not so? 

10

 MR. GOSSETT:  I -- I disagree, Justice Ginsburg. 

11  The -- from the -- the employer setting  up a  plan, the 

12  settlers of  a plan, all they care about is how much money 

13  a plan is going to cost them.  And it's a -- it's a design 

14  decision whether  or not you'd  rather have a  benefit of, 

15  say, $2,000 a month with a narrow -- a narrower suspension 

16  rule or $1,990 a month with a wider suspension rule.  Both 

17  of those plans cost the employer the same amount of money. 

18  There's no -- the -- the details of the number, of course, 

19  are -- are questions for actuaries.  But the -- the design 

20  question is one that can be made completely independent of 

21  this.  Is it's how important is it to the employer whether 

22  people go back to work in other jobs, how  important is it 

23  to the employees that they can work in specific jobs. 

24

 The -- while a change in the plan might save the 

25  -- the plan  money, the initial design  decision about how 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

41 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  restrictive the rules should be isn't a financial question 

2  in the -- in the slightest.  And in fact, the  fact that 

3  the change  in the plan -- the  -- in the suspension rule, 

4  the amendment  here saved  the plan  money, is  in fact  I 

5  think the best evidence of all that the amendment violates 

6  the  anti-cutback rule.  The anti-cutback  rule prevents, 

7  quote, a decrease -­

8

 QUESTION:  You're -- you're back  to the  word 

9  reduction  where  I agree  with  you.  But  I would  have 

10  thought  that this -- this provision  here in  203 really 

11  reflects a tension within the  union.  The union wants  to 

12  get benefits for its  early retirees, and that  argues for 

13  going back.  But the  union also  wants to reflect  -- or 

14  protect the  wages of  the people  who are  already there. 

15  And that means  that if there is a recession, what we want 

16  to do is stop too many people from going back because that 

17  might  have a  depressing  effect on  the workers  who are 

18  there. 

19

 Now, I put that again  because that -- that  was 

20  how  I  began to  understand  what was  going  on in  this 

21  provision and  I want you  to be  able to say,  no, you're 

22  wrong.  That isn't what's going on. 

23

 MR.  GOSSETT: 

What's  going  on is  that 

--

24  Justice Breyer, is that plans  -- that -- that unions  and 

25  the  employers want to  prevent cross-subsidization.  But 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

42 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  there's -- while it is  certainly the case that, at  least 

2  according to this plan and its amici, they have started to 

3  rely on this purported right to  deal with changing market 

4  conditions, they have no authority for doing so.  The only 

5  thing  they  can  point  to  is  one  floor  statement  by 

6  Representative  Dent  after that  provision  of ERISA,  in 

7  fact, had  been enacted, saying  that there might  be some 

8  change  in market  conditions which  would affect  things. 

9  Employers can deal with changing  market conditions in the 

10  traditional ways.  They can pay more or less money. 

11

 And  in  any event,  the  thing missing  in that 

12  approach to 203  is the foundational principle  that ERISA 

13  is designed to protect participants.  It's not designed to 

14  protect plans.  It's designed  to protect the participants 

15  in the plans.  That's why it -- that's why the vesting and 

16  accrual rules  are very  explicit.  And in  fact, turning 

17  very briefly to the vesting rules, Mr. -­

 QUESTION:  It's certainly  designed to  protect 

19  plans  in  some  respects, the  preemption,  that  sort of 

20  thing. 

21

 MR.  GOSSETT:  Yes,  that's  true,  but  that's 

22  largely  an indirect  way of  protecting  the plan  -- the 

23  plans and more indirectly the -- the participants and more 

24  indirectly  the  participants  and  more  indirectly  the 

25  Federal fisc because, of course,  plans are -- are insured

 The amendment that  -- the  plan provision  that

21  -- on  the narrow end  -- it's  a technical level  -- it's 

22  precluded under the IRS's own  regulations which point out 

23  that you  can't have -- you  can't change conditions  in a 

24  way  that  violates missions. 

But -- but  on the  more 

25  fundamental level, it violates -­

 MR. GOSSETT:  204(g)(1)  which  says you  can't

And while  one can  come  up with  a

reading  of  that  said  that  your 

9  provision  would  not  violate 204(g)(1),  it  would  read 

10  204(g)(1) -- 204(g) out of ERISA because -­

11

 QUESTION:  And  this is what we  were discussing 

12  before and  you spell this out in your brief, and you were 

13  very candid in  saying Justice Scalia's  solution wouldn't 

14  work. 

15

16

 MR. GOSSETT:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

 I -- I want -- I wanted to turn quickly to -- to 

17  203(c),  the  -- the  amendment  provision in  the vesting 

18  statute  that Mr.  Goldstein talked  about.  There  are a 

19  couple of things to note about that. 

20

 The first and foremost is probably that it shows 

21  that 203(a)(1)(B), the  -- the suspension rule  that we're 

22  talking about, talks about a plan providing for something. 

23  In 203(c),  they talk about a plan amending the rules.  If 

24  they  had  wanted  to  talk  about  an  amendment  in 

25  203(a)(1)(B), they could have.  They -- they talked about 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

46 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  terms amending things elsewhere in the same provision. 

2

 But more fundamentally, Mr. Goldstein is  simply 

3  wrong that a plan can  retroactively de-vest a participant 

4  of  benefits  that  had  previously  vested. 

Under 

5  203(c)(1)(A), which  is on page 4a of the yellow brief, it 

6  -- it explains that a plan amendment shall not -- shall be 

7  treated  as not satisfying  203 if  the -- if  the amended 

8  amount  is less  than  such  a non-forfeitable  percentage 

9  commuted -- computed under the plan without regard to such 

10  amendment. 

11

 So,  for  example,  if  a  plan participant  had 

12  earned  20  percent  of  their  -- had  a  non-forfeitable 

13  interest  in 20 percent  of their accrued  benefit and the 

14  plan switched  from a progression to a -- a cliff vesting, 

15  where you got everything in  5 years, they could do  that, 

16  but they  couldn't remove your 20 percent.  They could say 

17  you  don't vest in anything more  until the 5-year period, 

18  but they  couldn't say you lose the 20 percent vested that 

19  you already have. 

20

 QUESTION:  I think that they -- that the -- (c) 

21  being  there  shows no  more than,  that the  words, shall 

22  provide, which  is the beginning of 203, do not mean shall 

23  provide  in  the original  plan. 

They must  mean  shall 

24  provide  in  the  original  plan  or  through  permissible 

25  amendments because if  they meant the original  plan only, 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

47 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  there would be no safety. 

2

 MR.  GOSSETT: 

The  term  provide  is  not  in 

3  203(a)(1)(A) and (B), which are the -­

4

 QUESTION:  It  says at the very  beginning, (A), 

5  each plan shall provide  that.  And as some of  -- reading 

6  some of  what you've written, it's  as if you  think those 

7  words  mean in the original plan, and  -- and I think they 

8  point to (c) to say it can't mean that. 

9

 MR. GOSSETT:  Justice Breyer, the amendment of a 

10  plan  is  authorized  under  ERISA  section  402(b)(3). 

11  402(b)(3)  is the  provision of  ERISA that says  any plan 

12  must  include  a provision  that  allows amendments.  The 

13  amendments  that are  authorized under 402(b)(3)  are then 

14  limited by the anti-cutback rule,  by the provisions of -­

15  of 203, by everything else in ERISA. 

16

 The -- these specific limitations on amendments, 

17  though, are fully  -- are all read in  para materia.  Each 

18 

--  

each  limitation  on  amendments  applies  to  every 

19  amendment and there's no provision in 203  that says these 

20  amendments are allowed. 

21

 QUESTION:  We're  back to the  circle.  I  mean, 

22  the -- you're quite right.  Every time it  talks about the 

23  amendments or otherwise, it uses  some word like you can't 

24  reduce, and  the ordinary -- it would have been simpler if 

25  they had amended  that word reduced, wherever  it appears, 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

48 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  with the same exception they have here in 203.  Then you'd 

2  lose definitely  and you'd admit it.  On the  other hand, 

3  they didn't put those words in and that gives the strength 

4  to your argument. 

5

 But on the other hand, they say, well, yes, that 

6  if in fact they didn't mean to read it in, they're  really 

7  going to  reduce the  effectiveness of  that same  kind of 

8  thing over in 203, you see, because they  just have it for 

9  the forfeitability.  They don't have it for the reduction. 

10  Really, please, that doesn't make  much sense.  So  that's 

11  why,  you know,  I  can't get  a  firm answer  out of  the 

12  language. 

13

 MR. GOSSETT: 

I think  that  the text  of  the 

14  statute is pretty clearly on my side.  The only thing that 

15  Mr.  Goldstein can  point to is  this created  purpose and 

16  supposed longstanding practice  of plans to be  allowed to 

17  change  rules  retroactively in  light of  changing market 

18  conditions.  But  though the plans  have been doing  that, 

19  it's the text of the statute that controls and -­

20

 QUESTION:  But you  do  acknowledge that  plans 

21  have  been  making  these changes  and  the  IRS has  been 

22  accepting  them  for  purposes  of  the  employer's  tax 

23  deductions.

 MR.  GOSSETT:  I know,  Justice O'Connor,  that 

2  they did so  in this case.  Beyond that, all we  have are

4  Coordinating  Committee's  brief,  but  they're

6

 QUESTION:  Now, section  203  refers to  normal 

7  retirement plans.  You take the position  that it doesn't 

8  cover early retirement. 

9

 MR. GOSSETT:  Section 203(a)(3)(B) doesn't apply 

10  to the subsidized  portion of  early retirement  benefits. 

11  The -- the -- that's obvious because it is an exception to 

12  203(a)  which  says that  your  normal retirement  is non­

13  forfeitable. 

14

 And the  Government has  taken this position  as 

15  well.  This  is not  something that  we created.  In the 

16  regulation 

--  

this  is  in  29  C.F.R.  2530.203. 

The 

17  Government explains  that a  plan can  provide that  early 

18  retirement benefits are  suspended for  any reason -- for 

19  any  reemployment  because  203(a)(3)(B) is  defining  the 

20  universe  of  possible  suspension  rules  for  normal 

21  retirement benefits, but  it doesn't -- doesn't  limit the 

22  universe  of  suspension  rules  for  early  retirement 

23  benefits. 

24

 And  in  fact,  in  September 

--  

on  the  same 

25  amendment that applied to Messrs.  Heinz and Schmitt, that 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

50 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  -- in  that  same amendment,  the plan  provided that  for 

2  benefits accrued after September 30th, 1998, but only sort 

3  of  prospective  benefits, not  retroactive  benefits, any 

4  post-retirement reemployment would  lead to those benefits 

5  being suspended. 

6

 They -- and  -- and  this actually follows  from 

7  the 

--  

again,  from  the IRS's  own  position. 

In the 

8  Internal  Revenue Manual,  the  IRS says  you  can have  a 

9  provision saying that  any work is  -- is suspensive,  but 

10  you can only do that prospectively because applying the -­

11  such a  changed  rule retroactively  would decrease  their 

12  benefits. 

13

 But to  the extent that you can have a rule that 

14  says any work is suspensive,  that means that 203(a)(3)(B) 

15  isn't  -- just  isn't  applicable  here.  It's  not  what 

16  determines whether or not someone -- the rules that a plan 

17  can have for early retirement benefits.  A plan can  have 

18  a -­

19

 QUESTION:  Was  that  distinction made  in  the 

20  Seventh Circuit between the early retirement benefits with 

21  regard to the application of 203(a)? 

22

23

 MR. GOSSETT:  Sorry. 

 QUESTION:  Was that -- was that an argument that 

24  you presented to  the Seventh  Circuit distinguishing  the 

25  early retirements benefits from normal retirement benefits 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

51 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  for 203(a)  purposes?  I thought  it was -- that it  was 

2  acknowledged in the Seventh Circuit that 203(a) applied to 

3  the early retirement  benefits as  well as  the normal 

--

4  normal retirement benefits. 

5

 MR. GOSSETT:  203(a) applies to early retirement 

6  benefits  to  the  extent  that  they  are  the  actuarial 

7  equivalent, the net present -- the financial equivalent of 

8  normal  retirement benefits,  but  not  to the  subsidized 

9  portion of  -- of them.  So -- so  I think the  answer is 

10  yes, we did say that in -- in the lower court, but I'm not 

11  100 percent sure, Justice Ginsburg. 

12

 The -- one other  point I  wanted to  -- to  go 

13  over.  Though the plan argues that 204(g) doesn't apply to 

14  this change -- they say that the change only applies  to a 

15  reduction in the value of a life annuity -- that's not the 

16  statutory term.  The  -- the  statutory definition  of an 

17  accrued benefit,  which is in  ERISA section  323, is  the 

18  individual's accrued  benefit determined  under the  plan. 

19  It's whatever the plan promises to the participant that is 

20  protected by the plan.  It's --

21

 QUESTION:  You  -- you say that  204(g) prevents 

22  the plan at  the outset  from rendering itself  amendable, 

23  but if you agreed with  them that 204(g) does not  prevent 

24  the  later amendment,  it would also  be true  that 204(g) 

25  does not  prevent the employer  from the outset  at saying 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

52 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  that the retirement  benefits are  amendable.  Isn't  that 

2  right? 

3

 MR. GOSSETT:  Justice Scalia,  it allows an 

--

4  you can make an amendment --

5

 QUESTION:  I  was making the point  earlier that 

6  even if we find for you, the employer would -- would  have 

7  a way of -- of solving the problem, which is simply at the 

8  outset to set forth.  Now, it's very difficult for them to 

9  respond to that  argument when they  say that 204(g)  does 

10  not stop -- does -- does not prevent a later change in the 

11  plan.  How could it possibly prevent a later change but -­

12  not prevent  a later change, but  prevent a change  at the 

13  outset and announce that you're going to make a change? 

14

 MR.  GOSSETT: 

Well, it  clearly  prevents the 

15  later change, which is what is at  issue here.  I think it 

16  also prevents the earlier change because I think any other 

17  reading  of the  anti-cutback  rule reads  it  out of  the 

18  statute, but I don't think the Court needs to address that 

19  question in this case. 

20

 QUESTION:  But  another way of  putting Justice 

21  Scalia's point is  if they're right, it's  surprising that 

22  they  didn't make the point clearer in their plans because 

23  it would have been legal to do so. 

24

 MR. GOSSETT:  I don't think -- they didn't  make 

25  this argument  below, to the best  of my knowledge.  They 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

53

1  made this argument that -­

2

 QUESTION:  But I  mean if their basic theory  of 

3  the  204(g)  is correct,  then  all the  plans  could have 

4  solved this problem by saying so expressly so nobody would 

5  have been  fooled as your clients  were.  They  could have 

6  said in the  plan itself, we retain the  right to do this. 

7  They say  it's  just there  by statute,  but  the plan  is 

8  somewhat ambiguous, and they could  have said so expressly 

9  if they're right and you're wrong. 

10

11

 MR. GOSSETT:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  They couldn't have  done it if you're 

12  right and they're wrong. 

13

 MR.  GOSSETT: 

That's exactly  right,  Justice 

14  Stevens.  But of course, they didn't. 

15

 The -- the  main provision on amendments  in the 

16  plan, which  is  the provision  at page  50  of the  joint 

17  appendix, says that no amendment  can decrease the accrued 

18  value.  They  elsewhere in the  plan talk about  notifying 

19  participants of  changes to  the plan  and discussed  that 

20  there could be a change,  but that change -- that  doesn't 

21  say that there can be  a retroactive change.  There  could 

22  have been a  prospective change  that loosened the  rules. 

23  There  could  also  have been  a  prospective  change that 

24  applied to newly accrued benefits because by the terms  of

 Mr. Goldstein, you have 2 minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you, Mr.  Chief Justice, 

7  and may it please the Court: 

8

 I  have four points.  The  first deals with what 

9  kind of promises we can make to participants that they can 

10  enforce.  The promise can only  go in one direction.  That 

11  is, if we promise them  we will not change the  suspension 

12  rules, if they -- trustees  put that provision in and  the 

13  employees and the participants rely  on it, we -- that 

--

14  to -- to change that would violate the plan and they would 

15  have a right under 502 to enforce it. 

16

 But,  Justice  Scalia,  there  is  no  way  that 

17  there's a middle ground under which the plans flag for the 

18  participants, hey, this is open to a change because 204(g) 

19  -- if  they  win, they'll  win under  204(g).  204(g)  is 

20  categorical.  You can't reduce  benefits even if  you say 

21  you're going  to.  It's  just no way you  can do it.  And 

22  therefore, the only middle ground  is under our provision. 

23  If participants and  the trustees  want a plan  provision, 

24  making it  a concrete promise, we won't  change the rules. 

25  If that's in the plan, it would be enforceable against us.

 Second -­

 QUESTION:  No, but  your plan  could have  made 

4  clear what you say the law otherwise authorizes. 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It could  have, although I would 

6  say that  the provisions  cited  by the  Assistant to  the 

7  Solicitor General talks  about telling a person  who is in 

8  retirement  about  a  material change  in  the  suspension 

9  rules,  and that's -- that's pretty clear to my mind.  But 

10  it's true.  It could have gone -- we could have  been even 

11  more clear, but this is  a right, a statutory right,  that 

12  we have. 

13

 Justice O'Connor,  Justice  Ginsburg, what  does 

14  203 cover?  It  covers a  normal retirement  benefit, and 

15  usually what  we think of as an  early retirement benefit, 

16  that is,  the unsubsidized  portion of  an -- of a  early 

17  retirement benefit. 

18

 The  third  is  it  is 

--  

Justice  Breyer  is 

19  absolutely right about the purpose of this  provision.  We 

20  want  to be  able to  adjust to current  labor conditions. 

21  And Justice Souter,  the statute recognizes that.  203(a) 

22  has  a special rule  for multiemployer plans.  They cover 

23  things  like  construction  and labor  where  the  markets 

24  change a lot, and they  have a much narrower provision  in 

25  203 for single employer plans.

 But  ultimately, I  think  that  this is  fairly
