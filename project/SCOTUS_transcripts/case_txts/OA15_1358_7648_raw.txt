may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

            

This case marks the return of Iqbal as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plaintiffs seek to hold essentially the same defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable for the same actions arising in the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary circumstances in the wake of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

September 11 terrorist attacks. 

 

 

 

            

All of the judges below concluded that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plaintiffs' core theory is squarely foreclosed by Iqbal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But the Second Circuit majority then formulated its own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list merger theory of liability, premising liability on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the alleged decision of Attorney General Ashcroft to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merge the New York list of detainees, which had not been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fully vetted, with the INS list, thereby continuing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold-until-cleared policy for detainees on both lists. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

Bivens' liability does not attach here for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

at least three reasons. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

            

First, the Bivens remedy should not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

extended to national security and immigration policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions by senior officials in the wake of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

September 11 attacks.  If the damages remedy is to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed, it's for Congress, not this Court, to do so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

            

Second, the list merger theory suffers from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

the same pleading deficiencies that this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified in Iqbal itself.  Among other things, there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is an obvious alternative and noninvidious explanation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the list merger decision.  Given the uncertainty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the status of detainees on the New York list, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list merger was undertaken to avoid the inadvertent or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premature release of a dangerous terrorist. 

   

 

 

 

14 

            

And third, the defendants here violated no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

clearly established right.  It would not have been clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to every reasonable defendant that merging the lists in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the wake of the 9/11 attacks would be unconstitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather than risking premature release of a detainee on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the New York list. 

 

 

 

              

I think the easiest way for this Court to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve this case is through the Iqbal pleading theory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But given this Court's admonition that the existence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Bivens remedy is an antecedent question that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court should address first, let me start there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- you seem to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

assuming that the whole case is about the merging of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New York list with the other list, but I thought that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was -- this case was identified as a prison 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

conditions case. 

 

5 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, that 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

6 

7 

8 

9 

broader theory was raised below.  It was rejected by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every judge to consider it below, the district court and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the panel majority, and it -- it is also, I think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond the -- it's not within the scope of the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

presented. 

11 

            

But even if -- if -- and I think the reason 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

that it was barred below is because it squarely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreclosed by -- by Iqbal, both on the substantive due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process claim and on the equal protection claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

On the substantive due process claim, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

we have is an -- a -- a facially-valid constitutional 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

policy to -- to -- that could be applied to individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with individualized suspicion of terrorism. 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

And if you look at the allegations in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

complaint, and these are paragraphs 61 and 65 of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint, all that is alleged is that Ashcroft and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mueller met regularly with a -- this is on page 274A of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the appendix to the petition -- that in the -- and this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is paragraph 61 -- that Ashcroft and Mueller met with a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small group of officials to exert maximum pressure on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the individuals arrested, and then in paragraph 65, on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

the next page, that the punitive conditions in which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MDC and class members were placed were the direct result 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the strategy. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

There is no allegation that Ashcroft and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

Mueller or Ziglar created the punitive conditions, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they required the putative conditions.  They had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the right, as the Second Circuit itself held, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court held, to presume that the policy would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

implemented lawfully. 

 

11 

            

The only real theory that survives, I think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

Your Honor, really is the list merger theory, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory fails.  I think it's critical to understand in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that context how the case -- how the situation looked to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Attorney General -- to Attorney General Ashcroft 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who's alleged to be the decisionmaker. 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

I'll come back to the -- to the failure of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

the complaint to allege that he was the decisionmaker, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but even taking that, what he faced was the New York 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list which involved aliens, all of whom were out of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

status, and had been picked up in the course of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

Pent-Bomb investigation. 

 

23 

            

He knew that not all of those aliens had had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

individualized suspicion determinations, but that some 

 

 

 

 

 

may well have had ties nexus to terrorism, and he knew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

that the conditions of confinement would be lawful.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

is not disputed that those would be lawful as to those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with individualized suspicion. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

Faced with that situation, the Second 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

Circuit majority found that the list merger decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could only explained by putative intent or by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

discriminatory intent. 

 

8 

            

But there is an obvious alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

explanation for the decision that Attorney General 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ashcroft would have faced in deciding to merger the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list, is that you couldn't tell who was and who was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had -- who did and who did not have a potential link to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terrorism.  And in that situation, a decision to hold 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

everyone until cleared, to apply the hold-until-cleared 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy is best explained, not by invidious intent, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the desire to avoid the premature and inadvertent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

release of a dangerous terrorist. 

   

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  This went on for several

merger decision is early on in the -­

23 

            

24

Alderson Reporting Company

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  They were held longer, 

  

 

 

 

 

9

and there's no doubt that the clear -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No I can -­

   

  

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  -- longer than it 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

should. 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So I can understand after a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

bomb attack.  I can understand after a bomb attack and 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

3,000 people are killed.  I can understand that the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

first reaction of the law enforcement authorities is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pick up anybody you might think is connected, and we'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worry about the rest of it later. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

Now, eight months?  Now, what they do allege 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

is that Ashcroft and Mueller knew that the FBI had not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developed any reliable evidence -- that's 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph 67 -- tying the plaintiffs to terrorism, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized their prolonged detention, in restrictive 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions, and Mueller, it says, ordered that they be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kept in INS custody, and including the restrictive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions, even after local offices reported.  Ah, they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't say reported to whom, so that is a point in your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor, but that there was no reason to suspect them of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

terrorism. 

23 

            

But I think, fairly read, they are saying -­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

they -- okay.  They authorized it.  They knew that some 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these people had no information against them, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

answer is pick up anybody who might have a connection,

and then just keep them there?  I mean, that's what's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worrying me a lot.  And why doesn't that at least state

an allegation?

Suppose it had been five years.  Suppose it

with that and -- and if you know it, I can see it for a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day, two days.  Five years?  Eight months?  I mean, why 

    

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

isn't that an allegation that at least you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real-deal with on discovery and so forth? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, because I 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

think the core of the allegation against Ashcroft and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mueller is not that they prolonged the -- prolonged the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention.  The policy that they adopted in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

list-merger decision was facially constitutional because 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- and it -- because it adequately dealt with and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fully dealt with the dilemma that they faced. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  How long after 9/11 did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

they adopt that policy? 

 

 

 

20 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  I believe it was in

something that was done eight months down the road. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is something that was done as the officials are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to sort through how to respond to the very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult situation that the -- if you accept that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney general made the decision that he found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves in.  He had a list that was not fully vetted. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Some of the people on the list had ties to terrorism -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may have had ties to terrorism.  Some of them may well 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not have.  And what -- what -- in that situation, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application of the hold until it cleared policy.  Take a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breath.  Let's figure out what's going on.  Rather than 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

releasing everyone is -- was not -- not only doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raise a discriminatory inference, but it does not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

violate any clearly established right to have done that.

one thing, as Justice Breyer pointed out, to say you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initially hold these people.  But you know from day one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

that many of them have nothing to do with terrorists, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and yet you allow that system that might have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justified in October to persist for months and months 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when these people are being held in the worst possible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions of confinement.

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, they -­

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

well, they are being held in restrictive conditions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confinement, but those conditions are lawful as to folks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with individualized suspicion. 

 

 

12 

            

Now, the -- the -- there is -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

core of the claim that the Second Circuit saw against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Attorney General Ashcroft was the decision to submit the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals to the -- to the restrictive conditions in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first place.  And what I would say to that is, it -­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it understated -- it attempts to impose a 20/20 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

hindsight requirement on the attorney general and on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Director Mueller and Ziglar, who are -- who are involved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only as having, quote, "condoned the policy" that just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

doesn't exist. 

 

22 

            

The plaintiffs say, we had -- there were no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

allegations of terrorism ties against us, but, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, the attorney general didn't know that at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time.  What he had was a list that had some with ties 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

and some after.  And the policy to merge the list and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

hold until cleared was facially constitutional if it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took -- if there was -- in some instances took too long 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to clear.  And certainly, the OIG report suggests that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the case, that things did not run as smoothly as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they should have.  That is not something that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributable to -- to Attorney General Ashcroft, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Director Mueller, or to -- to Commissioner Ziglar.

But -­

 

10 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is the argument 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

you're presenting a -- a Bivens argument or a qualified 

   

   

   

 

 

 

12 

immunity argument? 

 

13 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, the 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

argument we've been discussing now is the qualified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity, Iqbal argument.  It's the personal 

  

 

 

 

 

participation.  But we do think the Bivens remedy should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be extended here at all.  It would be quite an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extension of Bivens, unprecedented, to apply this to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

national security and immigration policy decisions, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we think all three of those factors work together. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

With respect to national security, what this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Court has recognized is national security is committed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to congressional authority, that Congress is better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

placed to -- to decide the appropriate remedy.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for that is not only a matter of institutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

14 

1 

2 

3 

4 

competence, but that the risk of overdeterrence in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

national security context is a real one.  And it's one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress should make.  And that's, I think, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

core of this Court's decisions in Chappell and in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

Stanley. 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

              

I think the same is true with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy decisions more broadly.  Congress has provided a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy to challenge policy decisions in the APA.  And in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addition to that, policy decisions are much more likely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to receive attention as this set of policy decisions did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the OIG and from -- from Congress itself, and so -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is -- is there -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

the APA argument strikes me as -- as somewhat odd.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, the idea that the -- the people in prison are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed to say, let's look at the Administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

Procedures Act. 

 

17 

            

What about habeas?  Is that an available 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

remedy for them? 

 

 

19 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  It is an available 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

remedy, and indeed it was used here by -- invoked by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some and those folks were released.  And it -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does -- because the core of the complaint was you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding us without bond; we should be essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deported for the illegal remedies. 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

And so I do think that the availability both 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

of habeas here -- and I take Your Honor's -- I take Your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

Honor's admonition, but -- about the oddity of the APA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here -- but if the APA doesn't apply here, it's because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress provided it for policies and -- provided review 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for some policies, but not for all policies.  And that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is where -- that is the congressional judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

But it seems to me that -­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How could they have -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

how could they have access to habeas when they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

locked up without access to a lawyer, without access to

a telephone? 

 

12 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, there 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

were individuals who did file habeas petitions and -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and those individuals were largely released before the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims could be adjudicated.  But the point here is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that the -- that Bivens -- the extension of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens would really be quite extraordinary to a national 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

security and immigration policy context.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

immigration concerns, I think, do raise the exact same 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns, Your Honor, as the national security ones. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I suppose that in 1942, 

    

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

there was a president or a secretary of defense who 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

decided let's take 140,000 people -- 60,000, 70,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens and 60,000 noncitizens -- and lock them up for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ten years or five years or four years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

            

All right.  You go with habeas right at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

time.  You could understand how, in January of 1942, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be pretty tough for a judge in a district court to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start second-guessing people.  But several years later, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

people had the time to develop the information.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand what people knew then.  And they might find, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in some of those instances, there was no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justification whatsoever.  And I look at the Bivens 

   

  

 

 

 

 

remedy and say, one, it has a cautionary effect.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't deter where necessary, where necessary, and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where a big mistake was made, it has the possibility of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation later.  That's the whole argument, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

beware of cutting off Bivens, you never know what will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

happen. 

15 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

guess I would say a few things to that.  First of all, I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize Your Honor is not suggesting that this is -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

            

20 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, not at all. 

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  I -­

    

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I used a historic example 

    

   

 

 

21 

and I'm not worried about this case.

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  -- arrested for an

24

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, yeah.

17

3 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I'm worried about -­

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

Your Honor's hypo, I think it actually points up the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem with extending Bivens to national security 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy decisions and to policy decisions in general.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should not be, in the national security policy context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this Court should be calibrating the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterrence and underdeterrence and overdeterrence in 

 

 

 

 

 

that situation.  That is a judgment for Congress.  And 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

if Your Honor is serious about compensation -- and this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the problem with policies -- it should -- it can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really be the case that the right way to -- to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective compensation is to put the attorney general, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the director of the FBI, and the commissioner of the INS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personally on the hook for the whole class.

The secretary of the treasury -­

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

best authority you have for saying that, assuming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a Bivens action that has to be cut off at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower level of officials, it can't be to the highest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officials?  What -- what authority do we have? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  It's not the highest 

  

 

 

 

 

level of officials, Your Honor.  It's when there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broad national security policy, and I think that is what

this Court said on page 74 of Malesko, that the way we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge policy decisions is not through Bivens.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinarily through an injunction -- injunctive action.

wanted to begin with qualified immunity, in particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to the official conditions.  This case asks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court to hold the individual jailers are responsible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in damages for failing to overturn FBI terrorism 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classifications and the confinement conditions they 

 

 

 

 

 

produce.  But a reasonable jailer could have understood 

   

  

 

 

 

 

and believed it lawful in the circumstances of this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do as the BOP directed them, which is to hold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detainees in restrictive conditions based on those FBI 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designations until the FBI cleared -­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who determined the level 

  

 

 

 

 

of -- of restriction?  This -- this was not just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restriction.  This is --

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. LAMKEN:  Your Honor, the answer is that

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the BOP directed that you would use the most restrictive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions permissible.  The specific implementation was 

  

 

 

 

 

left to Mr. Hasty and Sherman.  But there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegation that the difference between -- that there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional conduct based on the difference between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the BOP directed and what the -- and what Mr. Hasty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Sherman did. 

 

 

            

The allegation here is that it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impermissible to impose these highly restrictive 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions because the FBI didn't actually have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information connecting these individuals to terrorism. 

 

 

 

 

 

And as -- and Mr. Hasty and Sherman somehow knew that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and as a result, it was impermissive -- impermissible to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose these conditions on these Respondents. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But that doesn't make any sense from a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plausibility perspective and it doesn't make any sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from a qualified immunity perspective.  Mr. Hasty and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Sherman are jailers.  They're expert in ensuring secure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions.  They are not trained in determining 

  

 

 

 

 

 

security classifications or connections to international 

 

 

 

 

 

terrorism.  They cannot be held liable for failing to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overturn the FBI's determinations. 

 

 

 

            

After all, just last week, this Court held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there's no clearly established law that requires an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

officer to overturn or second-guess the fellow officers' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions made in a particular context.  That just goes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

double when you're asking the jailers to overturn the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determinations made by the FBI.  The jailers don't get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to release people because they decide the court system 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got it wrong and that the people are actually innocent.

And -­

 

8 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about -- what about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

all the conduct that was not directed by the attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general or the FBI? 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think that 

    

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

that -- the most -- you're referring to the unofficial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions or the unauthorized abuses by individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

guards. 

15 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  Am I right that as 

   

  

  

 

 

 

16 

to those, the Second Circuit was unanimous? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. LAMKEN:  Yeah.  As to those, the Second 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Circuit was unanimous.  But they -- I think they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

overlooked one critical thing, and they tended to read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this complaint as if it were a complaint for injunctive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief.  There are a lot of things wrong.  They weren't 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

being redressed.  They should be redressed by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts.  But it's not.  This is actually an action for 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual damages against Mr. Hasty for conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed by others.  In order to establish a plausible 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

claim to that sort of relief, liability that he pays 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages for what others did, they would have to show 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Mr. Hasty not only knew that there was this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

misconduct, not only knew that he needed to intervene, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but that after he failed to intervene, then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs were injured as a result of the failure to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervene; that their injuries were caused by what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Hasty failed to do. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

            

And that's what's missing from the Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

Circuit's analysis and that's what's missing from the -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the complaint.  There's simply no temporal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection, no connection whatsoever between the -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're -- you're in 

  

 

 

 

 

charge of a detention facility, and all these things are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going on.  Prisoners are being knocked against walls, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their arms are being twisted.  There have been some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaints and nothing is done.  It continues to go on. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And the allegation is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

he deliberately did not take a routine inspection of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that particular portion of the prison in order to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willfully blind as to what was going on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, there's -- there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

doubt that misconduct occurred and there's no doubt that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Hasty actually sees the complaints, because that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the grievance process.  But what's missing from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

this is these individual plaintiffs being injured after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is brought to his attention.  If you review the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint, it doesn't have a moment where it says, this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

is when he learned and after that, we were injured. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's more of a blunderbuss that says, because there were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a lot of bad things happening, Mr. Hasty must be liable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for all of them. 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How could that pinpoint 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

one particular moment in time when this is ongoing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

behavior? 

11 

            

MR. LAMKEN:  And I think the answer is that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

you pinpoint his awareness and the injuries that these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents are claiming damages for. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And you say it in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

paragraph -- in paragraph 74, it says, "Indeed, after a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

few months of interacting with the plaintiffs, the MDC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants" -- I take it those are the people we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about -- "realized that they were not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terrorists, but merely immigration detainees; yet the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictive conditions and harsh treatment continued." 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

So what is that but an allegation that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

did know about it and they did continue the harsh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

treatment? 

24 

            

MR. LAMKEN:  So, Justice Breyer, referring 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

specifically to the unofficial abuses by the guards as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

opposed to the official conditions, temporarily, what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

missing there is what happened afterwards.  What were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

the -- what were the specific abuses he was aware of? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is this guard misconduct, or was it tapping the bars at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

night and keeping people awake?  And in -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It is their restrictive 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

conditions and harsh treatment.  And elsewhere -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

MR. LAMKEN:  That's true. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in the complaint they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

have a list. 

   

11 

            

MR. LAMKEN:  And that's exactly the 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

difficulty, is that he's aware of harsh treatment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally and, therefore, he must be liable for all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harsh treatment that occurs after that awareness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

You cannot say that here there is abuses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

generally with no particular time frame and then hold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him liable for every intentional tort that occurs in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institution.  And I think that paragraph 74 and 77, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

which the Second Circuit described as detailed, actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illustrate precisely the problem.  They don't say which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse he's aware of.  They don't say when, whether it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predates or postdates the claims that they have.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must prove facts that show that Mr. Hasty is personally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

responsible. 

25 

            

In fact, when they finally get to a date, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

24 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

which is paragraph 110 of the complaint, they say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

February 11, 2002.  Well, by February 14, 2002, four of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the six Respondents are already outside of ad max.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never explain why awareness on a time, after they're out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the institution, is a basis for holding Mr. Hasty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

liable. 

7 

            

If I could go back, however, to the official 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

conditions, Your Honor.  With respect to the official 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions, qualified immunity must be granted.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

simply no basis for saying that it is -- that every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable jailer would understand that they had to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their own determination that these were not terrorism 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detainees and overturn what the FBI was telling them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it's especially true given that the FBI was, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout this process, making determinations and 

 

 

 

 

 

clearing people.  There's no clearly established law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that requires jailers to be making those decisions for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FBI.  In fact, society would be ill served if we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked jailers to do that.  They're not experts in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international terrorism; they are experts in maintaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

security. 

22 

            

Finally, if I can end up where the acting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

solicitor general began, and that is with respect to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope of Bivens.  Special factors in this case, counsel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hesitation.  Congress ran the court tested aside, what

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

25

are the consequences of saying that individual jailers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody all the way at the bottom of that food chain, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must second-guess the FBI?  What are the consequences 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the government's ability to have a coherent response 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a national terrorist attack?  That is precisely the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

type of thing that Congress, rather than the courts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

should decide. 

 

8 

            

In addition, the linchpin of the claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

against the -- against these individuals is that the FBI 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had gotten these things wrong.  That means that they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to need to prove, plaintiffs want to prove that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FBI had things wrong.  It implicates -- cases like

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if the official

18 

policy that was adopted that we want to beat the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoners, you know, every day and that was the FBI 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy and it's communicated down, the prison 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrator has no choice but to carry out that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

policy? 

20 

            

MR. LAMKEN:  No, Your Honor.  I think in 

    

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

terms of there being a facially unlawful command, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is where you don't have qualified immunity.  But there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing facially unlawful that says impose the most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictive conditions permissible based on FBI 

 

 

 

 

 

designations until the individual is cleared by the FBI. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

And, boy, we all wish the FBI had been acting faster and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these individuals could have been removed more quickly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

But that's not at the feet of the individual jailers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Their job is to maintain secure conditions, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what they were doing.

And with respect to Bivens, Your Honor, the

20 

illegality or lawfulness of the conduct challenged isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the determination of whether or not Bivens should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extended to a new location -- a new context or not. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

What determines that is whether or not this Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the institutional competence to make the decision, or it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the sort of decision that Congress should make.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially since cases like this one are turning on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not the FBI was right or not in its terrorism 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designations, that implicates potentially sensitive 

 

 

 

 

intelligence information.  If that is going to be pulled 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into a lawsuit, courts should not be in the business of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creating those lawsuits and creating possible risks for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intelligence information.  That is precisely the sort of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision that Congress rather than the courts should -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Anything about the

23

hypothetical I gave, of course, is a real one, not this 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  But if you cut Bivens off totally, what prevents 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that from recurring?

there's an FTCA claim that was brought by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predecessors of these plaintiffs in which they recovered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money on in a settlement.  There are lots of remedies 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that occur.  And, indeed, in this case with respect to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the individual guards, there was a lawsuit against them 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a third amended complaint.  The OIG report

Under Petitioners' theory, any Muslim or

Arab noncitizen present in this country could be placed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for months in solitary confinement for violating the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration law.  But this Court has a historic role to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

play in ensuring that race and religion do not take the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

place of legitimate grounds for suspicion and in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterring future Federal officials from creating

8 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does that role 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

include the shaping and an announcement, really, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private damages remedies?  We've been very explicit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about the restraint in extending the Bivens action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond its original contours. 

 

 

 

13 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  That's correct, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

Justice.  And we don't believe that this requires any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extension of Bivens whatsoever.  When this Court heard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Iqbal, the Court distinguished between Mr. Iqbal's claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of religious discrimination, which the Court assumed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have required an extension of Bivens, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court assumed that it would be so extended because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue was not directly argued before the Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

But the Court treated differently 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Mr. Iqbal's claim for an equal protection violation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noting that the Court had allowed Bivens claims for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal protection violations under Davis.  And there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way to read the distinction between those two claims in

Iqbal, other than that an equal protection claim, such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the one these Respondents have, arises in a familiar 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens context.  The Court has, in the past, allowed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison conditions claims for -- under Bivens.  There is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing new here. 

 

 

            

Now, what Petitioners are -­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That -- that was -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was failure to give medical treatment. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  That's correct in Carlson. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And there's -- there's 

  

 

 

 

 

been Bivens, the gender discrimination case, and Coleman 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v. Miller, I think, the -- the medical -- denial of

medical treatment.

MS. MEEROPOL:  Carlson, yes. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the -- but -- yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

But we've been very careful in subject and places to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, we go no further.  This is for the Congress. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think you're asking us to go further.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think what you're asking for is a legitimate argument 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with many valid points to it, but you're asking for us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to create a new Bivens cause of action. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  Well, if it is a new Bivens 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

cause of action, Your Honor, I submit that it is an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate one here. 

 

 

            

Now, what the DOJ Petitioners argue is that

Bivens should not be extended because they were setting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

national security and immigration policy.  But the core 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of our complaint is that there was no sensitive national 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

security judgments being exercised.  No one was being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

vetted.  No one was determined to be a threat. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

This is not a situation where the Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

would have to look into sensitive national security 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determinations that were made.  Rather, if there was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

national security judgment exercised, it was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment that, in this case, race or religion could play 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the part of legitimate suspicion; could play a proxy, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and exploring that -­

 

 

 

13 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not sure I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

understand your point.  It was -- it was the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implementation of national security policy in response 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the 9/11 attacks, and the -- it was to detain people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Every one of the individuals detained was in violation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of their immigration status; right? 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  That's correct, your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It was to detain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

those individuals until they were properly cleared and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be -- could be released.  Now, you may disagree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that approach to the policy, but what concerns me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and why the restraint is appropriate in the Bivens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, is that it is a way of challenging national

policy through damages actions against the individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implementing it.  And I think that is an extraordinary 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

departure from where we have recognized Bivens remedies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the past. 

 

 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  This does arise in a national 

   

  

 

 

 

 

security context.  Mitchell v. Forsyth also arose in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

national security context.  The question is whether the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

national security context of these detentions, the type 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of determinations that were being made, are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determinations that are unsuited for Bivens because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either they should be left to Congress or they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside of this Court's core competence.  And I would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

submit that this is precisely the kind of examination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is within this Court's core competence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess my point 

    

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

is -- is a different one.  I understand the argument 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

that there are constitutional violations.  But the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question that you're asking the Court to do is to shape 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a remedy for that, a remedy that Congress has not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided.  And to look at it in the simplest terms, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, it has been 40-whatever years since we adopted an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach to implied rights of action under statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where we say if Congress wants people to be allowed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring individual damages actions, they pretty much have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say so. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

7

approach here except, of course, you're dealing with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution.  And the idea that the Court lacks the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institutional competency, okay, there's -- there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional claim against a national policy.  We 

   

  

 

 

 

think the best way to consider that constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge is to allow people to sue individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible for implementing it for damages. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You shape the policy, the national 

 

 

 

 

 

government in response to 9/11, therefore, you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay money because it's been a determination that that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

was unconstitutional.

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  Well, it is certainly true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that the Court has stepped back from freely implying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private causes of action.  But in every Bivens case that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has come before this Court, the Court has still engaged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the two-step inquiry, looked to see whether there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special factors that should keep the Court from staying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its hand and weighed the -- the interest on the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side of the equation, too.  And each time, the Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reemphasized that Bivens is about deterring individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal officer misconduct. 

 

 

            

Now, when a -- when a Federal official 

   

   

 

 

 

creates an unconstitutional policy, he's creating 

 

 

 

 

 

policy, but he is also acting as an individual to

violate what in this case would have to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly-established constitutional norms. 

 

 

3 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand that. 

    

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

But the point made by your friend on the other side, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though, of overdeterrence, when you have the attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general, the director of the FBI, the director of INS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sitting down and making -- what are we going to do to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respond to this crisis, and -- and people in the -- were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- old enough, 9/11, sort of have a better sense of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what that crisis was like. 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

And if you imply a Bivens actions, one of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

the things they're going to enter into, what is best, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what is appropriate, and presumably also, what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional.  They're going to say, well, gosh, if, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, I'm wrong, I'm going to -- I'm going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued, not because I'm the attorney general, but as an -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as an individual.  And -- and part of the policy that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've announced is that we don't want people forming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy to have to worry about they're going to have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- to pay if the -- if the policy is found infirm. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  I have two responses to that, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

22 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

23 

            

First of all, qualified immunity creates a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

powerful protection for Federal officials who are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undertaking a good-faith effort to protect our national 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

security, which everyone agrees is of paramount concern, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

but who do so believing their actions to be lawful, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they are mistaken.  There is already that incredibly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

substantial protection.

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Second, I don't believe that it would be a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

threat to the republic to provide the attorney general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with incentives to not create policy that violates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly-established law.  I see the threat coming from 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the other side. 

 

 

              

I -- I would like to make sure to take the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time to correct -­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll ask you one other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

thing, which is, has this been fully argued out below? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, I think it is an enormously important and very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open question.  And we can say on the one hand, just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what was said.  I think everything the Chief Justice 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

said is true.  There is a problem, in this time, of real 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

national emergency, to overdeter people from doing what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they reasonably think is necessary.  And they have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority for security, not the judges. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

At the same time, the law of this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correctly, I think is, but there's no blank check even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the President.  And if there's no blank check, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means sometimes they can go too far.  And if they have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gone too far, it is our job to say that.

Now, there are considerable advantages, as I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

2 

3 

4

6 

pointed out, saying, at the time they're going to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes, because there's a big frightening thing happening. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

But maybe they went too far too fast, and then this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offers a remedy later and maybe the deterrence is good. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Okay?  You see both sides. 

  

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Has that been fully argued 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

in this case?  If I go and look in the record, can I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find a question that I have wondered about for quite a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

long time fully answered? 

 

 

 

12 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  I -- I don't believe so. 

    

   

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

I -- I think the question you're posing is whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages would actually be a less intrusive remedy in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this situation than allowing for an injunctive relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim at the outset, if I understand your -- your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

question correctly. 

 

18 

            

19 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  In a set of cases. 

   

  

 

 

 

MS. MEEROPOL:  And -- and yes.  No.  I don't 

    

  

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

believe that that has been fully addressed below.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit, of course, found that no extension of Bivens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was required.  So the circuit didn't engage in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis of whether, if an extension is required, one in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this situation would be called for.

My -- my friend argued, both on reply and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

36 

from the podium, that -- that even -- that -- that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case cannot be distinguished from Iqbal.  But what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguishes this case from Iqbal is that we -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents have a factual allegation that the DOJ 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners' policy was to target Muslims and Arabs for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harsh treatment, and that they imposed this treatment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowing there was no reason to suspect Respondents of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ties to terrorism.

17

25 

Petitioners, DOJ Petitioners, had known that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- that -- had known that many were arrested without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an articulable tie to terrorism, that the Petitioners 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had reason to believe that some among that group might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have potential ties to terrorism, and that explains the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harsh treatment without raising an inference of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory intent, but I don't believe that is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair reading of the complaint or the OIG report. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                         

Respondents allege in paragraph 

 

 

 

47 that Petitioners received detailed daily reports of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the arrests and the detentions, and that they learned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the FBI had no basis to suspect Respondents and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class of ties to terrorism.  There was no reason to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that any of these individuals were -- had an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

articulate -- that there was an articulated basis to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspect them of ties to terrorism.

adequate remedies.  Can you tell me, as Justice Ginsburg 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed out, we didn't -- these detainees didn't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access to the outside.  Were there any legal proceedings 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed, injunctive proceedings, after say month 2, month 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3, and were -- were those remedies completely added to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district courts to look at this and say that we're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to give relief? 

 

 

 

9 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  There were some habeas 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

petitions filed.  In general, the government's response 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to those petitions being filed was to move the detainee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up to the front of the list, to clear him so that he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be removed from the country and from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictive conditions of confinement before a court 

   

 

 

 

 

could have the opportunity to rule on the legality of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the detention.  And importantly, those habeas petitions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were about the -- the right to detain these people in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself, not about conditions of confinement. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It is still not clear today that one can use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a habeas petition to challenge conditions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confinement, and it wasn't clear in the Second Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the time either.  So while habeas petitions were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed eventually, when some detainees finally had access 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to counsel, although restricted access, those -- those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitions were not actually ruled on by a court.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

court -- no court had the opportunity to determine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

whether what was happening to the detainees was lawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not, and that was part of DOJ Petitioners' entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy of harsh treatment.  It was not just to impose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maximum pressure.  It was also, as we allege in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph 61, to keep the detainees from accessing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

outside world. 

 

8 

            

Now, my friend argued that the DOJ 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

Petitioners cannot be on the hook for the substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due process claim in this case, a claim which was not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented in Iqbal.  There was no conditions claim in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Iqbal, just the equal protection claim, because the -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the DOJ Petitioners did not set all the details 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the restrictive conditions of confinement. 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

But their order itself, paragraph 61, 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

requires keeping individuals in solitary confinement, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isolation.  That is the way within the prison system 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people are kept from accessing the outside world.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot be done in a general population unit.  So an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

order that requires solitary confinement for individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who are arrested in connection with the terrorism 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation, but whom the attorney general and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other DOJ Petitioners know there is no nondiscriminatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason to suspect of any ties to terrorism, that states 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the substantive due process claim.  That is so excessive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

39 

1 

as to be arbitrary and punitive. 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

This is what the panel found so compelling, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3

9 

10 

I believe, about the merger of the New York list and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

national list, that it was not a situation where some of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the men on that list perhaps hadn't been vetted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rather, the entire list, 300 men, were people for whom 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FBI had not stated any interest or lack of interest. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it was this list of men who we allege Attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General Ashcroft ordered should be treated as of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest to the 9/11 investigation. 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If -- if we -- if we hold 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

that our previous cases instruct that we should not go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further with Bivens, you still have Section 1985(3). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Can officials conspire with each other?

MS. MEEROPOL:  It -- in this case -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In your favor? 

  

 

 

 

MS. MEEROPOL:  Yes.  What the circuit held 

  

  

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

as to that is that the question of whether officials can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspire with each other is so fact-intensive and had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been so inconclusively briefed in the district court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet it was required to remand back to the district to

determine sort of how they might have conspired with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each other, whether -- what their positions were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vis-à-vis each other such that a 1985 claim would be

appropriate.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there precedent in your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

favor on this point that there can be this conspiracy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if -- if it's established by the facts? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  Yes.  And I believe the case 

   

  

  

 

 

 

is cited by the Second Circuit, by the panel, our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent in our favor for that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what is so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact-intensive about the argument that government 

 

 

 

 

 

officials -- the government is the entity and officials 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within that same entity don't conspire among themselves, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're just doing their -- doing their jobs? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  Well, I think it depends on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the role of the high-level officials vis-à-vis the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

low-level officials at the Metropolitan Detention 

 

 

 

 

 

Center.  Certainly, we argue that officials at such 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disparate levels of the federal government, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vast, could -- could be held to have conspired with each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.  But I don't think it is an argument that was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fully developed before the district court, and that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the circuit held, and that's why it should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remanded to the circuit and that -- remanded to the

8 

9 

10 

              

I want to make sure to address the arguments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the MDC Petitioners, because, really, their argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about extending Bivens -- about not extending Bivens for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the claims against those officials is very different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the argument by the DOJ Petitioners.  Every judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who has considered the issue has agreed that the claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Hasty and Sherman were deliberately indifferent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months of physical and verbal abuse arise in a familiar 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens context and should be allowed to go forward. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

13 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's Carlson v. Green? 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. MEEROPOL:  Yes, exactly. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the -- the 

    

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

Second Circuit majority said yes as to Hasty, Hasty, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliberate indifference, but not as to Sherman. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  That's correct.  I must have 

    

  

 

 

 

17 

misspoke.  I apologize. 

    

18 

            

Yes.  The deliberate indifference claim goes 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

forward against Hasty, and then there were the claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against Hasty and Sherman for the official conditions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center.  These 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are claims that the men were held in solitary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confinement for months, deprived of sleep, deprived of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise.  This is not just the MDC Petitioners in -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following the orders from their superiors in the Bureau 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review

of Prisons.  They created the actual conditions of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

confinement. 

42 

3 

            

There is nothing in the record to suggest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

that the BOP ordered that all of the conditions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents were subjected to, lights on in their cells 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 hours a day while they were in solitary confinement, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the solitary confinement continue without any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individualized review.  There's nothing in the record. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, would that -- were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

they -- were those conditions constitutional as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals about whom the FBI had reasonable suspicion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a connection with terrorism? 

   

 

 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  That would depend.  Placement 

  

  

 

 

 

in solitary confinement, if it is incredibly prolonged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and incredibly restrictive, may be unconstitutional for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody.  We don't concede that the conditions -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is your argument dependent 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

on that? 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  No -­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  The proposition that it 

  

 

 

 

 

would be unconstitutional even as to those who have -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to whom the FBI had reasonable suspicion? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  No.  And that brings up an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

incredibly important point that I want to make sure to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get out, which is that we disagree with the MDC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Petitioners' statement that there was a terrorism 

   

 

 

 

 

43 

designation here, that there was reason to believe that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of the 9/11 detainees had ties to terrorism. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

There was no designation.  What there was is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

the fact that some men were arrested in connection to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the terrorism investigation. 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  The whole position as I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

understand it, the way it was presented today, was that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FBI had a list and the -- there was no way they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could determine what degree of information the FBI had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to any particular person. 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  But they were told what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

information the FBI was relying on.  That's in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph 70, it's 71 through 74 of our complaint, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually a liaison to the headquarters investigation was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

providing the MDC with information about all the men. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  With all the information? 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

Do you -- you think that the FBI in a -- in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sensitive -- investigation of something sensitive like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this about terrorism would necessarily have told people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at MDC every bit of information they had connecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people with -- with terrorism? 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  Well, our factual allegation 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

was that they were told all the information that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant to the threat that the men posed to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

institution. 

44 

2 

            

And also important here is what the OIG has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

explained about the meaning of the -- of the of-interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designation.  Being determined by the FBI to be of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest to the 9/11 investigation meant only that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were not, not of interest.  This is not just something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was happening in New York.  The OIG quotes the head 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the national security unit of the INS, who explains 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if the FBI could not state whether or not it had an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in an individual, that individual was held as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of interest to the 9/11 investigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

So even if there is word being sent out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13

that, you know, these men are of interest to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation, we have to be careful with them, what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MDC Petitioners received was that of-interest 

 

 

 

 

 

designation, which meant very little based on the policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being applied here.  And then they received the detailed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information; for example, that Ahmed Khalifa was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrested -- was encountered by the FBI in the context of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 9/11 investigation, had violated the immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, and that the FBI might be interested in him.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the actual information that was provided that we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made available in the complaint.

on the floor.  They find it.  And there might be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another.  Would they be justified in taking into custody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

every single person in that rooming house and looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into it?  I mean, for how long?  Would you say to them, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no, you can't do it because we don't know, there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people on the floor, they knew nothing about them, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually.  They admit it.  We knew nothing about them. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

All we know is they're in the rooming house.

JUSTICE BREYER:  And we also know there was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

a nuclear weapon.  And that isn't totally fanciful; it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could happen.  And -- and so what are they supposed to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do and how long? 

 

 

 

14 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  Well, we don't challenge the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

fact that these men were detained at all.  And we don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge that they were investigated while they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detained.  So even if they had been detained -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, some of them were up to eight months, which is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long period of time, and there's no challenge to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention in this case.  The challenge is to the way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were treated while they were detained.  That if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need to investigate after a national security emergency, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there are a lot of tools at the government's disposal to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

do so. 

 

25 

            

What you cannot do is single out a group of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

people whom you know there is no basis to suspect them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

of any ties to terrorism beyond sharing racial and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious characteristics with the 9/11 hijackers, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide that that group of people poses such a threat 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they must be placed in the most restrictive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions of confinement that exist in the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system while we take the time, eight months, up to eight 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months, to determine whether there actually is any basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to suspect them of anything other than an immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation.  And at the end of the day, oh, actually, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there wasn't.  Everybody was cleared and deported, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one would expect from a policy that is not based on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigating based on actual suspicion, but is rather a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blunderbuss attempt to gather all of the Muslim and Arab 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noncitizens whom one has authority over by virtue of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their immigration detentions, and -- and hold them in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictive conditions of confinement while they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated as suspected terrorists.

20

the Bivens questions, and that's about whether Bivens is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate for altering policy.  I don't know if I was 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

able to get this point out as well as I'd like to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before.  To -- to explain, I don't think that there is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really any precedent for the idea that you can't use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens to deter creation of a clearly unconstitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

policy.  And if -- if the Court did rule in that way, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

what would there be to deter the creation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional policies in the future?  Now, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

course, policies can be stopped as they are ongoing, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that does not protect the individual against whom, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, potential serious law enforcement action has been

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I suppose one 

   

  

 

 

 

answer would be the normal injunctive action would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge the constitutionality of the policy, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would seem, at least at first blush, to be a more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate way of doing it than to -- than individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages actions against officials responsible. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

MS. MEEROPOL:  But an injunctive -- an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

injunctive claim, while it could stop, currently, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current unconstitutional conduct cannot deter future 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional conduct from occurring.  It doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

deter the future attorney general from creating an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional policy.  And if national security 

  

 

 

 

 

policy is somehow insulated from judicial review without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even a determination that this is the type of national 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

security policy where we could expect there could -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there should be sensitive judgments made, if -- if in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that situation there is no Bivens remedy, then there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times when the Court will play no -- will be able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

play no role in reviewing what has occurred, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

the -- the individuals simply can't get into court fast 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough.  Maybe in a situation like this, they're denied 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

from getting into court for a period of time.  And then 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when they finally do, the claim that the way that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've been treated is stopped.  You know, they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

released; someone else is picked up instead.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

never a chance to actually undertake judicial analysis 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of what has been occurring.

10 

            

If qualified immunity justifies what was 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

done here, or if Petitioners have not plausibly alleged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a claim, those are bases to affirm the circuit.  But if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is no cause of action at all, if individuals who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the subject of clearly unconstitutional national 

 

 

 

 

 

 

security policy don't even have the opportunity to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the court, then there is nothing to deter even more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excessive exercises of government power in the future. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18

If there are no further questions.

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

              

A few quick points. 

 

 

49 

2 

            

First, a few short corrections of the 

   

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

record, although I apologize for the confusion about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

date.  It's not in the complaint, the date of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list-merger decision.  The OIG report suggests it was on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

November 2nd. 

 

7 

            

And then just, Justice Ginsburg, you had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

asked about the warden visits.  J.A. page 224, it says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on September 20, 2001, various wardens, including MDC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Warden Zenk, reestablished legal visits, legal telephone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calls, and legal mail for the September 11 detainees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

14 

            

15 

that? 

16 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was -­

  

 

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  I'd like to make -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the date of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  That was September 20, 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

2001.  And it's on page 224 of the Joint Appendix. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

            

Three points on the law. 

 

 

 

 

First, this would be a massive extension of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Bivens.  Malesko said, Justice Kennedy, you had asked, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that unlike a Bivens remedy, which we have never 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered a proper vehicle for altering an entity's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

policy, injunctive relief has long been recognized as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proper means for doing so.  That makes good sense. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It cannot be that the secretary of the treasury, who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

promulgates a policy that's later found 

   

 

 

 

50 

unconstitutional, could be liable personally to all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

banks for the unconstitutional policy. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

Bivens is not -- Justice Breyer, absence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

Bivens is not lawlessness.  It is not a blank check, and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is incorrect as -- to say that there's no way to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into court.  The way to get into court to challenge a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy is through an APA; it's through injunctive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

relief. 

10 

            

And although my friend on the other side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

suggests that a damages remedy is not a threat to the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

republic or a less-intrusive remedy, that's exactly 

   

 

 

 

 

the -- the judgment that this Court is ill-equipped 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to make, and that Congress should make. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

With respect to 1985(3), Justice Kennedy, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

want to make just one quick point, which is that the -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the DOJ defendants would be -- and all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants would be subject to qualified immunity for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1985(3) because it was not clear that officials within a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate unit could -- could conspire with each other. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's case law suggesting they couldn't.  And it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unclear, specifically in the Second Circuit, whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1985(3) applied at all to Federal officials.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualified immunity would eliminate the 1985(3) claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

And then if I could close with the -- the --

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

the Iqbal pleading and what we're talking about here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The -- the other side has made clear they're not talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the initial treatment and they're not even talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the length of time.  They're talking about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions of confinement and the fact that conditions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that could lawfully be imposed with people in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individualized suspicion were imposed on a much broader 

   

 

 

 

 

 

group.  But I submit that that ignores the perspective 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that the attorney general, even assuming that he was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person who made the policy decision, which, as Judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Raggi suggested, we should not assume -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just one point on -- on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

1985.  The fact that it wasn't clear that there was a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy under 1985, it doesn't follow -- it wasn't clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there wasn't a right that was being violated. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

            

18 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  That -- so -­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's different. 

  

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  With respect to the 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

interagency conspiracy, I think that suggests even the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

right wasn't involved.  And if the statute doesn't -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not clear the statute applies at all to them, we do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that's a situation in which qualified immunity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

23 

would attach. 

 

24 

            

But just to close what -- with what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

attorney general knew.  The attorney general knew that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

he had aliens who were legally detained as out of status 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and had been arrested in connection with Pent-Bomb, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

restrictive conditions of confinement -- not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful -- the unofficial conditions which have no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection to my clients, but the restrictive conditions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of confinement were okay for some with individualized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspicion, but he had no way to know which ones were and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which ones were not subject to that condition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

            

In that situation, he made the decision to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

subject the whole group to a hold-until-cleared policy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

until they could figure it out. 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

The idea that because in 20/20 hindsight we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

can identify the particular individuals who were not -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had not -- were not connected at all to terrorism and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thus wrongly detained does not change the reasonableness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of his judge -- of his judgment.  The fact that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't infer putative intent and discriminatory content 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the -- intent -- and the fact that it was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established at the list-merger decision, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is what -- a core of what the Second Circuit decided, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the list-merger decision was unconstitutional when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

made. 

23 

24 

25 

            

If there are no further questions.
