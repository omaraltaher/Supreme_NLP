 MR. GUERRA:  We -- we think, Justice 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, there is a 

commercial component, but there appears to be a 

1  bulk use of DMV information, which is clear from the 
2  fact that it's focusing on marketing and solicitation

4  very much aimed at use of DMV information --

14  under the noscitur a sociis principle that we are

there. 

1  driving, they want to market against -- for their health 
2  insurance processes versus private processes for State 
3  drug provided --
4
 MR. GUERRA:  Justice Sotomayor, I believe 
what your first question sounded -- your first example 
5
6  sounded like it was a noncommercial use.  I think that 
7  in the -- in the case where the State is acting as a 
8  commercial entity, the same rules we would -- we would 
9  apply with respect to lawyer solicitation would apply 
10
11
 And the reason I say that -- and the reason 
12  I think it's so clear that Congress intended that really 
13  lies in the language of Subsection (b)(2) because, 
14  there, Congress made clear that it understood that these 
15
16  in fact, that the consent requirement governs all 
17  commercial bulk use, absent an explicit exception. 
 And, if you take a look, it's in the second 
18
19  page of the addendum to our opening brief.  And it says 
20
21  with matters of motor vehicle market research activity, 
22  including survey research." 
23
24  because a commercial bulk survey using personal 
25

provisions are not wholly independent permissions and, 

that, "Personal information may be used in connection 

 Congress included the survey research clause 

information would otherwise be governed by (b)(12)'s 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1  consent requirement, and so Congress had to make clear 
2  that it was creating an exception for one industry to 
3  engage in this one particular type of bulk use. 
4
research clause means that is because, under 
5
6  Respondent's interpretation, it has no affect 
7  whatsoever.  If -- if, as they say, each of these 
8  clauses is wholly independent and sufficient to 
9  authorize whatever it covers, a phrase covering "in 
connection with matters of motor vehicle market research 
10
11  activities" would, in and of itself, cover the subset of 
12  motor vehicle market research survey research. 
13
14  understand that it's overriding the express consent 
15
16  when you look at the other provisions that might 
17  authorize bulk commercial use, find a comparably 
18  explicit authorization, and you can't find that in 
19  (b)(4).  (B)(4) says nothing about solicitation, much 
20
21
22  litigation in connection" --
23
24
25

 MR. GUERRA:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Not only ongoing 

requirement of (b)(12) and -- such that you now have to, 

less bulk solicitation.  And --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It says, "anticipation of

overrides (b)(12)'s express consent requirement. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. -- Mr. Guerra, I have to 

 MR. GUERRA:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  But my 

1  anticipation of litigation. 
2
3  point is that, in (b)(2), you find an explicit 
4  authorization for survey research, which is one of the 
very three topics covered in (b)(12) itself.  When you 
5
6  look at (b)(4), you don't see anything about 
7  solicitation, which is the kind of explicit override 
8  that (b)(2) indicates Congress wanted or -- or is 
9  necessary in order to conclude that another subsection 
10
11
12  admit that, given what a mess this statute is, those 
13  three words don't quite do it for me.  So, I mean, 
14  the -- the argument against you, right, is -- as to 
using (b)(12) to define (b)(4), is that, look, this is 
15
16  just a list of exceptions to a general prohibition, and 
17  no one is more general or specific than any other, and 
18  all you have to do is fit within one of them.  And it 
19  doesn't matter whether you don't fit within two of them, 
20
21
22  covered by (b)(4) or not?  If not, are you covered by 
23  (b)(12) or not? 
24
25

respect, number one, I don't think you can so readily 

if you don't fit within one of them. 

 So then the question would be:  Are you

dismiss the -- the interpretive import of those three 
words because they don't have any function other than to 
override the express consent requirement in (b)(12). 
And, if there is no need -- if (b)(12) doesn't apply to 
any other subsection, there is no need to be overriding 
it in (b)(2). 

But we don't rely solely on that -- the 
force of those three words.  It's also the case that 
(b)(2) -- excuse me, (b)(12) is one of the core 
provisions of the statute, in the sense that it's aimed 
at one of the fundamental problems that prompted passage 
of the Act in the first place, which was DMVs collecting 
information, then making it available to direct 
marketers. 

And so you are in a situation where you've 

got a core restriction aimed at a core problem this 

Statute 

is designed to -- to resolve, but -- whereas (b)(4) is 
one of the few subsections that authorize access to the 
most sensitive information that Congress -- excuse me, 
that DMVs were -- were collecting. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's kind of hard to 
argue, when you have (b)s (1) through (14), that (b)(12) 
is the core provision.  Usually, it's -- it's 1 of 14 
items in a list. 

MR. GUERRA:  Mr. Chief Justice, what I mean

 by that is that we know it's -- it's core in the sense 
 that it's aimed at one of the core problems that 
 Congress was addressing.  And (b)(4), by contrast, is 
 one of the few provisions in which Congress authorized 
access to the most sensitive information DMVs collect, 
 such as medical and disability status and Social 
 Security numbers. 

 And we submit it's simply implausible to 

 think that a Congress concerned with undue 
public/private access to DMV information would, in the 
 same statute, grant lawyers the right -- a unique right, 
 to use that highly sensitive information in order to 
 engage in bulk solicitation. 

 And, in fact, the legislative record here is 

devoid of any evidence that Congress was aware that 
 lawyers ever made use of DMV information for 
 solicitation, much less that -- or that they 
 contemplated it, much less that Congress made a 
 conscious decision to allow them to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you recognize that you 

 could use (b)(4) to identify class members? 

 MR. GUERRA:  We do, Your Honor.  And -- and 

 that's -- that is because that is not a solicitation. 
 That class notice is advising people who are not aware 
that there is pending litigation that could affect their 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 rights. 

Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So -- so if it's -- if 

 it's a solicitation, suppose this information was a -- the 
 recent automobile purchaser was asked:  Did you buy a 
car recently?  Were you charged this additional fee? 
 Period.  That would be okay? 

 MR. GUERRA:  Your Honor, yes.  It would be 

 okay -- well, let me just say if -- if the person --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That would come under 

(b)(4)? 

 MR. GUERRA:  Justice Ginsburg, if I may just 
 qualify my answer, yes, if you were investigating claims 
 on behalf of a potential client.  I don't think -- I 
 don't think people can just go down to the DMV and 
answer questions of personal interests to themselves --
 or lawyers, for that matter.  But that is an instance in 
 which you are simply engaging in investigation, assuming 
 that you are investigating a possible lawsuit, and not a 
 circumstance in which you are engaging in solicitation. 
And that is a fundamental difference. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, aren't we going to 

 be told the whole essence of the class action is you 
 have to see if there is an injury that goes beyond some 
 particular clients that you know.  And isn't this --
isn't this investigation in anticipation?

 MR. GUERRA:  Your Honor -- Justice Kennedy, 

 if they had limited their activities to conducting an 
 investigation, to determine the scope of a potential 
 claim, we would have no quarrel with that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the anticipation is, 

 are -- are you willing to join the class? 

 MR. GUERRA:  But that --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Isn't that critical? 
 MR. GUERRA:  No -- no, Justice Kennedy, I 

don't think so.  And I think the point of (b)(4) is it's 
 focused on proceedings, not on lawyers.  And it's 
 asking -- its basic goal is to ensure that tribunals can 
 do their job. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I do think you are 
helped somewhat by the -- the chronological progression 
 here, is it including the service of process, which 
 means the case has already started, and then 
 investigation in anticipation of the litigation that 
 follows the service of process. 

So it -- it is true that there is a 

 chronological aspect.  In order, it seems to me, for the 
 Respondents to prevail, they have to say that 
 investigation in anticipation of litigation also 
 precedes service of process. 

MR. GUERRA:  They would, and I think they do

 make that argument, Justice Kennedy.  My point is that 
 the focus of (b)(4) is on the tribunals, in ensuring 
 that they have -- they can have the information, that 
 they can do their job, which is to make and enforce 
judgments.  Lawyers get information under (b)(4) when 
 they act as officers of these tribunals, not for their 
 own commercial benefit.  When --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Guerra, where do you get 

 that from, in (b)(4), this focus on tribunals, rather 
than lawyers?  Because -- you know, the -- the 
 investigation is done by lawyers, right?  And that's a 
 critical part of (b)(4), so where -- where does that 
 come from in the statute? 

 MR. GUERRA:  It comes from the phrase "for 

use in connection with any civil, criminal, 
 administrative or arbitral proceeding in any Federal, 
 State, or local court or agency."  And --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But then it includes things 

 that are clearly done by lawyers. 

MR. GUERRA:  Right.  My point is that 

 lawyers get access when they act as officers of those 
 tribunals, not for their own commercial self-interests. 
 And an investigation in anticipation of litigation is an 
 obligation that all lawyers have, to ensure that they 
have a well-founded factual basis for bringing a lawsuit

 in the first instance. 

Official 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, are -- are you 

 saying that the study must be either a solicitation or 
 an investigation?  It can't be both?  Why can't it be 
both? 

 MR. GUERRA:  Because, Justice Kennedy, the 

 DM -- the DPPA is designed to -- it was aiming at a 
 fundamental problem of private individuals obtaining DMV 
 information for commercial solicitation purposes.  And 
Congress, we know, wanted to stop that in the absence 
 of consent.  So -- by the same token, they wanted to 
 make sure that they weren't intruding on the information 
 that courts and other tribunals need to do their jobs. 

 And so the -- the distinction is you can 

engage in an investigation because that's acting as an 
 officer of the court, in order to help the court 
 ultimately render its judgment. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's why -- would 
 you -- I want to make sure I understood your prior 
answer.  You said, I thought, that it would have been 
 okay to get the information from the bureau and then 
 ask, did you buy a car recently?  Did you have this 
 additional charge?  Now, suppose -- you said that was 
 all right? 

MR. GUERRA:  That -- Justice Ginsburg, I

 apologize if I am not making myself clear enough.  The 
 vital distinction is between investigative activity to 
 ensure that you have a well-founded basis to file a 
 lawsuit, versus solicitation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, isn't that --

 wasn't that crystal-clear here?  Because the dealers 
 were saying, you can't go forward unless you have a 
 plaintiff to match every dealer.  You're trying to bring 
 a representative action, but your list of plaintiffs, 
none of them bought from Dealer Z.  So we are 
 investigating to see if we can have a representative 
 action with a line-up of plaintiffs, each of whom has 
 purchased from a list of defendants. 

 MR. GUERRA:  Justice Ginsburg, determining 

that there are -- there are enough plaintiffs to justify 
 a class or group action is the -- the investigative 
 activity, but, when you go on to invite them -- and the 
 Fourth Circuit ruled that these letters were 
 solicitations, and that ruling is not before this Court 
at this point --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, suppose we had --
 what -- it was limited to did you buy the car, did you 
 pay the fee?  And then somebody who --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We -- we have just those 

 questions, no -- are you interested in joining a 
 lawsuit, please call us.  But somebody who receives this 
notice, it just asks, did you buy a car, did you pay the 
 charge, then calls the lawyer's office and says, tell me 
 something about this letter that you told me -- that 
 you -- you sent to me. 

 And how does the lawyer answer? 
MR. GUERRA:  If the lawyer answers by asking 
 investigative questions, when did you buy the car, were 
 you charged these fees, were -- were you advised, were 
 they prominently displayed, all of which is in gathering 
 information for the lawsuit, then the lawyer is engaging 
in permissible investigative prefiling activity --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If the lawyer had said 
 more -- did you buy a car, did you get charged the fee, 
 we're investigating this to determine whether this is --
 violates the law -- is that okay? 

MR. GUERRA:  It still is, Your -- Your 

 Honor.  The critical line --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the only -- the only 

 thing that's bad is to say, come call us for a

 participating as -- in this proceeding.  And --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's the difference 
 between that and how you answered Justice Ginsburg, when 
 she said class notice would be okay? 

MR. GUERRA:  Because class notice is not a 

 proposal of a -- of a relation -- a commercial 
 transaction.  It is noticed --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wait a minute.  It's 

 joining the class or opting out. 
MR. GUERRA:  Correct. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And, when you join the 

 class, you have a commercial relationship with the 
 lawyer no different than being a named plaintiff. 
 MR. GUERRA:  But the function of class 

notice is not to enable class lawyers to solicit 
 clients.  It is to enable courts to render binding 
 judgments and to satisfy due process requirements, so 
 that people unaware of a litigation do not have their 
 rights forfeited.  That is fundamentally different 
than -- than soliciting clients. 
 And I realize that --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Guerra, that 

 distinction -- I understand that you are deriving some 
 of it from (b)(12), but if I -- just -- just assume with 
me that (b)(12) has nothing to do with anything, and you

 were just limited to (b)(4), can you find that 
 distinction in (b)(4)? 

 MR. GUERRA:  Your Honor, I think the point 

 here is that, if you look at the conduct that is 
specified in the three examples, it is all activity that 
 lawyers would be engaging in as officers of a court. 
 And this Court has repeatedly recognized that there is a 
 fundamental difference between lawyers acting in their 
 own commercial capacities, as opposed to officers of a 
court. 

 And --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How -- how is 

 somebody conducting an investigation in anticipation of 
 litigation -- it hasn't started yet -- acting as an 
officer of the court? 

 MR. GUERRA:  Because they're discharging 

 their responsibility to ensure that they bring 
 well-founded claims and don't file suits without -- I 
 mean, under Rule 11, you have to have a well-founded 
factual basis for the allegations in the complaint. 

 So you need to do --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that just 
 seems to me to be saying a lawyer is always acting 
 as an officer of the court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you're 

 preparing a discovery request, when you're --
 anything -- anything that the officer functions --

MR. GUERRA:  I think most times, when you 

 are in -- engaging in litigation or pre-filing an 
 investigation, that would be true, and that's -- that 
 would be all protected under (b)(4).  The difference 
 is -- there is a -- there is a distinction.  This Court 
has recognized that lawyers have multiple capacities. 
 They wear three hats.  They are -- they represent 
 clients, they're officers of courts, and they're 
 commercial actors --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Guerra, don't you 

think -- I mean, I understand the distinction.  The 
 lawyer as commercial actor versus lawyer as officer of 
 the court.  But, boy, it's hard to get that from the 
 words here.  I mean, that -- that seems like the kind of 
 old-time legislative interpretation, where we just 
figured out the statute that we hoped Congress would 
 have written, as opposed to the statute that it did. 

 I mean, tell me where that distinction is in 

 this -- in this provision. 

 MR. GUERRA:  Well, Justice Kagan, for one 

thing, I think that, even if you decide that (b)(12) is

 not governing (b) -- (b)(4), it's still part of the 
 statute.  And it still demonstrates that Congress was 
 concerned about people using DMV information in order to 
 engage in commercial activity. 

And so the question then is, here's (b)(4), 
 which says, we're authorizing use of information for use 
 in tribunals.  There's no mention of lawyers here.  And 
 so the question is -- and this provision authorizes use 
 of the most sensitive information that -- that DMVs 
collect. 

 So the question you have to ask yourself is: 

 In light of (b)(12) and the fact that we know Congress 
 was trying to stop use of DMV information for 
 non-consensual solicitations, is it reasonable to think 
that this clause authorizes lawyers to use disability 
 status and medical information in order to go find and 
 solicit clients? 

 And I submit it is not, particularly if you 
 take the same broad reading that the Respondents argue 
for, the "in connection with" language, and you apply 
 that to (b)(6) and (b)(10), then you have these truly 
 incongruous results, where this Court in Condon 
 recognized that insurers were one of the purchasers of 
 the information that DMVs were selling and using it to 
direct market, and yet, in connection with underwriting,

 we've demonstrated that would mean that that is an 
 activity in connection with the business of insurance. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I understand 
 your argument about (12), but I -- I do think that you 
ought to assume we might interpret this statute, so that 
 each of these is independent, and you have to 
 concentrate on (4).  You keep going back to (12), when 
 we're talking about (4). 

 If you talk about (4) for a minute, it seems 

to me that you might give away too much because the 
 statute says, "including service of process," which 
 means the suit has to begin and then investigation in 
 anticipation of the litigation that will follow after 
 that suit has come in. 

But you seem to give that away.  You seem to 

 think that investigation in anticipation of litigation 
 can be before the suit is filed.  You -- you seem to 
 concede that. 

 MR. GUERRA:  Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't know why you 

 concede that. 

 MR. GUERRA:  I guess I -- I've never 

 understood that -- after service of process, it's still 
 in anticipation of litigation.  It's been my 
understanding that service of process --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It doesn't necessarily 

 follow --

 MR. GUERRA:  It initiates --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- that they -- they are 
describing only what goes on in the court.  If you just 
 took the phrase "investigation in anticipation of 
 litigation," "in anticipation of" sounds like before 
 litigation begins. 

 MR. GUERRA:  I am not disputing that, 

Justice Ginsburg.  My point is, though, even the -- the 
 (b)(6) and (b)(10) examples I just gave, 
 Justice Kennedy, don't -- it's not a reliance on (b)(12) 
 anymore.  It's just demonstrating why it's implausible 
 to think that the phrase "in connection with" should be 
read so literally that it authorizes anything that can 
 be shown to have a connection with the subject matter. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You -- you said earlier, 

 and it set me to thinking, that why would in 
 anticipation of litigation permit access to all of this 
very personal information?  And I don't know that, yes, 
 it does permit access, but only in anticipation of 
 litigation.  So you have to prove, before you get things 
 like Social Security number, driver -- anything else --
 all they asked for was name and addresses, I understand. 
MR. GUERRA:  Justice Sotomayor, that's true

 in this case, but if you -- if you read before, the way 
 Respondents are asking you to read it, there's no 
 limitation in the statute that says you can specify --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, yes, there is. 

There is a limitation that you're actually going to use 
 it in relationship to the litigation, number one.  And 
 the States are obligated to ensure that what they 
 release is actually covered by one of these exceptions. 

 MR. GUERRA:  If you interpret (b)(4) to 

authorize access by lawyers in connection -- based on 
 the theory that they are -- it's in connection with some 
 litigation, they will have access --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they have to explain 

 why. 

MR. GUERRA:  You -- the -- the request in 

 this case simply said, "pursuant to (b)(4) of the 
 statute." 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no.  As I read, 
 the first one is:  We want to see if there is a pattern 
of overcharging; give us the names and addresses of 
 people who have recently bought a car.  That seems, to 
 me, pretty specific as to what they want and why they 
 need it.  And I think it's pretty easy for the State to 
 say this fits. 

MR. GUERRA:  Justice Sotomayor, two points:

 The four requests that followed after the first two said 
 nothing of the sort, and the State gave me information. 
 It just said pursuant to the subsection that we're 
 talking about right now. 

In addition, there is no reason why lawyers 
 couldn't go in and say, I would like to identify -- I am 
 investigating whether people have claims for a 
 disability claims or -- or based on their medical 
 status, and I would like information of that ilk from --
from the DMV.  (B)(4) authorizes those -- that -- the 
 provision of that information.  And it doesn't say that 
 there has to be some heightened showing by -- by the 
 lawyers in order to obtain it.  So --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Guerra, suppose I am a 
lawyer, and I want to bring a toxic tort case, and I am 
 really -- I am looking for witnesses who have the same 
 kind of symptoms as my client had.  And so I put out a 
 letter saying -- you know, have you have been exposed 
 and -- and tell me about it, so that I can find out if 
you are a good witness, and -- you know, if you have, I 
 would also like to represent you.  Would -- would that 
 count? 

 MR. GUERRA:  Two points, Justice Kagan.  The 

 first is that you have highlighted why this is such a 
unique loophole for one very discrete class of lawyers.

 Most -- toxic tort lawyers cannot go to a DMV and say, I 
 need the names and address of people. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess what I was 

 suggesting was that, if I was just asking for witnesses, 
you would have to say that that was included by (b)(4); 
 is that right? 

 MR. GUERRA:  I do.  I do acknowledge that. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, now, the court -- the 

 lawyer is saying, in addition to your help as a witness, 
if you have the same symptoms -- you know, you can join 
 the suit. 

 MR. GUERRA:  And I think that that's an 

 improper use.  The Congress did not create this 
 authorization to go down to get the most sensitive 
information in order to enable lawyers to find clients 
 more easily than they might otherwise find them.  And so 
 investigation in anticipation of litigation is one use 
 that Congress authorized, and, as I have suggested, it's 
 a use that helps a lawyer discharge his or her 
responsibility to a court. 

 Asking somebody --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't know why this 
 case doesn't fit that description because the -- the 
 position that the dealers were taking was you can't --
you ought to maintain a representative action.  The

 State has such an animal, it's not quite a class action, 
 representative action.  To qualify, the group must be 
 numerous. 

 So how am I going to find out if it's 

numerous, without asking these questions? 

 MR. GUERRA:  You -- you can ask every 

 question up to, "Would you like to be a plaintiff in the 
 lawsuit," and that would be fine.  That's the dividing 
 line. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Might that get the lawyer 
 into some difficulty with the Bar Association?  They'll 
 look at this and say, look, we told you, if you are --
 if you are seeking clients, then you have to put 
 advertising material.  And a letter like that would tip 
the recipient off to something is going on, I should 
 find out about it, and maybe I should join it. 

 MR. GUERRA:  Justice Ginsburg, I think that 
 the -- the fact that that might trigger an obligation to 
 make a disclosure is not dispositive of whether it's a 
solicitation.  It would still be an objective factual 
 inquiry.  And, if there were no indications in the 
 letter that someone is being invited to join a lawsuit, 
 then it would be permissible investigation. 

 I would like to point out, though, in terms 
of why they needed this information, these lawyers filed

 suits initially against dozens and, later, against 
 hundreds of defendants, where they had no client with 
 any claim against that defendant.  Then they went to the 
 DMV, and they found over 30,000 names and addresses and 
sent out what the Fourth Circuit determined were 
 solicitations, in order to get clients in the claims 
 they had already improperly asserted. 

 They did not need that information to 
 indicate the interest of the named plaintiffs they 
already had.  Those people had standing to sue --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then there is a whole 

 string of defendants who were doing the same thing --
 the same allegedly unlawful practice, they couldn't 
 reach without getting additional plaintiffs. 

MR. GUERRA:  But their -- their clients have 

 no interest or need to reach those other dealerships. 
 They have a claim against the dealers with whom they 
 dealt --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But their client is a --
is a group.  This -- this is not an individual action --
 MR. GUERRA:  That's true, Justice Ginsburg. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The statute says sue for 

 the benefit of the whole.

State court said that each named individual could sue

 inconsistency.  And, of course, even if they want to try 
 to affect the conduct of the -- of the dealerships, with 
whom their clients never dealt with, they could still 
 get declaratory relief. 

 I would like to reserve the balance of my

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 please the Court: 

The DPPA is an unusual statute.  It directly 

 regulates the State's use of their own databases and 
 imposes massive civil liability and criminal penalties 
 for violations.  It regulates it in a relatively 
 distinct way, which is it makes disclosures 
presumptively unlawful, but then has 14 permissible use 
 provisions for which the State may, but does not must, 
 may disclose the information. 

 The scope of those 14 permissible use 

 provisions then becomes quite important for determining 
whether or not a statute that was originally designed

 primarily to regulate the commercial sale of DMV 
 information becomes intrusive into matters of 
 traditional State regulation or imposes massive 
 liability without the requisite clarity. 

Now, I would have thought that it was fairly 
 clear that, but for a resort to the specific controls to 
 the general canon, that all of the activity at issue 
 here comes comfortably within the language of (b)(4) 
 because, if you look at that language, it is remarkably 
broad.  Congress uses the word "any" three times.  It 
 uses "in connection with," which I think we all know is 
 a term of breadth.  And then it uses "including" and 
 uses illustrative examples. 

 And I think the only thing that really 

brings these examples together is Congress seems to be 
 covering the litigation process from cradle to grave. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One thing we also 

 know about the "in connection with" language is that we 
 have said, it can't really mean "in connection with," as 
broadly as that -- the Morales case, I guess, it has to 
 have a more narrow meaning.  Otherwise, everything would 
 be covered. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, that's 
 exactly right.  But the whole reason it has to have 
some limit is because it's presumptively quite broad.

 And if -- I mean, for those who look at legislative 
 history, the evolution of this provision, as it -- it 
 was changed twice in the legislative process. 

 And it started out that Congress was going 

to have a permissible use just for use in litigation 
 involving motor vehicles.  Then they dropped "motor 
 vehicles" and just said, "use in litigation."  And then, 
 in the final iteration, they said, "use in connection 
 with litigation."  So, clearly, they were trying to 
broaden it. 

 Now, I -- I would be the first to admit that 

 there has to be some limit, and we certainly wouldn't 
 say, for example, that if lawyers -- you know, decide in 
 this case, well -- you know, we got this DMV information 
for perfectly legitimate purposes involved in a 
 litigation, but, now, we are sitting on a gold mine, so 
 we should try to sell -- sell these same people floor 
 mats or wiper blades or something.  I mean, of course, 
 they can't do that.  So there are limits, but I think --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Can they do this:  Can --

 can Lawyer Smith say -- you know, there are some 
 products in this State that I really suspect are not 
 being properly made, and I have probably a tort suit; 
 and the damages are awfully small; I would like to get 
10 or 20,000 plaintiffs.  I wonder if there is anybody

So he goes to the DMV and says, I would like 

 the names of everybody who -- I'd like all your names 
 and addresses, and I intend to write them all and send 
 them a letter and say, I suspect there is some fishy 
 business going on here in the dress manufacturers; would 
you like to tell me about what happened?  Is that 
 possible?  Can they do that? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  It may or may not, depending 

 on where you draw the line.

 we talk about that?  You know, if they are really trying 
 to go after the dress manufacturers --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
 MR. CLEMENT:  -- they can go to the phone 

book, they can go to the title records office, there is 
 lots of places they can go, if what they want is just 
 general information about people.  And the only State 
 database that Congress has seen fit to regulate is DMV 
 databases.

 this is all passe.  Maybe -- perhaps they could get this

 MR. CLEMENT:  But, Justice Breyer, that's 

part of the reason I'm pointing --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So maybe what they want is 
 they want the names of all the people who've ever had a 
 car -- you know, because they think there's something 
 special about a car, and they think that's going to be 
connected.  But you see what I'm driving at. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  You have no lawsuit, but 

 you are going to get one if you can, and you have 
 grounds for thinking that there is some suspicious 
defendants, and what you are looking for is plaintiffs. 
 That's all. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  And --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All you are looking for is 

 plaintiffs.  Now, can you, under this statute, go and 
get the information, where all you are looking for is 
 plaintiffs for your lawsuit?  So far, you know how many 
 plaintiffs you have?  None. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think, actually, the best 

 answer, at the end of the day, is it depends on whether 
you are focused on a specific transaction, occurrence,

 defect, so I think you might ultimately --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Is your answer 

 what I have in my mind -- I'm just repeating the same 
 question.  I will do that -- I have some reason for 
thinking there are a whole bunch of defendants here who 
 have done something wrong.  All I am lacking is a 
 plaintiff, and what I want to do is get the names of 
 potential plaintiffs.  It's the same question.  I have 
 asked that three times.  Either you can, in your view, 
get it under this lawsuit, or you cannot. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I would say the best answer is 

 that you can.  If you don't like that answer and you 
 want to draw the line in a different place --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  I'm not liking or 

disliking.  All I want to know is --

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, here -- here's the 
 thing -- is I think there is a couple of places you 
 could draw the line, and I think there is a line drawing 
 question any time you have language like "in connection 
with."  The first would be, okay, I'm lawyers, and I 
 want to get clients for litigation. 

 You could say, well, that's enough of an "in 

 connection" requirement, so you can use that.  I would 
 say that that's probably on the other side of the line, 
but you could just say that's close enough.

 The other place you could draw the line is 

 when you have a specific transaction, occurrence, 
 defect, so that there be would be a difference.  If I --
 if I get this information and send people letters and 
say, I see you bought a new car in the last two years --
 you know, there is a lemon law in this State --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, wait.  Now, that's 

 your -- now, that's the line.  As to some of these 
 defendants, what he's saying is, these lawyers had no 
client that my defendant hurt, none. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And as to some of these, 
 but not all the requests, all they were doing was they 
 were looking for somebody who bought a car from me.  And 
the reason they want that is to ask them what the 
 practice was, so they can get a plaintiff to do what the 
 complaint is about.  So it's at least two -- or one or 
 two of the requests are like that. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  No, they are not in the 
following sense, Justice Breyer -- okay.  Just to 
 understand kind of the chronology here, no request --
 FOIA request is made at all here until my clients have 
 been approached by individuals who are complaining, 
 okay?  No letter goes out until the litigation is 
actually filed.  Now, they want to say --

 statement that I could write in an opinion that will 
 draw the boundary of this provision south of -- well, 
 the lawyer can go out when he has reason to believe that 
 a defendant has done something wrong and, to use a 
pejorative, troll for clients. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Right.

it does not -- you can't just go and troll for clients, 
 simply because you think a defendant has done something 
 wrong, and you have no client.

 want to say, well, wait a second, your clients didn't 
 have a beef with the other dealers. 

 That's wrong.  At all times in this suit, 

they had a conspiracy claim against those other dealers. 
 So, even as to the individuals they already represented, 
 they had a beef with those dealers.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the -- yes, but the 

 FOIA suit was made before the suit was filed. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  And the FOIA -- the two 

 FOIA requests that were made beforehand were 
specifically noted that they were in anticipation of

 litigation, and they were investigating, as Justice 
 Ginsburg suggested, as they needed to under State law, 
 whether this was a widespread practice.  And --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose you -- you said 

that you had a few people came and complained to the 
 lawyers, and then the lawyers wanted to see how 
 widespread this was.  Suppose the lawyer herself bought 
 a car recently, and she got this administrative fee. 
 And, now, she has -- no clients have approached her, but 
she would like to find out how many similarly situated 
 people there are, so she can get one of these 
 representative actions going. 

 Could -- on that basis, would it be 
 permissible to use -- would that come under the 
litigation exception? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think it would, 

 Justice Ginsburg, because I think that, when you are 
 trying to figure out where to draw the line, you look to 
 the words in the statute, which you know that 
"investigation in anticipation of litigation" is 
 covered, and I would think that would fit comfortably 
 within "investigation in anticipation of litigation." 
 And the --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It would be -- it 

would be a very poor lawyer who couldn't figure out how

 to write this -- the letter he's going to send out in a 
 way that it could not be said to be investigation, as 
 opposed to solicitation. 

 If you have a problem with the windshield 

wipers, you just send a letter saying, there is this big 
 problem with windshield wipers.  I am a lawyer, I'm 
 representing -- or I hope to represent, or I will 
 represent a group of people who have this problem, and I 
 think we will recover some damages.  Would you like to 
be a witness in that case? 

 That is in anticipation of litigation, but 
 it's also, quite plainly, an effort to solicit clients, 
 not just witnesses. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I couldn't agree more, 

Mr. Chief Justice, which is why the line can't really be 
 between investigation in anticipation of litigation and 
 solicitation in anticipation of litigation because that 
 is too thin a line to make a $200 million difference. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So where -- where is 

the line? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  The line is whether or not it 
 is in anticipation of litigation or in connection with 
 litigation --

 figure out what they mean.  If you think there is some 
 type of solicitation that the statute was meant to 
 prohibit, how do you draw a line that prohibits that, 
 but allows the sort of thing that you want to do? 

MR. CLEMENT:  I think the way you do is you 

 would basically say that, when they are saying, "in 
 anticipation of litigation," they mean in anticipation 
 of a particular litigation, particular problem, and so 
 it's different --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That doesn't have to 

 be filed in court, that may just be --

 MR. CLEMENT:  Oh, absolutely not.  I mean, 

 it seems to me --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- residing in the 

brain of any lawyer who's looking for work. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  No.  They are -- they are 

 concerned about a particular thing, and I think the "in 
 anticipation of litigation" language, I mean, that's not 
 the only time you have ever seen it before --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not just that 

 language.  It's "investigation in anticipation of 
 litigation."  If I understand you correctly, you are 
 saying investigation includes solicitation.

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think it is, though I guess 

 my point would be, even if you can identify some 
 solicitation that is not investigation, as long as it's 
 in connection with litigation, it's in (b)(4), and then 
I think --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So you are saying 

 that really this is a -- the way the statute works is it 
 says nobody can solicit, but for lawyers.  And that's 
 not -- that makes more sense than you might think 
because this was not a statute that was meant to 
 interfere with solicitation rules; it was meant to 
 interfere with commercial selling. 

 And -- and that's what this is about, and 

 there is a requirement, the requirement as to the 
lawyer, in good faith, has to believe that, if he finds 
 a client, there's a case. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I agree with everything, 

 except the first thing you said --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right. 
MR. CLEMENT:  -- which is that this is a 

 prohibition on solicitation.  If you look at the 
 structure of the statute, it says, presumptively, you 
 can't use this for anything.  And then there are 14 
 permissions.  And some of the permissions, like (b)(4), 
are unconditional.  If you come within (b)(4), you get

 to use it. 

Official 

 Now, when you get to the end of the statute, 
 which is -- I respectfully suggest is not where you put 
 the core provisions, it's where you put the less favored 
provisions -- then you have, in (b)(12), a conditional 
 permission that you can use it, but only if you get 
 consent. 

 Now, the thrust of their position is, if you 

 are in one of the unconditional permissions, but you 
also are, presumptively, in one of the conditional 
 permissions, somehow, that condition from (b)(12) hops 
 over to (b)(12) -- (b)(4) and says --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't think 
 that is fair.  I think their position is, to harmonize 
(b)(4) and (b)(12), you have to interpret investigation, 
 not to include solicitation, because, otherwise, you 
 have a conflict, that (b)(12) prohibits solicitation, 
 unless you have the consent; whereas, (b)(4), which 
 says, "investigation," does not require consent. 

Now, the two exist in perfect harmony if 

 investigation does not include solicitation, but 
 there -- there is a discrepancy between the two if it 
 does include solicitation.  And you have to say, well, 
 this is an exception from (b)(12). 

MR. CLEMENT:  No, you don't.  There is no

 discrepancy.  A conditional -- like you get a green 
 light for use in litigation.  You get a yellow light for 
 solicitation.  If you have solicitation in connection 
 with litigation, you're covered by both, you take the 
green light, there is no conflict. 

 And the premise for your discussion was we 
 have to harmonize.  I would take issue with that.  If 
 you look at these 14 exemptions, there is tons of 
 overlap in them.  Congress is not telling you that each 
of these 14 exceptions has an exclusive area, and you 
 have to find out which field is preempted by (1), (2), 
 (3), (4), (5), (6), (7).  If you look at (b)(1) and 
 (b)(4), there is complete overlap. 

 One of the things I would take issue with is 

my brother said that, well, (b)(4) is about the 
 tribunal.  No, it's not.  (B)(1) is principally about 
 the tribunal.  (B)(1) is the provision that talks about 
 government actors and their functions, and it 
 specifically talks about torts. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  (B)(4) is about -- (b)(4) is 
 about very sensitive information.  You're talking about 
 people's Social Security numbers.  You're talking about 
 whether the person has a disability that they may not 
 want to disclose to the general public -- a person has 
Parkinson's or -- or epilepsy or is diabetic.

 And so you're just -- you're saying lawyers, 

 they -- they get all that stuff.  Nobody else can, but 
 lawyers are a privileged class, and they get it. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Alito, it is important 
to recognize lawyers presumptively get it under Federal 
 law, but Federal law is only a floor.  And so let's take 
 Social Security numbers, please, because, sure, as to 
 (b)(4) and (b)(1) and two other provisions, Congress 
 says, presumptively, you can get Social Security 
numbers. 

 You know what -- you know what State -- the 

 State of South Carolina says?  You never get Social 
 Security numbers, unless you have a court order.  They 
 put that right in their State FOIA law.  And so that is 
just another example of how -- this is a Federal floor. 
 States can release this information.  They don't have 
 to. 

 And, to Justice Breyer's point, it makes 

 sense that you would distinguish between an attorney who 
is subject to the Bar discipline, is subject to 
 oversight and solicitation process, and treat that 
 solicitation differently from a solicitation by a direct 
 marketer, which is what (b)(12) is clearly aimed at, not 
 the practice of law.

 Justice Alito brings out is -- I see your 
 interpretation, and I hope the other side will give me 
 some line because they have the same problem -- you 
 know, but in reverse.  What is the line? 

But your way, it doesn't become that much of 

 a privacy statute.  It's sort of a misnomer.  It's a --
 it's a statute that is designed to prevent the 
 commercial use of your -- of this personal information. 
 It's not really a privacy statute. 

MR. CLEMENT:  It's certainly not an 

 all-purpose privacy statute.  I do think that's fair. 
 And the principal thing that they were concerned about, 
 of course, is that you could look at somebody's license 
 plate and indiscriminately go down, pay a fee, and get 
their home address. 

 Now, the one thing we know from (b)(4) is, 

 if a lawyer wants to do that exact thing, to serve 
 process, the lawyer gets to do it.  You can get 
 somebody's license plate, go to the DMV, get an address, 
and serve process.  And they specifically preserve that. 
 So we know, as to the core of the statute, they treated 
 lawyers differently. 

 They were also concerned with direct 

 marketers taking this information and using it to market 
people, but I don't think you'd lump lawyer solicitation

 in anticipation of litigation, which may put some limit 
 on it, together with that. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in anticipation of 
 litigation does come after service of process, and an 
additional way to harmonize this statute with (12) is to 
 say that, after the suit has been filed, then -- in 
 anticipation of the litigation that that suit will 
 engender, then you may get the information.  But you 
 didn't do that. 

MR. CLEMENT:  There's two problems with that 

 way of looking at the statute, I think I would 
 respectfully suggest, Justice Kennedy.  One is we are 
 talking about items on an inclusive list, so even if you 
 took your premise that -- that the anticipation of 
litigation in that list somehow is anticipation post 
 service of process -- which I want to come back to --
 even if you took that position, they are just things on 
 an inclusive list.  And so it wouldn't stop you from 
 saying that the ultimate test here is whether it's in 
connection with litigation. 

 But I guess I would go back to that and say 

 I've never once thought that investigation in 
 anticipation of litigation was something that would take 
 place after service of process.  I thought -- I mean --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's the way the

 statute's written. 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Yeah, but I don't think that 
 that was an intentional thing on the Court's part, that 
 we're going to name these and we're going to name them 
in chronological order.  If they tried to do it, I think 
 they got it wrong. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Clement, I'm not 

 sure I'm satisfied with the answer you gave to 
 Justice Scalia.  He said, look, we've got to harmonize; 
instead of general-specific, solicitation of clients is 
 different than investigation, and we just say they're 
 mutually exclusive.  It is a little bit of a general and 
 specific.  And that's proven by (b)(2) because, when 
 (b)(2) wants to permit solicitation, it expressly says 
it, and they didn't expressly say, "solicitation," in 
 (4). 

 That's, I think, your adversary's main 

 argument.  And I'm -- I'm still not sure I'm comfortable 
 with the answer you're giving.  You're saying they're 
independent, but why are they necessarily conflicting? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Last word "conflicting"? 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  "Conflicting," exactly, 

 or -- or conflicting or overlapping. 
 MR. CLEMENT:  I think --

 they necessarily overlapping? 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think they are necessarily 

 overlapping, and I guess I would point to several 
 things.  First of all, the language in (b)(2), I don't 
think helps them nearly as much as they do.  I think 
 that language in there about survey research, like much 
 language in many statutes, maybe avoids the marketers --
 or the -- the motor vehicle marketers from having to be 
 here in a lawsuit because it removes all doubt about it. 
But I think they would be covered, even without those 
 words. 

 But the point is -- you may say, well, 

 that's horrible, that's superfluous.  But, no, if you 
 look at the way the statute operates generally, there's 
lots of overlap.  So this isn't a context where you want 
 to make sure that there is no overlap and everyone 
 operates independently. 

 I pointed to (b)(1) and (b)(4).  They both 

 cover courts and litigation.  If this Court uses DMV 
information in its opinion, it's covered by (b)(1), it's 
 covered by (b)(4). 

 Or look at (b)(3).  (B)(3) is a provision 

 that says, generally, companies can use DMV information 
 to verify somebody's identity.  And then it specifically 
says, and if somebody lies to you about their identity,

 you can pursue legal remedies. 

Official 

 Okay.  When you're pursuing that legal 

 remedy pursuant to (b)(3), you're also doing things in 
 connection with litigation pursuant to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's --

 well, that's right.  I understand your point, that this 
 is -- they're not separate categories, and there's no 
 overlap.  But the word is "harmonizing," and the problem 
 is we have to give some limiting construction to "in 
connection with." 

 And it seems to me that, if you are involved 

 in that endeavor, it does make sense to see how what 
 you're going to cover under the "in connection with" 
 relates to what's exempt under the other provisions. 

MR. CLEMENT:  But, as we've discussed, 

 Mr. Chief Justice, if you -- if you are saying you are 
 not going to apply the specific controls the general, 
 but you may be using a junior varsity version of it to 
 harmonize the statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Exactly. 
 MR. CLEMENT:  -- as -- as we suggested in 
 our colloquy, I think the line between solicitation in 
 anticipation of litigation and investigation in 
 anticipation is far too thin a line to 
make a $200 million difference.

 And if I could direct the Court to page 93 

 of the Joint Appendix because that will show you just an 
 example of the postcard that is attached to these 
 letters.  And the postcard does ask specifically, as 
Justice Ginsburg was suggesting -- again, this is at 93 
 of the Joint Appendix -- it asks people to fill out 
 their name, address, the dealership they bought the car 
 from, the type of car, and then the administrative fee 
 or processing fee that was charged. 

Now, I think it's common ground between the 
 parties that we get to ask about that administrative or 
 processing fee because that is investigation in 
 anticipation of the -- of the litigation.  As I 
 understand where my clients arguably made a $200 million 
mistake is by adding the line "I'm interested" -- "I am 
 interested in participating" signature, that crosses the 
 line into solicitation. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the reason -- the 

 reason that would be so -- I agree with you, that it's 
very hard to figure out what the line is here between 
 the investigation and solicitation. 

 But that's where the solicitation thing 

 comes into play because what it -- the words that go the 
 other way, in my mind, that cut against you, is that 
this card could have asked for Social Security numbers,

 it absolutely couldn't. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Not under South Carolina 
law.  All right.  But then, under another State, under 
 this statute, they could.  Now, that's helpful, that 
 answer. 

 But if -- when I think of asking for Social 

 Security numbers, I -- the words -- exaggerated, but 
they go through my mind -- are "identity theft run 
 wild." 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And, if that is a 

 concern -- if that is a concern, then, by reading this 
as a solicitation -- you know, the pure case -- and 
 throwing the other exception to cover it, you force the 
 State to focus on it. 

 And the State then has to decide whether 
 they are going to permit or not permit the solicitor, 
who -- you see, might -- might include the lawyer here, 
 to ask for the Social Security number, and better to 
 have them focus on that decision.  That's the connection 
 that I see between the two. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  But, Justice Breyer, let me

 State in the country is focused on identity theft.  And 
 the only circumstances in which I can imagine a State 
 ever giving Social Security numbers to a lawyer is if 
 there case was -- you know, these car dealers are 
putting the Social Security numbers on the forms and we 
 are --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So are we -- do we 
 know -- by the way, that is helpful because do we know 
 under how many States' law the DMV would be forbidden to 
give Social Security numbers? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I don't know that offhand.  I 

 can get that to you in a supplemental letter.  I just 
 know South Carolina, it says, right in their FOIA 
 statute, you can't get that information.  And, like I 
said, the only situation -- it's kind of --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there a Federal law 

 to that effect? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  What's that? 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There may be a Federal 

law to that effect. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Right.

 Federal law against the dealers, they might ask for the 
 information.  It's the same kind of thing. 

 The only circumstances in which I could 
 imagine a State would ever give a lawyer disability 
information is if they were bringing an ADA suit.  If 
 they were bringing an ADA suit against a dealer, you 
 might actually want them --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if they are --

 if they were thinking they might bring an ADA suit --

MR. CLEMENT:  Fair point --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your position does 
 create a special -- the point your friend makes -- it 
 does create a special exemption from a solicitation bar 
 for lawyers.  Lawyers can solicitate -- you know, Acme 
Products can't. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, sure, but they can --

 they can solicit for their legal services in connection 
 with litigation.  And that, I think, is different --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In connection with 

something they hope might someday become litigation, 
 depending upon the answers they get. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, again, if you're going 
 to draw a line -- there's two things here -- you know, 
 there's -- there's an impulse to draw a line with "in 
connection with," and, at some point, you will have to.

 would you like to join me in that litigation? 

 Am I right to think that the first falls on 

 one side of the line, it's not enough, there's no 
 litigation there; and the seconds falls on the other 
side, according to you?

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's right, Justice 

 Kagan.  And I just want to emphasize that my -- my 
 clients fall on the other side of even yet another line, 
 which is they already had clients before they asked DMV 
anything.

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- is a contemplated 


MR. CLEMENT:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  A specific contemplated 


MR. CLEMENT:  Exactly.  Or to put -- you 


 know, to give just another sort of example, this seems 
 to be what clearly surely should be covered is, okay, I 
 understand there's a defect with the particular make and 
 model of a car.  I've used the DMV records, consistent 
with State law, to get access to the fact that you've 
 bought one of these cars; do you want to join the suit? 

 I don't think there's anything nefarious 

 with that.  There's certainly nothing --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would you want to 
start the suit?  It doesn't matter in your position.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Yeah, that's -- that's not my 
 case because this -- these people came to us before we 
 did anything.  But I don't think there's anything wrong 
 with that, Your Honor.  And, yes, you might say it's 
solicitation, but I don't think, if you look at these 
 provisions, that you would interpret them that way when 
 they're all permissive uses.  And --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if Congress wanted to 
 draw the line between possible -- you know, some unknown 
lawsuit and an actual lawsuit that's in the mind of the 
 lawyer, why did it use the term "litigation," when it 
 had already used earlier, in the same subsection, 
 "proceeding," civil, criminal, administrative, or 
 arbitral proceeding? 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Alito, I think 

 when it uses "in anticipation of litigation," it 
 actually wants to cover activity that takes place before 
 there's an actual proceeding.  And what I was going to 
 say is -- you know, that language doesn't come out of 
the ether.  I mean, that's the language you use in 
 attorney work product. 

 And, as I understand it -- I've looked into 

 this a little bit, the basic rule there is you 
 distinguish between litigation in the abstract and the 
point at which you've identified a particular

 transaction, occurrence, defect.  And, at that point, if 
 you're doing something, it's in -- it's in anticipation 
 of litigation. 

 The one other point I haven't yet made, 

which is, to the extent you're going to resort to the 
 specific controls of the general, I think it is worth 
 noting that this would be the first time, that I'm aware 
 of, that the Court would ever have applied that canon to 
 impose this kind of massive civil liability and even 
potentially criminal liability. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know which is 
 specific and which is general.  I mean, that's the 
 problem I have with that. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I agree, and I think that's 
the best reason why the canon doesn't work.  These are 
 equally specific.  And, in the case of an overlap 
 between the two that you have here -- and you have in 
 (b)(1) and (b)(4) and (b)(3) and (b)(4) -- you just say, 
 okay, Congress thought it was okay, and you just call it 
a day. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what you say, 

 Mr. Clement, that you and your varsity version of the --
 which is stronger than the other one is --
 MR. CLEMENT:  Paradoxically. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- is something like, if

 (b)(4) is hard, we have to draw a line someplace, we can 
 look to (b)(12) as expressing some kind of concern that 
 we can use to draw that line. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Yeah.  And the reason I think 

that --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's not a conflict, we 

 don't have to -- you know, it's not inconsistent, it's 
 just this is an expression of what Congress was thinking 
 about, we're going to use it as a clue. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  But the line-drawing 
 problem is really drawing the line about "in connection 
 with."  The line-drawing problem -- drawing the line 
 between solicitation in anticipation of litigation and 
 investigation in -- in anticipation of litigation just 
doesn't work.  They're two sides of the same coin. 
 As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, if my 

 clients had sent a letter that nobody objects to, that 
 says, we're bringing a lawsuit, we think you may have 
 been charged the same kind of fee, I think what the 
State Bar would have said -- the natural next question 
 for anybody getting that letter is, will you represent 
 me?  And precisely because of that, we want you -- we 
 want to treat this like it's solicitation, and we want 
 to add these additional bells and whistles. 

And part of the irony here is, I think, the

 things that make our letter look most like it's 
 advertisement or solicitation are the things that are 
 required by the State Bar. 

 And, keep in mind, that's another reason why 
treating attorney solicitation differently from general 
 solicitation makes perfect sense because they're subject 
 to --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what 

 you're saying.  You're saying the State Bar requirements 
would have required you to say, are you interested in 
 joining the lawsuit? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, and -- they would --

 it's so natural that somebody will say, can I join your 
 lawsuit --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 
 MR. CLEMENT:  -- that they would require all 

 the language that says, you have alternatives, other 
 people can -- can -- can hire you. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's because --

that's because the State is allowing solicitation, and 
 it puts certain conditions on what your solicitation --

 MR. CLEMENT:  Exactly. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You point to page 94, you 

 say, oh, it's just the last line, the whole thrust of 
the letter was solicitation.  You have to be fair about

 that. 

MR. CLEMENT:  And, Justice Scalia, the last 

 thing you can infer from the statute is that Congress 
 wanted, for the first time ever, get in the business of 
 managing attorney solicitation, a subject they'd always 
 left to the States.  And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I just want to, 

 before you leave, because -- in response to 
 Justice Kagan, I think you've changed positions a little 
 bit.  You started by saying there were three ways to 
 draw a line.  Getting clients is okay; getting clients 
is okay if you get a specific treatment, occurrence, or 
 defect.  And you didn't mention what the third was. 

 So what's your preferred reading? 
 MR. CLEMENT:  My -- my preferred reading is 
 that transaction, occurrence, defect -- which I took her 
red light camera to be an example of a particular 
 identified defect.  But I do want to emphasize, before I 
 sit down -- it's the last thing I'll emphasize, that my 
 case is a little bit better because we had a client and 
 a specific defect before anything happened.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. GUERRA:  Thank you. 
First of all, I'd just like to point out 

 that the consequence of Respondent's argument is that --
 is they gave the example of going to get the license 
 plate and then getting the name and address to serve 
 process. 

But, on their theory, you can also go down 
 and -- you can witness an accident on the side of the 
 road, you can go down to DMV, get the name and 
 license -- use the license plate to get the name and 
 address and send a solicitation letter.  And that is 
trolling. 

 And I think everybody -- as I understand it, 
 the line seems to be everybody wants it somewhere south 
 of trolling.  And yet --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why don't you give us 

the line that's north? 
 (Laughter.) 
 MR. GUERRA:  My line -- my line --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  North of trolling? 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, not north of trolling, 

but you understand the point.  What's your line?

 MR. GUERRA:  Our line is solicitation, 
 Justice Breyer, and there are two ways to get that. 
 There is the -- we -- I submit, is the strong textual 
 evidence in (b)(2), that Congress did, in fact, 
understand that the consent requirement governs all bulk 
 solicitation or surveys or marketing, and it had to give 
 an explicit override in (b)(2) because, otherwise, 
 (b)(12) would have restricted the ability to do 
 nonconsent --

JUSTICE BREYER:  In the middle of the -- in 
 the middle of the class action, several of the clients, 
 the only ones who brought -- who bought the cars --
 which there is loads of evidence they're defective, from 
 Dealer Smith, died, and they want to see if they can 
find three others, so they don't have to dismiss them 
 from the class, they're almost certain -- and has loads 
 of evidence there is the -- you know, the harm caused by 
 the defendant.  They are missing a client.  They died. 

 And so can they get it then? 
MR. GUERRA:  I'm not sure I understand the 

 question. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can they go to the board 

 and say, look, Dealer Smith here -- we're in the middle 
 of the case, we're finished with discovery.  We're 
just -- he just died and --

 MR. GUERRA:  Are you talking about --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- we want to find three 

 others, and I'm sure there's loads of evidence here that 
 there were a hundred thousand others, who bought this 
defective thing from this defendant, we want to find out 
 the names and addresses.  Can they get it or not? 

 MR. GUERRA:  For purposes of soliciting new 

 class representatives, I think not. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Not. 
MR. GUERRA:  And I think -- and there are 

 loads of ways to find class representatives without 
 going to DMVs.  And, in fact, that's what most class 
 action lawyers have to do, is advertise in one fashion 
 or another.  So that's not, to my mind, in Congress's 
conclusion. 

 But I would just point out that, according 

 to Respondents, the phrase "survey research" is 
 surplusage, and this Court says that's -- you're not 
 supposed to reach that conclusion, if you can avoid it, 
and you can avoid it by understanding it to be the 
 meaning -- the meaning -- its effect is to override the 
 consent requirement, so that -- that you can do 
 commercial bulk surveys in (b)(2), which would otherwise 
 require consent as a -- as a consequence of (b)(12). 
And then there is the so-called "junior

 varsity" harmonization basis for reaching solicitation. 
 And I would point out that Respondents are saying, it 
 can't be that you -- that some -- certain statements in 
 a letter means you crossed the line into solicitation 
and that that has all kinds of massive civil liability 
 consequences. 

 Congress used the word "solicitation" in 

 this statute.  Congress meant to draw some kind of line 
 around solicitation.  Now, admittedly, we're saying that 
the harmonization means that that's the same line you 
 would draw in (b)(4).  But it's not inconceivable to 
 think that Congress was -- was drawing a line at 
 solicitation and that liability would flow, depending 
 upon whether somebody crossed it or not. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Guerra, it didn't 

 draw the line at solicitation in (b)(4), and the 
 advantage of Mr. Clement's argument is that the line 
 that he sets up actually has a textual basis in (b)(4) 
 because it focuses on words like "what is a litigation," 
and "what is a proceeding," and "are we there yet."  And 
 that seems to be what the language of (b)(4) indicates. 

 MR. GUERRA:  Your Honor, our point is --

 sort of, if you step back, and you -- and this is the 
 question for the harmonization purpose:  (b)(4) covers 
solicitation only because of the indeterminacy of the

 phrase "in connection with."  Without that language, 
 there's no basis for saying (b)(4) is authorizing 
 lawyers' solicitations.  So it is, I would submit, at 
 the periphery of the authorization that (b)(4) provides. 
(B)(12) solicitation is at the core of what 

 that provision is about and that -- the -- the mass 
 marketing of using DMV information is one of the 
 fundamental problems Congress was addressing. 

 And I just think it's implausible to 
conclude that the -- at the periphery concept in 
 (b)(4) should take precedence over the core function of 
 (b)(12).
