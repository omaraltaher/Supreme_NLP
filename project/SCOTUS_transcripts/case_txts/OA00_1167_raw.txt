CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 00-1167, Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council


v. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.


Mr. Berger.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL M. BERGER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. BERGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


There are three important things that should be


kept in mind while we're addressing the issue this


morning.  First, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency


totally prohibited a select group of individual landowners


scattered around Lake Tahoe from making any use whatever


of their land.  These prohibitions were never designed as


the kind of planning time-out touted by TRPA and its


amici.  Rather, they were amendments --


QUESTION:  Well, what about a temporary order


that says, gee, we're required by State law to develop a


plan and it's going to take us a few months and, pending


that, you can't develop?  Now, does that invoke


immediately some per se taking rule?


MR. BERGER:  It does if it's a flat prohibition


of use, Your Honor, and if there is --

 QUESTION:  A flat prohibition that says, while


we're developing this plan, which we think won't take


long, you can't go ahead with your development?


MR. BERGER:  Justice O'Connor, I do believe that


if it is a total prohibition on use, and there is no use


being made of the property at the time, that it's part of


the public project to have this freeze on use, and it's


the public that ought to be paying for that project, not


the individual landowners who are frozen out.


QUESTION:  Suppose that -- we'll have to play


with the facts a little bit, it's a hypothetical case, but


that within a month from now the World Trade Center is


ready to be constructed and New York says -- and the owner


wants to rebuild highrises for office only, and the city


says, wait a minute, this is so important to the whole


city, we need a year to think about it, a year in addition


to the usual zoning process.  A taking?


MR. BERGER:  I think if they forbid the entire


use of the property and don't allow any applications for


use to be made, don't allow the owner to do anything --


QUESTION:  Well, they could use it for a parking


lot.


MR. BERGER:  If there is some reasonable,


economically viable, productive use that can be made of


the property at the time, then I don't believe we have a

per se taking.


QUESTION:  Well, I guess my question -- and I


know you had a more general introduction before I


interrupted you, is the use of a moratorium a standard


instrument of zoning policy, or is it very rare?  I


couldn't find anything in the briefs on this.


MR. BERGER:  It has, I believe, become much more


rare these days.  There's an awful lot more planning going


on.  Agencies are doing a better job of planning, and they


find the need for this kind of a total prohibition on


development to be made.


QUESTION:  My impression is that most of these


moratoriums, or moratoria, whatever they're called, would


not be total.  I mean, if you're considering altering a


rural zoning scheme that now doesn't have any limit on


number of residencies per acre, and you're thinking of,


say, no more than one house on every 3 acres, the only --


and that's what you're thinking about, the only moratorium


you would have to impose would be no more -- until we make


up our mind, no more than one house on every 3 acres.  It


wouldn't say, nobody does anything while we're sucking our


thumb on this question, right?


MR. BERGER:  That's correct, Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  And --


MR. BERGER:  -- and I think that's the more

typical kind of moratorium, and the kind that most of the


amici on the agency's side have been talking about.


QUESTION:  There was one Minnesota moratorium


that was -- seemed somewhat like this that had been


sustained by, I think the Minnesota appellate court.


MR. BERGER:  There was one, Your Honor, and I


would submit that that court erred.  It happens.  Lower


courts do that sometimes.


(Laughter.)


MR. BERGER:  And we believe that --


QUESTION:  So we notice.


(Laughter.)


MR. BERGER:  And we believe that that simply is


not an appropriate precedent for this Court to follow.


QUESTION:  Why, why is it -- I guess this is


going to be your basic point.  Why is it the case -- let's


take not this moratorium, but let's take a moratorium that


lasts for a year, and after that time everyone believes


the board will allow certain kinds of development.  Other


things being equal, that year of no use would probably


have reduced the value of the land by 5, 10 percent.  Now,


so why, since that's the effect of the moratorium I'm


imagining, should the public have to give compensation for


that small diminution in value?


MR. BERGER:  Because it's not the diminution in

value we're talking about here, Your Honor.  It's the


total elimination of the ability to make use of the


property, and in all of this Court's cases you have talked


about denial of economically productive use of land, and


what we're doing here, and what you're talking about in


your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, is taking away the


right to use that land.


It's as if I took away your car for a year and I


parked it in the garage and I kept good care of it, and I


returned it to you at the end of the year with no


diminution in value whatsoever, or perhaps the 5 percent


that Your Honor hypothesized.  You still would have been


without the use of that car for a year, and I think that


you would be entitled to compensation for the fact that I


deprived you of the use of that car.


QUESTION:  Well, certainly if the respondent


here had simply said, we're going to need your property


for 3 years, and so we're going to take a leasehold


interest for 3 years, the respondent would have had to


compensate for that.


MR. BERGER:  Chief Justice, I couldn't agree


with that more, and I believe that that is in fact what


we're dealing with here.


QUESTION:  No, but you're -- it seems to me


you're not dealing with that here, because in that

hypothetical the person, the third party in fact takes the


property in the sense of using it for that party's own


benefit.  Here, no one, the Tahoe Regional Planning


Authority isn't using the property for its benefit.  It's


saying that during this period of time there are some


things that you can't do.


MR. BERGER:  That's true, Justice Souter, but


frankly I don't see the difference between them, because


the Government --


QUESTION:  Well, one difference is that the


person taking in the one hypothetical gets a considerable


personal value, i.e., the use of a car, or the use of


property for a period of time.  There's no such fact in


evidence here.


MR. BERGER:  Absolutely true, but this Court's


jurisprudence has always examined cases like this from the


impact on the property owner, not from what the Government


gains by the taking.  Justice Holmes said that in the


Boston Chamber of Commerce case a century ago.


QUESTION:  Isn't your argument, and wasn't your


answer to Justice Breyer's question in effect to invoke


the kind of standard language which has come out of the


Lucas case?  In other words, it is preventing all use of


the property, or all economically productive use of the


property, and yet Lucas garaged that phrase in the

circumstance in which the denial of economic use was


assumed to be permanent.


Here, we're dealing with a situation -- Justice


Breyer's question dealt with a situation in which the


deprivation is assumed to be temporary, so that it does


make sense in his hypothetical to say, well, it reduces


the value of the property during the interim period maybe


by 10 percent.  That is a very different economic fact


from an indefinite, permanent deprivation which would


reduce the economic value of the property down to


something close to zero, and doesn't that distinction have


to be recognized, and isn't that the reason why the Lucas


formula simply cannot be used uncritically in this


circumstance?


MR. BERGER:  Justice Souter, I believe that that


distinction gets recognized at the valuation phase, not at


the liability phase.  In other words, taking for a small


period of time, or for less than the full life of the


property, would be compensated less than taking the full


fee interest.


QUESTION:  Yes, but what you're really saying


is, if the -- I think, that if in Justice Breyer's


hypothetical there is a diminution in the value for this


period of 10 percent, that you've got to compensate for


the full 10 percent, and it seems to me that our cases are

pretty clear in saying, that's not how you measure the


compensation obligation.  That's the -- that's an example


of taking, you know, the one stick out of the bundle and


saying because you can't use that one, you've got to


compensate 100 percent for that one, but I think our cases


rule that out, don't they?


MR. BERGER:  Actually, your cases in quite a


number of different circumstances say that if you do take


one important stick out of the bundle, you may well have


taken the property --


QUESTION:  Permanently.  Permanently.


MR. BERGER:  Well, except in First English, Your


Honor, where this Court expressly said, and examined all


the cases, that temporary takings are constitutionally no


different than permanent takings.


QUESTION:  Well, except that that gets to the


argument that the other side makes throughout here, that


the assumption of that statement was that we had a taking


in the first place, whereas the issue in this case is


whether we do have a taking.


MR. BERGER:  Well, that's correct, and what


we're talking about here is a deprivation of all use. 


That's why we have a pretty clean case for the Court to


deal with here.


QUESTION:  It's a deprivation of all use if you

fit it into Lucas.


Lucas was a case that did not involve a


permanent taking, so that it seems to me your first


argument has got to be not that the Lucas formula can


apply here, but that the Lucas formula should apply here


as opposed to this Penn Central formula.  You've got to do


that in order to get into First English.


MR. BERGER:  I agree with that completely, but I


think that what we're dealing with, if you examine the


facts of the case, is that from the time that these


ordinances were enacted in 1981 until whatever end point


you want to look at, there was a total deprivation of use.


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Berger, you may well have


been able to prevail under the Penn Central approach, I


assume, viewed in its entirety over this period of time,


but that was waived.  Am I correct in that?


MR. BERGER:  We did not present a Penn Central


case, that's correct.


QUESTION:  And all you want is this pure and


simple per se taking, as applied to, as it comes to us,


what is it, a 3-year period?


MR. BERGER:  Well, there was this 3-year period


chopped out at the beginning of the time.


QUESTION:  And that's what we're focused on here


as the case actually comes to us?

 MR. BERGER:  That appears to be what the Court


is interested in, as the Court reframed the question.


QUESTION:  May I ask you this question, Mr.


Berger?  Just looking at temporary takings, and just


looking at the liability stage as opposed to the valuation


stage, is there a distinction in your view between a


regulatory taking and a physical taking?


MR. BERGER:  I don't believe so, Justice


Stevens.  I think that this Court did deal with that in


the First English case, and it explained that physical


takings and regulatory takings are judged by the same


constitutional standards.


QUESTION:  So that in your view -- of course,


the physical taking, even for 10 minutes, would be a


taking.  There's no doubt about that.  But your view is,


even if the regulation prohibits all use of a piece of


property, an automobile, whatever it may be, for 10 or 15


minutes, there is a taking.  The damages may be


infinitesimal, but there's always -- past the liability


stage.


use --


MR. BERGER:  If there is a total prohibition of


QUESTION:  For 10 minutes.


MR. BERGER:  -- there is liability.  Now --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Berger, can you reconcile the


different approach that this Court has said goes for


spatial separation, like the air space in Penn Central,


and time segregation?  It seems to me that if the one --


if Penn Central is the regime for splitting off the air


rights, it should also be the regime for splitting off a


discrete period of time.


MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, this Court and other


courts have always dealt with the time value of property,


if I may, differently than they have in these spatial


terms.  The fact is, leasehold interests, future interests


have always been recognized as independent items of


property that are independently protected by the


Constitution.


If you had a piece of property that had a


landlord and a tenant and a lender and some remainder


person --


QUESTION:  But these are all physical takings.


MR. BERGER:  -- with all interests, and it was


condemned, all of them would be entitled to compensation.


QUESTION:  But that's --


QUESTION:  These are all physical takings cases.


MR. BERGER:  And this Court has said in First


English that there is no difference constitutionally,


Justice Stevens, between the physical takings and the

regulatory takings.


QUESTION:  Suppose I --


QUESTION:  What do you do about the fact that


there is a regulatory taking of sorts whenever you have a


permit system, let's say the normal zoning regime in which


you cannot construct any building on your acreage without


first applying and getting the approval of the zoning


agency?


MR. BERGER:  Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  During that period, there's been a


total taking. 

You cannot do anything with that property


until you get the building approved.


MR. BERGER:  Clearly you cannot do anything


until you've gotten the property approved, but it seems to


me that there is a fundamental difference between a


landowner working through a system whose end product is,


at least theoretically and probably very likely, the


issuance of a permit to go ahead and develop something


that is economically productive on that land as opposed to


being stuck in a system where you're forbidden --


QUESTION:  But that would have been during that


interval of time it meets your test.  Nothing can be done


until the permit issues, so a fortiori, under your theory,


compensation due.


MR. BERGER:  I don't believe so, Justice

O'Connor, because --


QUESTION:  Well, that's what it sounds like.


Now, what about your basic zoning law?  I'm


going to, as a city, limit the use of this property to one


house per acre.  You can't have unlimited apartments or


commercial property owner.  Now, for the enactment of


that, is there a taking immediately?


MR. BERGER:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Well, you're permanently deprived of


the use of it for commercial purposes.


MR. BERGER:  Yes, Your Honor, but you are not


totally deprived of the use of it.


QUESTION:  But can we get back to the basic


question that Justice Scalia asked, and Justice O'Connor


asked it as well.  I want your answer.  Why is it that a


delay for purposes of ordinary zoning, which, let's


assume, prohibits you from any use of the property, is not


a taking?


MR. BERGER:  Because you are there in a process


working toward the actual development of the process, of


the property, pardon me, in contrast to being in a


situation like these people are, where there is no process


for development.  There is instead the desire --


QUESTION:  Let's assume that the Tahoe Regional


Planning Agency thought, in good faith, that there would

be some development allowed, but they needed a year to


think about it.  My -- that's the same as the World Trade


Center hypothetical.  We know something very valuable is


going to be built, but you say it's a taking, and I don't


understand the difference between that and the regular


zoning procedure.


MR. BERGER:  The difference is that in the


second situation there is a conscious and total


prohibition on use, and that's the purpose of the


regulation, is to prohibit the use.  In the former


situation, where you're applying for a permit, the purpose


of the regulation is not to prohibit use but, in fact, to


enable use.


QUESTION:  Well then, it seems to me you have to


change your answer about the World Trade Center


hypothetical, where you say there's going to be a very


valuable use, we just don't know what it is, but we need a


year to think about it, in addition to the normal -- and


you told me that was taking, but now your rationale seems


to me to back away from that.


MR. BERGER:  If they are in a process where


there will be development at the end, then I believe that


there is not an automatic per se taking, but it seems to


me that what we're dealing with, if we've got a total use


prohibition, we do have a taking.  It's a question of

time.


QUESTION:  But Mr. Berger, your -- it seems to


me your deciding whether the temporary taking is --


whether the temporary interference is a taking or not


depends on what's going to happen after the temporary


period expires, because in one situation you think, well,


they know they're going to get something valuable out of


it, in the other they don't, but that means that the test


for the temporary period turns entirely on an evaluation


of the future.


MR. BERGER:  Well, if I made it sound that way,


Justice Stevens, I apologize.  I -- what I'm saying is


that you have two different schemes set up.  One is a


process leading toward development.  The other is a


process of total blockage, and where the intent of the


Government is simply to block the use of property.  We're


not looking at the future --


QUESTION:  Well, you're not suggesting they're


doing it just for the sole purpose of blocking the use. 


Don't they have some ultimate goal in sight here?


MR. BERGER:  Sometimes they may.  Sometimes they


don't.


QUESTION:  But your -- you rest on the


hypothesis that they are just interested in a total


blockage for a temporary period of time, and they don't

MR. BERGER:  But that is the fact that we're


dealing with.  We're dealing with --


QUESTION:  They don't have any interest in


protecting the lake?


MR. BERGER:  We have no question about their


ability to protect the lake.  The question is how they do


that, and what they've decided to do in order to protect


the lake is to prohibit these people from making any use


of their land.


QUESTION:  But it seems to me in effect -- maybe


this is a variant on Justice Stevens' question -- that


you're saying, what's really wrong here is that this is


not done in good faith, that this is not done, let's say,


in the case of the period of time necessary to get


permits, with an actual development in mind.  This is


called a moratorium, but they mean something more than


just moratorium, they just mean stop, period, and it


sounds to me as though you're making it turn on whether


it's good faith or bad faith.


MR. BERGER:  Oh, I don't think it needs to.  I


think, in fact, in this case, when they put this


moratorium in the context not of -- they don't even call


it a moratorium.  They did this as amendments to their


Water Quality Act.  What they said was, these properties

need to be kept frozen in order to protect the clarity of


Lake Tahoe.


QUESTION:  And your argument in effect contrasts


that with an existing permit system whereby if you comply


with certain requirements you will ultimately end up with


a permit, the purpose of which is to make sure you do


comply with the requirements.


MR. BERGER:  Exactly, Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  But you still have -- I mean, in the


one case the regulating agency has said, you can't do


anything with your land while we're thinking about the


scheme we're going to adopt, and in the other case the


agency has said, just as categorically, you can't do


anything with your land while we consider your


application.  In both cases they're, for a later


regulatory purpose they're both saying, you can't do


anything with your land.


MR. BERGER:  Justice Scalia, in a sense that is


certainly true, but in the case of the processing of a


permit application, we know that there is permitted use. 


It's there.  It's in the books.


QUESTION:  Not during the pendency.  Not while


the application is pending.


MR. BERGER:  The regulations of the agency say


that for this property there is permitted use.  The

question is how you make that use, and under what


conditions and circumstances, not whether there will be


use at all, where you have in the second situation a total


prohibition on use and we don't know what's going to


happen at the end of that total prohibition on use.


The key to it may be this case itself, where the


light at the end of the tunnel that they keep touting as


the saving grace of this kind of a regulatory regime


turned out to be no light at all.  There was a complete


continuation of the use prohibition when this temporary


so-called period ended.


QUESTION:  Well, under your theory it would seem


that -- suppose that a building catches fire and is


substantially destroyed by fire, and the fire department


comes, and the police department, and they block it off


for a period of time, no use while this is investigated,


none, property owner can do nothing, can't enter it,


you're out of there.  I guess the city or the governing


jurisdiction would have to pay the property owner.


MR. BERGER:  I don't think at that point, Your


Honor, that that would be a taking.


QUESTION:  But it fits squarely within your


argument.


MR. BERGER:  No, I think that in that case, Your


Honor, you would at least be entitled to perhaps some

nuisance examination.  You've got a wrecked building that


is a hazard, and at least the Government would have the


ability to order the property cleaned up before anything


else could be done with it, and I think in those


circumstances --


QUESTION:  But that seems to make the question


whether there's a taking turn on the nature of the motive


of the -- underlying the regulation or the prohibition,


and I thought your position was, regardless of the good


faith and the great public interest in doing it, the State


has to pay when it does this.


MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, I think we all have to


live with what this Court called the nuisance exception


when it decided the Lucas case, and that there are some


things that the Government can do that prohibit all use


that are not compensatory.


QUESTION:  Are you satisfied with the standard


that says, every Government regulation is a candidate for


a taking, just as every speech act is a First Amendment


candidate, but it's actually a taking in this area only


when the impact of the Government regulation is not part


of a reasonable process looking towards a reasonable form


of regulated development?


MR. BERGER:  I think I could accept that,


Justice Breyer.

 QUESTION:  Well, if that's so, they're going to


say they win, because they're going to say, of course,


this was an effort, reasonably, to regulate Lake Tahoe


over a period of time.  It's very complicated, it didn't


last -- it lasted a long time, but no more than necessary.


MR. BERGER:  Oh, I would disagree with that


characterization.  This was not an effort to regulate Lake


Tahoe.  This was an effort to prevent the use of these


properties.  Certainly they --


QUESTION:  But that's a reasonableness


calculation, and that's the Penn Central aspect rather


than the more categorical approach that you're urging upon


us, I should think.


MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, if they had come up


with a nuanced, subtle regulation that had something to it


other than the meat ax approach that the agency took in


this case, I think you would have a Penn Central-type


analysis, but what we've got in this case is not anything


subtle at all.  We've got a complete, easy, quick


prohibition, and --


QUESTION:  What is the status today?  What is


it, 22 years later?


MR. BERGER:  We're 22 years later.


QUESTION:  What's the status today of the


properties affected by this suit?

 MR. BERGER:  The clients that I represent are


still, for the most part, unable to do anything.  There is


the new plan put in in 1987, which this Court looked at in


the Suitum case, and some of the people, those in the


position of Mrs. Suitum, in the stream environment zones,


are still totally prohibited from using their land.  Most


of the people are still totally prohibited from using


their land.


A large number of them have sold their land to


Government agencies that were buying them up at bargain


basement prices, at nothing approaching what would, an


appraiser would call fair market value, but the value of


land that couldn't be developed, in order to mitigate


their losses, and as the court approved in the Del Monte


Dunes case, what they'd like to do is to make themselves


whole.


QUESTION:  Well, is it your position that all of


the properties involved in this petition are, today, still


totally deprived of any use whatever?


MR. BERGER:  I believe, Justice O'Connor, there


may be a handful of them that under the 1987 plan, and the


regulations that came under that in 1989, were finally


released and allowed to do something, but it's only a


small number, and for the most part these properties are


still unused and unusable.

 QUESTION:  Is it your position that the


application of the Penn Central approach would not result


in appropriate compensation determinations at the end of


the day?


MR. BERGER:  I don't know that, Your Honor.  As


a pragmatic matter, doing a Penn Central approach on a


case that involves hundreds and hundreds of individual


properties would have been a nightmarish litigation that


only the wealthiest of landowners would be able to afford


and, particularly in light of the clear prohibition of use


that they decided that they needed, we thought that it


made more sense to do a Lucas-type approach than a Penn


Central approach in this case.


QUESTION:  May I just ask this one question? 


With regard to those who have subsequently been permitted


to develop their land, it's your view that you're


nevertheless entitled to a takings compensation for the


period which the moratorium was in effect?


MR. BERGER:  Yes --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. BERGER:  -- Justice Stevens, that's true.


I'd like to reserve the rest of my time, Mr.


Chief Justice, if I may.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Berger.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Petitioners' only takings claim before the court


of appeals and his only -- their only takings claim before


this Court is a facial per se claim.  That means that


their contention is that the mere enactment of the


temporary moratorium in this case effected a taking with


respect to every parcel to which it applied -- that's the


facial aspect -- without any consideration of the reasons


for the moratorium.  That's the per se aspect.  And what


is more, that bold claim is limited at this point to the


temporary moratorium in effect from August '81 until April


1984.


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, you described it as a


bold claim.  Supposing it had gone on for 10 years.


MR. ROBERTS:  In 10 --


QUESTION:  Would it be still bold?


MR. ROBERTS:  On the facial aspect I think so,


Your Honor.  I think doing the Penn Central analysis and


not the Lucas analysis, so long as it's not a permanent


deprivation abuse.


Now, certainly a 10-year claim would have a much


harder row to hoe against a takings challenge, but I would

like to know the impact on the property's value, why the


10 years was necessary, if it was, the sorts of things


that are factored under Penn Central.


QUESTION:  Well, you could do a Penn Central --


you could have done Penn Central in Lucas.  I mean, Penn


Central is wonderful.  We could apply it to everything,


but as Mr. Berger pointed out, that's a terribly


complicated analysis, enormously expensive for property


owners to have to go through, which is why you have cases


like Lucas.


MR. ROBERTS:  This Court said Lucas applied only


in the rare circumstance, a total ban on economic


reproductive use.


QUESTION:  Suppose I take a 3-year leasehold,


right. 

The Government comes in and says, we're taking


this property for 3 years, not a permanent taking, just a


3-year taking.


MR. ROBERTS:  That --


QUESTION:  We do a Penn Central analysis of


that?


MR. ROBERTS:  Oh, no.  If the Government


condemns a leasehold, that's a taking, and compensation is


due.


QUESTION:  All right, suppose in this case that


one of these barred owners leased the property to someone

who's going to put a mobile home on it for a year, the


moratorium comes in effect, assume the mobile home can't


be -- is that a taking of the leasehold, of the


lessee's --


MR. ROBERTS:  No.


QUESTION:  -- interest?


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  You don't sever up the


property interest and -- so that it corresponds to the


extent of the regulation and then say --


QUESTION:  You're taking from the lessee. 


That's all he's got.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the right at issue here is


the right to build residences, to develop the property.


QUESTION:  No.  My hypothetical is that it


applies to a mobile home and the guy who leases for -- the


lot for a year, and then TRPA says you can't put the


mobile home on there for a year.  They take this entire


leasehold.  Compensable?


MR. ROBERTS:  It would first of all be under the


Penn Central analysis, and the economic impact --


QUESTION:  Why, if it's a total taking?


QUESTION:  General Motors certainly didn't do


Penn Central.


MR. ROBERTS:  No, but the other -- the


distinction is the one this Court talked about in Loretto,

between -- you mentioned the World War II condemnation


cases.  The Pee Wee Coal case, the Government came in and


occupied the coal mine to prevent a strike.  That was a


taking.  In Central Eureka they said, you cannot use the


gold mine, and this Court said, that's different, that's


not a taking.


That's the type of distinction that we're


talking about here between physical appropriation or,


extended to Lucas, a ban on total economic use, and the


temporary regulation that's at issue here.  Because the


regulation is temporary, the land retains economic value.


QUESTION:  I'm still not sure of your answer. 


Your answer is that in my hypothetical about the 1-year


lease that's taken from the lessee, it has to be a Penn


Central analysis because?


MR. ROBERTS:  Because you're starting out with a


property -- presumably the regulation applies to the


property generally, and it just so happens that this one


parcel has been severed out into a leasehold, and in doing


that, that is a question that has to be addressed before


you get to the analysis, should you sever out the affected


property interest to a leasehold.


QUESTION:  But you could have made that same


argument in General Motors, and I think the Government


did, that you shouldn't just treat it as a leasehold,

you've got to value the whole property.  The court says


no, there was a leasehold in effect, that's what the


Government took, that's what the Government has to pay


for.


MR. ROBERTS:  But if -- if this Court is -- in


its past takings cases, when it's been presented with a


regulation that applies to a discrete property interest,


it hasn't said, well, let's redefine the effective


property interests to that.  It didn't do it in Penn


Central, it didn't do it in Keystone Bituminous, and it


didn't do it in the construction laborers case.


The way the property was held by the petitioners


in this case is fee simple.  This regulation applied to


fee simple property.  It did not affect the value anywhere


near the extent that the regulation in Lucas did.


QUESTION:  No, but just to make it clear, in my


hypothetical -- I know it didn't happen, but in my


hypothetical, no recovery because?


MR. ROBERTS:  No, I'm not sure it's no recovery,


but I am sure that it's still evaluated under Penn


Central, because --


QUESTION:  But Mr. Roberts, if you evaluate it


under Penn Central, would it be legitimate to evaluate it


this way.  I've assumed it would be, but maybe I'm wrong. 


Assume that the leasehold is not physically taken, so that

the Government doesn't substitute itself for the trailer


owner and use the property.  It's strictly a prohibition


of use.  I assumed that under Penn Central the lessee


would have his claim against the lessor because the lessor


was not delivering.  The lessor would not have a claim for


a permanent deprivation here because there, with respect


to the lessor there would only be the temporary taking.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well --


QUESTION:  So that the lessee would probably


come out okay against a different party.  The lessor would


be in the same position that the lessor would be in if


there had never been a lease.  Is that the way it would


work?


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, presumably the impact of


regulation would be something that would be addressed in


the lease agreement itself.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. ROBERTS:  I mean, if they were leasing it to


build a mobile home and it turns out they can't, who bears


the responsibility for that, again a matter between the


lessor and the lessee.


The important point is that the, what the


petitioners are arguing for is an extension of the Lucas


rule which applied in a, as the Court said, the rare


circumstance in which all economic use is prohibited, and

the Court emphasized in Lucas that that had the


consequence of rendering the property valueless.  This is


how the Court phrased the question presented in Lucas,


whether the act's dramatic effect on the economic value of


Lucas' lot accomplished a taking.


Well, here, there is no dramatic effect on the


economic value of the affected lots, because we're talking


about temporary regulation for a limited time.


QUESTION:  Well, but does --


QUESTION:  Well, in light of what's happened, we


know it's been 22 years, and presumably many of these


properties will never be allowed to be developed.  Is


there no end in sight?  Can we not look at that as a


taking?


MR. ROBERTS:  First, Your Honor, my


understanding of the record is quite different from my


brother's.  If you look at the pretrial order, Exhibit A,


pretrial order filed July 17, 1998, it describes the


situations with respect to each of the properties.  Most


of them have been sold long ago.  Of those that are not


sold, two-thirds have a score that makes them buildable


under the '87 plan, so two-thirds of the petitioners who


still own property can build on those lots according to


the record in this case, and that is just petitioners'


allegations.

 QUESTION:  When you say sold, do you mean at the


bargain price that Mr. Berger referred to, sold to --


MR. ROBERTS:  Sold typically to the Government


buy-out agencies, I wouldn't say at a bargain price.


QUESTION:  Sold to the Government agencies who


will do with it just exactly what is achieved by the


Government's not taking position of it, that is, nothing. 


I find this distinction between whether the Government


takes possession of the land versus whether the Government


doesn't take possession of the land quite unrealistic --


MR. ROBERTS:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- where you're talking about a


Government that wants to assure that the land lies fallow. 


The Government achieves entirely what it wants by simply


saying, nobody shall do anything with the land.  That --


why should the Government condemn the land?  It doesn't


have to.


MR. ROBERTS:  That's not, of course, what we're


talking about here.  What we're talking about here is a


time-out for a limited period while the agency carries out


its responsibility to determine what can be done with the


land.


QUESTION:  All right, so how does he prove that? 


What about the one-third who could never build?


MR. ROBERTS:  Well --

 QUESTION:  What happens to them?  What is your


view of the correct thing he should have done?  Is a


person who never is allowed to build, and never can use


the property at all, simply out of luck, if what they say


is we're having a 10-year, a 30-year procedure of 3-year


moratoriums, 10 at a time or something like that?  How is


it supposed to work, in your opinion?


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the first thing I'd say is,


you bring an as-applied claim and not a facial claim.  The


facial claim is the mere enactment of this temporary


moratorium effective taking.  Well then, don't talk to me


about what happened 15 years later, if the mere enactment


of the temporary moratorium is your complaint.  That's a


different case, and he brought that case, and it was


thrown out because it was too late.


There were challenges brought to the '84 plan,


there were challenges brought to the '87 plan.  Those


challenges failed, and now the effort is to link those


challenges up to what's left, the little tail on the dog


of this temporary moratorium that started the process.


QUESTION:  How does an as-applied challenge go? 


What if you make an as-applied challenge.  What would you


have to prove?  Would you have to prove that any


intelligent agency could make up its mind and, you know,


either fish or cut bait within a year?  Suppose --

 MR. ROBERTS:  If the as-applied challenge is to


the temporary moratorium?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, you go through the Penn


Central factors, and if it's taking too long, that's


certainly something pertinent on the character of the


Government action.  That's what other courts have looked


to.


QUESTION:  No, no, but it goes beyond Penn


Central if you're no -- if it is no longer an honest


moratorium to decide what you're going to do with the


land, then you're out of Penn Central.  Then it's just a


taking.  You're kidding us.  You only need a year to


decide what you want to do.  You've imposed a moratorium


for 5 years.  Why should I have to go through Penn


Central?  Four of those years is just prohibiting me from


using my land with no other governmental purpose in mind


except the prohibition.


MR. ROBERTS:  And that's one of those things


that they would have to show.  Here, of course, the


district court found that the planning effort was


undertaken as speedily as possible.


QUESTION:  But you acknowledge that if, in an


as-applied challenge, there's a showing that the agency


does not need 3 years or 5 years or whatever, that the

thing could reasonably have been done in 1 year,


everything beyond the 1 year is then a taking?


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  You have to go through the


other factors.  This is not a per se analysis.


QUESTION:  Why?


MR. ROBERTS:  The other factors include the


impact on the property.  You're claiming a taking.  What


was the effect on your property?


QUESTION:  Well, what if -- let's take a


hypothesis where the moratorium is 10 years.  Now, you


still go through this thing that you're talking about?  It


cannot be long enough ever to be a per se taking?


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, even the court of appeals


recognized that the moratorium is long enough so that the


present value of the uses that might be allowed is de


minimis, then perhaps the categorical rule would apply,


and 10 years seems like it's going to be too long for the


Government to figure out and carry out its


responsibilities and planning, but I wouldn't say that we


try to find a point in time at which suddenly we shift


from the accepted Penn Central analysis to the Lucas per


se analysis.


QUESTION:  Well, but yet you agree that shift


has to take place somewhere along the continuum of time.


MR. ROBERTS:  I guess what I'm saying is at some

point calling something a temporary moratorium is a misuse


of the label.  If it's 30 years, that's too long.


Now, the best that Justice Holmes could do was


say that when it goes too far it becomes a taking, and I


may not be able to do much better, but the Penn Central


factors allow consideration of things like, what is the


need for it?  The need may not be sufficiently compelling


to justify a moratorium of 2 years, or the need may be


sufficiently compelling to justify a longer moratorium. 


What was the impact on your -- the property?


Keep in mind, the petitioners submitted no


evidence of impact on value.  We have no idea from the


record what the impact of the temporary moratorium was,


other than the evidence that we submitted which shows that


properties were sold for significant amounts of value


during the period of the temporary moratorium, which makes


sense.


A temporary ban on development doesn't render


property valueless.  If you have two parcels of property,


one subject to a permanent ban on use, and the other


subject to a temporary ban, it is true, as some of the


amici say, the permanent ban could be made temporary and


the temporary ban could be made permanent, but you're not


going to pay the same price for both of those parcels of


property.  The one that's subject to the temporary ban is

going to have a higher market value, reflecting the fact


that future uses are available, or will be available or


not, depending on the plan that's ultimately adopted.


QUESTION:  I suppose that depends on how much


any prospective buyer would believe that the temporary ban


is really temporary, or how much they believe that it's


going to be strung out and extended, and if worst comes to


worse, and the Government can't pick it up at bargain


prices it will pay compensation to get rid of the land. 


I --


MR. ROBERTS:  And that's like the petitioners'


effort to link their lost challenges to the permanent land


use plan to their challenge to the temporary moratorium. 


QUESTION:  Mr. --


MR. ROBERTS:  The district court --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Had you finished your


answer?


MR. ROBERTS:  I was just going to say that the


district court in this case specifically found that the


agency acted in good faith throughout, so the idea that


the temporary moratorium to allow planning to take place


was some kind of a sham for a permanent --


QUESTION:  Well, but it also found there was a


total deprivation of use for X amount of time.


MR. ROBERTS:  Only looked at from that period.

Only looked at for the 32-month period, and our submission


is that that's the improper way to carve up the property


interest and say, oh, it's a total taking, because we're


going to only look at the property that was taken.


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, in answer to one of


Justice O'Connor's questions about a hypothetical fire


damage case Mr. Berger referred to the nuisance exception


as possibly taking the case out of the whole takings area.


At what point in what procedure would the possible


availability of the nuisance defense arise or be


considered with respect to polluting Lake Tahoe?


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, we raised the claim before


the court of appeals that one reason there was no taking,


even if Lucas applied, was because of the nuisance, et


cetera.  The Court didn't find it necessary to reach that


issue.


QUESTION:  I see.


QUESTION:  And so the district court said there


wasn't -- that a nuisance hadn't been made out.  The


district court said that, didn't it?


MR. ROBERTS:  That's right, and we appealed


that, and the court of appeals didn't find --


QUESTION:  And what was your argument to the


court of appeals, that this was a nuisance exception?


MR. ROBERTS:  That given the impact on the lake

of development, that it fell within the California and


Nevada nuisance requirements.


QUESTION:  That it all should be a park.


MR. ROBERTS:  Not that it should all be a park,


but that further development would threaten the serious


and, in fact, irreparable harm to the lake.  That's the


basis for the Government action in this case that the


petitioners have never challenged.


But I want to emphasize in concluding that it's


important to remember that the issue is not whether a


total ban on use for this period effects a taking.  The


issue is whether a temporary moratorium from August of '81


to April of '84 for the purpose of carrying out the


responsibility of undertaking planning with respect to


these lots is on its face with respect to every lot that


it applied to a per se taking without regard to the


reason.


QUESTION:  Phrased that way, it's quite clearly


in your favor, but I think they're seeing this as a group


of landowners thinking from the beginning, whatever the


justification for this, and the justification is


excellent, saving Lake Tahoe, it's going to end up that we


won't be able to use our land for anything, and we've been


able to tell you that from day one, so we brought a case


right off the bat that we knew that was going to happen,

and then year after year went by when people told us,


maybe you'll be able to build, maybe you won't, which


really wasn't so, we knew we wouldn't, and then it ended


up that we couldn't, all right.


Now, what are we supposed to say to them? 


Aren't they supposed to have some remedy at law?  And


that's I think why he wanted to hear all his questions,


not just one, and there is that lurking in this case, and


I'm not totally sure how to deal with it.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, first of all they waited


until the '84 plan took effect to file their lawsuit. 


That suggests to me the gripe was with the permanent ban,


not so much the temporary moratorium.


Second of all, the supposition in your question


makes this not a facial challenge.  In other words, it's


not the mere enactment.  It's because we know what's


really going on here.  That's an as-applied challenge,


that's not a facial challenge, so the landowners in your


case said, as, in fact, some have, bring an as-applied


challenge saying, as applied to me this is a taking.


QUESTION:  So do you agree that a temporary


moratorium that ripens into a permanent ban is a taking?


I mean, you know, let's assume that I sold the


property during the temporary moratorium which later


ripens into a total ban, and I claim that I should have

been compensated for those 3 years that I owned the


property without any ability to do -- does that constitute


a taking?


MR. ROBERTS:  I think the period in which the


agency's justification is, we need a time-out to undertake


planning so that we're not locking the barn door after the


horse escapes, should be evaluated separately from the


period in which the agency says, this is the land use


plan, and if you've got a gripe with us you can challenge


that.  Those are two separate periods.  The character of


the Government action is different in those two periods.


QUESTION:  Okay, let's assume that they are


analyzed separately, and it is found that for the period


Justice Scalia is talking about the Government really was


not acting in good faith.  Its plan, its intent right from


that moment on, from the first day on, was to ban all


development whatsoever.  In that case, does he have a


claim for a complete taking during the 3-year period?


MR. ROBERTS:  Oh, certainly, yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  I don't think it's a facial


claim, because it depends on more than looking


specifically at the face of the ordinance.


QUESTION:  So it's a question basically of good


faith and intent --

 MR. ROBERTS:  And here the --


QUESTION:  -- and understanding what they're


doing.


MR. ROBERTS:  The district court at petition


appendix at page 69 said the agency acted in complete good


faith, and completed its responsibilities as quickly as


could be expected.


Thank you, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  If the court of appeals opinion is


just simply affirmed just as is, weren't we wasting our


time in First English?


MR. ROBERTS:  Oh, no.  First English didn't


address the question of when a temporary regulation can


become a taking.  It said that if you have a temporary


taking, and it assumed arguendo that there was a taking


for a temporary period, compensation is required, and we


don't dispute that at all.


QUESTION:  Yes, but as -- assume the court of


appeals opinion is the law.  First English wasn't a


taking.  That's your whole point.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, that's what the California


State courts determined on remand when they were addressed


with the question.


QUESTION:  No, no, just talk about Federal law. 


You're saying that First English could not have been a

taking, so we were just waiting our time up here.


MR. ROBERTS:  Oh, no, no, not at all.  First


English could have been a taking.  It would have required


an evaluation under, again, Penn Central, not Lucas, to


determine whether the regulation at issue there, both the


temporary and permanent, and both were at issue at


different points in First English, constituted a taking.


But once you assume that that was a taking, and


you assume the results of that analysis, then it is a


taking.  Compensation is required.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Roberts.


MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  General Olson, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS


GENERAL OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The colloquy so far today seems to me to


illustrate the wisdom of Justice O'Connor's comment in her


concurring opinion in the Palazzolo case last June that


the Court should avoid per se rules in the area of


regulatory taking.


Petitioners knew per se rule of takings


jurisprudence, taken to its logical end, would make every

freeze in the status quo, however brief, during a


permitting, planning, or rezoning process equivalent to a


condemnation, to use their words --


QUESTION:  I don't understand it that way,


General Olson.  I thought Mr. Berger separated out, or at


least certainly tried to separate out the normal zoning


process where you're working towards a permit and a permit


is realistically possible at the end of the road.


GENERAL OLSON:  It seems to me that's a very


difficult distinction for him to make, because it requires


an analysis of the nature of the Government's interest in


each particular permitting process.  We know that they can


be short, we know that they can be long, we know that they


can be comprehensive.


QUESTION:  I don't think that's necessarily


true.  I think you can segregate, at least to my


satisfaction, the idea of a zoning requirement in


existence -- you have to file for a permit -- and


basically to show that you comply with the zoning


requirements.  In other words, if you're going to have


zoning at all, a permit process is almost necessary as


opposed to a moratorium which doesn't say, you know, look,


we're going to look over your application and decide


whether you can build.  It simply says no, you can't


build.

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, what we would submit is


that that zoning permitting process is part of the


background principles of land use, land regulation, just


as temporary moratoria have always been, that when there's 


rezoning process, a process referred to by this court in


the First English case, that process may have to come to a


halt.


The purpose for the temporary moratoria here was


to allow the agency to develop a sensible plan and, as Mr.


Roberts has already noted by reference to the record,


there's no indication that it was not in good faith.  The


length of the period, 32 months, was held by the district


court to be a reasonable time to accomplish the


objectives.  The purpose of the plan, as acknowledged by


the petitioners themselves, is that the purpose for the


plan was to prevent the degradation of the lake and they


indicated that a slowdown -- in their brief, they


mentioned in their brief that a slowdown in building


permits was an appropriate governmental response to that


measure.


Now, in each instance the question is going to


be, how long did it take, was it in good faith, what was


the Government up to?  Here, the Government was attempting


to preserve the value that Mr. Berger's clients wanted. 


They themselves purchased their property and planned to

build a home on it because of the pristine quality of the


lake.  They make the argument in their brief that it was


being degraded, that something had to be done about it.  A


limit on development they say -- I think it's on page 3 of


their brief -- was the logical objective to solve,


approach to solve that particular problem.


So what Lake Tahoe, the regional board that


we're dealing with here today, was doing was saying, wait


a minute, before we destroy the lake let's stop, let's


have a process in which we evaluate how to solve the


problem that every landowner around the lake, including


the petitioners, want to have solved.


QUESTION:  Well, that's extraordinary.  You


refer to it, General Olson, as just a traditional


moratorium.  I don't think this is a traditional


moratorium at all. I think it's quite extraordinary to


just say, you know, a time out, nobody does anything with


this land.  I just don't think that that's the normal kind


of moratorium.  Nobody does anything beyond the limited


use that we anticipate we will ultimately impose.  It's


very rare that you impose a complete prohibition of use,


because that's a condemnation.


GENERAL OLSON:  It may be unusual, but it is not


so rare.  In fact, page 5 of the petitioners' brief refers


to the two --

 QUESTION:  Two cases, as I recall, that


involve -- total, right, yes.


GENERAL OLSON:  Two instances, and the first one


that they refer to is to aid the preparation of a


comprehensive plan by precluding developers from obtaining


permits that conflict with the plan being drafted.  That


is precisely almost the same words that were used by the


legislator in connection with the compact that suggested


that there ought to be a moratorium.  This is the compact


itself in the 1980 amendments.  It specifically said that


it was necessary temporarily to halt works of development


in the region which might otherwise absorb the entire


capability of the region for further development or direct


it out of harmony with the ultimate plan.


Now, if there is some challenge to the good


faith of what was going on here, that is not this case. 


If there's some challenge to what happened afterwards -- I


think the questions Justice Stevens asked point out that,


well, if there was something that was done improperly to


take these people's property with respect to what happened


afterwards, or how far it went, or how it affected a


particular property owner, that is the Penn Central test.


Now, for tactical reasons, the property owners


in this case decided not to pursue a Penn Central case. 


We heard here today that because it would be too expensive

and too complicated for any individual property owner to


bring that case.  Well, that is going to be the case every


time anybody challenges Government action as a taking of a


piece of property.


These property owners decided to pool their


interest and decide not to show what the Government's


interest was, the degree of invasion in individual


property rights, how much it hurt, whether or not it was


in good faith and so forth, so they eschewed tactically


all of those considerations.


Now, instead --


QUESTION:  With some reason, because they


couldn't use their property at all -- at all.


GENERAL OLSON:  They couldn't use their property


at all as far as this case was concerned, and the question


presented in this case, for a limited period of time while


a Government agency was acting to address the problem that


they acknowledge, because they acknowledge that continued


development along the lines that was occurring at the time


this moratorium was adopted was degrading the lake and


destroying their property.


QUESTION:  That's fine, and that's a general


social problem for which the entire society should pay.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  If, indeed, you do need that time to

figure out what to do with the lake, why should some


individuals bear the burden of that necessary pause to


consider what to do?


GENERAL OLSON:  I submit it's the teaching of


this Court that not every delay, not every intrusion on


the use of property, not every incursion on property


rights constitutes a taking under the Fifth Amendment.


QUESTION:  I understand that, but these aren't


the only people who are using Lake Tahoe.  They're


preserving Lake Tahoe for all of the citizens of that


State and for citizens of other States, for that matter.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, Justice --


QUESTION:  And yet they're saying, since we need


time to think about this, we are preventing total, total,


all the use of your land for 3 years.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  I don't see that it seems to me fair


that these people should bear the whole brunt of the


moratorium.


GENERAL OLSON:  They haven't established that


they have bore the whole brunt.  They haven't established


the degree to which their individual property rights were


violated, or the extent of their intrusion.  They haven't


done all of the things that this Court --


QUESTION:  They've certainly established a

common situation.  That is, every one of them, presumably,


was prevented from using the property for 3 years.


GENERAL OLSON:  Because the use of that


property, as they acknowledge, would have destroyed the


very property rights that they're here seeking to


vindicate, and what we're saying is that in many different


situations the Government might have lots of reasons,


local governments, State governments, Federal Governments,


to cause a pause in the development.


Now, what --


QUESTION:  I agree with that, and that's what


worries me.


GENERAL OLSON:  That's right, and --


QUESTION:  That's exactly what worries me.


GENERAL OLSON:  And that's why this Court in the


Penn Central case gave an opportunity to use a reasoned


decisionmaking to solve the problem, to find out how far


is too far.  To ask that very question that Justice Holmes


did is to entertain the answer.  We need to know how -- in


order to determine how far is too far, this Court has said


repeatedly we need to look at the circumstances.


What -- the rule that petitioners are proposing


interdicts that judicial fact-finding, reasoned


decisionmaking process.  What it also does is cause the


permitting agency, the Lake Tahoe Regional Planning Board,

to try to do this on a permit-by-permit, quasi-


adjudicative process, as opposed to what they did do, as


instructed by Congress, a legislative process in which


things would stop, reasoned decisionmaking would take


place --


QUESTION:  Well, no one is challenging their


authority in the sense of acting for the Government, but


the fact that they were instructed to do it by Congress


doesn't make it any more or any less of a taking.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I understand that,


Mr. Chief Justice, but what I'm saying is that the


Government agencies that looked at this problem decided


that it had to be solved in a global way.  This was


Government acting in a way we want it to act, in a


legislative process with transparency to look at the whole


problem and, if there had been a taking because it was too


long, or too much of an intrusion, there is a remedy under


the Fifth Amendment and it's described, how you get to


that remedy is described in this Court's jurisprudence in


the Penn Central case.  The petitioners here sought not to


pursue that remedy.


QUESTION:  May I ask, do you understand your


opponent to be arguing that a curfew would be a taking?


GENERAL OLSON:  A taking -- well, a curfew --

you couldn't go out after certain hours of the night, and


so the property was totally useless when the curfew --


would that be a taking under --


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I think that they're


arguing that any momentary suspension of the use of


property would be a taking.


QUESTION:  So it would be.


QUESTION:  Thirteenth Amendment.


Mr. Berger, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL M. BERGER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. BERGER:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Let me


touch briefly on a couple of things, if I might.


First, General Olson talked about this Court's


cases that generally have built on the question of, we


can't tell how far the regulation goes until we know how


far they went.  Well, that's true, and in this case we


know precisely how far they went.  They totally prohibited


the use of all of the property owners who are here in


front of this Court, and it's that question that we're


here to answer.  When we know how far they went, we don't


need to get into any detailed, factual investigation of


other circumstances.


Justice Kennedy asked about the First English


case, and whether the Court wasted its time there if the

Ninth Circuit's opinion in this case is simply affirmed,


and I would have to conclude that that is indeed what


happened.  The clear message of merely affirming what the


Ninth Circuit did in this case would be to tell all the


lower courts that they need to pay no attention to First


English, because this Court laid out a lot of clear


messages in the First English decision that the Ninth


Circuit paid no attention to, and --


QUESTION:  But it also said we merely hold --


this is from First English, stating the holding.  We


merely hold that where the Government's activities have


already worked a taking of all use of property, no


subsequent action by the Government can relieve it of the


duty to provide compensation for the period during which


the taking was effective.


MR. BERGER:  Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, that


is true, and -- but what the Court said in First English


was that we're limiting, you were limiting the case to


what you called the facts presented in that case, and the


facts presented in that case were a temporary moratorium


for about the same length of time as the one that we're


dealing with here, which froze all use of that property


and, in fact, in my belief had a better justification for


it, because it had a health and safety justification,


which this one doesn't.

 As you, justice Ginsburg, pointed out, the trial


court examined at great length the question of whether


these people were creating a nuisance and concluded that


there was no nuisance created here.  As much as he was


concerned about the fact that continued development around


Lake Tahoe might change the color of the lake, there was


no health problem with changing the color of the lake. 


There was no safety problem with changing the color of the


lake.  We would all be the poorer, I think --


QUESTION:  But that question was not resolved on


appeal.


MR. BERGER:  That's correct, the court of


appeals did not deal with that question, only the district


court did, and its analysis is there for you to look at.


The 1980 compact amendments that the two


legislatures and Congress went through are interesting in


this case, because while they, in fact, said there was a


need for a moratorium, but the moratorium that the


legislators and Congress agreed to was not the one that


TRPA enacted here.  They said, what we need is a cap on


the number of building permits that are issued, and that's


in the record here, too, and they said we're going to


limit the number of building permits that each city and


county can issue to the number that they issued in 1978.


The first thing that TRPA did after that was


54 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

enacted was to say, we need to rearrange that, and we're


going to say, you can issue those permits, but you can't


issue any of them to these people.  These people are


totally frozen out, and they're being frozen out as part


of a major public project so that we can clarify the


waters in Lake Tahoe, and it just seems to us that where


you have these people who are being asked to make this


sacrifice on behalf of the greater public good, either of


the people who already own homes around Lake Tahoe, and


whose lands therefore gets more valuable, or on behalf of


the rest of us who don't own homes up there but who might


like to vacation there so that we can also enjoy the


beauties of Lake Tahoe, that those people shouldn't be


left flapping in the breeze with no compensation for the


fact that they're the ones that have been asked to pay for


this project.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Berger.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
