 CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:  We'll hear  argument

5  Pfennig.

 Mr. Waxman. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR.  WAXMAN: 

Mr. Chief  Justice,  and  may it 

10  please the Court: 

11

 This case  involves a regulation  promulgated by 

12  the Federal Reserve Board to govern the disclosure of fees 

13  imposed for exceeding a credit limit.  It does not involve 

14  any challenge  to the  fees themselves  or any  contention 

15  that the  fees were  not disclosed.  Unquestionably  they 

16  were.  This case  concerns only  how such fees  should be 

17  characterized when they are disclosed. 

18

 QUESTION:  Would  you enlighten  us on just  how 

19  this transaction gets authorized in the ordinary course of 

20  events and in this event?  Is there any special call made, 

21  or is the credit card just  submitted to the store and the 

22  store processes  it  and if  it's  not rejected,  it  goes 

23  through?  What happens? 

24

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, as  the Solicitor General has 

25  explained  in  his brief  for  the Federal  Reserve Board, 

3


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  ordinarily the arrangement  between banks -- that  is, the 

2  banks that  issue  the cards  and the  banks  that do  the 

3  corresponding relationship with  the merchants -- have  an 

4  agreement between the  merchants and  the banks where  the 

5  merchant will  be liable for fraudulent use of the card or 

6  the other unless  it obtains authorization to  process the 

7  charge.  And so in the  ordinary practice, the  board has 

8  explained, a  merchant may or may not, is not required to, 

9  but may  well call  in the  charge or  submit the  account 

10  number to the issuing bank via the  correspondent bank and 

11  get an approval, yes or no, to process the charge. 

12

 Now,  the  board  has  explained  that  when the 

13  issuing  bank  authorizes  the  merchant  to  process  the 

14  charge, that two  important things don't happen.  One, it 

15  does not in any way represent a renegotiation between  the 

16  consumer and the  issuing bank, and it  says nothing about 

17  the overall credit limit.  And two, the issuing bank often 

18  will have no idea whether the charge being authorized will 

19  or will not trigger a  credit limit of the consumer for  a 

20  variety of reasons, not the least of which is that, as the 

21  board  explains,  credits  and  payments aren't  instantly 

22  reflected, merchants often  don't put  the true amount  of 

23  the charge in.  They may, as hotels and -- and rental car 

24  companies do  -- often  block very  large amounts  because 

25  they don't know what the ultimate charge will be.

1

 And there is also a recognition in the industry, 

2  the board  explains, of a certain tolerance.  That is, the 

3  merchant -- the credit  card company won't always  want to 

4  cut somebody off whenever it has a suspicion that they may 

5  hit  their  credit  limit  because  the  merchant  has  a 

6  relationship with  the customer.  And since  the system of 

7  information is so  imperfect, the issuing bank  also has a 

8  relationship  with  its  consumer  and  doesn't  want  to 

9  embarrass the consumer. 

10

 So the short answer to that -- the short version 

11  of  the very  long  answer  is  in  the  ordinary  course, 

12  merchants  have an  incentive  to seek  authorization, but 

13  they're  not  required to,  and  the authorization  that's 

14  given  doesn't  reflect  knowledge by  the  issuer  that a 

15  credit limit will be exceeded. 

16

 QUESTION:  But, Mr. Waxman,  is it not true that 

17  there  are many occasions on which  the credit limit will, 

18  in fact, be  exceeded and  there will, nevertheless,  come 

19  back an approval, and that the customer in those cases may 

20  or may  not  know  that his 

--  

that, A,  his  limit  was 

21  exceeded, and B, that he's going to be charged for it? 

22

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, the  creditor -- the consumer 

23  may  or may  not know  that his  or  her credit  limit was 

24  exceeded,  but  of course,  that  information  is entirely 

25  within the knowledge of the  -- the potential knowledge of 

5


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the  consumer because the  consumer does  know what  or -­

2  what charges  he or she has  made and what payments  he or 

3  she has made. 

4

 QUESTION:  Well, not necessarily.  You can have 

5  a card owned by two or three people in the same family and 

6  maybe the husband  spent some money  that the wife  didn't 

7  know about  while this  was going  on.  So it's at  least 

8  possible that they  would exceed the credit  limit without 

9  the credit cardholder knowing it, their not being aware of 

10  it, not keeping track of it. 

11

12

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, the -­

 QUESTION:  And -- and I'm just asking you, is it 

13  not true  that  it is  possible that  he  will receive  an 

14  affirmative  answer to  using  the  card  without  knowing 

15  whether or  not he  exceeded  the limit  and therefore  is 

16  going to be -- be charged for it? 

17

 MR.  WAXMAN:  It's  possible either  because he 

18  doesn't keep good track or he doesn't -- he's not accurate 

19  or he's allowed  a child or a  spouse to use the  card and 

20  isn't keeping track or control of that. 

21

 But one thing that you said, Your Honor, that is 

22  not  true is the issuing -- the credit card issuer is not 

23  giving permission directly to the consumer to do anything, 

24  and most particularly if -­

25

 QUESTION:  Well, but I'm  not sure that's right. 

6


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  If  the -- if the credit  card issuer is  informed of the 

2  overcharge, that  it's over the limit, and decides this is 

3  a good  customer, well,  let's not  charge him  for it  or 

4  let's okay  it anyway,  he gives that  information to  the 

5  merchant  and  the  merchant  may  not tell  the  customer 

6  anything about it.

 MR. WAXMAN:  The merchant -­

 QUESTION:  Isn't that true? 

 MR.  WAXMAN: 

The merchant  won't  know.  The 

10  merchant isn't going to tell the customer anything.

 MR. WAXMAN:  And the credit  card issuer may not

 MR. WAXMAN:  But you're positing -­

 QUESTION:  That's my point. 

 MR. WAXMAN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  The  credit company  may know and  he 

19  will not pass that information on to the consumer. 

20

 MR. WAXMAN:  There is a  credit -- there  is an 

21  agreement that must be accepted -­

22

23

 QUESTION:  Well, am I correct on my facts? 

 MR. WAXMAN:  You're --

 QUESTION:  Is it not possible? 

 MR. WAXMAN:  You are correct that it is possible

1  that the  consumer  won't realize  it and  the issuer  may 

2  know.  And in  that instance,  the issuer,  which has  no 

3  relationship directly with the consumer,  doesn't tell the 

4  merchant to tell the consumer.

 QUESTION:  Correct. 

 MR. WAXMAN:  But, Justice Stevens -­

 QUESTION:  And so the consumer may end up paying 

8  a charge that he didn't realize he'd incurred. 

9

10

11

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, the -­

 QUESTION:  Is that correct or not? 

 MR. WAXMAN: 

That is  only partially  correct. 

12  It's correct factually given the hypothetical that  you've 

13  articulated.  It's  incorrect legally because  the credit 

14  agreement -- it must -­

15

 QUESTION:  If he has -- if he knows two things. 

16  He knows  the fine print on the credit agreement and, two, 

17  he knows the status of his balance.

19

 MR. WAXMAN:  I -­

 QUESTION: 

But if  he  doesn't have  either of 

20  those  in mind, it could  occur -- it  could occur that he 

21  would run  an  overcharge and  be charged  $15  or $20  or 

22  whatever it is without realizing he's incurred the charge. 

23

 MR.  WAXMAN: 

It is  true  with  the following 

24  caveats.  I'm not  trying to  fight the hypothetical.  I 

25  just want to make sure -­

1

 QUESTION:  It  seems to  me you're unwilling  to 

2  give me a categorical yes answer when the answer is yes. 

3

 MR.  WAXMAN: 

And  I  can't, and  here's  why, 

4  Justice Stevens.  I -- I mean  no disrespect.  But many, 

5  many credit card issuers do not imply an over-limit fee on 

6  a transactional  basis.  They apply it, for example, if at 

7  the end  of the  month the  balance exceeds  the limit  as 

8  opposed to whether a particular transaction sort of spikes 

9  it over the limit  one time.  And so I'm just trying to be 

10  completely accurate. 

11

12

 Now, the term -- I think it's very important -­

 QUESTION: 

Well,  you've  given  me  lots  of 

13  examples  where the  charge would  not  be incurred.  I'm 

14  merely trying to get you to acknowledge there will be some 

15  cases in which a person who is not fully familiar with the 

16  -- with  the balance in  his account doesn't  realize he's 

17  gone  over the amount  and is  being charged for  an extra 

18  credit charge. 

19

 MR. WAXMAN:  I think that must -- there must be 

20  instances in which that is true. 

21

 But the  term, credit  limit, Your  Honor, is  a 

22  term of  art that is recognized  in the industry,  that is 

23  reflected in the Federal Reserve Board regulations, and it 

24  draws an important distinction between increasing a credit 

25  limit,  an established credit  limit, upon  an application

1  and authorizing a point-of-sale transaction. 

2

 QUESTION:  Well, now, Mr. Waxman,  exactly what 

3  happens when  a point-of-sale  transaction is  authorized? 

4  The merchant is then off the hook? 

5

 MR. WAXMAN:  The  merchant has  a safe  harbor, 

6  Your Honor.  The merchant is told, if you pay this  charge 

7  and it turns out  not to be collectible for any reason, we 

8  will hold you harmless.  And that's the reason that  this 

9  business 

--  

contractual  relationship  is  established 

10  between  issuers  and  merchants, as  a  way  to encourage 

11  merchants to allow use of the card. 

12

13

14

15

 Now -­

 QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, is -- I'm sorry. 

 MR. WAXMAN:  No. 

 QUESTION:  Is the -- is the  event of exceeding 

16  the 

--  

the  limit  defined  in  these  agreements 

17  characteristically as an event that can occur at  any time 

18  during the  billing  period, or  is it  an  event that  is 

19  defined as -- as occurring only at the  end of the billing 

20  period  when all the credits and -- and all the debits are 

21  -- are accounted for? 

22

 MR. WAXMAN:  My understanding,  Justice Souter, 

23  is it  varies depending on issuer  and card, but  that is, 

24  some -- some cards  will -- all -- all -- well, there are 

25  some credit cards and charge cards that don't have limits, 

10


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  but when  they have a limit,  the limit is  required to be 

2  explicated  in  the  initial  disclosures. 

And  in  the 

3  solicitation, the disclosure, and all periodic statements, 

4  the  lender,  the  credit  card  issuer,  is  required  to 

5  identify the credit  limit and specify that  fees that are 

6  charged for exceeding a credit limit will be the following 

7  amount. 

8

 QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, will you explain what the 

9  consequence  is? 

It's  -- this  is  not  a  question of 

10  disclosure or  not because either it  will be part  of the 

11  finance charge  and disclosed as  such or the  -- whatever 

12  you  call OCL.  What difference  does it make?  It's not 

13  notice.  If it goes -- if it's part of the finance charge, 

14  how is the consumer benefitted? 

15

 MR.  WAXMAN:  Well, I don't  -- I  will explain 

16  what  difference it  makes.  No  one  has yet  explained, 

17  neither the respondent in this case nor the Sixth Circuit, 

18  how  the consumer  is benefitted  by the  rule  that she's 

19  advocating or the Sixth Circuit's rule, but  here's how it 

20  works. 

21

 In the open-end credit  relationship, the credit 

22  card or charge card relationship, there are three relevant 

23  events. 

24

 One  is  the  solicitation  or advertisement  to 

25  invite  someone  to  enter into  a  relationship.  That's 

11


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  called the solicitation. 

2

3

 The -­

 QUESTION:  Are you  talking about  solicitation 

4  for  a  purchase  of  a credit  card  or  for  purchase of 

5  merchandise? 

6

 MR. WAXMAN:  For a purchase  of a credit  card. 

7  You  get a  letter in  the  mail saying  buy a 

--  

open a 

8  Citibank card, and there are  certain disclosures that are 

9  required in those solicitations. 

10

 If you  send back  something that  says, yes,  I 

11  want to have a -- I want one of your credit cards, the act 

12  and the  regulations require that  certain disclosures  be 

13  made  at  that  point,  and  that's  called  the  initial 

14  disclosure. 

15

 And  then  the  third  event  is  the  periodic 

16  statement, when you get your statement every month or so. 

17

 Now, with respect  to the  solicitation and  the 

18  initial disclosure,  the  consequences of  calling this  a 

19  finance charge or a component of the finance charge versus 

20  an other  charge are  zero.  That  is, in  both of  those 

21  instances,  the  lender,  the issuer,  must  disclose that 

22  there  will be charges paid -- fees assessed for exceeding 

23  a credit  limit and  how  much it  is.  And  they're  not 

24  characterized  there  as  part of  the  finance  charge or 

25  otherwise.

1

 The 

--  

on  the -- those  documents  require a 

2  statement of what the APR, the annualized percentage rate, 

3  is,  but the APR  in those  statements refers only  to the 

4  periodic  rate,  the  interest  rate  that's going  to  be 

5  charged to all -- applied to all charges.  In the -­

6

 QUESTION:  That's the only  thing it could occur 

7  to. 

8

9

10

 MR. WAXMAN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR.  WAXMAN:  Because  you  don't  know whether 

11  there will be late charges or over-limit charges. 

12

 QUESTION:  Is -- is it  a consequence of  -- of 

13  the other  position that they would somehow have to try to 

14  do the impossible? 

15

 MR. WAXMAN:  Not at those two stages, but at the 

16  third stage, that is, the periodic statement, when you get 

17  your bill  every month, there is  a difference there.  In 

18  both instances,  there will  be a  specification of  over­

19  limit charge,  but if the Sixth Circuit is right, in those 

20  instances  in  which  the issuer  actually  knew  that the 

21  charge it authorized  the merchant to process  resulted in 

22  the  consequence  of  an over-limit  charge,  it  would be 

23  called over-limit charge  finance charge.  That  is, there 

24  would be a line item that  specifies what it is, just like 

25  any other charge or any other purchase or payment, and the 

13


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  amount.  But it would  affect the annual percentage  rate, 

2  what's called  the historical  annual percentage  rate, in 

3  the periodic statement. 

4

 QUESTION: 

Are  there  any  other 

--  

other 

5  instances  in  the  act  where  the  APR,  calculated 

6  retroactively on  the monthly  statement,  is higher  than 

7  what was the APR that was disclosed? 

8

 MR.  WAXMAN: 

Yes, there 

--  

yes,  there are, 

9  Justice  Stevens,  because  there  are  certain  types  of 

10  charges that  may or may not  occur.  For example,  if you 

11  use your card to get cash at the cash machine or something 

12  that will be -- will -- that are charged in the finance -­

13  that are part  of the finance charge and  will, therefore, 

14  affect  the APR  on the  monthly statement,  but won't  be 

15  disclosed to the -­

16

 QUESTION:  So -- so then the respondent's theory 

17  could -- and that's consistent with  the act, I  take it. 

18  So then respondent's theory could work. 

19

 My concern was that respondent's theory couldn't 

20  work  because you had -- couldn't hypothetically calculate 

21  an annual percentage rate not knowing whether charge would 

22  be made. 

23

24

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  But if you can  and -- and do have an 

25  adjustment of the  APR that's permitted under  the act, on 

14


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the disclosure  statement, then  her theory  at least  can 

2  work. 

3

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, her -- I'm not saying  that 

4  her theory  or the Sixth Circuit's rule couldn't work.  It 

5  would require a great deal of additional rulemaking by the 

6  Federal  Reserve  Board  because  the APR  is  a 

--  

is a 

7  fraction, is a  percentage, the numerator of  which is the 

8  component  of  all  the  individual  charges  and  the 

9  denominator is something  that, in the context of an over­

10  limit fee, is unclear.  Does it apply to the  transaction 

11  that  it  was  applied  to?  Is  it  the  average monthly 

12  balance?  Is it for the whole  month or part of the month? 

13  It's not impossible. 

14

 But what it  -- what it is  is directly contrary 

15  to the two objectives of TILA.  The purpose of TILA is to 

16  come up with bright line  classifications that are readily 

17  complied with by  issuers and that help  consumers compare 

18  competing costs of  credit.  That is manifest in Congress' 

19  purpose, and a rule that  requires the treatment month  to 

20  month, charge  to charge depend on what the issuer knew at 

21  the  time  it authorized  some  charge that  may  later be 

22  determined to  have triggered  at -- the  -- allowing  the 

23  borrower  to  exceed the  credit  limit would  cause these 

24  monthly APR's to vary widely and, it seems to me, can only 

25  create confusion and  inability to say, well,  gee, I just

1  got an  application or a -- a thing  in the mail from, you 

2  know, Citibank saying 17.3  percent, but I just looked  at 

3  my statement and it's 79 percent. 

4

 QUESTION: 

Mr.  Waxman,  I  don't  think  you 

5  finished the  answer to the question  I asked, and  what I 

6  wanted to know is if  it's labeled a finance charge,  then 

7  there won't be interest on it; whereas, if it's treated as 

8  a debit  like any purchase, then the interest would run on 

9  it in the  future.  So could  -- it could be  a difference 

10  for the consumer, could it not? 

11

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, yes, in the month in which it 

12  has  occurred  because, with  respect  to the  next month, 

13  whatever finance charge  was applied and -- and continues 

14  as a  balance will  also have  applied to  it the  finance 

15  charge, that  is, the interest rate that would apply.  So, 

16  but with -- there  is a consequence in the month  in which 

17  it  is  applied;  that  is,  for  whatever  days  it's 

18  outstanding, up until the  -- the end of the -- the card's 

19  grace  period, a finance  charge could be  applied to that 

20  other charge. 

21

22

 QUESTION:  So it could be -- it could be -­

 QUESTION:  Why isn't it  carried over from month 

23  to month?  In other  words, I -- I get  a late -- this 

--

24  this special  charge, but I just  pay the minimum,  so I'm 

25  really carrying  part of  the special  charge over  to the

1  next month.  I pay interest on that too, I take it. 

2

 MR. WAXMAN:  These cards  typically have a grace 

3  period in which you can pay off your balance and you don't 

4  have to pay any finance charge, but if you don't, whatever 

5  charges  are carried  forward,  whether they  derive  from 

6  purchases of over-limit charges or late fee charges or 

--

7  or finance  charges in  the previous  month, something  is 

8  charged against it.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL 

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

 MS. McDOWELL:  Mr.  Chief Justice,  and may  it 

16  please the Court: 

17

 Congress  has given  the  Federal Reserve  Board 

18  broad authority  to implement  the Truth  in Lending  Act. 

19  The regulation at  issue here is the  permissible exercise 

20  of that authority. 

21

 The board has addressed  the disclosure of  fees 

22  for exceeding a credit limit with a clear bright line rule 

23  which requires all  such fees to be  disclosed clearly and 

24  conspicuously but separately  from the finance charge  and 

25  APR.

1

 To  use  the  Court's  own  terminology,  that 

2  approach is neither obviously repugnant to the statute nor 

3  demonstrably irrational.  To  the contrary, the rule  is a 

4  sensible one  that,  in the  view  of the  expert  agency, 

5  provides meaningful  disclosure  to  consumers  and  clear 

6  guidance to creditors.  There's  no merit to the court  of 

7  appeals'  and respondent's  contrary approach  which would 

8  only  impose  exorbitant  compliance  costs  on  creditors 

9  without any meaningful  benefit in terms of  disclosure to 

10  consumers. 

11

 The  board's  rule  is  not  foreclosed  by  the 

12  statutory  text.  The  act  does not  speak  expressly to 

13  whether  over-the-limit  fees  are  or  are  not  finance 

14  charges.  Nor  is  that question  resolved  by the  act's 

15  generally phrased definition of finance charges as charges 

16  imposed as an incident to  the extension of credit.  That 

17  phrase is ambiguous  as to whether it  encompasses charges 

18  that are imposed not  as the cost of  the credit that  the 

19  creditor  has contractually  obligated itself  to provide, 

20  but instead as a penalty for the consumer's obtaining some 

21  additional credit  that she  had no  contractual right  to 

22  obtain. 

23

 The  board's  rule is  rational.  As  the board 

24  recognized over-the-limit fees -­

 MS. McDOWELL:  Yes. 

 QUESTION: 

Would you 

--  

as I  understand the 

3  respondent's brief,  it asks us to draw a line between the 

4  over-the-limit fees that  are imposed for acts  of default 

5  and those  that are  imposed for  extension of  the credit 

6  limit and says that Regulation Z draws such a distinction. 

7  Would you comment on that argument? 

8

 MS. McDOWELL:  That  argument is incorrect, Your 

9  Honor.  The relevant provision  of Regulation Z, which is 

10  at page  2 of the petitioners' brief, contains no limit of 

11  that sort.  It speaks of charges for actual unanticipated 

12  late  payment  for  exceeding  a  credit  limit  and  for 

13  delinquency, default,  or similar  occurrences.  It  thus 

14  speaks in a categorical manner  of charges for exceeding a 

15  credit limit.  It doesn't condition them on whether it was 

16  unanticipated or whether it's tantamount to a default. 

17

 The  board  has  acknowledged  that  there  are 

18  hypothetical situations at  least in which  a -- a  charge 

19  might be labeled an over-the-limit charge when it actually 

20  is  not,  when  there  actually,  for  example,  is  no 

21  contractual credit limit and -- and a charge is simply, in 

22  that  context,  labeled  inaccurately  an over-the-credit-

23  limit fee.  However, when a charge is, in fact, imposed by 

24  the creditor as a consequence  of the consumer's exceeding 

25  the contractual credit  limit, it  is validly within  this

1  regulation. 

2

 QUESTION:  Was  this an  account that carried  a 

3  finance  charge? 

Because  the  regulations  describe 

4  something called  charge  card that  doesn't have  finance 

5  charge, but could have an over-the-limit charge. 

6

 MS.  McDOWELL:  That's -- the particular account 

7  at issue in this case was a credit card. 

8

 QUESTION:  Which  did have a finance  charge, or 

9  you don't know? 

10

 MS. McDOWELL:  Yes, it  does impose a  periodic 

11  charge if  all charges that are run up during a particular 

12  month are not paid within the grace period. 

13

 QUESTION:  If I understand  the other side, they 

14  make kind of a plain language argument.  They -- they talk 

15  to the  merchant.  The  merchant sends  in  -- they  want 

16  approve a $200-purchase and they  get back, well, it'll go 

17  over the  limit and is  it okay.  And they say,  yes, let 

18  them go over the limit, and so they've extended additional 

19  credit.  And -- and they, if they're  going to charge them 

20  $15 to do  it, that would be  a finance charge -- I mean, 

21  that would  be a charge for  an extension of credit.  Why 

22  doesn't it fit the plain language? 

23

 MS.  McDOWELL: 

We don't  disagree  with  you, 

24  Justice Stevens,  that it  is,  at some  general level,  a 

25  charge imposed incident to the extension of credit.  There 

20

1  was necessarily an extension of credit here. 

2

 QUESTION: 

In -- in  exchange for  the higher 

3  credit limit, yes. 

4

 MS. McDOWELL: 

The -- but  -- but  the  term, 

5  incident to the extension of  credit, is an ambiguous one. 

6  The Court construed  similar language  in the Holly  Farms 

7  case  and  recognized it  to  be  ambiguous.  It  doesn't 

8  address precisely  the nature or -- or the extent to which 

9  a particular charge has to be connected to an extension of 

10  credit.  And here, the  board has reasonably viewed  over­

11  the-limit fees like  late payment  fees and other  default 

12  fees as  being imposed for a violation of the terms of the 

13  credit agreement rather than as -­

14

 QUESTION: 

And then  the  -- but  wouldn't the 

15  customer say,  well, I didn't violate anything?  You told 

16  me I could do it.  Why is it a violation? 

17

 MS. McDOWELL:  In the first place, there  was no 

18  communication  in  this case,  and  there typically  is no 

19  communication  when  we're 

speaking  only  of  the 

20  authorization process. 

21

 QUESTION:  But  what if  there were  -- what  if 

22  there  had been a  communication?  Would  it be different? 

23  Would it  be a different case if the merchant put the bank 

24  officer on the phone and said, you're over your limit, and 

25  the -- and the customer said, is it okay for me to pay the 

21


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  extra 15  bucks for  this -- go  over the  limit $15?  He 

2  says, yes, we'll -- we'll okay it.  And then they hang up. 

3  At the end  of the month, he  gets a $15 charge  for that. 

4  Would that be  -- that would not be an extension of credit 

5  in your view  if they talked on the phone and agreed to it 

6  instead  of  having  to just  go  through  these anonymous 

7  communications. 

8

 MS.  McDOWELL: 

It  would  look more  like  an 

9  extension of credit, I -- I might grant you, but the board 

10  is still entitled to draft categorical rules  by virtue of 

11  its authority under section 1604(a) to make classification 

12  adjustments and exceptions. 

13

 QUESTION:  There's no duty on the -- on the part 

14  of the  bank to say, of course, if we okay it, you have to 

15  pay an extra 15 bucks. 

16

 MS. McDOWELL:  Well,  Your Honor, you're raising 

17  a policy question that Congress or the board could address 

18  whether  additional disclosures are  required at the point 

19  of purchase.  Here we're  talking about disclosures  that 

20  occurred later,  days or  weeks later,  when the  customer 

21  receives her periodic statement. 

22

 QUESTION:  Just a  bill that  said, you  didn't 

23  realize it, but you just earned  a -- you just -- you  owe 

24  us $15 that you should have realized. 

25

 MS. McDOWELL:  Well, and whether it's imposed as 

22


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  a finance charge or -- or as an other charge, the consumer 

2  is still  going to have the  -- the kind of  surprise that 

3  you referred to.  And in the board's view, it doesn't make 

4  any meaningful difference whether, at  that point when the 

5  customer receives her periodic statement, it is identified 

6  as  one  or  the  other.  Indeed,  it  could  confuse the 

7  consumer to have  the over-the-limit  fee included in  the 

8  historic or  actual APR on her periodic statement.  If she 

9  were,  for  example,  comparing  that  statement  with  a 

10  solicitation that she  received by direct mail,  she might 

11  be inclined to think that -- that the solicitation offered 

12  better terms when it really did not. 

13

 QUESTION:  Would you agree that -- that it would 

14  be to the consumer's advantage to have this categorized as 

15  a  finance charge  because then she  wouldn't have  to pay 

16  interest on that in -- in future charges? 

17

 MS. McDOWELL:  No, Your Honor.  She  would still 

18  have  to  pay interest  on  it.  Whether  it's labeled  a 

19  finance charge or not makes no difference  in that regard. 

20  It only has to  do with how it's labeled  and whether it's 

21  included  in  the  actual APR  on  the  -- the  customer's 

22  periodic  statement. 

Even  if  it's labeled  a  finance 

23  charge,  in  other words,  she  can be  charged additional 

24  interest.  The periodic rate can be applied to it. 

25

 So, in  fact, the  board has  concluded that 

--

23


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that there's  no benefit  to consumers  to treating  over­

2  the-limit fees generally as finance charges, and the Sixth 

3  Circuit's rule, in particular, would make no sense because 

4  it would  depend  on the  creditor's subjective  knowledge 

5  whether a particular charge was or was not included in the 

6  APR  in  the  particular  month. 

That  would  impose 

7  significant compliance  costs on  creditors and would  not 

8  tell consumers anything that's particularly meaningful  to 

9  them. 

10

 When the board revised Regulation Z in the 1980­

11  81 period, after  the TILA  Simplification Act, the  board 

12  sought to focus on legally enforceable relationships,  not 

13  on unenforceable understandings that a consumer might have 

14  as a  result of a course of  dealings with the credit card 

15  company. 

16

 And  understanding  this  particular  provision, 

17  consistent  with  its  plain  terms,  as applying  to  all 

18  charges imposed or exceeding a  credit limit is consistent 

19  with that approach.  It provides the meaningful disclosure 

20  and it avoids imposing unwarranted compliance costs. 

21

 If there are no further questions -­

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SYLVIA A. GOLDSMITH 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

24


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  Mr. Chief  Justice, and may  it 

2  please the Court: 

3

 This case has come  full circle.  It  started 4­

4  and-a-half years  ago with  the filing of  a complaint,  a 

5  complaint  that says  if you  authorize the  request of  a 

6  consumer to have more  credit and you  tie a fee for  that 

7  authorization, that fee is a finance charge. 

8

 The question  presented here  is whether  or not 

9  the Sixth Circuit has the right or should have invalidated 

10  a provision of Regulation Z with respect  to the exclusion 

11  of certain over-limit fees, and we believe that resolution 

12  of that  question brings us back  to the complaint.  What 

13  does the complaint say in that regard? 

14

 QUESTION:  Are  -- are  you fully defending  the 

15  decision of the Sixth Circuit, Ms. Goldsmith? 

16

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  We -- yes.  We believe that the 

17  Sixth Circuit's decision is that this fee, the fee in this 

18  case, is  a  finance  charge, and  we  stand  behind  that 

19  decision  100 percent.  We have  stated in  our complaint 

20  that  this fee -- and -- and it's important  to remember 

21  that -­

22

 QUESTION:  Ms. Goldsmith, before  you continue, 

23  the  Sixth  Circuit said  a  portion  of Regulation  Z  is 

24  invalid because it's  incompatible with the statute.  Are 

25  you defending that invalidation?

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  In theory,  yes.  We -- we  feel

5

 QUESTION:  How about in practice? 

 (Laughter.) 

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  We feel that perhaps  the court 

6  did not need to go there, that -- in -- in looking at  the 

7  situation now, we -- we have always -­

8

 QUESTION:  But you asked -- you asked  the court 

9  to do that. 

10

11

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  Yes, we did. 

 QUESTION:  When  you argued the case  before the 

12  Sixth  Circuit,  you  made it  very  clear  that you  were 

13  seeking a  holding  that a  portion  of Regulation  Z  was 

14  incompatible with the statute. 

15

 MS.  GOLDSMITH: 

I think  to  the  extent that 

16  Regulation Z says that anything you call an over-limit fee 

17  as excluded from the finance  charge, that is incompatible 

18  with the  regulation.  And we  stand by  our lower  court 

19  argument  that if that  is the case,  then that regulation 

20  cannot stand. 

21

 And -- and  once the  Government stepped in,  we 

22  realized -- a  significant part of their argument  is that 

23  the -- that the Federal Reserve Board could say that.  The 

24  Federal Reserve Board  could say that all  over-limit fees 

25  are excluded from the finance charge and we took that as a 

26


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  -- as a tacit concession  that the -- the Federal  Reserve 

2  Board didn't actually do that.  What they said, within the 

3  context  of  section 226.4(c)(2),  is  that  fees, penalty 

4  fees, fees  for unilateral  acts of default,  need not  be 

5  disclosed as part of the finance charge.  And so while we 

6  support the Sixth  Circuit's decision,  this is a  finance 

7  charge -- no matter how you get there, you have to  get to 

8  that  point 

--  

alternately,  as  an alternate  basis  to 

9  support the decision,  we realize  that the regulation  is 

10  not necessarily triggered in this instance. 

11

 QUESTION:  But  that's an  argument you  didn't 

12  make before the Sixth Circuit.  The Sixth Circuit -- you 

13  told them that  this regulation was incompatible  with the 

14  statute. 

15

 MS.  GOLDSMITH:  That  is correct.  And I  -- I 

16  have to fall on the  sword in that regard, that  honestly, 

17  until the Government  stepped in  and helped clarify  that 

18  issue  for us,  we did  -- we  were fighting  a  battle we 

19  didn't need to fight.  And ultimately -­

20

 QUESTION:  But  they clarified  it in the  Sixth 

21  Circuit.  So why didn't you say, oh, Sixth Circuit, we've 

22  now seen the light and we -- we don't  want the regulation 

23  declared invalid? 

24

 MS.  GOLDSMITH: 

I  don't  believe  that  the 

25  Government clarified  that for  us in  the Sixth  Circuit. 

27


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  What -- what  clarified it  for me  was the  Government's 

2  brief, the merit briefing in this case, where they said, I 

3  believe  28  pages into  a 30-page  brief, if  the Federal 

4  Reserve Board wants  to exclude all over-limit  fees, they 

5  could, and  that's sort of when  the light bulb  went off. 

6  They didn't.  And  that -- that's  sort of  what took  us 

7  where we are. 

8

 And ultimately,  I think  there's precedent  for 

9  this Court to  review the ultimate  basis to support  this 

10  decision based on making sure that the -­

11

 QUESTION:  Well, you  used the word review.  We 

12  wouldn't be reviewing it.  We would be taking a first view 

13  of it. 

14

15

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I'm sorry. 

 QUESTION:  But you didn't -- you -- we would not 

16  be reviewing anything that the court below determined.  We 

17  would be  accepting a new argument that has not been aired 

18  below, and that's not review. 

19

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I think that in  Connecticut v. 

20  Doehr,  for instance,  this Court acknowledged  that there 

21  are circumstances that this Court wants  to make sure that 

22  the right  rule  of  law  is handed  down. 

And  if  the 

23  questions are  intertwined, the  -- the  issues that  were 

24  raised below  and an alternate argument in  support of the 

25  decision is  raised before this Court, if it's a matter of

2  direction on, if it's a matter that has been -­

3

 QUESTION:  Usually  if we're asked to  affirm on 

4  an alternate  ground,  it's a  ground  that the  court  of 

5  appeals passed on as kind  of an alternate ground.  Here, 

6  the court of appeals didn't pass on this at all. 

7

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I  agree.  And like I said, I -­

8  I believe  in the Connecticut  v. Doehr  case, this  Court 

9  acknowledged  that alternately  we  cannot  put form  over 

10  substance, and we need to make sure that the right rule of 

11  law is passed down. 

12

 And I  believe Justice Scalia,  as a  concurring 

13  comment in U.S.  v. Burke, said there's got to  be play in 

14  the joints, that even if it is not something that  came to 

15  the Court procedurally,  if it is  something that -- that 

16  meets the three factors I was enumerating from Connecticut 

17  v. Doehr, the Court will entertain an argument. 

18

 QUESTION:  It isn't just a procedural point, Ms. 

19  Goldsmith.  We do  better if  we have  an opinion  of the 

20  court  of appeals  on  the  subject  than  if  we're  just 

21  launching it into -- for the first time ourselves. 

22

 MS.  GOLDSMITH:  And  I would agree,  and -- and 

23  the only  defense that I  have to that  is that this  is a 

24  matter that  has been fully briefed and  argued by counsel 

25  before this Court.  And when -- when the case got taken in

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  by this Court, everyone said  to me, you have to  remember 

2  why they  took it in,  and -- and my understanding  is is 

3  because the regulation has been challenged.  And -­

4

 QUESTION: 

What other  argument  is there?  I 

5  don't understand.  I  thought -- and I'm  just mixed  up 

6  about this.  I thought that there is a Z regulation.  It's 

7  called Regulation  Z.  And I thought Regulation Z says the 

8  following is  not part of the finance charge, a charge for 

9  exceeding  a  credit limit. 

Now, are  we  talking about 

10  something in  this case that is not a charge for exceeding 

11  a credit limit? 

12

13

14

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I believe so. 

 QUESTION:  What? 

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I think that a  fee denominated 

15  an over-limit fee that is actually an anticipated cost for 

16  approving  an extension  of credit  is in  fact a  finance 

17  charge. 

18

 QUESTION:  Does it say on  the paper this  is a 

19  charge for exceeding a credit limit? 

20

 MS.  GOLDSMITH:  I  believe  they called  it an 

21  over-limit fee assessment. 

22

 QUESTION:  All right.  And so  it's called  an 

23  over-limit fee assessment and you pay it if you exceed the 

24  credit limit.  You don't pay it if you  exceed the credit 

25  limit, or do you?

 MS.  GOLDSMITH: 

I  think  that's  a  factual 

2  question.  I -- I think -­

3

 QUESTION:  Oh, okay.  Well, what is  the answer 

4  to  the factual question?  Do  you pay for  exceeding the 

5  credit limit or do you not pay it for exceeding the credit 

6  limit? 

7

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I believe the facts of this case 

8  -- this is not a  fee that was imposed for the  unilateral 

9  act of exceeding a credit limit. 

10

11

12

 QUESTION:  Okay.  So -­

 QUESTION:  It depends, doesn't it, on -­

 QUESTION:  -- there's a  new argument, the first 

13  time in this Court, that this is not a fee for exceeding a 

14  credit limit.  Was it made below in any form? 

15

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I believe the allegations of our 

16  complaint have always been clear. 

17

 QUESTION:  Oh, yes, but, I mean -- that may be. 

18  I'm just asking, have you ever told any court before today 

19  that  this is not  the -- I'm not  -- it sounds sarcastic, 

20  but  I don't  mean it to  be sarcastic.  I want  to know. 

21  Have you ever before argued in this case, told a judge and 

22 

--  

that this is not a  fee, quote, for exceeding a credit 

23  limit?  End quote. 

24

25

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  No. 

 QUESTION:  No.

 QUESTION:  Ms. Goldsmith,  we wouldn't resolve a 

2  whole lot in this case,  however, if we didn't reach  that 

3  question, would we? 

4

5

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I don't believe we would. 

 QUESTION:  We  -- we'd just have  another case a 

6  little bit down  the line, perhaps  with the same  parties 

7  before the Court, arguing this -- this follow-on question. 

8  Right? 

9

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I believe absolutely.  I think 

10  that what we realized is  that the arguments that we  were 

11  making  in the court  below, which  -- which we  stand by, 

12  were premature. 

13

 QUESTION: 

If  we  don't  resolve  it,  we've 

14  essentially wasted our time. 

15

 What -- what -- doesn't it depend upon what  the 

16  regulation  means by  credit limit?  It  could mean  that 

17  limit set forth in the -- in the agreement with the credit 

18  card company,  past which  there is  no obligation on  the 

19  part of the company to extend you any  further credit.  It 

20  could -- it could reasonably  mean that.  Indeed, that 

--

21  that's what  I would normally think  it does mean.  Or it 

22  could mean  what you want it  to mean, whatever  limit the 

23  company later places upon your desire to -- to go ahead. 

24

 Now, why should we accept your interpretation of 

25  it  rather than  the  interpretation of  the  agency?  We 

32


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  usually do accept  the agency's interpretation of  its own 

2  regulation. 

3

 MS.  GOLDSMITH: 

I  don't  believe  that  our 

4  interpretation conflicts with that of the  Federal Reserve 

5  Board.  If  -- if we  look at  the plain language  of the 

6  regulation -­

7

 QUESTION: 

We  wouldn't be  arguing  here.  I 

8  mean -­

9

 MS.  GOLDSMITH:  I believe  what the -- what the 

10  Federal Reserve Board has said is that when you have a fee 

11  for a unilateral act of default, that that fee is properly 

12  excluded from the finance charge.  I believe in the -­

13

 QUESTION:  Well, don't  we have  to accept  the 

14  Government's position?  It's  representing the agency,  is 

15  it not? 

16

17

18

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  Absolutely. 

 QUESTION:  So it is the agency position. 

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I don't  believe that you  will 

19  find  in the Government's  brief an argument  that the fee 

20  alleged in  this case necessarily fits within the terms of 

21  section 226.4(c)(2).  In fact,  I believe several  times, 

22  pages  17, 18 of  the Government's brief,  they talk about 

23  how over-limit fees were included as a penalty fee in that 

24  portion of the regulation. 

25

 That gets us back to the complaint.  Was the fee 

33


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  charged  here  a  penalty  fee or  was  it  a  fee for  an 

2  anticipated, approved extension of credit? 

3

 QUESTION: 

I  didn't  think  that  was  the 

4  Government's argument in  my -- as I  read it.  I thought 

5  there are some  words here.  For  exceeding a -- it  says, 

6  for  exceeding a credit  limit.  And as I  understood the 

7  argument -- I  might not  have perfectly well  -- is -- I 

8  thought that their argument is basically when you exceed a 

9  credit  limit,  the company  doesn't  want you  to  do it. 

10  Okay?  So it says, no.  And  if you do it, we're not going 

11  to cancel you out, but we will charge you a penalty.  Now, 

12  sometimes it's what you say.  Sometimes the company would 

13  love you to do it  and get the extra money.  In fact, they 

14  might make profits  on that.  So they'd love you to do it. 

15  But trying to  distinguish between those two  instances is 

16  too  difficult,  and because  it's  too difficult,  we are 

17  going to have  a blanket rule, and the  blanket rule is if 

18  you fall  within these  words, exceeding  a credit  limit, 

19  this is not a finance charge. 

20

 Now,  that's  what  I  understood  it to  be,  a 

21  typical  administrative  agency  argument.  And  they say 

22  Chevron, Mead, et cetera, we win.  All right. 

23

 Now,  suppose  let  me 

--  

for the  purpose  of 

24  answering, please assume  that you do  have a charge  here 

25  that  falls  within the  term,  exceeding a  credit limit. 

34

1  What is your response to the argument that I just made? 

2

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I  think if we assume that  this 

3  fee is a fee for exceeding a credit limit, then we need to 

4  look at the nature of the fee and determine whether or not 

5  that is obviously repugnant to  the statute.  And I  think 

6  part of 

--  

of what  we  have been  accused  of doing  is 

7  creating an impossible factual distinction.  Some would be 

8  disclosed as a finance charge, some would not. 

9

 And I direct the Court  to the regulation itself 

10  that draws  that factual distinction as to late fees.  The 

11  -- the Federal Reserve Board went out of its  way, in both 

12  the language of the regulation and  the commentary, to say 

13  if this is a unilateral act of default, you have paid late 

14  or not in  the amount that you were supposed to pay and we 

15  absolutely did not authorize that, that must -- that would 

16  be excluded  from the finance charge.  But if the creditor 

17  acquiesced in that in any way, that is a finance charge. 

18

19

 And what our position is is that a late fee -­

 QUESTION:  I mean, you say the agency said this? 

20  Where -- where did the agency say that? 

21

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  In  both the regulation  itself 

22  and the commentary.  In the commentary -­

23

 QUESTION: 

What 

--  

what  portion  of  the 

24  regulation says that? 

25

 MS.  GOLDSMITH:  Section  226.4(c)(2)  in  the 

35


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  portion that says actual unanticipated late payments.  And 

2  in the  commentary, the -- the board has  defined actual, 

3  and it's the qualification of actual unanticipated goes to 

4  the  question is this  a unilateral  act of default  or is 

5  this something that the creditor acquiesced in.  So our -­

6  our point is is that if you look at -­

7

 QUESTION:  I suppose  that depends  on what 

--

8  what time period unanticipated refers to. 

9

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I  believe that  the commentary 

10  helps explain that for us. 

11

12

 QUESTION:  Okay.  What does the commentary say? 

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  The commentary says if  this is 

13  truly a  late fee because you  have paid and  the creditor 

14  could do nothing  about it, then  that is going  to be  an 

15  actual unanticipated  late fee.  But if  this is something 

16  that month  after month  after month  you paid  late every 

17  month and  they could be deemed to have acquiesced in that 

18  late payment,  that  must  be disclosed  as  part  of  the 

19  finance charge. 

20

 QUESTION:  Where -- where is that in -- in your 

21  brief? 

22

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  The portion of the commentary -­

23  to be  perfectly honest,  I don't  know if the  -- if  the 

24  commentary is reprinted  in the appendix.  The regulation 

25  language is -­

1

 QUESTION:  Gee,  if it's  that central, I  would 

2  have thought it ought to have been there.  It's new to me. 

3  Where -- where is it? 

4

5

6

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I don't know, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  You don't know what you just said? 

 MS.  GOLDSMITH: 

I  don't  know where  in  the 

7  appendix it is is what I don't know.  I know  that section 

8  226.4(c)(2) -- the commentary  specifically outlines  the 

9  fact  that there is a  distinction between acts of default 

10  and -- and acquiesced -- oh, thank you very much. 

11

 What counsel was  handing me is the  actual CFR. 

12  I mean, the  commentary is  at 12CFR Section  226.4(c)(2). 

13  What I don't believe is that is reprinted in full anywhere 

14  in the appendix or in the briefing.  I thought that's what 

15  your question was. 

16

 QUESTION:  Yes, sort of.  I  -- I'd like to know 

17  what it is that you're  -- you're saying makes your  case. 

18  I -- I don't have the text in front of me and you say it's 

19  nowhere to be found in  all of these voluminous  materials 

20  that we have for this case. 

21

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I was trying  to give an analogy 

22  as to late fees which is somewhat tangential to the issue. 

23  What  the point is is that a late fee -- you have to start 

24  with what the  concept of an extension of credit  is.  And 

25  -- and we do outline this in our brief, that we're talking 

37


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005

1  about each  and  every time  a consumer  seeks  to make  a 

2  purchase,  they're  essentially  saying  may  I  have  an 

3  extension of credit to cover this purchase. 

4

 QUESTION:  May I ask you a question about that? 

5  If -- if you  are correct in your analysis, why  isn't the 

6  answer to the problem that  you raise here is simply  that 

7  they are not  entitled to  charge you any  fee at all,  no 

8  matter what you call it?  Because if  I understand your -­

9  and  I may not,  but if  I understand your  argument, your 

10  argument is they agreed to my charging beyond the limit in 

11  the agreement as we  originally negotiated it.  They  said 

12  it's okay.  And  if  that is  the  case, why  isn't  your 

13  argument and your  remedy simply they can't charge  me any 

14  penalty at all for that?  They agreed to it.  And we never 

15  even get into the question that we've got in this case. 

16

 MS.  GOLDSMITH: 

I  think  the answer  to  the 

17  question  is is that  this is  really no different  than a 

18  request to -- to -- a request to make a purchase below the 

19  credit limit versus a request to make a purchase above it. 

20  Either way, they could  charge you a fee.  I mean, that's 

21  -- that's what -­

22

23

24

 QUESTION:  No. 

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  -- credit is. 

 QUESTION:  But if your point -- and I think I'm 

25  not  getting your point,  but if  your point is  that they 

38


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  approved this  in the sense that  they said, yes,  we will 

2  honor this  -- they're telling you  in -- in effect  -- we 

3  will honor  this charge  and that  that, in  effect, is  a 

4  renegotiation  of your credit limit with the bank, then it 

5  would follow  that they  can't charge  you any  penalty at 

6  all.  The only thing they can make you do is pay what  you 

7  have charged.  And  if that's the case,  we don't need  to 

8  get  into  this 

--  

this  complicated  question  about 

9  Regulation  Z.  All you have to  say is, I don't owe you a 

10  cent for exceeding the credit  limit.  Why isn't that  the 

11  answer to your question or to your problem? 

12

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I think two  things.  First  of 

13  all, we have never claimed that this is a renegotiation of 

14  the credit  limit.  We have always taken the position that 

15  there is  a distinction between renegotiating  your credit 

16  limit and getting  an extension of credit  that happens to 

17  take you over your  credit limit.  So that -- that's  the 

18  first issue. 

19

20

 The second issue is -­

 QUESTION:  So  you're saying, yes,  it violates 

21  the  contract,  but  it's  okay  to violate  the  contract 

22  because they -- they approved in advance this charge. 

23

 MS.  GOLDSMITH:  We  do not  feel  that it's  a 

24  violation of the contract if they allow you to do it. 

25

 QUESTION:  Then  if it's not a  violation of the 

39


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  contract  because they allowed  you to  do it, why  do you 

2  concede that they can charge you  any fee at all for doing 

3  that? 

4

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I'm not  conceding that they can 

5  charge you a penalty on top a finance charge, but what I'm 

6  saying is that anytime a creditor extends credit, they may 

7  charge a fee and -­

8

9

10

 QUESTION:  Okay. 

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  -- as a credit. 

 QUESTION: 

They  may,  but  in  the  original 

11  contract with  you  in the  -- the  -- at  the  -- at  the 

12  beginning of your relationship with  the bank, they didn't 

13  spell  out the particular situation that you're describing 

14  here.  They said, in -- if I understand it, if you go over 

15  the limit, we  charge you X dollars,  and -- and  that was 

16  the  extent of it.  You're  fighting about whether  the X 

17  dollars  should  be  classified  as  a finance  charge  or 

18  something else, but  your argument now is a different kind 

19  of argument. 

20

 Your  argument  now  is  they,  in  some  sense, 

21  approved my going over the limit.  If that does not change 

22  the original agreement, then what difference does it make? 

23  If it does  change the original agreement,  then why isn't 

24  your remedy simply to say you can't charge me a fee at all 

25  for going over the limit?

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I believe  what we have  always 

2  said is that this extension  of credit was like any  other 

3  extension of credit on the card.  Whether Ms. Pfennig goes 

4  in 2 weeks before her -- her credit limit was exceeded and 

5  says, may  I have enough credit to make this purchase, and 

6  they say, yes, and contractually we know -­

7

 QUESTION:  Yes, but  your -- your argument  is 

8  that the  extension of credit in this case is an agreement 

9  to exceed the credit limit.  Isn't that your argument? 

10

11

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I don't think so. 

 QUESTION: 

I  thought  your  argument,  Ms. 

12  Goldsmith,  was  that  the  contract  provides  that  any 

13  extension of credit over the credit limit shall be subject 

14  to the regular percentage plus the $15 penalty.  Right?  I 

15  mean, you acknowledge  that there is  an agreement at  the 

16  outset as  to what  the finance  charge will  be for  this 

17  added extension of credit.  It'll be the regular rate plus 

18  the penalty. 

19

20

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I don't -­

 QUESTION:  If that's not  your argument, then -­

21  then I think Justice Souter has to be correct. 

22

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I think  at this stage of -- of 

23  the litigation, since we have not conducted any discovery, 

24  we have  not seen the actual cardholder  agreement to know 

25  what it  says with regard to over-limit  fees.  So I don't 

41


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  think I can answer the question in that regard. 

2

 QUESTION:  Didn't  -- didn't  Ms. Pfennig get  a 

3  copy?  I mean, the -- isn't it on her monthly bill? 

4

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  On  her bill it  will tell  her 

5  what her contract rate is,  but the initial disclosures -­

6  I believe she had this card 7-8 years before this happened 

7  and it is not in the record. 

8

 QUESTION:  I thought -- I thought the terms have 

9  to be  disclosed monthly  in addition  to when the  credit 

10  card is new. 

11

 MS.  GOLDSMITH:  What has to  be -- and -- and I 

12  believe that -- that  Mr. Waxman explained this,  that you 

13  have your initial disclosures that come with the card when 

14  you  originally get  it.  What  has to  be disclosed  on a 

15  periodic  basis  is an  itemization  of each  extension of 

16  credit that you've received, a total that you've received, 

17  plus your -- your APR.  Those types of terms of what  the 

18  cost of credit  is on a monthly  basis are going to  be on 

19  your periodic statement. 

20

 I believe what -- what Justice Scalia's question 

21  was is  what does the credit  card agreement say as  to is 

22  she  going to be  charged a flat  fee, is she  going to be 

23  charged a  flat fee plus the  finance charge, and  that is 

24  not in the record.  We don't have that. 

25

 QUESTION:  And if that's  not in the record, how 

42


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  can you  make  the argument  you're making?  Because  the 

2  argument you're making depends on  whether, in effect, the 

3 

--  

the  agreement is  Justice  Scalia's suggestion  or my 

4  suggestion.  And if that's not in the record and you don't 

5  know, how do we get into this at all? 

6

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I think  the confusion is coming 

7  in because  ultimately what  is or  is not  labeled in  an 

8  over-limit  fee may not  be a  fee for exceeding  a credit 

9  limit as that term has been used in the regulations. 

10

 QUESTION:  And the only way we can tell that is 

11  to look at the contract, isn't it? 

12

13

14

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I don't believe so. 

 QUESTION:  No? 

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I believe  that if you  look at 

15  section  1637(b)(2)  that  describes how  each  and  every 

16  extension of credit  needs to  be itemized, we're  talking 

17  about a  singular event, an extension of credit.  She says 

18  may I  make this  purchase.  May I  have an extension  of 

19  credit to cover this purchase,  and they say yes.  And  in 

20  everyday experience, we  all know that means  you're going 

21  to  be  charged something  for  that extension  of credit. 

22  It's going to be charged a finance charge. 

23

 QUESTION: 

Are  you  talking  about  just  an 

24  ordinary credit card transaction where you go in and  say, 

25  look, I'm  buying a pair of gloves and  I want to put them 

43

1  on my  credit card?  This  you're describing as  a request 

2  for an extension of credit? 

3

4

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  Absolutely. 

 QUESTION:  Okay.  So  we're starting back  that 

5  simply.  Then how did we get so complicated? 

6

7

8

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I'm not quite sure. 

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION:  Well, one reason it's complicated, if 

9  I understand your  position, you're objecting both  to the 

10  fee  and  to  the later  statements  imposing  an interest 

11  charge on the fee, aren't you? 

12

 MS.  GOLDSMITH:  I  think it's  triple dipping, 

13  yes.  I think that, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, they 

14  -- they charge you for the extension of credit.  You get a 

15  finance charge  on your actual extension of  credit.  They 

16  impose  a penalty  fee,  and then  they  charge a  finance 

17  charge on the penalty fee -­

18

 QUESTION:  If  that's in the contract,  so what? 

19  A  deal is a deal.  If you agree, I  pay 10 percent up to 

20  this  amount, if I go  over that amount,  I pay 10 percent 

21  plus $15, if that's in the  contract, isn't that perfectly 

22  fair? 

23

24

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I think -­

 QUESTION:  And  you don't  know whether it's  in 

25  the contract.  So you can't say it's unfair.

 MS. GOLDSMITH: 

But this  is not  a breach  of 

2  contract case.  This is a Truth in Lending  Act case, and 

3  the only thing the Truth in Lending Act -­

4

 QUESTION:  Whether  it is or not,  you shouldn't 

5  call it unfair if you don't know. 

6

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I don't  recall using the  word 

7  unfair.  I'm sorry.

 QUESTION: 

Could  I  interrupt with  this  one 

11  question?  I want  to be  sure I  get it  out before  the 

12  argument is over.  Would you explain to me what difference 

13  it makes,  in terms of notice to the consumer, whether one 

14  calls it  a -- an  other charge or  a finance charge?  In 

15  either event, doesn't  the consumer  get exactly the  same 

16  notice? 

17

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I don't  believe so because when 

18  it is charged as  a flat fee as  an other charge,  besides 

19  the fact that there's interest  charged on top of it,  the 

20  consumer is in a position  that they then need to  compare 

21  cost of credit,  one, as a dollar figure, the  other as an 

22  APR.  And  while I  believe Ms.  McDowell  said that  the 

23  primary purpose of TILA is to create bright line rules for 

24  the credit  card industry,  I think  there is  significant 

25  support, as this Court has stated, that one of the primary

2  cost of credit.  And -- and Congress has said we -­

3

 QUESTION:  But why would the consumer understand 

4  the  cost of credit  any better  by labeling it  a finance 

5  charge rather than an other charge?  That I haven't -- you 

6  haven't explained to me. 

7

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  Because  Congress said we  want 

8  that to be an apples-to-apples comparison.  So Ms. Pfennig 

9  can know  that the  extensions of  credit she received  up 

10  till now  were charged at 18.49  percent.  She  knows that 

11  the extension of credit she received over her credit limit 

12  was $29 -­

13

 QUESTION:  So how does that work?  I -- I exceed 

14  my credit by $15.  My colleague exceeds his credit by $42. 

15  Each of us is charged a $15 late fee.  What's the interest 

16  rate?  And, of  course, there  are an infinite  number of 

17  possibilities.  So  I guess I'd get a  -- a statement that 

18  would be every  conceivable possibility of  how much I  go 

19  over with interest rates ranging  from like .2 percent  to 

20  48,000 percent.  So,  I mean, how -- how  is this supposed 

21  to work? 

22

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  The  simple answer  is I  don't 

23  know.  Ultimately  I think the Federal  Reserve Board does 

24  have to offer the direction of how this will be disclosed, 

25  but I think the important thing -- and I believe -­

 QUESTION:  I think  that's why  Justice Stevens 

2  might have thought it's  going to confuse the consumer  if 

3  you win, not help the consumer. 

4

 QUESTION: 

I  would  think  it's  much  more 

5  informative to the consumer to  know that my interest rate 

6  for all of  the things up  to the -- my credit limit  has 

7  been  this  past month  so much,  and  -- and  then  see a 

8  separate charge, God, I got socked 15 bucks for going over 

9  my credit limit.  You think you're helping the consumer by 

10  -- by  taking that $15 separate charge and just mushing it 

11  into the general overall  credit limit so that instead  of 

12  thinking he's  being charged  10 percent,  he thinks  he's 

13  being  charged  11 -- 11  percent,  and  he doesn't  know 

14  anything about the late -- about the -- the going over his 

15  over limit fee?  I don't think that helps him at all. 

16

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  But I  don't believe that that's 

17  necessarily how it would be done.  I believe that, Justice 

18  Breyer, you had  said earlier about  how certain -- there 

19  are  instances  where  certain  fees  are  disclosed 

20  differently. 

You  can have  a  situation  where  a cash 

21  advance is calculated at a different APR than the contract 

22  rate  of the finance charge.  An ATM fee might be charged 

23  at a  different -- a different  APR than  something else. 

24  And  those are  itemized  at  the  bottom.  You  wouldn't 

25  necessarily  not let  them  know that  this  was a  charge

1  incident to something over the credit limit, but you would 

2  put it in apples-to-apples comparison, which I believe -­

3

 QUESTION:  But,  of course,  the difficulty  for 

4  you is all you  have to say is that the  view I was taking 

5  somewhat by  argument is a reasonable  one, and if  it's a 

6  reasonable one, I  guess it's a  reasonable interpretation 

7  of  the  statute.  And  therefore,  Regulation  Z doesn't 

8  violate it. 

9

 Now -- now, you haven't been able to show us how 

10  we'd get on the opposite  interpretation.  We didn't  even 

11  know  what the statement  would look  like.  So  it's very 

12  hard for  me to say it's  not reasonable what  the -- what 

13  the -- that Regulation Z, isn't it? 

14

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  I think that ultimately depends 

15  on -- on the  construction of the  regulation.  We  -- we 

16  seem  to want to  parse out  for exceeding a  credit limit 

17  without  looking  at the  context  of the  regulation that 

18  these are acts of  default.  And what  we have alleged  in 

19  the complaint,  which ultimately is  controlling here,  is 

20  not  an  act  of  default. 

So  in  that  instance,  the 

21  regulation is not triggered  and it's premature for  us to 

22  decide whether or not it was rationally based. 

23

 QUESTION:  The  one thing that the  -- the board 

24  has said is we don't  want these individual to make  every 

25  extension of credit or what -- to do this kind of thing on 

48

1  a case-by-case basis.  That's why we're establishing these 

2  categories.  And your interpretation was making the credit 

3  card company has  to know and every  one is going to  be a 

4  knock-down, drag-out,  specific facts  of the  case.  And 

5  that's exactly, it seems to me, what the board didn't want 

6  to have happen. 

7

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  And I  think that gets  back to 

8  Justice -- Justice  Kennedy's question of quite  some time 

9  ago. 

Where  I was  trying  to  go is  that  there  is a 

10  distinction in  the nature of a late fee and an over-limit 

11  fee.  And the -- the Federal Reserve Board went out of its 

12  way to create  that factual distinction  as to late  fees. 

13  And late fees, by nature, are on the periphery of the cost 

14  of  an extension  of credit.  While the  total has  to be 

15  disclosed and your late payment is associated with whether 

16  or not you paid toward the total, an over-limit fee by its 

17  nature is tied to a specified extension of credit.  May  I 

18  have this extension  of credit, which  happens to take  me 

19  over the credit limit?  Yes, you may, but we are  going to 

20  charge you a fee for that. 

21

 And I think  that's the distinction, is  that to 

22  the extent  we have to  get to  -- let's  just assume  the 

23  regulation controls  here.  Does it  make sense?  Is  it 

24  rationally based  to create  a factual  distinction as  to 

25  late fees which  are on the  periphery of the  cost of  an 

49

1  extension of  credit and not do  so for an  over-limit fee 

2  that goes to  the very core of what the  finance charge is 

3  supposed to disclose? 

4

 QUESTION: 

Now  you're  going  back  to  the 

5  regulation itself is no good. 

6

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  To the extent that  it controls 

7  here, which  I'm not sure it does, I  think yes.  And that 

8  -- that  decision comes  down the  nature of  the fee  and 

9  whether or not it is so integrally  tied to the cost of an 

10  extension of credit that it has to be disclosed as part of 

11  the finance charge, and we think that it does. 

12

 QUESTION:  Ms. McDowell  said that  -- that  in 

13  dollars and cents,  there's no difference to  the customer 

14  using -- there is a  dollars and cents difference, I  take 

15  it, and would you explain what it is? 

16

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  Yes.  With all due  respect, I 

17  believe she said -- may I finish the question? 

18

 QUESTION:  I think you've answered it. 

 Mr. Waxman, you have 3 minutes remaining. 

 MS. GOLDSMITH:  Thank you. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. WAXMAN:  The question of whether  or not we 

24  disclosed  this  fee properly  within  the  regulation was 

25  passed on by the lower court.  It  is the law of the case. 

50


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005

1  The lower  court held, as the  second part of  its ruling, 

2  that, quote,  unequivocally the regulation required  us to 

3  disclose this fee as an other charge. 

4

 Now, Justice  Scalia  is correct  that  how  you 

5  interpret the Fed's bright line  regulation which says, at 

6  page 2  of our blue brief,  the following charges  are not 

7  finance charges.  Charges for exceeding a credit limit, of 

8  course, depends  on what  credit limit  means, and  credit 

9  limit  is  a  term  of art. 

Everybody  in  the industry 

10  understands it.  Even  the respondent  at page  1 of  her 

11  brief, she  says,  quote, in  the middle  of  the page,  a 

12  credit  limit  represents the  amount  of credit  the card 

13  issuer has preapproved the consumer to obtain.  There's no 

14  possible allegation in  this case that she  ever asked for 

15  an extension of her credit limit or received an  extension 

16  of her credit limit. 

17

 And there  is a reason  that the  board came  up 

18  with an  absolute bright line rule, and the reason is that 

19  before  1980, when  Congress  mandated classifications  in 

20  order to simplify things for  creditors and consumers, the 

21  Federal Reserve Board  confronted -- confronted  questions 

22  like many of  the hypotheticals  that Justice Stevens  and 

23  others  have asked  here.  Well,  what if -- what if they 

24  knew that it  was going to exceed it and  what if somebody 

25  actually called  and asked permission.  I don't want to be

1  embarrassed in the store.  Will you authorize this? 

2

 The board  literally -- and  some of -- many of 

3  these letter interpretations  are cited  in the briefs  in 

4  this case,  although not  all of  them.  The board  drove 

5  itself crazy trying  to answer all of  these hypotheticals 

6  and came up with a  set of letter rulings, exacerbated  by 

7  the Federal courts also trying  to come up with their  own 

8  interpretations, that  made it  impossible for  issuers to 

9  come up with formulaic disclosures that would prevent them 

10  from  being  socked  with  huge  class action  awards  and 

11  allowed  them to present  information that consumers could 

12  compare. 

13

 And so Congress said in 1980 we want bright line 

14  classifications, and  that's exactly  what the board  did. 

15  In  1980,  the  board  said  that  it  was  amending  its 

16  regulations to, quote,  substitute where possible precise, 

17  easily applied rules for principles  that create ambiguity 

18  and -­
