CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­1095,  Musacchio  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States. 

 

            

Mr.  Jaffe. 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ERIK  S.  JAFFE 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

This  case  presents  two  questions  concerning 

 

 

 

 

 

the  consequences  of  the  failure  to  object  or  raise  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  at  trial. 

 

 

            

On  the  question  of  whether  jury  instructions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  objected  to  by  the  government  become  the  baseline 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  measuring  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence  at  later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stages  in  the  case,  the  critical  point  here  is  that  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  can  determine  that  a  defendant  is  guilty.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  a  jury  does  so  under  a  particular  framework,  it 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  evaluated  under  that  framework.  And  if  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  sustain  that  verdict  on  the  reasons  it  used  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  own  deliberations,  that  verdict  is  not  rational. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  there  ­­ there's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  doubt  in  this  case,  is  there,  that  the  jury

found  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  defendant  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed  a  crime  set  forth  in  the  indictment? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Your  Honor,  I  think  that  is  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

entirely  correct.  There  is  no  doubt  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  evidence  that  they  could  have  done  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whether  they  did  that  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  They  ­­ they  had  to. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  JAFFE:  ­­ a  different  matter. 

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  They  had  to  find  that,  plus 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  else,  isn't  ­­ wasn't  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR.  JAFFE:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ that  the  issue? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  JAFFE:  It  was  the  issue. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  if  ­­ if  they  came  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  said  both  are  true,  the  first  has  to  ­­ has  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  true. 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  In  the  Fifth  Circuit,  we  pointed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  that  there  was  the  potential  for  confusion  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"and"  could  have  been  misread  by  them  as  "or,"  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  have  necessarily  had  unanimity  on  ­­ on  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements  of  the  "and"  added  up. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  didn't  read  that  as  being 

    

 

 

 

 

 

a  part  of  your  case  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  It  is  only  so  indirectly.  So  we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised  this  as  plain  error,  and  we  lost  that  because  we

couldn't  demonstrate  prejudice  because  there  was  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncertainty. 

            

Our  point  in  this  Court  is  that,  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  wants  to  ignore  or  have  a  court  disregard  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions,  it  would  then  be  its  burden  to  prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmlessness,  and  that  same  uncertainty  about  unanimity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  then  redound  to  our  benefit. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well  ­­ well,  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"or"  would  have  been  accurate,  wouldn't  it  have? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Well,  the  "or"  would  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accurate,  but  would  have  required  a  unanimity 

   

 

 

 

 

instruction  to  be  clear  which  of  the  "ors"  they  agreed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on.  If  six  thought  it  was  "exceeding"  and  six  thought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  "unauthorized,"  that  is  a  ­­ not  a  valid  verdict. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  On  the  basis  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument  in  this  case,  I  didn't  think  there  was  any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  the  government  tried  this  case  solely  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  theory  that  he  encourage  others  to  exceed  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority. 

            

            

MR.  JAFFE:  I  think  ­­

    

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  how  they  argued 

  

 

 

 

 

the  case.  That's  how  it  was  indicted.  So  why  isn't  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmless  error? 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Well,  because  the  evidence  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  sufficient  to  actually  support  that  conclusion.  The

government  certainly  argued  that. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's  not  sufficient  to 

  

 

 

 

 

support  the  conclusion  that  he  exceeded  authority. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  it  is  more  than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient,  if  not  the  only  theory  they  could  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  on,  was  that  they  ­­ that  he  had  encouraged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others  to  exceed  their  authority. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  No.  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  disagree,  Your 

    

   

   

  

 

 

Honor.  We  argue  that  what  he  encouraged  others  to  do, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  one  accepts  all  those  facts  as  true,  still  would  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitute  exceeding  authority. 

 

 

            

That  the  government's  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Could  I  ask  you  ­­ I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

sorry. 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  wanted  to  finish  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  I  was  saying  the  government's 

    

 

 

 

 

theory  about  what  is  and  is  not  exceeding  authority  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat  confused  in  this  case  as  it  was  confused  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presentation  at  the  trial  level;  and  therefore,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  have  been  clear  that  that  evidence  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  sufficient  to  show  conspiracy  to  exceed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It  doesn't  seem  clear  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  these  two  theories  are  actually  separate.  They  ­­

they  ­­ when  Congress  enacts  a  criminal  statute,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

often  adds  a  lot  of  synonyms.  So,  you  know,  in  the  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  theft  statute,  whoever  embezzles,  steals,  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unlawfully  and  willfully  extracts  or  converts, 

 

 

 

 

 

et  cetera,  they're  not  necessarily  all  distinct.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  really  see  a  difference  between  making 

   

 

 

 

 

unauthorized  access  and  exceeding  authorized  access. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let's  take  the  first,  making  unauthorized 

 

 

 

 

 

access.  Let's  say  somebody  has  access  to  some  ­­ an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  here  in  the  building  has  access  to  ­­ lawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access,  proper  access  to  some  records.  If  that  employee 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  night  sneaks  into  some  other  place  in  the  building 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  starts  looking  through  files,  that  person  is  making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unauthorized  access. 

 

            

And  in  the  other  situation,  exceeding 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  access,  let's  say  a  person  doesn't  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

any  ­­ any  access  to  any  files  in  the  court,  but  sneaks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  and  looks  at  those  files.  That  person  had  zero 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  access  and,  therefore,  exceeded  authorized 

 

 

 

 

 

access. 

              

I  just  think  these  are  ­­ it  seems  to  me, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  them,  they're  two  ways  of  saying  the  same  thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  the  issue  that's  presented  here  may  not  ­­ the  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you've  asked  us  to  decide  may  not  actually  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented  by  the  facts  of  this  case.

MR.  JAFFE:  Your  Honor,  that  question  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

actually  not  before  this  Court.  The  government  does  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute  that  exceeding  and  unauthorized  are  discrete  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  means  of  accomplishing  a  crime.  The  Ninth 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Circuit  has  held  that  they  are  discrete.  Even  the  Fifth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  agrees  that  they're  discrete.  It  just  disagrees 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  to  what  the  content  of  those  two  separate  elements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are. 

            

But  for  this  Court's  purposes,  you  need  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ever  go  there.  We've  invited  that  in  a  footnote  in  our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  You  declined  the  invitation,  which  is  entirely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  prerogative,  but  that  is  an  issue  that  will  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  briefed. 

 

              

I  agree  with  you,  it  is  not  the  clearest  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes,  but  suffice  it  to  say,  the  way  this  issue  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  brought  to  this  Court,  it  has  been  assumed  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fifth  Circuit,  assumed  by  the  government,  and  I  believe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumed  by  the  Ninth  Circuit  that  they  are  discrete  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  elements  that  would  be  separately  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctly  proven. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  I  could  go  back  to  your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

main  argument.  You  seem  to  be  suggesting  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry  that  we  should  be  undertaking  really  focuses  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  jury  and  how  this  jury  made  its  decision.  But  I

Jackson,  suggests  that  that's  not  the  correct  inquiry. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  the  correct  inquiry  really  is  ­­ is  as  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  jury,  any  jury.  And  so  your  focus  on, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  the  way  that  these  instructions  might  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected  this  particular  jury  just  really  isn't  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  one  at  all. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  I  partially  agree  with  you,  Your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  It  is  not  that  we  are  asking  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals  on  the  jury  thought  or  what  their  literal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  process  was  in  the  jury  room;  but  it  is,  indeed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  any  jury  in  the  position  of  this  jury,  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  this  jury  received,  with  the  instructions  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  received,  could  possibly  have  come  to  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion? 

            

And  our  point  is  no  rational  jury  facing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  and  instructions  this  jury  faced  could  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  on  the  exceeding  portion  of  the  charge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  they  convicted  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

first  portion  and  that  was  enough. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  They  convicted  on  a  combined  ­­

without  authorization,  period.  And  they  were  told  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  to  find  that  unanimously.  So  what  ­­ what  else  is

MR.  JAFFE:  It  is  not  clear  they  understood 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  because  the  unanimity  instruction  did  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguish  between  unauthorized  access  and  exceeding 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  access. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  ­­ that  ­­ that's  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  case  comes  down  to:  Failure  to  instruct  the  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  had  to  be  unanimous  as  to  both? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  No,  that  is  what  our  objection 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  government's  harmlessness  argument  comes  down  to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  the  government  cannot  resolve  the  uncertainty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  jury  room. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  isn't  a  harmlessness 

   

  

 

 

argument.  It  ­­ it's  an  argument  that  the  jury  was  told 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  convict  if  A  plus  B.  They  came  back  and  said, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  A  plus  B,  he's  guilty. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  now  you  come  and  say,  well,  you  know,  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  wasn't  guilty  on  B.  There  wasn't  enough 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence. 

            

            

            

That's  okay.  He's  still  guilty  on  A. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  JAFFE:  Let  me  give  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  ­­ I  just  don't  see  how 

    

   

 

 

 

 

you  get  around  that. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  I'll  give  an  example  that  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

help  clarify  it:  In  murder  charges,  it  is  typically 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged  that  one  knowingly  and  intentionally  killed  a

person.  If  the  government  fails  to  prove  intentionally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  had  sufficient  evidence  for  knowingly,  you  cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support  a  murder  conviction  because  they  proved 

   

 

 

 

 

manslaughter  unless  it  was  specifically  charged  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  instruction  to  the  jury.  You  can't  just  save 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  because  yes,  of  course,  they  found  manslaughter  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implication. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  that's  not  this  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

What  you  ­­ you  ­­ what  you  have  hypothesized  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

erroneous  instruction  that  ­­ or  ­­ or  a  ­­ a  ­­ a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure  to  find  what  was  necessary.  There's  no  failure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  find  what  was  necessary  here,  so  your  hypo  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work. 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Well,  the  "what  was  necessary" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  begs  the  question  a  bit  on  necessary  to  whom. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To  the  jury,  it  was  necessary  to  find  both.  And  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only,  at  best,  could  have  found  one.  We  do  not  concede 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  did  find  one  accurately,  because  there  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  can  see  that  your 

    

 

 

 

 

argument  might  work  in  some  cases  if  the  jury  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confused,  if  ­­ if  this  meant  that  it  took  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attention  away  from  a  critical  element.  But  I  ­­ I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

don't  see  that  that's  a  possibility  here,  even  assuming 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Justice  Alito's  comments,  which  I  think  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

considerable  merit,  are  inapplicable,  but  you  ­­ that

they're  quite  different. 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Well,  as  I  said,  I  believe 

   

   

  

 

 

Justice  Alito's  comments  are  a  fair  issue  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigated,  and  it  could  be  litigated  on  remand  if  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  goes  back.  It's  not  presented  here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  to  whether  the  jury  was  confused,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  argue  the  jury  was  confused.  We  couldn't  meet 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  burden  of  prejudice,  but  our  point  is  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  meet  its  burden  of  showing  that  didn't  happen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either.  That's  the  Olano  situation,  where  right  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

middle  where  there  is  confusion,  neither  side  can  win  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That  sounds  like  what 

  

 

 

 

 

you're  saying  ­­ I  don't  understand  the  point.  What 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia  said  seems  right.  It's  charged.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  find  A  and  B.  Therefore,  they  must  have  found 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A.  The  indictment,  superseding  indictment  charged  A. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The  statute  says  A.  Okay?  So  we  know  they  found  A. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Now,  what's  the  problem? 

 

 

 

MR.  JAFFE:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  problem  seems  to  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been  that  they  were  also  charged  that  they  had  to  find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B.  Fine.  They  made  a  mistake. 

   

  

  

 

            

            

Did  you  object?  No. 

  

 

 

Was  it  harmless?  It  doesn't  seem  to  me  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ how  could  it  have  been  harmful.

I  mean,  I  ­­ I  think  your  problem  is  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

problem  with  the  extra  B  in  the  jury  instruction.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  I  would  look  to  see  what's  your  objection  to  B?  Did 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  object?  No.  Then  it  must  have  been  plain  error. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well,  it  was  ­­ it  was  erroneous,  but  was  it  harmful? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that  I  could  understand,  but  you're 

   

 

 

 

 

arguing  something  else,  and  it  is  the  something  else 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  don't  understand. 

   

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Sure.  We  ­­ we  are  not  arguing 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  was  erroneous  or  harmful  to  include  that.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  arguing  that  it  is  binding.  We  are  defending  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  instruction;  not  rejecting  it.  It  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  seeking  to  reject  the  jury  instruction;  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  we  think  it  is  incumbent  upon  the  government, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  want  to  analyze  the  verdict  on  grounds  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  the  instruction,  to  prove  that  doing  so  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  there  anybody  ­­ well  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  I  don't  see  the  theory  of  it.  The  jury  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed.  You  ­­ he  is  guilty  of  murder  if  he  killed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone,  da­da­da,  and  he  had  ­­ and  he  was  looking  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ceiling.  Okay?  Doesn't  make  any  sense. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

Okay.  That  was  wrong. 

  

 

 

So  now  you're  saying  if  the  judge  makes  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistake  there,  nobody  objects,  he  says  the  wrong  thing,

"why." 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Sure.  So  the  "why,"  I  think, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

comes  from  Jackson  v.  Virginia.  So  let's  say  they  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ and  he  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  was  not  a  case  involving 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a  jury  instruction. 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  It  was  a  case  involving 

   

  

 

 

 

sufficiency  of  the  evidence  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  To  show  that  the  charge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

met  ­­ the  charge  ­­ the  evidence  proved  the  crime  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  the  statute  or  the  indictment. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  But  the  reasons  behind  Jackson 

  

 

 

 

 

 

explain  that  we  are  looking  to  whether  or  not  the  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  rationally  reached  that  conclusion.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  we  do  so  is  to  enforce  the  presumption  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocence  and  to  enforce  the  reasonable  doubt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction. 

            

So  if  a  jury  instructed  erroneously  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

person  needed  to  be  wearing  a  green  hat,  had  zero 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  that  person  was  wearing  a  green  hat,  yet 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  that  they  were  wearing  a  green  hat  anyway,  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  problem  in  that  verdict,  and  we  know  there's  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  in  that  verdict.  No  rational  jury  could  find

it  is  a

so­called  law­of­the­case  doctrine. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Suppose  that  there's  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

that  there's  a  two­count  indictment  and  there's  plenty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  evidence  to  convict  on  Count  I  and  zero  evidence,  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  scintilla  of  evidence,  on  Count  II,  and  the  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicts  on  both  counts;  so  the  ­­ defendant  is  entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  judgment  of  acquittal  on  Count  II. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  you  seem  to  be  saying  in  that  situation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  would  say,  this  is  a  crazy  jury.  This  is  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrational  jury  because  their  verdict  on  Count  II  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

totally  ridiculous;  and  therefore,  the  defendant  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled  to  judgment  of  acquittal  on  Count  I  as  well, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

despite  the  fact  that  there's  plenty  of  evidence  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Count  I. 

 

            

Is  that  what  you're  saying? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Not  entirely.  It  is  certainly  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  conclusion  from  the  implications  of  Jackson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v.  Virginia.  However  ­­

what's  the  difference  between  that  and  the  argument  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  made?

abstract  term,  but  given  that,  I  believe  the  same  thing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  true  where  the  jury  made  a  terrible  decision  on

that  you  wouldn't  cross,  in  fact,  from  one  count  to  the

I  could  see  the  argument  perfectly  well,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  were  inclined  to  go  there,  that  yes,  a  jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  went  that  off  the  rails  on  one  count  is

properly  applied  the  presumption  of  innocence  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  doubt  standards. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  That  ­­ that  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

revolutionary  holding. 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  It  would.  But  I'm  not  asking 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  to  make  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But,  now,  I  don't  see  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

difference,  other  than  a  purely  formal  difference, 

   

 

 

 

 

between  that  situation  and  what  you're  ­­ what  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing. 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  At  some  level,  there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  formality  to  it,  but  that  is  Smith.  And  Smith 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  that  formal  distinction,  I  believe,  to  cabin  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

implications  of  Jackson.  And  if,  at  the  end  of  the  day, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jackson  makes  a  good  point,  but  one  doesn't  want  to

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Of  course,  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  JAFFE:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ this  case  is  even  ­­ is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  worse  than  the  hypothetical  that  Justice  Alito 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

posits  in  that  ­­ in  his  hypothetical,  Count  II  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  count.  In  this  case,  the  equivalent  of  Count  II  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  hypothetical  was  not  real  at  all.  It  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misinstruction  which  you  did  not  object  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  JAFFE:  It  was  not  our  burden  to  object. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  the  reason  it's  not  worse  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  didn't  object  because 

  

 

 

 

 

it  was  favorable  to  your  client.  I  mean,  it's  always 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better  to  ­­ if  you  have  two  than  just  one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  We  didn't  object  because  we  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

confused.  The  trial  counsel  was  actually  confused  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  this  was  a  case  about  both,  as  the  government 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  sort  of  acknowledges  towards  the  end  of  trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  they  ­­ where  trial  counsel  makes  a  motion, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming  both  were  in  play,  and  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understands  that  trial  counsel  was  confused. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Didn't  the  ­­ didn't  the

MR.  JAFFE:  They  corrected  the  formal 

  

 

 

 

 

portion  of  the  charge,  but  all  of  the  allegations,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means,  the  mechanisms  of  the  conspiracy,  the  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  charged  as  being  supporting  acts,  all  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included,  continued  to  include  "exceeding,"  just  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior  indictment  had. 

 

 

            

And  so,  understandably  or  not,  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  confusion  both  on  the  part  of  counsel,  I  believe  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  part  of  the  court,  potentially  on  the  part  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  that  continued  to  argue  "exceeding"  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  its  closing. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Counsel,  I'd  like  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hear  your  argument  on  the  statute  of  limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  at  this  point. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

On  the  statute  of  limitations,  both  parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree  that  it  is  inevitable  that  a  court  will  review  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeited  limitations  bar.  Whether  it  comes  at  habeas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  sooner  is  really  the  only  question  before  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  government  concedes  that  it  can  be  raised  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  ineffective  assistance­of­counsel  claim  if  it  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meritorious  limitations  bar. 

 

 

            

Our  point  is,  doing  it  sooner,  doing  it  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  appeal,  doing  it  while  you  still  have  counsel,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  ­­ in  ­­ in  point­of­counsel  cases,  is  the  better

and  more  efficient  way  of  doing  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  a  ­­ that's  a  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

that's  a  rule  that  will  have  application  in  a  lot  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  situations.  You're  saying  whenever  an  error  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  raised  on  habeas,  we  ­­ we  should  accord  ­­ no  matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  been  waived,  no  matter  what  else  exists,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  allow  that  point  to  be  raised  in  initial  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  No,  Your  Honor,  that  is  not  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  are  saying. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  why  ­­ why  wouldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it?  I  mean  ­­

    

 

            

            

            

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Several  reasons. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Why  doesn't  it  follow? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  JAFFE:  Because  that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  your  argument: 

  

 

 

 

Since  it  can  be  raised  in  habeas,  why  not  do  it  now? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Because  statutes  of  limitations 

  

 

 

 

 

can  be  distinguished  from  those  other  types  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments.  The  habeas  argument  is  merely  a  reason  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  wait. 

 

            

But  it  can  be  cabined  ­­ our  point  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cabined  to  limitations  issues  for  several  reasons.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  look  at  the  habeas  cases  we  cite  at  the  tail  end  of

limitations  argument  is  indeed  ineffective  assistance. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  you  are,  Mr.  Jaffe,  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  saying,  in  every  statute  of  limitations  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whenever  a  statute  of  limitations  is  involved  in  every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  the  defendant  can  raise  it  for  the  first  time  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal,  every  statute  of  limitations. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Yes,  though  the  theory  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  that  would  happen  might  be  different.  So  in  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances,  it  would  be  as  a  plain­error  question;  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  instances,  it  might  be  on  a  stronger  theory. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  yes,  that  is  basically  our  point,  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  exception. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Maybe  you  should

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'd  like  to  get  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

substance  of  your  argument,  but  as  I  understand  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  this  wasn't  a  waiver  which  the  court  found 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

below.  You're  arguing  it's  a  forfeiture. 

   

  

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Forfeiture  because  it 

  

 

 

 

was  unintentionally  done. 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  so  you  are  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under  plain  error. 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Plain  error  is  the  ­­ the  ­­ the

not  reach  those  broader  theories  ­­

MR.  JAFFE:  ­­ to  vote  in  our  favor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  let's  assume  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under  plain  error.  Now  let's  go  to  what  ­­ what  made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  plain.  Okay? 

  

 

            

We  have  a  bunch  of  cases  that  say  that  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  statute  of  limitations  as  opposed  to  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  bar.  Why  would  it  be  plain  that  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional? 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  You  need  ­­ if  you're  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plain  error,  one  need  not  conclude  it  as  jurisdictional. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One  simply  needs  to  conclude  that  the  government  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failed  to  bring  the  suit  within  the  time  required  by  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

On  its  face,  the  date  of  the  indictment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compared  to  the  date  of  the  alleged  crime  is  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simple,  very  plain.  It's  more  than  five  years.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  may  well  have  a  defense  ­­ relation  back, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  their  defense  is  ­­ and  they  can  raise  that.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ I  ­­ I  ­­ I'm  having 

   

   

  

 

 

 

            

            

            

a  very  hard  time  accepting  that  argument.  If  we  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  ­­ it  wasn't  plain,  that  this  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim­processing  rule  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  I  believe  there  are  two  separate 

    

 

 

 

 

 

lines  of  cases  that  are  getting  conflated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Plain  error  could  involve  any  error.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

need  not  be  jurisdictional.  It  can  simply  be  contrary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  statute,  which  is  a  non  jurisdictional,  merely  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  statute  like  the  statute  of  limitations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  jurisdictional  argument  is  a  different 

   

 

 

 

and  separate  reason  that  need  not  infect  ­­ or  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  in  order  to  resolve  plain  error.  The  error  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  simply  the  statute  says  you  must  bring  it  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five  years.  They  brought  it  in  seven.  That's  error. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  failed  to  raise  it,  but  that's  the  very  purpose  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plain­error  rule,  is  to  make  up  for  mistakes  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  who  failed  to  raise  things  they  should 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise  have  raised,  and  so  one  gets  to  raise  it  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plain  error.  That's  ­­

MR.  JAFFE:  I  guess  what  I'd  say  is  that  no 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

sane  lawyer  would  do  that  because  they  subject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves  to  claims  of  malpractice,  they  subject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves  to  the  higher  standards  of  plain­error 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review.  At  the  end  of  the  day  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What's  malpractice? 

  

 

 

 

It  sounds  like  a  ­­ a  good  practice  to  me  for  his 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client. 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Well,  in  subject  on  appeal  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  higher  standards  of  plain­error  review  is  still  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negative.  If  they  end  up  losing  and  there  was  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance  they  could  have  won  had  they  brought  it  timely, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  lawyer  has  now  sent  a  man  to  jail  based  on  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merely  a  mistake,  but  an  intentional  decision. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That's  not  true  of  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  categorization  if  it's  jurisdictional  and 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  plain  error  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  JAFFE:  That's  true. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  your  jurisdictional 

  

 

 

 

argument  surprised  me  because  you  cite  a  line  of  cases

that  were  meant  to  cabin  the  use  of  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  distinction  between 

  

 

 

 

claim  processing  and  jurisdictional  was  to  cut  back  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exorbitant  use  of  jurisdiction,  and  you  just  seemed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

switch  it. 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  I  start  with  the  case  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Bowles  v.  Russell,  and  merely  point  out  that,  on  pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  every  single  ground  in  that  case  and  those  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow,  this  statute  is  stronger  and  more  clearly  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitation  of  the  court's  power. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  thought  Bowles  went  on 

    

 

 

 

 

that  the  Court  had  held  that  before,  and  so  it  was  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  adhere  to  its  prior  ruling. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  That  was  some  of  what  Bowles 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

went  on,  but  it  gave  many  other  reasons,  as  did  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow­on  cases.  And  if  one  looks  at  the  wording  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  one  may  not  try  or  punish  is  a  continuing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibition.  It  is  not  merely  you  can't  prosecute, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  might  just  be  thought  to  apply  to  the  prosecutor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  is  a  ­­ a  restriction  on  the  court. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  again,  you  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

making  all  statutes  of  limitations,  quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

"jurisdictional." 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  No,  we  would  not,  Your  Honor.

We  would  look  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Which  might  that  be? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  JAFFE:  ­­ at  the  wording. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  JAFFE:  Because  ­­ because  I  believe  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

            

wording  of  this  statute  is,  in  fact,  unusually  strong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  with  the  "except  as  otherwise  expressly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided  by  law,"  meaning  you  cannot  avoid  it  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implication.  It  is  such  a  strongly  worded  statute. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Others  might  not  be  that  way  at  all,  and  one  would  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  to  extend  this  to  differently  worded  limitations, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  ­­ I  would  have  ­­ the  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  most  recent  case  that  we  had,  which  was  Wong,  makes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  the  statute  of  ­­ of  limitations  generally  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional,  and  I  would  think  suggests  that  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

really  have  to  have  language  saying  it  is  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  overcome  that  presumption.  In  other  words,  just  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong­sounding  statute  of  limitations  wouldn't  cut  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

according  to  Wong.  That's  the  way  I  would  read  that. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  I  would  read  those  cases  as 

    

 

 

 

 

 

dealing  with  civil  situations  as  opposed  to  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations,  where  the  limitations  period  is  generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  of  as  a  period  of  repose,  not  as  a  substantive 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit  on  the  government's  power.  And  that's  the  Toussie

case,  as  well  as  Benes,  which  followed  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  also  point  out  that  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarity  of  Congress's  language  goes  to,  are  you  limiting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court,  as  opposed  to  merely  requiring  bringing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  within  a  certain  period  of  time,  but  without 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifying  the  consequence  of  failure. 

 

 

 

 

            

Here,  the  language  is  so  expressly  directed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  court's  power,  and  it  does  indeed  specify  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences  of  failure:  You  may  not  try  or  punish  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  are  you  saying  that  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  adopt  a  different  interpretive  rule  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  context?  Is  that  what  I  understood  you  to  say? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  I'm  saying  that  you  already 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have.  That  this  Court  views  criminal  statutes  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations  more  strictly.  It  views  them  as  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  civil  statutes  of  limitations  that  is  viewed  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit  on  the  government's  power  rather  than  merely  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit  on  a  litigant's  remedies.  And  that  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

already  ­­ that's  Toussie.  And  I  believe  Benes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

discusses  that  at  further  depth. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  you  need  not  reach  jurisdiction.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

believe  the  easiest  way  to  reach  the  ­­ to  deal  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  is  on  the  Wood  and  Day  line  of  cases,  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  already  held  that  a  limitations  period  cannot

be  forfeited,  only  waived,  and  that's  in  the  habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context,  admittedly.  The  ­­ the  sides  are  flipped.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  government  in  the  habeas  context  inadvertently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fails  to  raise  a  limitations  period,  it  is  still  allowed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  bring  that  up  on  appeal.  The  court,  on  appeal,  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  to  raise  that  sua  sponte. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  this  case  is  stronger,  once  again, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  every  score  than  Day.  And,  consequently,  if  Day  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good  law,  this  case  is  almost  a  fortiori  the  same 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result. 

            

And  one  need  not  give  it  any  further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  than  that,  that  if  the  government  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmatively  waive  a  limitations  objection  to  a  habeas 

   

   

 

 

 

petition,  then  Petitioner,  who  has  so  much  more  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stake,  should  have  to  affirmatively  waive  a  limitations 

   

 

 

 

 

 

objection  to  indictment. 

 

 

            

If  I  may,  I'd  like  to  reserve  the  remainder

the  evidence  must  be  measured  against  an  extra  element 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  an  obviously  erroneous  jury  instruction.  That  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  consistent  with  the  purpose  of  sufficiency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review,  it  contradicts  how  this  Court  has  treated  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  issue  in  civil  cases,  and  its  whole  purpose  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  is  to  give  guilty  defendants  windfall  acquittals. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  it  was  obviously 

  

 

 

 

 

wrong,  why  did  the  government  the  first  time,  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original  indictment,  charge  "and"? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  ­­ it  ­­ it  was  obviously 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong  to  include  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  exceeding  authorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access  component  to  the  case  at  the  jury  instruction

clear  that  the  case  was  about  a  conspiracy  to  commit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unauthorized  access. 

 

            

And  I  think  my  ­­ my  friend  on  the  other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  pointed  out  that  ­­ that  ­­ that  Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  was  confused  as  to  what  the  case  was  about  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  stage,  but  if  you  look  at  what  Petitioner  said  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  was  about  when  he  was  briefing  this  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fifth  Circuit,  he  made  very,  very  clear  that,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  view,  the  government  had  abandoned  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  to  commit  exceeding  authorized  access,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  abandoned  that  with  its  superseding  indictments,  and

proposed  were  limited  to  a  conspiracy  to  commit

during  his  oral  argument  in  the  Fifth  Circuit,  over  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  again  ­­ at  the  beginning  of  his  argument,  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

middle  of  his  argument,  at  the  end  of  his  argument  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphasized  that  the  government  had  tried  this  case  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"unauthorized  access  case  from  start  to  finish." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why  didn't  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

ask  the  judge  to  correct  his  charge  when  the  judge  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  mistake  of  saying  "and"? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  ­­ Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I  don't 

    

   

   

 

 

 

know  why  we  didn't  do  that.  I  think  obviously  the  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ it  would  be  better  for  ­­ for  all  of  us  if  ­­ if

I  will  say  that  the  change  was  made  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last  minute.  The  ­­ the  parties  had  had  a  charging

was  not  at  issue.  Petitioner  had  never  asked  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"exceeding  authorized  access"  language  to  be  included  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  instruction.

instructions  that  didn't  include  that  language.  It  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  mistake  on  our  part,  and  we  suffered  the  consequences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  mistake  in  the  sense  that,  at  that  point,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  was  charged  incorrectly.  But  if  the  jury  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquitted  Mr.  Musacchio  based  on  its  view  that  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insufficient  evidence  with  respect  to  the  extra  element, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  this  Court's  decision  in  Evans,  we  wouldn't  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  able  to  ­­ to  appeal  that.  That  ­­ that  would  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  the  end  of  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  why  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

instruction  erroneous?  You  concede  that  these  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

methods  of  violating  the  statute  are  discrete?  They're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  different  ways  of  describing  the  same  thing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  We  do  think  that  they  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrete,  and  we  think  that's  consistent  with  our  ­­ our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  general  reading  of  the  statute  and  with  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  courts  have  ­­ have  addressed  it.  I  think  they're 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  closely  related. 

 

 

              

I  think  what  ­­ we  agree  with  what  ­­ what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  said  in  his  petition  at  page  4,  which  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  these  are  essentially  two  different  ways  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committing  the  same  crime. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  suppose  you  had  an

access  and  there  was  a  factual  dispute  about,  let's  say,

the  date  on  which  the  employee's  employment  ended,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  the  date  on  which  any  authorized  access  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employee  had  to  records  of  the  employer  ended,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say  that,  if  you  did  not  succeed  in  proving  beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  reasonable  doubt  that,  as  of  the  date  when  the  access 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  obtained,  the  employee  had  ceased  to  be  employed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  employee  would  be  entitled  to  a  judgment  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquittal?  That  seems  rather  odd. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Justice  Alito,  I  don't  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

don't  want  to  resist  a  broader  reading  of  the  statute, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  I  ­­ I  would  only  say  that  ­­ that  the  statute 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defines  the  term  "exceeding  authorized  access"  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  ­­ this  is  at  page  11a  of  our  statutory  appendix. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  said,  "The  term"  ­­ it  says,  "The  term  'exceeds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  access'  means  to  access  a  computer  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  and  then  to  use  such  access  to  obtain  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alter  information  in  the  computer  that  the  accessor  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  entitled  so  to  obtain." 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  there  were  a  circumstance  in  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  no  authorization  in  the  first  place  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access  the  computer,  I  think  we  would  be  in  trouble. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  we  would,  of  course,  have  the  other  ­­ the  other  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  proving  that  the  statute  had  been  violated, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  was  the  unauthorized  access  charge. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  why  in  this  case,  I  think,  there

harmless  error  but  ­­ something  at  page  20  of  your

thing  we  look  at  in  a  sufficiency  question  is,  well, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  are  the  instructions?  So  you  want  to  say,  oh, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  don't  look  at  instructions? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think, 

   

   

  

 

 

Your  Honor,  in  ­­ in  the  ­­ the  vast  majority  of  cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  instructions  are  going  to  correctly  reflect  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  statute  that's  being  charged. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  ­­ but  you  ­­ but  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  we  shouldn't  look  to  jury  instructions  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assessing  the  deficiency  of  the  evidence.  I  ­­ I  ­­ I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  an  astounding  proposition. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  ­­ I  don't  think  it's 

    

   

 

 

 

astounding  at  all,  Your  Honor,  and  I  think  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressly  what  the  Court  said  in  the  Jackson  case.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  look  at  the  footnote  16  of  Jackson,  the  Court  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  when  conducting  the  sufficiency  analysis,  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ the  analysis  should  be  conducted  with, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"explicit  reference  to  the  substantive  elements  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  offense  as  defined  by  state  law." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  suggests  that  you 

  

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  even  look  to  the  indictment.  That  you  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  look  to  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  you  would  have  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

look  to  the  statute,  but  the  indictment  would  tell  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  statute  is  being  ­­ is  being  charged.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  it's  ­­ it's, 

  

 

 

 

 

frankly,  a  style  point  rather  than  a  substantive  point. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

But  it  ­­ it  ­­ it  does  seem  to  me  that  we  should  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  that  in  the  opinion. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Well,  I  think  that  you 

   

  

 

 

 

shouldn't  put  that  into  the  opinion.  I  ­­ I  would  agree 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  that  ­­ with  you  on  that  because  I  think  that  ­­ I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that,  on  our  first  argument,  what  you  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarify  and  you  should  ­­ you  can  apply  the  same  rule, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially,  that  the  Court  has  applied  in  the  civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  when  you've  recognized  that  ­­ that  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  and  sufficiency  review  are  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ on  two  different  tracks. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  when  the  ­­ the  issue  in  the  case  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructional  error,  then  I  think  it's  fair  to  look  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  parties  said  about  the  instructional  error. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  if  the  issue  is  sufficiency  and  there  is  ­­ there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  dispute  ­­ if  the  issue  is  sufficiency,  then  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  place  to  look  would  be  the  ­­ the  elements  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime  as  defined  by  the  statute.  I  think  that's  what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jackson  says,  and  I  think  that's  what  the  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  held  in  ­­ in  the  civil  context  in  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  ­­

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I'm  sorry.  Just  going  back 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to  this  question  of  whether  it's  the  statute  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indictment,  you  think  you  just  look  to  the  indictment  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  you  which  statutes  to  look  to,  but  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indictment  would,  let's  say,  add  an  extra  element,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  matter?  You  should  ­­ you  should  look  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  in  the  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ in  the  same  way  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  suggesting  here  we  shouldn't  look  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions? 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  ­­ I  think  what  the  ­­ the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  of  the  indictment  is  to  give  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice  of  the  ­­ the  crime  with  which  he  is  charged. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  a  lot  of  times,  as  the  Court  well  knows,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indictment  is  going  to  be  a  lengthy  document  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

contains  a  lot  of  allegations,  a  lot  of  different  facts. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

And  what  this  Court  has  made  clear  is  that,  just  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  indictment  says  something  happened  at  a  certain  time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  ­­ or  in  the  narrative  of  a  description  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense  it  includes  some  information,  that  doesn't  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  government  is  required  to  prove  everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  identified  there. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  ­­ but  I  guess  I  ­­ it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ that  does  seem  a  little  bit  troubling  to  me  just

because  of  the  function  of  an  indictment  is  providing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice,  that  if  the  indictment  gets  the  statute  wrong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  the  government  should  be  stuck  with  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that's  what  ­­ you  know,  that's  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  now  thinks  is  the  charge. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  ­­ I  think  that,  in  a  case 

    

   

   

 

 

 

like  ­­ and  I  ­­ it  may  be  that  ­­ that  in  a  different 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  where  ­­ I  would  have  to  see  the  indictment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  ­­ you're  hypothesizing,  Justice  Kagan.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  case  like  this,  where  the  indictment  says  this  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statutory  offense  and  ­­ and  ­­ and  it  ­­ and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identifies  the  statutory  code  provision  and  it  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"unauthorized  access,"  so  it  makes  clear  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  being  alleged  here  is  the  unauthorized  access 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

branch  of  a  1030(a)(2)  violation. 

   

 

 

              

I  think  that  ­­ that  shows  you  what  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  that  points  to  the  law  that  needs  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  thought  that  the 

    

 

 

 

government  agreed  that,  if  the  charge  in  the  indictment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  "and,"  A  "and"  B,  the  government  would  have  to  prove 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A  and  B  ­­ if  that  was  what  the  indictment  charged. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  if  the  ­­ if  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

indictment  had  said  that  the  conspiracy  here  was  to

if  the  ­­ that  charge  says  "A  and  B,"  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  nonetheless  prove  the  conspiracy  theory  under  A  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

B,  and  then  the  jury  instructions  could  ­­ could  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specify. 

            

And  so  I  think  ­­ I  ­­ I  think  that's  ­­

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

that's  fairly  well­established  that  the  government  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge  in  the  conjunctive  in  that  sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  what's  important  for  this  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  the  ­­ the  indictment  in  this  case  was  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific.  It  changed  from  the  original  indictment, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  had  the  ­­ alleged  the  broader  conspiracy  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  commit  unauthorized  access  and  to  exceed  authorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access,  and  it  went  to  a  narrower  conspiracy  that  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged  unauthorized  access. 

 

 

            

And  that's  why  Petitioner's  counsel  said 

 

 

 

 

 

repeatedly  in  his  briefs  and  at  oral  argument  on  appeal, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  was  an  unauthorized  access  case  from  start  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finish. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Counsel,  you  can  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  imagine  cases,  can't  you,  where  the  instruction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  an  additional  element  could  cause  prejudice  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant? 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  ­­ I  think  you  ­­ one  could

example,  if  the  additional  element  would  cause  the

particularly  damning  evidence  that  they  might  otherwise

trial. 

            

But  that's  not  what  Petitioner  is  asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for.  What  he  is  asking  for  is  an  acquittal,  despite  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  the  jury  found  with  respect  to  all  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  elements  of  the  crime.  There  was  sufficient 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  as  to  those  actual  elements. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  the  other  point  to  add  is  ­­ is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  not  a  case  ­­ this  particular  case  does  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve  the  kind  of  confusion  that  you're  hypothesizing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Petitioner  argued  this  ­­ a  confusion  theory 

   

 

 

 

 

in  the  court  of  appeals,  and  the  court  of  appeals  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  at  page  A­10  of  the  Petition  Appendix  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  of  appeals  expressly  rejected  the  theory.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  of  appeals  said  that  ­­ that  if,  you  know,  the  ­­

the  only  error  here  was  the  erroneous  jury  instruction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  if  that  jury  instruction  had  any  effect  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  it  worked  only  to  the  benefit  of  the  defendant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  Petitioner  here  really  got  a  trial 

   

 

 

 

 

that  was  ­­ that  was  biased  in  his  favor,  which  is  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unusual  for  ­­ for  ­­ for  a  defendant.  And  what  he's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  do  is  ­­ is  piggyback  off  of  a  trial  that  was

MR.  MARTINEZ:  In  ­­ in  the  jury

not  A  plus  B,  and  we  know  they  had  to  have  found  A  and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B,  and  if  they  were  wrong  on  B,  they  still  found  A.

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Right.  And  I  just  want  to  be 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  B  is  not  actionable, 

   

  

 

 

 

let's  just  say,  or  there's  insufficient  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  By  assumption,  if  we  assume 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  that  ­­ we  are  ­­ we  do  not  concede  that  we

But  if  you  were  to  assume  that  there  were  not  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  extra  ­­ of  the  extra  element,  I  think  then  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  would  be  whether  there  was  some  sort  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unanimity  instruction  that  would  have  been  required  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specify  which  particular  theory. 

 

 

 

            

            

It's  not  this  case  and,  you  know  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  that's  interesting 

  

 

 

 

because  I  ­­ I  ­­ I'm  not  sure  that  that's  true. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Well,  I  think  in  ­­ I  ­­ I

two  different  ways  of  committing  the  same  crime,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  need  an  ­­ a  unanimity  instruction.  But  I  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  My  hypothetical  was  that 

  

 

 

 

 

B  is  not  statutorily  proper. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Oh,  that  B  is  not  a  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  MARTINEZ:  ­­ not  a  proper  at  all. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Well,  in  that  case,  I  think  that  ­­ that  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  would  posit  harder  questions  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  because  there,  I  think,  there  would  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

some  ­­ there  could  potentially  be  confusion  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible  that  the  jury  might  have  convicted  on  ­­ on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory  that's  not  legally  viable. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  just  to  ­­ to  go  back,  Your  Honors,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  the  purpose  of  sufficiency  review,  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  ­­ from  Jackson  and  the  due  process  origins  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  sufficiency  review,  that  they  make  clear  the  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  are  distinct.  This  Court's  decisions  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Praprotnik  and  Boyle  make  clear  that  forfeiture  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  of  jury  instructions  doesn't  carry  over  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiency  context. 

 

            

And  I  think  the  practical  point  is  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

significant  here,  which  is  that  his  rule  is  only  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  an  effect  in  cases  where  a  jury  has  found  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  guilty  as  to  all  the  actual  elements  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime,  where  there's  sufficient  evidence  as  to  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  elements  of  the  crime,  and  where  there's  no

confusion. 

            

And  so  we  think  this  ­­ this  is  a  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  designed  to  produce  ­­ designed  to  produce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

windfall  acquittals. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Suppose  you  took  a  converse 

   

  

 

 

 

case  where  the  instructions  favored  the  government  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant  didn't  object,  is  convicted,  then  brings  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiency  claim.  Do  you  again  say  it  really  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measured  as  against  the  statute?  It  has  nothing  to  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  instructions? 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Yes.  We  think  that  if  ­­ if 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  had  been  an  obvious  clerical  error  in  ­­ in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's  favor  and  he  had  made  all  the  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  at  trial  about  sufficiency  and  ­­ and  ­­ we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  that  the  ­­ the  error  on  the  ­­ on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructional  point  would  carry  over  into  ­­ into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiency­of­the­evidence  review.  So  we  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

neutral  rule  that  really  applies  equally  to  both  sides. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  there  are  no  more  questions  as  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  question  presented,  perhaps  I  can  turn  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute­of­limitations  issue. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You  know,  I  ­­ I  have  a  ­­

   

   

   

  

 

 

sort  of  a  threshold  question  on  that.  Your  ­­ your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend  says  that  he  really  doesn't  have  to  demonstrate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  statute  here  is  jurisdictional  because,  even  if

it's  not  jurisdictional,  he  wins  anyway. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Do  ­­ do  you  agree  with  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  don't  know  what  the  plain  error  is  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  ­­ if  it's  not  jurisdictional. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  We  don't  think  there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plain  error,  partly  because  it's  not  jurisdictional  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partly  for  other  reasons. 

 

 

 

            

Maybe  I  could  step  back  and  just  give  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  the  Court  my  understanding  of  how  I  understand  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  that  he's  making. 

 

 

 

              

I  think  he's  got  basically  three  distinct 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments.  The  first  is  ­­ is  that  it's  jurisdictional, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  would  mean  that  it's  not  waivable,  that  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  has  a  duty  to  ­­ to  raise  it  at  any  time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

The  second  argument  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  In  which  case  there  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  plain  error. 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  In  which  case,  I  think  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  what  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  In  ­­ in  which  case  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  trial  court's  failure  to  raise  it  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error. 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  ­­ I  think  it  would  be 

    

   

 

 

 

 

error,  but  I  think  what  Petitioner  would  say  is  that  he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  to  satisfy  the  plain­error  rule  because,  if

it's  a  jurisdictional,  then  it  can  be  raised  ­­

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  true. 

  

 

 

MR.  MARTINEZ:  ­­ and  must  be  raised  at  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  true. 

  

 

 

MR.  MARTINEZ:  So  I  think  his  second 

   

  

 

 

 

argument  is  that  he  ­­ he  can  get  de  novo  review  even  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  jurisdictional  if  he  raises  it  for  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  on  appeal. 

 

 

            

And  I  think  his  third  argument  is  he  has  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  can  get  plain­error  review. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

We  think  each  of  these  arguments  is  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First  of  all,  with  respect  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  point,  this  Court  has  said  for  over  140 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  that  the  statute  of  limitations  is  a  matter  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  that  the  defendant  has  the  burden  of  introducing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  case.  That's  completely  contradictory  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea  that  the  statute  of  limitations  is  jurisdictional, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  would  mean  that  the  government,  as  the  ­­ the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  party  invoking  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court,  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  burden  of  establishing  compliance  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  of  limitations. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  do  you  deal  with  his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  we  should  ­­ if,  in  a  civil  case,  we  make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  presumption  that  a  statute  of  limitations  is  a

claim­processing  rule? 

 

            

In  a  criminal  case,  we  should  have  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

opposite  presumption  because  of,  A,  the  rule  of  lenity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and,  B,  because  it  is  on  the  ­­ a  question  of  the  power 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  government. 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  don't  think  ­­ I  don't 

    

   

 

 

 

think  you  should  have  that  presumption.  I  think  that  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  Court  ­­ the  ship  has  already  sailed  to  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent  because  this  Court  ­­ again,  for  ­­ for  140 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years,  from  Cook  through  Biddinger  to  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  in  Smith  just  a  few  terms  ago  ­­ has  said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  the  statute  of  limitations  is  a  matter  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  that  has  to  be  introduced  into  the  case  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant. 

            

And  I  think  if  ­­ if  Petitioner's  primary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  his  jurisdictional  argument  were  accepted, 

 

 

 

 

 

that  rule  would  go  out  the  window,  and  what  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  is  that  the  government  and  the  Court  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  establish  and  raise  the  jurisdictional  ­­ would  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  to  establish  the  statute  of  limitations  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  violated  in  every  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  shouldn't  the  rule  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  context  be  the  same  as  the  rule  for  timely  filing  a

for  a  couple  reasons,  the  most  important  of  which  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Rule  52(b)  governs  this  case  where  Rule  52(b)  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  directly  govern  the  filing  of  a  ­­ of  a  habeas 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition. 

            

And  so  Rule  52(b)  makes  clear  that  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  exclusive  means  by  which  a  criminal  defendant  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain  appellate  review  of  a  ­­ of  a  claimed  error  where 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  didn't  object  below  is  by  satisfying  the  four­prong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Olano  standard.  And  in  the  habeas  context,  that  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  apply. 

 

            

If  you  look  at  the  Court's  analysis  in  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  habeas  cases,  which  was  drawn  on  by  the  other, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Day  v.  McDonough  case,  the  Court  emphasized  that  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding  was  valid  there  because,  in  part,  there  was  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  to  the  contrary.  Here  you  have  a  rule  to  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary. 

              

I  think  the  second  point  that  could  be  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  those  ­­ on  that  ­­ on  this  front  is  that  the  habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  is  special.  And  I  think  the  Court's  decisions 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  both  Day  and  in  Wood  v.  Milyard  really  emphasize  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  driving  those  cases  is  a  desire  to  have  a  rule 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  takes  account  of  the  habeas  context,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

desire  to  have  finality  with  respect  to  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions,  and  the  desire  to  harmonize  the  rule  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  to  statute  of  limitations  with  the  rules  that

apply  to  other  threshold  barriers  to  habeas  relief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  think  that  the  State's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  the  habeas  context  in  finality  and  comity  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stronger  than  the  defendant's  interest  in  a  direct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  appeal  in  requiring  that  the  charge  be  filed  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  where  what's  at  stake  is  ­­ is  a  criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction? 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  that  ­­ that  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  criminal  defendants  are  obviously  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  an  interest  in  raising  arguments  that  they  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  meritorious  when  they  didn't  raise  it  below.  I  do 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  there's  a  very  significant  legal  difference 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  those  types  of  policy  concerns  don't  really  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  really  applicable  in  ­­ when  you're  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  a  direct  appeal  because  Rule  52(b)  sort  of  blocks 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

And  I  also  think  that  the  ­­ the  reasoning 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  cases  like  Day  and  Wood  really  does  turn  on  the  fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  had  a  statute  of  limitations  rule  and  you  had  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bunch  of  other  rules  governing  sort  of  threshold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barriers  to  habeas  relief.  Rules  about  procedural 

  

 

 

 

 

 

default,  rules  about  exhaustion,  rules  about 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity.  And  what  the  Court  said  in  both  of  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  is  that  it's  trying  to  harmonize  those  rules.  And

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  ­­ but  just  take  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  where,  under  the  habeas  rule,  it  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  for  the  ­­ the  district  court  to  raise  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute­of­limitations  defense  on  its  own  motion.  Why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  that  not  fit  within  the  plain­error  rule? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  that  ­­ that,  for  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  fit  within  the  plain­error  rule,  and  so  we  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shifting,  I  think,  to  Rule  52(b),  you  would  ­­ the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  would  need  to  show  that  there's  both  an  error 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  the  error  is  obvious.  And  as  Justice  Scalia 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  hinting  at,  perhaps,  with  his  question  earlier,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  there  is  an  error  here.  The  statute  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations  is  an  affirmative  defense;  and  therefore, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  burden  is  on  the  defendant  to  raise  that  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  ­­ in  the  Cook  case,  the  Court  made  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  if  there's  an  indictment  that  alleges  a  ­­ a  crime 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  outside  the  statute  of  limitations,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indictment  is  nonetheless  not  necessarily  or  inherently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flawed  unless  the  statute­of­limitations  defense  is 

 

 

 

 

 

raised  and  ­­ and  subsequently  litigated. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  still  in  all  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

make  any  sense  to  say  we're  going  to  let  him  off  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas  because  of  inadequate  assistance  of  counsel  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failed  to  raise  the  statute  of  limitations  and  yet  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  raise  that  point  on  appeal  ­­

not  decide  that  statute­of­limitations  thing  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  appeal? 

 

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Bear  in  mind  I  dissented  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

both  Day  and  Wood,  so  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  As  I  recall,  Your  Honor,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  ­­ I  think  there's  a  ­­ there's  a  couple  of 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

reasons.  The  strongest  is  that  the  difference  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas  context  is  that  the  record  can  be  developed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When  you're  looking  at  a  case  on  Rule  52(b),  this  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  always  treated  review  under  52(b)  as  being  limited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  existing  record,  whereas  in  habeas  case,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  can  be  developed. 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  very  important  in  two  fundamental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways.  First,  it's  important  to  know  why  the  defense  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  raised  by  the  defendant  at  the  appropriate  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  ­­ the  defendant  is  going  to  have  ­­ and  including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case,  could  have  a  very  strategic  reason  for  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raising  the  defense  during  the  trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  can  get  into  that  in  ­­ in  ­­ in  this

particular  case  if  the  Court  is  interested. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  the  second  ­­ so  that's  one  reason  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  important  to  have  a  record.  And  the  second  reason 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  government  has  to  have  the  ability  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduce  evidence  if  it  wants  to  rebut  or  establish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compliance  with  the  statute­of­limitations  defense. 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  what  this  Court  said  in  Cook.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cook  the  whole  point  of  the  case  was  that  it's  unfair 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  allow  for  a  ­­ a  ­­ a  indictment  to  be 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed  on  a  demurrer  because  that  would  deprive  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  of  its  right  to  reply  and  give  evidence  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish  compliance  with  the  statute  of  limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once  the  defense  is  raised. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  on  ­­ on  direct  review,  the  record  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  frozen  and  you  wouldn't  be  able  to  look  out  outside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  record,  whereas  on  habeas  you  would  be  able  to  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  the  record. 

 

 

            

And  in  addition,  I  think  the  ­­ it's  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  to  ­­ to  sort  of  look  at  the  theoretical  basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  ­­ the  error  and  ­­ and  ­­ and  recognize  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  satisfy  Rule  52(b)  in  the  way  that  that  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  ­­ has  traditionally  been  thought  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  Rule  52(b)  is  generally  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  that  the  trial  judge  is  supposed  to  notice  on  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own.  And  what  this  Court  has  said  about  statute  of

that  the  defendant  himself  has  an  obligation  to  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Suppose  the  court  of  appeals 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  a  direct  appeal  sees  that  the  statute  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations  for  a  particular  offense  is  six  years  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  indictment  was  filed  25  years  after  the  event.  Can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  of  appeals  say  to  the  government,  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  It  looks  like  it's  too  late.  Do  you  have  any 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation  for  this?  And  the  government  says,  well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no,  doesn't  ­­ we  can't  think  of  anything.  Do  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  wait  until  habeas  to  correct  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  ­­ I  think  that  the  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  better  way  is  to  wait  until  habeas  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct  that.  And  the  reason  for  that  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule  52(b)  is  limited  to  the  existing  record.  And  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  you  know,  made  clear  in  your  hypothetical, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  way  you  can  figure  out  that  there's  an  error  in

have  done  differently  if  this  had  been  raised  before? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  that  might  be  true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes,  but  it  doesn't  seem  as  though  that's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary  case.  I  mean,  why  would  you  have  ­­ you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  ­­ you  can  make  an  exception  for  cases  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  really  ­­ the  government  has  ­­ is  able  to  come  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say,  we  really  need  to  develop  the  record.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  that's  not  true,  why  wouldn't  you  decide  this  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quickly  as  you  could? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  I  appreciate  the  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

I  ­­ the  sort  of  practical  concern  embedded  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  I  think  as  a  formal  matter  you  would  still 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

need  to  be  looking  outside  the  record. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  formal?  I  mean,  we've 

    

  

 

 

 

been  through  this  many  times.  It  comes  up  in  all  kinds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  instances.  People  are  always  alleging  ­­ not  always 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  often  allege  that  their  counsel  was  inadequate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sometimes  it  would  be  possible  to  know  that  on  direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal,  but  in  the  mine­run  of  cases,  you  want  to  find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  from  the  counsel  why  he  did  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  therefore  I  think  every 

   

  

 

 

 

circuit  ­­ I  don't  know  what  this  Court  has  said  ­­ has

Now,  if  we  start  making  exceptions  from

say,  go  file  it  tomorrow. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Right.  And  I  ­­ and  I  think 

   

   

  

  

 

 

that's  the  better  way  to  handle  this  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  is  to  ­­ to  ­­ because  we  see  some  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  look  like  they'd  be  pretty  easy  to  decide,  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  well,  let's  ­­ let's  erode  what  would  otherwise  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  hard­and­fast  rules  about  how  Rule  52(b)  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  operate. 

 

 

            

Again,  we  don't  think  there  is  an  error 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Rule  52(b)  because  this  isn't  something  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  judge  is  supposed  to  figure  out  on  his  own.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  that  an  error  is  plain  on  the  record  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  record  itself  is  not  sufficient  in  and  of  itself  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  there  is  an  error.  And  so  we  think  that  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  a  rule  that  says  sometimes  you  should  bring  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  plain  error,  sometimes  you  should  bring  in  in  habeas, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  going  to  create  a  lot  of  confusion  both  for  courts

and  for  litigants.  You're  going  to  be  litigating  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  exception  applies,  when  the  exception  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply. 

            

            

And  I  think  the  key  thing  that  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Of  course  ­­ of  course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  there  was  a  ­­ a  strong  statute­of­limitations  bar, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

isn't  it  likely  that  the  trial  judge  would  suggest  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  counsel,  don't  you  want  to  raise  a  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations  defense? 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  that's  very,  very 

    

 

 

 

 

likely  that  the  trial  court  might  do  that.  I  ­­ we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  think  that,  because  there  are  sometimes  strategic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  for  not  raising  the  defense,  you  know,  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  trial  judge  should  do  it  in  a  way  that  it  doesn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interfere  with  those  strategic  concerns. 

 

 

 

 

            

We  don't  think  that  there  is  a  problem  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  does  it  that  way,  but  we  certainly  don't  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  an  obligation,  and  we  don't  think  it's  an  error 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  judge  doesn't  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  type  of 

  

 

 

 

 

strategic  reason  are  you  talking  about? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Well,  I  think  there  ­­ there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

could  be  a  couple  of  them.  In  this  case,  for  example, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  original  indictment  was  undoubtedly  filed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  limitations  period.  Now  that  indictment  was

superseded.  But  if  the  defendant  had  raised  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretrial  motion  a  motion  saying,  you  know,  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

superseded  indictment's  out  of  time  because  it  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relate  back  and  he  had  won,  the  effect  of  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  just  to  resurrect  the  original  indictment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  had  never  been  dismissed. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  if  he  had  actually  raised  this  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  and  he  had  succeeded  on  his  statute­of­limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  to  the  superseding  indictment,  we  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  been  back  in  the  world  where  the  original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indictment  applied.  And,  as  the  Court  has  noted,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original  indictment  was  somewhat  broader  than  ­­ than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  superseding  indictment. 

 

 

            

            

And  so  that  might  have  been  a  good  reason. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  another  case,  the  ­­ there  may  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  in  which  a  defendant's 

   

 

 

statute­of­limitations  defense  will  be  in  contradiction 

 

 

 

 

 

to  his  defense  of  innocence.  You  know,  it's  one  thing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  say,  I  was  in  Hawaii  when  the  crime  was  committed, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it's  another  thing  to  say,  I  committed  the  crime  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

January  1st  and  not  on,  you  know,  March  15th. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  there  may  ­­ you  know,  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  ­­ might  look  at  those  arguments  and  decide  he's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  pick  the  ­­ the  stronger  horse,  and  he  might

statute­of­limitations  defense  for  that  reason. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  you  summarize  for 

  

 

 

 

 

me  your  position  on  three  arguments  he  made. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ I  know  the 

    

   

 

 

jurisdictional  one. 

 

            

            

            

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  then  there's  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  MARTINEZ:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ the  other  two. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  MARTINEZ:  So  ­­ so  on  ­­ on  his  claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  de  novo  review  on  appeal,  we  think  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  with  Rule  52(b),  and  we  think  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misreads  Wood  and  Day,  the  habeas  cases,  because  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  really  about  the  habeas  context. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

He  makes  another  argument  about  Nguyen.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  Nguyen  is  a  ­­ a  kind  of  all­season  pass 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  ­­ for  ignoring  Rule  52(b). 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then,  finally,  with  respect  to  plain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error,  we  think  there  are  two  overriding  arguments.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  one  is  that  we  don't  think  there  is  an  error  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For  there  to  be  an  error,  we  think  the  statute  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations  would  need  to  be  something  that  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  court  is  supposed  to  have  an  obligation  to  sort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out.  We  don't  think  the  trial  court  has  that  obligation

because  this  Court's  cases  say  that  ­­ that  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  limitations  is  an  affirmative  defense  that  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised  by  the  defendant. 

 

 

 

            

Even  if  you  disagree  with  us  on  that,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  ­­ that  Cook  makes  clear  that,  whenever  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute­of­limitations  defense  is  raised  in  a  case,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government  has  to  have  the  opportunity  to  reply  and  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  And  what  that  means  is  that,  if  the  defense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  raised,  that  the  government  has  not  even  had  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity  to  explain  what  evidence  it  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  in,  what  that  means  is  that  the  record  as  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stands,  the  existing  record,  is  not  sufficient  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diagnose  an  error  because  you  would  have  to  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure  out,  well,  could  the  government  have  responded? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  know,  would  they  have  argued  that  ­­ that  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling  of  the  statute  of  limitations?  Would  they  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduced  a  different  set  of  evidence?  You  would  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to,  essentially,  reimagine  how  the  trial  would  have  gone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ if  the  defense  had  been  raised  at  the  appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time. 

            

And  if  you're  trying  to  reimagine  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  another  way  of  saying  the  error  is  not  plain  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what  would  you  argue

very  clear  ­­ and  the  evidence  was  super  clear  that  this

I  don't  want  to  get  into  the  facts  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Well,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  think  ­­ I 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

think  ­­ in  some  cases,  I  think  it  would  be  fair  for  ­­

been  a  strategic  reason,  such  as  there  may  have  been  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  then  the  parties  could  litigate  that.

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ERIK  S.  JAFFE 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  On  the  issue  of  whether  or  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  instructions  are  binding,  several  points: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  the  confusion  persists  to  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day.  Just  as  Justice  Alito  is  pointing  out  that  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  difficult  to  see  the  difference  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unauthorized  and  exceeding  authorized  access,  that  too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  infected  the  jury.  We  could  not  prove  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently  to  show  prejudice,  but  they  cannot  prove  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently  to  show  harmlessness  or  inevitability  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  had  you  not  so  instructed  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second  of  all,  I  believe  that  Jackson  v. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Virginia  talks  from  a  jury­centric  perspective.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

issue  is  not  the  statute.  The  issue  is  whether  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rational  jury  could  have  done  what  they  did.  And  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  works  if  you  look  at  the  instructions.  It  does  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  if  you  look  at  some  hypothetical  statute  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  think  they  were  applying.  They  thought  they  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  something  different. 

 

 

            

Third,  their  objection  that  we  ­­ we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledged  that  this  was  only  about  unauthorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access  is  curious  because  he  cites  the  appellate  stuff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there  was  new  counsel,  yet  his  own  side's  briefs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  trial  level  recognized  that  trial  counsel  was

confused. 

            

Yes,  after  that  confusion  was  resolved 

 

 

 

 

 

post­verdict,  we  argued.  Okay.  The  government 

  

  

 

 

 

abandoned  it.  That's  fine.  We  absolutely  argued  that. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  at  trial  the  harm  was  already  done. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  confused  themselves,  they  confused  the  jury,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparently  confused  the  judge. 

 

 

 

            

Third,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  phrase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"unauthorized  access"  is  not  actually  even  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  which  just  goes  to  my  point  that  there  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusion  as  to  access  without  authorization  and  access 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceeding  authorization.  Both  could  have  theoretically 

  

 

 

 

 

been  part  of  the  rubric  of  unauthorized  access.  Neither 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  authorized  there. 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ moving  onto  the  ­­ well,  I  guess  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last  thing  I'd  say  is  every  court  to  consider  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  if  this  had  been  in  the  original  indictment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it  also  said  "and"  and  in  the  jury  instructions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  court  to  consider  this  issue,  including  the  Fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  below,  including  the  First  Circuit,  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held  the  government  to  it. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  don't  think  the  government  denies  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

They  just  say  if  it's  in  the  indictment  alone  they  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  either/or.  But  if  it's  in  the  indictment  and  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions,  they  concede  that  the  so­called  law  of  the

case  is  binding. 

 

 

            

            

The  easy  way  for  this  Court  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  law  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

case  you  ­­ you  are  ­­ you  are  asserting  that,  if  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  mistake  but  it's  the  law  of  the  case,  that  applies 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  appeal.  As  ­­ and  I  thought  that  law  of  the  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  to  the  same  court,  different  stages  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation,  not  that  a  ­­ a  court  of  appeals  has  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

perpetuate  a  trial  court  error. 

   

 

 

            

MR.  JAFFE:  Law  of  the  case  is  a  terrible 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

name.  We  unfortunately  didn't  come  up  with  it.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  ­­ we  both  agree  that  it's  not  an  accurate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

descriptor.  It's  just  the  phrase  that's  been  used  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  cases.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  the  issue  is  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  instructions  binding  at  the  sufficiency  stage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  court  you're  in?  That's  really  the  issue.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

law­of­the­case  cases  don't  really  apply  because  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misnamed. 

            

Turning  to  the  statute  of  limitations,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd  say  is  this:  There  is  error  when  something  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary  to  law  whether  or  not  it  was  the  judge's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation  to  raise  that.  The  Apprendi  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

post­Apprendi  cases  are  the  best  examples  of  this.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  is  applying  pre­Apprendi  law.  It  did  not  make  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistake.  We're  not  expected  to  anticipate  Apprendi.

Yet  on  appeal  those  cases  were  considered  erroneous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  this  Court  adopted  Apprendi. 

 

 

 

 

            

Again,  it  is  not  about  whether  you  made  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection  or  whether  the  Court  should  have  thought  of  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves.  It  is  about  the  merits  of  the  result,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  instance,  we  claim  the  statute  of  limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  violated.  That  is  the  error  regardless  of  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed  to  raise  it. 

 

 

 

            

Talking  about  raising  the  issue:  Again, 

  

 

 

 

 

calling  the  statute  of  limitations  the  affirmative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  is  a  little  misleading.  It  is  not  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative  defense.  One  has  to  plead  it.  One  ­­ but 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  has  to  actually  prove  that  they  satisfy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  It  is  a  hybrid  kind  of  creature,  and  Cook  and  those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  deal  with  pleading  because  they  wanted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  to  have  the  opportunity  to  respond. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  do  not  disagree.  The  government  should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  opportunity  to  respond,  and  in  the  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit,  the  Seventh  Circuit,  and  the  Sixth  Circuit,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  some  need  for  evidentiary  submissions,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  remand  it.  Get  it  done  more  quickly  with  the  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  actually  heard  the  case,  which  makes  a  lot  more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  than  waiting  till  habeas. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted.
