12  the meaning of the phrase "omits from gross income an 
13  amount properly includible therein" in 26 
14  U.S.C. 6501(e)(1)(A).  More specifically, the question 
is whether an omission from gross income occurs when a 
15
16  taxpayer overstates his basis in sold property and 
17  thereby understates the gain that results from the sale. 
18
19  rulemaking, the Treasury Department issued published 
regulations that interpreted section 6501(e)(1)(A) to 
20
21  apply in overstatement of basis cases.  Those 
22  regulations reflect a reasonable interpretation of 
23  ambiguous statutory language, and they are accordingly 
24  entitled to deference under Chevron.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but only if

 MR. STEWART:  If the Court in Colony had 

interpreted the statutory language to be unambiguous, or 

1  your reading of the Colony decision is correct, right? 
2  If we think that Colony definitively resolved the 
3  question before you, the regulation can't overturn that. 
4
5
6  if the Court in Colony had issued an authoritative 
7  interpretation that Congress had then built upon, that 
8  would be correct.  But the Court in Colony stated that 
9  the language was, in its words, "not unambiguous."
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but once -- once we 
10
11  resolve an ambiguity in a statute, that's the law, and 
12  the agency cannot issue a -- a regulation that changes 
13  the law just because, going in, the language was 
14  ambiguous.
15
16  the Court in Colony purported to give a definitive 
17  definition of the phrase "omits from gross income an 
18  amount properly includible therein" wherever it appears 
19  in the United States Code.  And the Court in the first 
20
21  question before us is whether the taxpayer is subject to 
22  the extended assessment period under the 19 -- under the 
23  Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if they use 

in with the baggage it -- it carried from the Colony 
case; right? 

1  now is the 1954 code.  It's true that, like the 1939 
2  code, it includes the phrase "omits from gross income an 
3  amount properly includible therein," but it also 
4  includes adjacent provisions that bear upon the meaning 
5
6
7  the exact same phrase, and it's a fairly detailed --
8  it's not just a normal phrase they might use elsewhere, 
9  I think it's reasonable to assume that that phrase came 
10
11 
12
13  remember that the 1954 code was enacted in 1954, and the 
14  Colony decision came in 1958.  And so, I would take your 
15

17  statutory provisions that we're relying on would be 
18  pretty indirect means of an -- of expressing an intent

22  a circuit conflict and trying to resolve that conflict.

2  from what we said it was, the law that's written there, 
3  that's a very obscure way to change it.  I'm inclined to 
4  think that the law stays the way it was.
5
6  statutory provisions that I have in mind, to explain a 
7  little bit more fully why we think that the context in 
8  which the new provision or the 1954 provision appears 
9  bears on the -- the proper interpretation of the 
10
11
12  appendix to the Respondents' brief. 
13
14  subsection (A) is:  "If the taxpayer omits from gross 
15
16  excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income 
17  stated in the return," the assessment period is 6 years 
18  rather than 3 years. 
19
20
21  term "gross income" is defined to include gains derived 
22  from dealings in property.  And in that sense, it 
23  might --

purposes of the Internal Revenue Code generally, the

 So, what goes from that?
 MR. STEWART:  Well, if you look at 

1  and this statute.  You made the same argument under the 
2  Colony statute.  It lost.  So, you can't go back to that 
3  argument because it's already been rejected. 
4
5
6  subparagraph (i), Roman (i) -- or Roman (i) after the 
7  general rule, it says:  "In the case of a trade or 
8  business, the term 'gross income' means the total of the 
9  amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or 
services (if such amounts are required to be shown on 
10
11 
the return) prior to diminution by the cost of such" --
12 
"of such sales or" --
13
14  argument as I read it in the brief, it's a bit 
convoluted, as Justice Scalia observed.  But if Congress 
15
16  intended to change Colony, it wouldn't just have created 
17  this subdivision (i); it would have changed the main 
18  statement.  So, why don't we read this as simply saying 
19  we accept whatever Colony said, and the only thing we're 
20
21  The exception argument. 
 MR. STEWART:  As I say, I would agree that

23  if Congress had passed this statute after the Court's 
24  decision in Colony, that this would have been a fairly

 And I think it's -- it's just as fair to say 

that --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, this language would 

 MR. STEWART:  Well, in our -- I think --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a very strange

14  to me.

12  endorse the Colony rule going forward and apply it to 
13  trades -- to non-trade and -business taxpayers as well 
14  as trades and businesses, the most natural thing would 
have been to change the word "amount" in the main rule 
15
16  to "item," to make clear that the main rule would apply 
17  only when an item of gross receipts had been left off 
18  the return altogether.

3  respond to your question, Justice Kennedy, is to say if 
4  you look at the statute in its current form, both the

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stewart, don't you have 
3

5
6  the statute remained the same, Colony itself was a 
7  decision that found ambiguity in the statute.  So, you 
8  have the power under Brand X to go back to that statute 
9  and reinterpret it, if you will.
10
11  Brand X, but we -- we don't think that the Court needs 
12  to reach that question.  And when the Court in Colony 
13  said that the --
14
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if the Court thinks it 
has to reach that question because it agrees more with 
15
16  Justice Scalia than with you as to whether this statute 
17  stays the same, then you have independent Brand X 
18  arguments, don't you?

9  what it does today.
10
11  something was unambiguous, and that was the little (i) 
12  that was added.  And he also said he wasn't taking any 
13  position on the '54 code; isn't that so? 
 MR. STEWART:  That's correct.
14
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He did. 
15
16
 MR. STEWART:  And the Court said that both 
17  at the end of its opinion and it also said at the 
18  beginning the only question before us is whether the 
19  extended assessment period applies under the '39 code.

21  a case where we applied Chevron deference to a 
22  pre-Chevron opinion?  In other words saying, well, the 
23  Court looked at that, but the Court said it was

1  Obviously, Brand X is a recent decision of this Court. 
2  And I would agree with you that it's perilous to kind of 
3  put a Chevron overlay on decisions that were issued 
4  before Chevron.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Even without Chevron -- I 
5
6  mean, even apply it, I would have thought the point of 
7  Brand X is you look at the language of the statute and 
8  you look at what Congress intended, and where they 
9  intended the agency to have power to interpret, you 
follow the agency.  And you could do that after the 
10
11 
event if the basis for your decision is that it isn't 
12 
clear. 
13
14  goes and looks at what Congress meant, and what they

17  don't see the basis for saying now the agency still has 
18  power. 
19
20
21  in that, in which case it's not worth your time. 
 MR. STEWART:  Let me give two -- let me --
22

24  think in effect what Justice Harlan did for the Court in

1  amount of gross income, as though it meant item of gross 
2  receipts.  That was the practical effect of the Court's 
3  decision.  And I think two of the -- two of the adjacent 
4  provisions of the current code make clear that that's 
5
6
7  the basis.  I thought the basis is that there are two 
8  kinds of things:  One is you just don't put in some big 
9  category of stuff in your return, and the agency can

14  code defined "gross income."  It defines it in terms of

3  of the regulation in temporary form.  A couple of months 
4  before the regulation was promulgated, we had lost 
5
6  two-to-one vote.  At that time, we had won this issue in 
7  four trial courts --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Stewart, prior to 
8
9  this latest round of litigation, had the IRS ever said, 
ever given any indication, that it viewed Colony as not 
10
11 
controlling any -- any -- any longer? 
12
13  indication of our -- the position in the intervening 
14  years -- and we agree that there's a surprising dearth 
of law -- was the Fifth Circuit litigation in Phinney, 
15
16  P-H-I-N-N-E-Y, which was decided in 1968.  Phinney 
17  involved a situation in which the taxpayer accurately 
18  reported the amount of gross receipts, approximately 
19  $375,000, but misstated the nature of the receipts as 
proceeds of a stock sale rather than of an installment 
20
21  sale.  And the reason that that misstatement of the 
22  nature of the receipt made a difference was that it 
23  potentially affected the taxpayer's entitlement to take 
24  a stepped-up basis.
25

 And so, the court of appeals in Phinney said 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And as a result of this 

rulings or anything else that it viewed Colony as an 

1  that was subject to the extended assessment period, that 
2  the misstatement of the nature of the --
3
4  case, had the IRS suggested in any kind of guidance or 
5
6  outdated decision?  Because, you know, I'm a taxpayer, 
7  and I'm reading Colony and I'm thinking the language of 
8  the statute is still the same; why wouldn't Colony 
9  control?
 MR. STEWART:  Well, I -- I think one reason 
10
11  you might think that is that if you were -- you -- the 
12  opinion was not oblivious to the fact that the 1954 code 
13  had been enacted in the meantime, and the Court went out 
14  of its way to say:  We are discussing only the 1939 
15
16  1954 code, other than to note that our -- our conclusion 
17  in this case is consistent with the unambiguous language 
18  of new 6501(e)(1)(A).  And as the D.C. Circuit explained 
19  in Intermountain, that is best read as a reference to 
subparagraph (i), which says that for a trade or 
20
21  business taxpayer, "gross income" will mean gross 
22  receipts without an offset for the cost of acquiring 
23  goods and services.  So --

doesn't bear on the legality of the taxpayer's 

1  would at least be on notice that there was uncertainty 
2  as to the proper meaning of the -- the code.  Judge 
3  Boudin had written for the First Circuit in a case 
4  called CC&F W. Operations in 2001 that it was at least 
doubtful whether the main holding of Colony carried over 
5
6  to the new -- the 1954 code.  That was certainly dictum, 
7  but it also flagged the fact that this was a subject of 
8  uncertainty. 
9
10
11  substantive returns.  The only question is whether the 
12  IRS has 3 years or 6 years to make an extended 
13  assessment.  So, as of 2003, when 3 years from the date 
14  of the return had run for these taxpayers, I think the 
15
16  least uncertainty whether Colony applied.

19  taxpayers that Son-of-BOSS transactions were invalid

 MR. STEWART:  No.  No, those were two 

different documents. 

 MR. STEWART:  Well, the --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 
 MR. STEWART:  The two --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So, there are two different 

1  Commissioner reiterated his view:  "It has long been 
2  held that the extended statute of limitations," da, da, 
3  da, "is limited to when specific receipts or accruals 
4  are left out of the" -- of gross income, which is 
5

7
8  same thing? 
9

11
12

14  documents.  So -- so, in July, they're telling the tax 
bar this is okay.  And what you say is this document

16  here, which you refer to without a date, told them it 
17  wasn't okay. 
18
19

24  of a single -- of the district counsel for a single

 MR. STEWART:  Well, first of all --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'd be rather curious if 

you could sort that out. 

 MR. STEWART:  Well, the 2000 notice that the

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I know there are many 

proposition. 

 When we issued the notice with respect to 

1
2  ways of downplaying that, but I'm just curious as to 
3  what happened.  What about the one you cited?  When was 
4  that?
 MR. STEWART:  I don't know the exact date in 
5
6  2000, but it has long been established that transactions 
7  lacking economic substance and transactions motivated 
8  purely for tax avoidance purposes may be disregarded 
9  from -- by the IRS.  That -- that was a pre-existing 
10
11
12  Son-of-BOSS transactions in particular, that was simply 
13  the IRS's way of informing taxpayers that we regard this 
14  particular avoidance mechanism as encompassed by the 
general principle that transactions lacking economic 
15
16  substance --
17
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, yes, that's 
18  the general principle.  But the point you made just a 
19  few moments ago is -- I think is responsive to that, 
which is:  We're not talking about the merits; we're 
20
21  talking about a statute of limitations.  The whole point 
22  of a statute of limitations is some things that are bad 
23  are -- are -- are gone.

 MR. STEWART:  That's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can't go back to

4  different 2000 document for.  They are citing it as 
though it were a definitive statement of agency position 
5
6  as to the operation of the assessment period.  It -- it 
7  was not that.  It was a document issued by a single

district counsel cited Colony in a way that it suggested 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so, what that 
-- what happened here is that the taxpayer came to the 

1  official was seeking guidance with regard to the 
2  question of whether we needed to get within the 3-year 
3  assessment period or whether it was appropriate to rely 
4  on the 6-year assessment period.  And although the 
5
6  that it continued to control the operation of the 1954 
7  code, the district counsel stated on the facts of this 
8  case it would not be inappropriate to rely on the --
9
10
11  same conclusion as a district counsel of the IRS. 
12
 MR. STEWART:  That's correct, but not --
13  didn't come to the same conclusion as the IRS did in

17  the July.  What about this other, undated one?  Now, I 
18  notice what you say about it.  You said that it 
19  described "arrangements that unlawfully 'purport to

22  it -- will I come away with the impression, uh-oh, these

conclusion as the IRS did in --

Official 

 MR. STEWART:  I -- first I would say --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that the impression you 

 MR. STEWART:  That notice would not say --
tell you anything relevant to the computation of the 

1
2
3  had? 
4
5
6  assessment period. 
7
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  All right.  That's 
8  what I suspect.  Then look at the unfairness of this. 
9  I'm not saying there aren't worse unfairnesses in the 
world, but, nonetheless, people spent a lot of money. 
10
11 
The whole Bar has gone to an enormous effort. 
Everything up through 2000 being -- seems to say you can 
12 
13 
do this.  You have a case on point in the Supreme Court. 
And then 9 years later, after continuous litigation, the 
14 
IRS promulgates a regulation which tries to reach back 
15
and capture people who filed their return 9 years 
16 
17 
before. 
 MR. STEWART:  Again, I'm not quite sure what 
18
19  you mean by saying:  would seem to say that you could do 
this.  I don't think that there were any affirmative IRS 
20
21  statements that could lead people to believe that the 
22  Son-of-BOSS mechanism was okay, but what --
23
24  Mr. Stewart, two things that Justice Breyer brought up? 
One, he said that the IRS had given people advice that 
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you clarify, 

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And then he said -- he suggested that a 

overstatement of deductions don't get you the longer
 

 And the other question is, is it so, that
 
agents told people that Son of BOSS would work?  Is --
 MR. STEWART:  No.  No, it's not true that 

1  Son of BOSS was okay; it would work -- this tax shelter, 
2  this tax scheme, would work. 
3
4  basis is like deductions.  And you agree that 
5
6  statute of limitations.  So, why -- why should an
 
7  inflated basis get you to 6 years when inflated
 
8  deductions don't?  That's one question.
 
9
10
11
12  the IRS had advised people that Son-of-BOSS transactions 
13  were okay.  It wasn't until 2000 that the IRS issued a 
14  specific document that said, as a matter of agency 
15
16  just a kind of case-specific application of the more 
17  general -- of the more general proposition that 
18  transactions lacking economic substance can be 
19  disregarded.
20
21  basis is treated differently from the overstated 
22  deduction, that follows inexorably from the language of 
23  the code.  That is, Congress defined the conduct that 
24  would trigger the general rule as an omission from gross 
25

policy, they're not okay.  But, again, that document was 

 With respect to why the overstatement of 

income, and because of the way that gross income is 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, as to why Congress would have done 

1  defined, an overstatement of basis can lead to an 
2  understatement of gain, which in turn is taken into 
3  account in computing gross income.  A deduction may 
4  ultimately affect taxable income, but it doesn't affect 
gross income.  And so, there would be no way of reading 
5
6  the statute to encompass that. 
7
8  this, I think a clue is furnished by subparagraph Roman 
9  (ii), which is at the bottom of page 1a, and it says: 
"In determining the amount omitted from gross income, 
10
11 
there shall not be taken into account any amount which 
is omitted from gross income stated in the return if 
12 
13 
such amount is disclosed in the return, or in a 
statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate 
14 
to apprise the Secretary of the nature and amount of 
15
16 
such item." 
17
18  says even if you fall within the general rule, even if 
19  you understated your gross income by more than 
20
21  the IRS adequate information to notice that the 
22  misstatement had taken place, you will be off the hook 
23  for the 6-year assessment period. 
24
25

25 percent, if, at some point in the return, you gave 

 And so, that provides a safe harbor that 

 And I think that is highly relevant in 

responding to the policy concern that Justice Harlan

difficult for the IRS to catch; the IRS would be placed 

more broadly but given taxpayers an out where the 
disclosures are adequate. 

1  identified in Colony.  That is, Justice Harlan said the 
2  reason we think that Congress intended to restrict the 
3  statute to situations where an item is left off the 
4  return altogether is that those would be the most 
5
6  at a special disadvantage. 
7
 Here in subparagraph (ii), Congress has 
8  accomplished the same intent but through a different 
9  mechanism.  That is, it's made the general rule sweep 
10
11 
12
 If I could reserve the balance of my time. 
13
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just on that point -- and 
14  we'll find out in a minute -- is the Respondent going to 
15
16  everybody knows you have a basis? 
17
18
19  necessarily what you're telling the government.
20
21  I don't want to speculate too much on what he will say, 
22  but I think his position is an overstatement of basis 
23  could never trigger the assessment period because the 
24  item of gross receipts would have been adequately 
25

 MR. STEWART:  I don't think that --

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 Mr. Garre, is it implicit that you always 

omission -- an omission from gross income is where you 
leave out a specific taxable item or receipt. 

1
2
3  have a basis? 
4
5
6
 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, our position is the 
7  one that the Court reached in Colony, which is that an 
8  overstatement of basis is not an omission from gross 
9  income.  What the Court held in Colony was that an 
10
11 
12
13  when it concluded that the statute of limitations on the 
14  statute -- on the tax assessments at issue expired in 
2003 and rejected the IRS's extraordinary efforts to 
15
16  avoid that result by discombobulating this Court's 
17  decision in Colony and by seeking to retroactively 
18  reopen and extend the statute of limitations. 
19
the addition of subparagraph (i) in the code, and that 
20
21  was added in 1954, before the Court's decision in 1958. 
22  And I'd like to make a few points about subparagraph (i) 
23  because I think it's the crux of the Government's 
24  position.
25

 What the Government relies on principally is 

 The first is just the anomaly of their 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

was a circuit split at that time about exactly this 
question and that this paragraph was a response to that 
circuit split.  So, what else could Congress have meant 
by it? 

1  argument, that by adding this subparagraph -- and it's 
2  on page 1a of the addendum to the red brief -- which 
3  explicates the definition of "gross income" in one 
4  specific context, the sale -- the cost of goods or 
services by a trade or business, Congress meant to 
5
6  change the general rule -- and that's what it called it, 
7  the "general rule" -- in subsection (A). 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why do you think they 
8
9  added that paragraph?  Because it seems clear that there 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  taxpayer side of the circuit split.  There's legislative 
17  history indicating that it also thought it was 
18  addressing the computational rule of how to get gross 
19  income, which factors into the 25 percent trigger.
20
21  this Court in Colony looked at the 1954 amendments at 
22  the suggestion of the government and concluded that its 
23  decision was consistent with the 1954 amendments. 
24  That's in the last line of the decision.
25

 I think what maybe is most important is that 

 MR. GARRE:  Well, Your Honor, I think that's 

probably right.  It thought it was agreeing with the 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Were most of the --

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's got to mean --

to find out what the predecessor section means. 
 And then he says:  I'm not going to 

cetera.  The only unambiguous language that he could be 
referring to is in (i) because he has just -- he had 
said the earlier language was ambiguous. 

1
2  that's got to refer to (i).  It can't refer to the --
3  Harlan said two things.  He said it's ambiguous; 
4  therefore, I'm going to look at the legislative history 
5
6
7  speculate on what this new thing means, but I do want to 
8  point out that the result we reach in Colony is in 
9  harmony with the unambiguous language of 6501, et 
10
11 
12 
13
14  so, Your Honor.  First of all, you're right, he referred 
15
16  subsections.  It's not clear that he was identifying 
17  subparagraph (i).  He could have well been referring to 
18  subparagraph (ii), along the lines of what my friend 
19  just spelled out, because much of the Colony decision 
was based on addressing the situation where the -- where 
20
21  the IRS is at a special disadvantage because something's 
22  been left out entirely.  And that really kind of gets to 
23  the heart of subparagraph (ii). 
24
25

 But the anomaly of the Government's 

construction here today is that Colony would come out 

 MR. GARRE:  Well, I don't -- I don't think 

to the whole 6501(e)(1)(A), which includes both 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  differently, because Colony doesn't involve a taxpayer 
2  involved in the sale of goods or service; it involved a 
3  taxpayer in the sale of real property.  So, even though 
4  this Court in Colony said --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- real estate developer 
5
6  in the business of buying and selling property.  So, I'm 
7  not sure that I buy your argument that it can't be goods 
8  and services, because that was the services of this 
9  particular company.
 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, the sale of real 
10
11  property, whether in parcels or otherwise, has always 
12  been treated differently than the sale of -- costs of 
13  goods or services, which really is a term of art.  And 
14  if you go back at Colony, you can see that the Court 
referred to basis, referred to property, and that's 
15
16  precisely the way that the parties did in their brief. 
17  The Solicitor General in its own brief framed the 
18  question presented as overstatement of basis in the sale 
19  of property.
20
21  today.  The subparagraph (i) they're referring to is 
22  addressed to the specific situation of a trade or 
23  business involved in the sale of costs of goods or 
24  services --
25

 That's the situation that we have here 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I --

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. GARRE:  -- which is different. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I was going to ask in 

those or any of those relate to the sales of goods and 

sale of goods and services.  And at that time, no one 
was drawing this bright-line distinction. 

1
2
3  conjunction with Justice Kagan's discussion, were the 
4  pre-Colony cases that involved splits -- did most of 
5
6  services or were they all real estate sales?  Do --
7
 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, the Uptegrove case 
8  did, the Third Circuit case.  But they involved -- the 
9  fact is they involved both the sale of property and the 
10
11 
12
13  drew it, as I think is implicit in Justice Kagan's 
14  question, when it talks just about goods and services.
 MR. GARRE:  It did do that.  There was one 
15
16  reason for Congress to address that specific situation, 
17  in that there was a regulation that had defined "gross 
18  income" differently.  It's appended at the end of our 
19  brief, and it was discussed in Uptegrove.  So, there was 
20
21
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And the other reason, it 
22  was goods and services.  There's always FIFO and LIFO. 
23  I mean, there's -- you know, taxpayers who sell goods 
24  have inventory cushions.  And so, the IRS is very, very 
well aware that that kind of judgment is involved in all 
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but the Congress 

a reason to single that out.  But I think the more --

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

and here, you're dealing with specific disclosures as to 
the basis. 

1  these statements.  It's not quite the same with basis. 
2
 MR. GARRE:  Well, Your Honor, I think it's 
3  the opposite, if I understand your question, which is 
4  that taxpayers typically put more information which is 
going to put the IRS on notice when you're dealing with 
5
6  basis and the sale of property as opposed to the costs 
7  of goods and services, which involve many transactions 
8  and you're dealing with them in the aggregate.  When 
9  you're dealing with the sale of property, as in Colony 
10
11 
12
 Here, if you look on page 151 of the JA, it 
13  lays out the adjustment in the basis.  And the same was 
14  true in Colony.  And so, to the extent that there's a 
15
16  taxpayer. 
17
18  amendments in 1954 were pro-taxpayer amendments as 
19  relevant here; and yet, the Government's conclusion is 
that by adding this subsection addressing the specific 
20
21  situation, it meant to take away the general rule in a 
22  way that hurt taxpayers.  It's inconsistent with what 
23  this Court said in Colony because the Court --
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why would they be 
redundant?  I mean, if the statute without little (i) 

distinction there, I think it cuts in favor of the 

 The problem for the Government is all of the

Alderson Reporting Company

the trigger has to be --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you agree that that's 

rule, the general rule, is as you say it is? 

1  meant what you said it meant, then there would be no 
2  occasion to put this in, because "omission from gross 
3  income" would refer to items of income, period.  That's 
4  -- so, what work does (i) do, if it just -- if the main 
5
6
 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, everyone agrees it's 
7  not redundant, even the Government, because what it does 
8  is, at a minimum, it has a computational effect of 
9  affecting the 25 percent trigger.  The amount to get to 
10
11
12  not why Congress passed that provision? 
13
 MR. GARRE:  Well, it's not clear, Justice 
14  Kagan.  The -- the Federal Circuit in the Salman Ranch 
case cited legislative history that suggested it was 
15
16  trying to achieve just that result.  But I think the 
17  broader point I would make is it's not at all uncommon 
18  for Congress to act to provide an answer to a specific 
19  situation that had come up by explicating it.  And yet, 
one doesn't conclude that, in doing that, it's intended 
20
21  to overstate -- override the entire general rule that's 
22  stated, particularly where it doesn't touch the language 
23  that's the subject of the general rule.  Congress didn't 
24  in any way touch the phrase interpreted in Colony, 
25

"omission from gross income." 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And the anomaly gets even greater if you 

 In 1982, Congress re-enacted the same
 

subsection, to mean "Substantial omission of items,"
 

language, "omission from gross income," found in the 

1
2  look at Congress's actions after Colony.  In 1965, 
3  Congress amended the heading.  Now, granted it's only a 
4  heading, but it amended it, the heading to the 
5
6  which is perfectly consistent with Colony's
 
7  interpretation, directly contrary to the Government's
 
8  interpretation.
 
9
10
11  provision at issue in Colony in 26 U.S.C. 6229, which is 
12  the provision for partnerships.  And yet, it omitted the 
13  subparagraph (i) that the Government relies upon as the 
14  transformative provision narrowing the general rule. 
And so, why on earth would -- would Congress omit that 
15
16  subparagraph if it did the transformative work that the 
17  Government suggests? 
18
19  except to say that they have to be interpreted the same 
20
21  placing on subparagraph (i).  I think the answer is, is 
22  subparagraph (i) just doesn't have and was never 
23  intended to have the transformative effect that the 
24  Government suggests.
25

 Whatever -- we can talk about what the Court 

 The Government doesn't have a response 

way, which makes no sense given the emphasis it's 

34
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Garre, where do 

the world after Colony, but the fact is, if you go back 

1  meant in Colony, but I do think that it's critically 
2  important that Colony is entitled to full stare decisis 
3  effect.  In fact, it's stare decisis coupled with 
4  Congressional re-enactment.  The Government describes 
5
6  and look, no one thought that Colony was just a ship 
7  passing the night that had only retrospective 
8  significance.  Everybody, including the IRS, appreciated 
9  that Colony was a landmark decision.
10
11  you find evidence of that?  Because you cite some cases 
12  in your brief that end up not really supporting your 
13  position.  And as far as I can see, there's only one 
14  case after Colony that deals with the question of 
whether Colony continues to govern after the 1954 
15
16  amendments.  And that case, which is Phinney, seems to 
17  cut in the opposite direction.  So, am I missing 
18  something?  Are there cases that -- that favor you that 
19  say that, yes, Colony continued to control?
 MR. GARRE:  I think what my response would 
20
21  be first as to Phinney, the Fifth Circuit has clarified 
22  that the Government's construction of Phinney is just 
23  wrong.  Phinney was consistent with the Colony rule.  It 
24  dealt with a particular application of it.
25

2  seems to me to cut in the Government's direction if not

5
6  rule? 
7
8  Phinney, and then I'll address the other cases.  I would 
9  ask you to look at the Solicitor General's opposition 
brief in Phinney, which recognized that Colony was the 
10
11 
governing principle.  One would think that the 
Government thought that Colony was just a shot in time, 
12 
13 
had no ongoing significance, they would have said that 
in the opposition brief in Phinney.  The Solicitor 
14 
General accepted Colony as the governing rule, as 
15
16 
everyone did. 
17
 As to the cases, I think it's fair to say 
18  that, no, we can't point to a case in the 1950s, '60s, 
19  or '70s where they specifically confronted the question 
before the Court today.  But what I -- what I -- what I 
20
21  can say is look at the cases that we cite in our brief, 
22  and all of those cases discuss this Court's opinion in 
23  Colony as if it continues to have lasting effect on the 
24  interpretation of the "omits from gross income."  And

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because what I was thinking, 
Mr. Garre -- and tell me what you think the consequence 
5
6  of this would be -- is that if I were a tax lawyer and 
7  somebody came to me and said is Colony still the rule, I 
8  would have said:  Well, I can't tell you 100 percent.  I 
9  think you're good 70 to 80 percent.  You know, it's the 
same language, and there's Colony out there, and -- and 
10
11  -- and nothing the IRS hasn't said that Colony doesn't 
12  control, but I can't -- so, I'm giving a 70 percent. 
13
14  as I see it?
 MR. GARRE:  Well, I don't know how you would 
15
16  put a percentage on -- on, in effect, whether Colony was 
17  a "step one" case or not.  I mean --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, in terms of what a 
18
19  taxpayer thinks, whether Colony continues to govern.
20
21  you know, the IRS's actions here really put taxpayers in 
22  an extraordinary situation.  I mean, they're taking a 
23  decision of this Court that says an overstatement of 
24  basis -- no, that's not an omission of gross income. 
They're relying on the 1954 amendments to get around

3  perfectly consistent with those.

6  that, Mr. Garre, and without doing more than noting the

 MR. GARRE:  Justice Ginsburg, the government

17  interpretation, which was the one that the Court 
18  rejected.  If -- if this Court -- this Court must have 
19  considered that argument in reaching the opposite 
20
21  fair to describe that language as dictum.  But this 
22  Court has many times said that even if something is 
23  dictum, if it explicates the Court -- Court's holding,

 MR. GARRE:  I think that the prefatory 
5
6  language there -- I think -- I think you're right. 
7  That's a fair characterization.  But, ultimately, what 
8  the Court said was its holding was in harmony with the

17  don't know which one he was referring to.  And the

 MR. GARRE:  Well, we do disagree with it --

 Under our current regime, can you ever give

2  more than a 70 percent chance?  Because you have, in the 
3  absence of a definitive Supreme Court ruling, the IRS 
4  can reach a different result and it can do that 
5
6  that, right?  I mean, if we determine that Colony was 
7  ambiguous, the IRS can change the rule in Colony, and it 
8  can apply that rule, new rule, retroactively.  That's 
9  what our cases say, right?
10
11  I mean, I certainly accept the Brand X part of that. 
12  What we disagree with is that (a) the IRS has the 
13  authority to retroactively apply an interpretation of a 
14  statute, which gets to the meaning of 7805(b)(1); and 
(b) whether or not the regulation in this case on its 
15
16  face applies it retroactively.  But I accept --
17
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, they can't -- they 
18  can't change the interpretation of the statute, but they

4  according to Brand X, if there's ambiguity, despite a

7  what Brand X says? 
8

10
11  indeed Colony meant by "ambiguous" ambiguous. 
12
13
14  meaning of "ambiguous" is, right?
 (Laughter.) 
15
16
 MR. GARRE:  I don't think so, for this 
17  reason:  Because Colony -- at the beginning of the 
18  Court's decision, Justice Harlan in a gracious way, as 
19  the Chief suggested, pointed out that there could be 
some ambiguity in the text.  But then he went on to 
20
21  apply the traditional tools of statutory construction. 
22
 JUSTICE ALITO:  But I can hardly even think 
23  of a statutory interpretation question that we've gotten 
24  that doesn't involve some degree of ambiguity, if we're 
25

 MR. GARRE:  I --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It depends on what the 

honest about it.  We take a case where there's a

degree of ambiguity is Brand X referring to? 

 MR. GARRE:  Well, I would -- I would think 

1  conflict in the courts of appeals.  And so, there was at 
2  least enough ambiguity in those cases for one or more 
3  courts of appeals to come to an interpretation that's 
4  contrary to the one that we ultimately reach.  So, what 
5
6
7  that Brand X refers back to Chevron and looks to the 
8  first step of Chevron.  Brand -- what Brand X is looking 
9  to is whether or not -- it's really a step one or step

19  Congress speak to that specific situation?  And in order 
20

22  to a bunch of legislative history, and none of that 
23  legislative history actually speaks to the exact 
24  question before the Court, only by implication.
25

two case.  And on step one, Chevron looks to whether 
Congress has addressed the specific question presented. 
And if you look at the Court's decision in Colony, what 
Justice Harlan said was Congress was addressing itself 
to the specific situation where a taxpayer actually 
omitted some income receipt or accrual in his 
computation of gross income, and not --

to get his result, Justice Harlan says first that the 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that was the specific 

 So, if you look at the whole of -- of the 

42

that Congress addressed the specific situation of 

1  Colony opinion, it sure seems as though there's a lot of 
2  extrapolation going on and essentially a lot of 
3  ambiguity. 
4
 MR. GARRE:  Well, I would disagree with 
that, respectfully, Your Honor.  I think the -- the 
5
6  holding of the Court -- and, again, it's entitled to 
7  stare decisis effect even if this Court might approach 
8  it differently today under different modes of statutory 
9  construction or otherwise.  The holding of the Court was 
10
11  whether an overstatement of basis was an omission from 
12  gross income, and the Court said no. 
13
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, in the end, there has 
14  to be a resolution.  But the question is, what does it 
look like before you get to that resolution?  And -- and 
15
16  Justice Harlan is doing a lot of tap dancing there, you

18  report, going to this colloquy, before he can come up

to do with a parenthetical where, once again, although

concrete example of that is --

1  law in 2003 when the statute of limitations expired was 
2  Colony.  Even if the Court -- the agency had leeway to 
3  reinterpret it, it's changing the law.  And the reason 
4  why it's doing that is it's doing it retrospectively.
 If you look at cases like Brand X, the 
5
6  theory is you have one interpretation, and then the 
7  agency going forward can have another one.  In Brand X, 
8  the agency sought to apply its -- its new interpretation 
9  prospectively.  Here, it's doing retrospectively, and 
10

19
20

this is one permissible reading, it was the law as the

1  -- it was the permissible reading and the law until the 
2  government changed it.  And the government didn't change 
3  it, try to change it, until 2009.  The statute of 
4  limitations in this case expired in 2003.
 And so, if the government can adopt a new 
5
6  interpretation going forward, the question is, can it 
7  apply that interpretation retrospectively during the 
8  time frame in this case?  And our position on that is 
9  that they certainly haven't done so unambiguously.  And 
that -- as this Court said in St. Cyr, ambiguity means 
10
11 
unambiguous prospectivity.  And the Court also 
12 
rejected --
13
14  the preamble as part of the regulation?  Because if I 
15
16  me.  It seems to me that your view that the government 
17  did not do this clearly enough must rest on looking at 
18  the regulation without the preamble. 
19
could -- I mean, certainly, we think you'd go first to 
20
21  the regulation.  And it says "was open."  The preamble 
22  says, quote, this is "not retroactive."  It says it does 
23  not apply to open tax -- it only applies to open tax 
24  years, and not to reopen closed tax years.  That's on 75 
Federal Register 78,898.  The government -- the way that

13  think, at a minimum, the taxpayer ought to get the 
14  benefit of that, and this Court should say that if the 
government really wants to do -- take the extraordinary 
15
16  step that it's taken here to retroactively reopen a

 And what Congress said is internal

3  "regulation" because there's two types of IRS

it's clear Congress was thinking about that distinction.

21  If you do read that as one unit, then the "enacted on or

 MR. STEWART:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
14
 I'd like to make three quick points.
 First, Mr. Garre refers to the amended 
15
16  heading of section -- subsection 6501(e), which now 
17  states "Substantial omission of items," but I think the 
18  heading simply points up the fact that some provisions 
19  within subsection (e) refer to amounts and some to 
20
21  gift taxes, refers to omission of items. 
22
23  Congress chose that term precisely to make clear that 
24  the understatement -- or the overstatement or 
25

items.  Subsection (e)(2), which deals with estate and 

understatement of an item that was reported will not 

 And the legislative history makes clear that

 The second thing is that, at bottom, 

1  give rise to the extended period. 
2
3  Respondents argue that the -- that the phrase "amount of 
4  gross income" should be construed to mean item of gross 
receipts.  And they don't offer any real textual 
5
6  argument as to why that would be a sound reading. 
7  Really, they rely exclusively on Colony.  But the Court 
8  in Colony said, at the beginning of its opinion, that it 
9  was pronouncing only on the 1939 code.  It said at the 
end of its opinion that it was not generally trying to 
10
11 
construe the 1954 code. 
12
 And it stated that the relevant -- the most 
13  relevant language was not unambiguous.  And I think the 
14  recognition of ambiguity is relevant in part because it 
15
16  because saying that a particular snippet of language is 
17  ambiguous is to recognize that its meaning may vary 
18  depending on context.  And the --
19
20
21  get it out, but you mentioned Brand X.  Have we ever 
22  applied Brand X to one of our decisions?  Have we ever 
23  said an agency by regulation can alter and change one --
24  a Supreme Court decision?
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Stewart, I know 
you've got a -- your third point, and I want to let you 

sets up our Brand X argument, but it's also relevant 

 MR. STEWART:  No.  I mean, Brand X was the

applying it to a court of appeals decision. 

 MR. STEWART:  That was applying it to a 

 Justice Stevens --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that was 

1  first case that announced the Brand X principle, and the 
2  Court has not applied it since.

7  court of appeals decision. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  We've never 
8
9  said an agency can change what we've said the law means.
 MR. STEWART:  No.  Justice Stevens wrote a 
10
11  separate opinion in Brand X, suggesting that it might 
12  not apply to decisions of this Court, but the Court as a 
13  whole did not pronounce on that. 
14
 And then the third point I would want to 
make is that Mr. Garre referred to cases and one IRS 
15
16  General Counsel opinion that were issued during the 
17  period between 1958 and 2000 that applied Colony to the 
18  current statute, but they did so in a very specific way. 
19  That is, they relied on the aspects of Colony that 
20
21  assessment period for cases in which the IRS was at a 
22  special disadvantage due to inadequate disclosure.  And 
23  those cases applied that language in elucidating current 
24  subparagraph (ii), which provides a safe harbor in cases

of adequate disclosure.
