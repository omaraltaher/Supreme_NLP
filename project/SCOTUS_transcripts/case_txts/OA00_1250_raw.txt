CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 00-1250, U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Robert


Barnett.


Mr. Dellinger.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, III


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DELLINGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act


does more than merely prohibit hostile discrimination


against individuals with disabilities.  Congress


recognized that an additional kind of discrimination is


the failure of employers through indifference or whatever


to undertake reasonable accommodations to the physical or


mental limitations of otherwise qualified individuals.  As


a result, this act does affirmatively require businesses


to lift barriers that inhibit employment opportunities for


those with disabilities.


The question here, though, is whether, in one


particular respect, the act goes beyond a requirement that


obstacles be cleared away.  The issue is this.  Where an


employee is unable, because of a disability, to continue


in his job, is that employee entitled to be placed in

another position instead of a more senior fellow employee


who would be entitled to the job under the normal


operation of a bona fide seniority system?


Now, this is not an easy question, but we


believe that in the end a clear answer necessarily emerges


from the act, and that is this, that the act simply does


not require an employer to override neutral selection


criteria wholly unrelated to disability in choosing among


applicants for a position, and in particular it does not


require the employer to set aside the normal operation of


a bona fide seniority system.


QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, are you suggesting by


that argument that the express exception for bona fide


seniority systems in title VII was surplusage, that it


wasn't needed, because there would have been -- it would


have been counted as a neutral rule?


MR. DELLINGER:  That is correct.  In fact, I


think the presence of that provision in title VII is part


of a background assumption in which neither title VII nor


any other Civil Rights Act has ever taken what would be a


fairly substantial step of requiring an employer to prefer


someone for a position over an employee who is entitled to


it under a seniority system or, indeed, to prefer any


applicant over a more qualified employee.


QUESTION:  But your answer is that it wasn't

necessary to put that in title VII, title VII would apply


just the same way without it?


MR. DELLINGER:  That is correct.  I do not


believe that --


QUESTION:  Is there any indication that that's


what Congress thought when it didn't -- I mean, it does


seem a rather conspicuous absence, that the model statute,


the basic one has an express exception for bona fide


seniority systems, and this one doesn't.


MR. DELLINGER:  Title VII took especial care to


do that, but if you look at the more relevant statute, the


Rehabilitation Act, it also does not contain any express


exception and, moreover, it was interpreted not to require


that, but most importantly under title VII, is this


Court's decision in TWA v. Hardison, where the Court said


it would reach the same result as the principle we argue


for here, even without, even before you get to the portion


of the act about bona fide seniority systems.


The Court in Hardison held that the reasonable


accommodation language of that act for religious


adherence, the same reasonable accommodation undue


hardship language does not require displacing the rights


of more senior employees under a seniority system in order


to accommodate a religious adherence need to avoid working


on a Saturday shift.

 QUESTION:  But are there any instances in which


the seniority clause has to be ignored in favor of a


reasonable accommodation?  Suppose there are two positions


and they pay the same thing, but a senior employee wants


position A, and that's the only one that the disabled


person can fulfill?  The seniority provision trumps there?


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, it does, Justice Kennedy,


and let me acknowledge that, of course, whenever you have


a clear rule like the rule here that an employee, that an


employer may apply a neutral standard unrelated to


disability, such as a merit standard or a seniority


standard, any time you have a clear rule, and that's the


way seniority systems operate, you're going to have


individual cases where, if you had a different kind of


system involving individual assessment, you might reach a


different conclusion in the very particular instances, but


that -- that notion that you look and see whether in one


particular case favoring the interest of the less-senior


employee would in some social sense be better, that system


is fundamentally incompatible with the nature of how a


seniority system operates.


This is a system that, for US Airways, there are


14,000 customer service employees.  Seniority is a system


that gets rid of the potential of favoritism --


QUESTION:  Would you talk about what the system

is here, because I found it a little hard to understand. 


Is it that a policy of the employer, the airline, that


every so often all positions in the category in which this


person worked are declared vacant?


MR. DELLINGER:  I think that terminology is not


used, Justice O'Connor.  The effect may be the same.  What


happens under US Airways' system is that periodically,


basically once a quarter, all positions are put up for


rebidding.


QUESTION:  All positions throughout the company,


or in certain categories of jobs?


MR. DELLINGER:  All through the entire category


of customer service employees, which would be 14,000.  I


don't think they rebuild the --


QUESTION:  Customer service jobs, once a


quarter, are all declared open?


MR. DELLINGER:  That's right.  Each different


division would -- well, they're not so much declared open,


as simply put up for rebidding.  That is, the way the


system operates is that there is a -- it's a very simple


system.  There's a list kept in order of seniority. 


Everybody can rely upon where they are in the pecking


order of that list.  When there are positions eliminated,


the people who are in those positions are not necessarily


the ones who lose their job.

 If two positions are eliminated in the freight


area, the two juniormost employees have to leave, and


the --


QUESTION:  Well, we're not talking about job


elimination.  I thought we were talking about an existing


job that continues but it's declared open.


MR. DELLINGER:  No.  There is no -- there's


no -- if you gained the impression from respondent's brief


that Mr. Barnett's position was somehow singled out to be


declared vacant --


QUESTION:  No.  No, all customer service jobs,


every quarter, are essentially declared open.  Is that the


policy?


correct.


MR. DELLINGER:  That is correct.  That is


QUESTION:  And at that -- is it also true, as I


think you allege, that the seniority policy does not


create legally enforceable rights in any employee?  No


employee wanting to come in would be able to sue to get


that enforced.


MR. DELLINGER:  That is correct.  The


company's --


QUESTION:  So what kind of a seniority plan is


that?  I mean, on the one hand you say, we have to apply


our seniority plan, but on the other hand, it isn't

enforceable.


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, and I'm glad you asked


that.  Of course, the company's consistent position in


court, whenever someone wants to have a court review how a


seniority plan is applied, is it relies upon the fact that


it does not create legal rights enforceable in court, but


no one has challenged the fact that it is a bona fide


program.  It's not a --


QUESTION:  I know, but what would be the


situation if there were truly a vacant position at US


Airways in customer service?  Would you think the ADA


would say that it would be a reasonable accommodation to


consider a disabled employee for placement in one of those


slots?


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, absolutely.  We believe


that the reassignment aspect of reasonable accommodation


does have considerable bite and does considerable work. 


It requires you not only to consider, but actively


consider whether there are any other vacant places in


which you could place an employee.


QUESTION:  I mean, there is a provision in the


act itself, is there not, that speaks to a vacancy and


that can be a reasonable accommodation?


MR. DELLINGER:  That is correct, and we believe


that what that means, Justice O'Connor, is that an

employer must, unlike the situation under the


Rehabilitation Act, where you could simply say you can't


do the job --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. DELLINGER:  -- we're letting you go, we


can't accommodate that job, they have no obligation to


consider other places in the company.


Here, they have to actively consider.  You have


to actually go out, you're obligated to go out and try to


find a vacant position.


QUESTION:  Okay, so why isn't the sort of thing


that US Airways does here, declaring all these jobs open


once a quarter, create the kind of thing that US Airways


has to consider a vacant position?


MR. DELLINGER:  Well, you are exactly right that


when the quarterly rebidding process comes up, yes, they


have to consider, and they did, indeed, consider Mr.


Barnett's request to be transferred into that position. 


Moreover, if they needed to make adjustment or


accommodations on how that second position functioned,


they would be obligated to do that as well.


What they were not obligated to do at this


point, after they've identified available positions,


overridden any arbitrary rules that say, you know, some


people can't have that position, altered the position,

they then consider whether there's any good reason not to


place Mr. Barnett in that position and, in the absence of


a good reason, they are required by this provision to do


so.  At this point, we believe that the better reading of


the act does not require the employer to override neutral


selection criteria wholly unrelated to disability in


choosing among applicants --


QUESTION:  May I ask, do you mean any neutral --


any neutral selection criteria would trump the statute? 


Say they had a criteria that they used brand new employees


for certain ticket-selling jobs as a training mechanism,


and they always took people who hadn't worked for the


company for more than 90 days or something, that that was


their regular practice, would that practice always trump


the interest of the disability -- disabled person?


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  I believe that an employer


is entitled, under the statute -- you've got to have a


good, neutral reason unrelated to disability, but the


bright line --


QUESTION:  Now you've added the word good. I


thought it only had to be neutral.


MR. DELLINGER:  I mean good in the sense that it


has to be legitimate, bona fide business reason.


QUESTION:  Something they always do.


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  You've got to, because the

act requires you to make this appointment,  but where


we --


QUESTION:  Suppose you have a seniority system


that's riddled with exceptions.


MR. DELLINGER:  Where you have a seniority


system that's riddled with exceptions, it is perfectly


open to someone who challenges that to say, you don't


really have a neutral policy unrelated to disability.


QUESTION:  No, no, you do.  I mean, here you


happen to have just one exception.  Well, suppose there


were five or six, and so the argument would be, well, if


you can make an exception for the hardship, the


catastrophic illness, for this special situation in that


one, what we want you to do is also make an exception for


the handicapped person.


Now, nobody's doubting the employer's good


faith.  The question is, well, why not make na exception


for us.  You have a lot of others.  Let's have a trial on


it to see how open to you that is.


MR. DELLINGER:  The answer to your question is,


no, you are not required to do the reassignment merely


because your seniority policy is one that applies


seniority in some circumstances and not others.


QUESTION:  All right, then at that point I'd


become uncertain what exactly -- why we should hold what

you want, from my point of view.  That is, I can easily


see this act simply requires the employer to act


reasonably, and now you could say, where there's a


longstanding seniority system, and there's nothing special


about it, and there are zero or very few exceptions, it's


automatically a reasonable thing to not stir up enormous


trouble in the workplace by saying, we're going to start


making exceptions.  I could see that.  I'm not saying I


agree, but I understand it.


But now, why is it, if there are, however, quite


a few exceptions, that it isn't even open to the


handicapped person to argue, make another, it's not


unreasonable to make another?


MR. DELLINGER:  Let me preface my answer by


saying that for decades US Airways has had an established


seniority policy that covers all of these positions, which


has been regularly followed, with one exception for


catastrophic illnesses and one revision of how you


calculate the time of seniority, so that that issue is


not, you know, raised or put before the Court as to


whether you would think that not a good reason.


But it seems to me that under -- if you look at


the sequence from the title VII through the Rehabilitation


Act, through Hardison, the background principle that our


civil rights laws have simply not restricted the ability

of an employer to make a good faith determination about


how to fill positions, and that nothing in the ADA itself


seems to question that bedrock assumption.  That is to


say, no one suggests, though it would be a perfectly --


not unduly costly that you need to add positions. 


Everyone seems to concede and agree that you don't need to


transfer an employee to a position that would constitute


a, quote, promotion, unquote, even though that might --


the employee might be qualified to do that position.  No


one suggests that you have to bump an employee who was


actually sitting in a position.


Here, what you have is the defeated expectations


under a seniority system, and if that system is bona fide,


the way it works is to allow each employee to determine


what his or her most important desires are, and that is


what you gain through seniority.  If you lose to --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger --


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- one of the reasons that I find


this particular statute puzzling is that it's not like


title VII.  Title VII says, thou shalt not discriminate. 


It says, you don't prefer -- you don't just redress


imbalances.  It's a straight nondiscrimination statute.


This one isn't.  This one is driven by a concept


called, reasonable accommodation.  It makes reasonable

accommodation -- if you don't reasonably accommodate,


you're discriminating, and so it seems to me that this


statute has reasonable accommodation, if it's undue


hardship, then it would be unreasonable, but there's


nothing like that in title VII.  This disabilities act


gives a starring role to reasonable accommodation, which


it truly doesn't have in title VII, so to give that


effect, couldn't you look at this and say, well, this man


was already in the job, and no body is going to be out of


work, so the accommodation is reasonable.  If he were


seeking to bump somebody else, it wouldn't be reasonable. 


Why isn't that an appropriate way to look at this act


that's driven by the idea, reasonable accommodation?


MR. DELLINGER:  Let me acknowledge that what


makes this an interesting case is the fact that the ADA


does go beyond merely prohibiting hostile discrimination,


so you're right that there are things that an employer


affirmatively has to do that it doesn't have to do for


other employees under this act.


The general language of the act, though, in my


view is not sufficient to change the landscape that


existed under the Rehabilitation Act, where the Courts had


uniformly held that reassignment was never required.  It's


now a possibility, but you're never required.


QUESTION:  But did the statute have the word,

reassignment in it, as this one does?


MR. DELLINGER:  It did not have in it the word,


reassignment, but we don't think that that word is


intended to change -- in the Hardison case under title VII


it was a reasonable accommodation case, and yet the Court


said, no, there's a bright line.  We're never -- even


though the religious part of title VII requires a


reasonable accommodation, we're never going to require


another employee to sacrifice his or her standing under


the seniority policy.


Now, the other part of your question, I think


the question asked by Justice Breyer was, but what if it's


really reasonable in a particular instance, and here's


where I need to suggest why that approach is fundamentally


inconsistent with how a seniority system operates.  You


are introducing an element of judgment and discretion


which will unsettle settled expectations in a way that is


completely unpredictable.  What happens is, you simply


can't know what the domino effect will be of substituting


for a seniority system.


This is a system that is now operated by lower


level managers who need to keep a posted list where every


employee knows what the position is.  If someone -- it


would be a fundamental alteration of the system to require


the employer no longer to utilize this neutral basis.  For

example --


QUESTION:  I notice that one of the amicus


briefs suggests -- on behalf of labor unions suggests that


that might well be true if it were the subject of


collective bargaining and an agreement, but not for an


ordinary employer plan.  Is that how you read the brief?


MR. DELLINGER:  That is how you read that brief,


and I see that is not a distinction which Congress made in


title VII when it chose there to protect seniority


plans,and it is not one that seems to make a great deal of


sense here.  That is, in many States, in spite of the


language put in by US Airways, in many States the


provisions of a company plan are legally enforceable in


court.


Moreover, I don't think there's any intent on


Congress to weigh in on the question of whether the


workforce should be unionized or not unionized by giving


the disabled lesser rights --


QUESTION:  Then if that's true, then what


meaning do we give to reasonable accommodation in the ADA?


MR. DELLINGER:  I think what reasonable


accommodation --


QUESTION:  It has to be something different, I


assume, than undue hardship, because that's a separate


defense.

 MR. DELLINGER:  Undue hardship, that's right,


really goes to cost on an employer.  I think the


reasonable accommodation language here requires an


employer to take affirmative steps to try to enable a


person with a disability to continue in the workplace, and


in particular with respect to reassignments, to look for


vacant places to make second job accommodatable, for


example, but not to cross a very major line --


QUESTION:  But in a situation where the


employer's policy is just to create open positions every


quarter, that aren't enforceable anyway on behalf of any


employee, is it unreasonable to say the employer has to


accommodate this disabled worker?


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, it is unreasonable for the


following reason.  The reassignment, the sort of quarterly


declaration of vacancy to which you refer is simply how a


system operates where every employee accumulates seniority


and then gets to choose the position and the shift, so


that if you gain seniority, you get enough, you say thank


goodness I can now get off the graveyard shift, I can go


on the swing shift or the day shift position, I've gained


all of this, and that is rebid every quarter.  People


rebid on positions, and that seems like a perfectly


reasonable thing to do.


It is a -- there's nothing -- what is the bright

line, I think, here is that Congress has -- would have


fought long and debated hard before it took the major step


of saying an employer could not, at the end of the day,


once all accommodations had been made, choose a person for


a position based on who was the best-qualified or who was


the most senior.


Now, let me say again what --


QUESTION:  Your argument for that, as I


understand it, is the argument that you've repeated in a


couple, or your claim that you've repeated in a couple of


instances that there would be something fundamentally


unhinging to the seniority system to allow a disabilities


exception, and that seems to me in part sort of an


empirical question.


I mean, if a company like yours was going to


have 100 disability exceptions a month at every terminal,


yes, I can see it, but is there any reason to believe that


the magnitude of the possible disabilities exceptions


under reasonable accommodation would be so great as to


have that kind of cataclysmic effect on the general


reliance that employees can place on seniority?


MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Souter, that is a good


question that I think would go to whether it was an undue


hardship.


QUESTION:  Well, it would go to that, but

wouldn't it -- you know, it would go to --


MR. DELLINGER:  But here, on the question of


unreasonableness, I think we're looking at a question of


principle.  As Judge Posner said in the Seventh Circuit


decision, it is a difference not just of cost but of


principle, and here the principle at stake is the interest


of other employees, so --


QUESTION:  There's no question, to the extent of


the exceptions, their interest is going to be discounted


in some way.


MR. DELLINGER:  And even -- even though we don't


know the numbers, because we don't know ultimately how


broadly the court will interpret the phrase, disability,


which you have sub judice in other cases, and even them


would take some working out.  We don't know the numbers,


but we do know how it would disrupt the expectations of


employees.


Here, for example, even though we have a bright


line rule -- we have a bright line rule with promotions. 


Even though promotions are a reassignment to a vacant


position, you never have to promote, and that's because


there's a good reason, it is thought, that promotions are


not a reasonable accommodation.  There's an even better


reason, in my view, not to trump the rights and interests


of other employees who have earned a right to a position,

and to try to look, as several of you have in questions,


as to whether it might be reasonable in a particular


instance, I don't know how you place this burden on


managers in a system that is a seniority system to make


those complex social judgments not knowing what the domino


effect is.  You could have --


QUESTION:  Well, one thing is easy to see is


that if you bump somebody, it's no good.  That's not


reasonable.  If somebody, as in this case, is already in


the job, you let that person remain in the job, so it's


not as though every exercise of seniority rights is of


equal magnitude.  If somebody is trying to bid for that


job and some senior person otherwise would be laid off,


then you say it's unreasonable, but here there isn't such


a situation.


MR. DELLINGER:  That could well be.  We don't


know what the effect is, because someone will be bumped if


they don't get their desired position.  For example --


QUESTION:  I thought we know on the facts of


this case that it's only a question of, that nobody is


going to be bumped.  The question is whether he stays in


that job.  There were jobs he could have done in cargo, if


he weren't disabled.


MR. DELLINGER:  We don't know what the


consequences will be, because what Mr. Barnett is

asking -- and this is from his declaration, which is not


in the joint appendix, but is at page 3 of his declaration


of February 28, he says, the intent and potential effect


of my request was to have the employee who is going to


displace me in the mailroom go around me and bump the next


less senior position.


You could have the following situation.  You


could have the person who's claiming the job in the


mailroom could be an older single parent who's finally


worked out child care arrangements and is entitled by


seniority to the mailroom position, but who finds out,


when, though she is senior in position, or he is senior in


position, that Mr. Barnett is insulated from the normal


operations system, would have to bump the next position


down, which might well be a graveyard shift position, or a


position in cargo, which the person was too old to handle


the effects of, so you simply --


QUESTION:  What it boils down to, though, is, I


think as Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, it means that no


one can bump up, but it doesn't mean that anybody gets


bumped down, and that, there's a -- I mean, she suggests


there's a qualitative difference between those two.


MR. DELLINGER:  And I think we don't know that,


Justice --


QUESTION:  Well, why don't we know that as a

matter of logic?


MR. DELLINGER:  Because it could well be that


the more senior employee who needs to be in the mailroom,


she needs -- her position is being eliminated.  She needs


to be in the mailroom, which has a day shift.  She's


senior and entitled to it.  She can't get it.  The next


senior position, which she has to take, could be a


graveyard shift, or a graveyard shift in cargo.  She might


not be able to work --


QUESTION:  That's true, but it's still the fact


that we know that the effect of following Justice


Ginsburg's suggestion is that no extra person gets bumped


down.  It's merely that one person doesn't bump up and


bump the disabled employee down.  That we can say with


certainty, can't we?


MR. DELLINGER:  It may well be in many instances


the bottom-most person will lose their job, and it could


be that the more senior person would get a job that


they -- that doesn't work out for them.


QUESTION:  But that's going to be a wash no


matter how it works.


MR. DELLINGER:  Not necessarily.


QUESTION:  If you have  zero-sum -- I mean, if


you have a finite number of employees and you're laying


somebody off, that's --

 MR. DELLINGER:  Under our plan, it won't be that


more people will lose jobs, or get their less desired


accommodation. It will be that the more senior employees


do not get the position to which they are entitled, which


for complex reasons may be very important to them.


I'll reserve the remainder of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Dellinger.


Ms. Center, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLAUDIA CENTER


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. CENTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


There are four points that must be made in this


case.  First of all, the petitioner's proposed definition


of the term, reasonable accommodation, as meaning fair,


proper, fit, appropriate, not extreme, not excessive, et


cetera, et cetera, must be rejected, because that


construction eviscerates all of the statutory defenses, is


contrary to all of the regulations, and it is contrary to


the listed reasonable accommodations, including


reassignment.


Second, the term reasonable accommodation in the


ADA means a modification that enables the disabled


employee to participate that is reasonable to the disabled


employee.

 Third, even if you --


QUESTION:  You're  -- stopping you at the second


point, there, so from your point of view, reasonable


relates only to its effect on the employee, not on anybody


else?


MS. CENTER:  That's correct.


Third, even if you disagree with my proposal for


the definition of reasonable accommodation, the term must


include the listed reasonable accommodations.  Where it


says reasonable accommodations may include, those


accommodations listed, which include reassignment to a


vacant position, are reasonable accommodations by


definition.


QUESTION:  But the statute says may include.  It


doesn't say must include.  Your definition says must


include?


MS. CENTER:  The may include relates to the


case-by-case individualized analysis that must take place. 


All of the accommodations won't be necessary in every


cases.  The may include relates to the specific needs of


the specific individual employee.


And finally, reassignment to a vacant position


means an actual reassignment to a job that is not


currently occupied or that has not already been filled.


QUESTION:  Would you -- Ms. Center, why is it --

it has been conceded, I gather -- you didn't contest this


anyway, in your brief, that reasonable accommodation would


never include appointment to a promotion to a more -- a


position that pays slightly more, even though the amount


it pays more is negligible, so it's not -- you know, it's


not a hardship on the employer.  Why is that?


MS. CENTER:  Well, I think there are several


reasons that the agency, the EEOC has come to that


conclusion, which I agree with.  First of all, the listed


accommodation is reassignment to a vacant position. 


Congress did not say promotion, and reassignment describes


a lateral transfer, ordinarily.


QUESTION:  Well, but this is a vacant higher


position.  They didn't exclude that.  This is a vacant


position at a higher level.  Why wouldn't that be


included?


MS. CENTER:  Further, the EEOC regulations


explain that the purpose of the reasonable accommodation


is to enable the disabled employee to enjoy the privileges


of employment along with similarly situated disable -­

nondisabled employees, to enjoy equal benefits, and if


there's a promotion it's sort of -- it's contrary to that


principle.


QUESTION:  Oh, but so is what you're urging


here, this -- you're ending up giving the person here

seniority rights, which exceed those of other employees


who have been there a certain amount of time.


MS. CENTER:  Well, in this case the job that Mr.


Barnett ended up with was equal in terms of, a) he would


have been employed, and b) at the same pay and, et cetera,


the same level --


QUESTION:  I understand, but --


MS. CENTER:  -- as he would have gotten but for


his disability.


QUESTION:  But you can't urge that your system


assures that the disabled not be given any benefits that


other employees would not get.  You're giving him a


benefit that they wouldn't get.  They wouldn't be allowed


to stay in that job, so why can't you do the same thing


for a promotion?


I mean, the other side has a criterion.  Their


criterion is, it is -- reasonable accommodation is limited


to accommodation to the disability, so you provide him


with a working space that will accommodate the fact that


he can't stand up for too long, or you put him in another


job at the same level that's vacant which doesn't require


him to stand up.  All of this accommodates the disability,


they say.


Whereas the accommodation you're urging here has


nothing to do with accommodating the disability.  It has

to do with, I don't know, giving him a different job.


MS. CENTER:  Right, the accommodation is --


QUESTION:  They have a criterion.  I don't


understand what your criterion is, except, you know, do


what is reasonable.  Why isn't it reasonable to promote


the disabled person if it -- it just costs a few more


bucks.  That's the only vacant job left.  It's not


hardship to the employer, so promote him.  Why isn't that


reasonable?


MS. CENTER:  Well, it's -- in addition to the


reasons I already gave you, the agency has construed


reassignment to a vacant position to not include


promotion, and --


QUESTION:  Well, never mind the agency.  Maybe


the agency was unreasonable.


(Laughter.)


MS. CENTER:  In this case, though, the


accommodation that Mr. Barnett sought was not more


seniority.  The accommodation was reassignment to a vacant


position and not --


QUESTION:  I'm not talking about him, though. 


I'm asking for your theory of the case.  What is it that


makes an assignment not reasonable, or an accommodation


not reasonable?


MS. CENTER:  An accommodation --

 QUESTION:  Once you cut it loose from


accommodating the disability, which is what the other side


wants to do, once you cut it loose from that, why isn't


everything up for grabs, including a promotion?


MS. CENTER:  It's not cut loose from the


disability.  The reasonable accommodation has to be made,


by the clear a statutory language has to be made to the


physical or mental limitations of the disabled employee. 


Here, the reassignment enabled Mr. Barnett to retain --


would have enabled Mr. Barnett to retain his employment. 


It was because of his disability that he was unable to


perform the job that he was relegated to when the


positions were put up for bid, so it was through his


disability --


QUESTION:  Well, it can -- it can be a


reasonable accommodation.  The question is, is he entitled


to it in the face of an employer's seniority plan that


would put somebody else there instead?


MS. CENTER:  Well, I think that he --


QUESTION:  I think that's the question.


MS. CENTER:  Well, there are -- I think he is


entitled to that reasonable accommodation if all other


possibilities are exhausted.  If all of the prerequisites


are met for reassignment, such as there is a vacancy, the


disabled employee is qualified, and no statutory defense

such as undue hardship applies, I think he is entitled to


the reassignment.


QUESTION:  Even though some other employee on


the basis of greater seniority than the respondents under


the plan could take that slot?


MS. CENTER:  Yes.  I think he's entitled to that


slot at that point.


QUESTION:  And you don't equate that with the


situation of a promotion?


MS. CENTER:  No, it's not a promotion.  It's a


lateral transfer.


QUESTION:  Let me be sure of one thing.  The


case arises on a summary judgment, and I thought the court


of appeals held that you were entitled to a trial, not


that you were entitled to summary judgment.  Are you


claiming you are entitled to summary judgment?


MS. CENTER:  No, I'm -- I think that the


employer is free to try and present a defense to our claim


of failure to accommodate.  Their defense would be undue


hardship, or one of the other statutory defenses.


QUESTION:  Does reasonableness go the jury, or


is there a jury, do you think?


MS. CENTER:  There would be a jury.  I think in


this case because reasonable accommodation -- because


reassignment is one of the listed reasonable

accommodations, the judge could state that reassignment is


a reasonable accommodation, but if you disagree with my,


you know, construction of reasonable accommodation, then


it could go to the jury, I suppose.


QUESTION:  In your summary judgment proceeding,


did you challenge, at all, the employer's description of


the seniority system?


MS. CENTER:  Yes, there was a challenge to that


description.


QUESTION:  I didn't see it.  That is, as far as


I could see there's an affidavit on the employer's side,


and Rule 56(e) requires you to point to specific, you


know, record evidence or affidavits, et cetera.  I didn't


see any.


MS. CENTER:  Well, there wasn't -- I -- maybe I


misunderstood the question, but there was in the record an


effort to point out that they had made exceptions to the


seniority system, that they had amended it --


QUESTION:  As far as I could tell, what I have


to assume about the system is that it's widespread, it's


longstanding, it governs 14,000 employees, the only


exception is an exception for catastrophic medical


transfer, and the -- they say, I guess we have to take it


as given, that it would require your view would require US


Air to weigh and balance conflicting claims and personal

desires of all US Air agents, and it would interfere with,


I guess, the alternative child care arrangements,


educational endeavors, and the ability of other, the other


employees to continue working for the company.


Now, those seem to me the facts.  I didn't see


any refutation of them --


MS. CENTER:  There are additional facts --


QUESTION:  -- and therefore I assume, for


summary judgment purposes, I take those as a given, and if


I'm not supposed to, I'd like to know right now.


MS. CENTER:  There are additional facts, in


addition to the catastrophic illness exception there is a


significant modification to how to calculate furlough


seniority.  There is a change from department seniority to


company seniority.  In addition, as the petitioner has


conceded, the personnel policy guide containing the


seniority policy states on its face that it's not a


contract, it's merely a --


QUESTION:  No, that's given.  I assume it's not.


MS. CENTER:  And the grievance procedure, where


by employees would bring these seniority matters to the


company's attention, that grievance procedure says, you're


not allowed to grieve something that's required by Federal


law, and we get to decide what's required, so in that


circumstance it seems to me not reasonable for an employee

to believe that the job assignment policy is going to


trump a legitimate need for reasonable accommodation under


a Federal law.


QUESTION:  Given that statement, to get to


this -- what I think of anyway as the heart of this


matter, assuming I don't accept your view of reasonable


accommodation, assuming that I accept the view that


reasonableness includes the interest of other workers and


perhaps the interest of management as well, all right,


given that view of it, when you come up with the


characteristics that I've mentioned and that you added to,


why isn't it reasonable for the employer to say, look, if


I give this person the job, there's an alternative chain I


have to bump that really causes disruption in the company. 


It throws everything up for grabs.


I can't enforce a seniority system under that


kind of regime, but even if I could, all these other


workers here are going to be disrupted, too, and that's


what makes my seniority system reasonable in the


circumstance.  Now, your reply to that is precisely what?


MS. CENTER:  The sort of domino effect has been


vastly overstated by this case by the petitioner.  The


actual impact of this sort of accommodation in this case


and in other cases is to permit the disabled individual to


have one assignment, and then replacing, on the list of

possible jobs for people to bid on, replacing that


assignment would be the job that the person left, so each


reassignment leaves a vacancy to be put on the list of


jobs --


QUESTION:  I don't understand that part of your


answer, though I want to hear the rest, because if there


are 7,000 jobs missing, then it will be 7,000 people at


the end of the day without a job, and either you go down


one chain and bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, or you go down


a different chain and bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.  The


harm is precisely the same.  It's a question of which


people suffer it, so I don't see why there isn't a domino


effect.  It's this chain, or that chain.


MS. CENTER:  Right, but in terms of the


particular chain, there's a list of jobs upon which the


nondisabled employees can bid, and those would include all


of the jobs that remain vacant after the reassignment, as


well as the job that the disabled individual left, so the


actual impact is modest. 

It's removing one job on the


list and adding a different job on the list.


QUESTION:  Well, isn't it like musical chairs in


a way?  I mean, someone is going to lose out to the


disabled person.


MS. CENTER:  Someone may get a bob that they

job.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. CENTER:  That's correct, but no one would


lose their job because of the reassignment.


QUESTION:  Well, it may be a job -- I mean, it


depends.  It may be a job that the person can't take, such


as the person who had arranged from child care, and


simply, the only other job available is one that the


person cannot do.  I mean, that's possible.


Why isn't it -- as I read this statute, I don't


see anything in it which says that if -- there's plenty in


it that says we're going to sacrifice some of the


convenience of the employers to the needs of the


handicapped, but I don't see anything in it that says


we're going to sacrifice the expectations of coworkers to


the handicapped.  Why isn't it a perfectly feasible


reading of reasonable accommodation to mean an


accommodation that, among other things, does not defeat


the reasonable expectation of fellow employees?


MS. CENTER:  Well, you could conclude that, but


I think it's -- if you look at the statutory structure, if


you looked at the list of reasonable accommodations, if


you look at the governing regulations, all of these


provisions explain how the equities are weighed in the


statutory --

 QUESTION:  What is there in any of them that


shows that Congress envisioned not just putting some


burden on the employer, but putting some burden on fellow


employees?


MS. CENTER:  Well, the --


QUESTION:  I mean, it mentions vacancy only.  I


mean, it mentions vacancy because nobody's hurt if there's


a vacancy, but somebody is hurt if there's a vacancy to


which somebody has seniority entitlement.


MS. CENTER:  Well, the plain language of the


statute requires that the employer provide reasonable


accommodation, and the defense is undue hardship, and so


that's how the statute works.  If there's no other


possible accommodation --


QUESTION:  Yes, but if I reject that view of the


statute on the one I was taking, I'd still like to know


what the response is to what I think is the main point,


which is not the domino effect.  If I paraphrase it, life


is very difficult in a big company when you lay off 7,000


people.  It's terrible, and the one think that the 7, the


14,000 who remain have to be certain about is that there's


a fair system in place, and once we open it to this kind


of argument, well, it's over.


Your client has a very bad back.  I might think


that's somebody that this act should protect, but when we

get to the reasonable accommodation stage, at that point,


if all those people are in the act, I can't run my system,


says the employer, because the claims for special


exemption in the bumping will be endless.


Now, your response to that is what?


MS. CENTER:  Well, if you disagree with our


reading of the term, reasonable accommodation, the term


still would require a case-by-case individualized analysis


of whether it was reasonable in this situation, and what


the petitioner wants is a per se rule for bona fide


seniority policies, and that's completely contrary to the


way that the statute works, which is case-by-case


analysis.


QUESTION:  -- say that your client could be


bumped by someone who's more severely handicapped if he


were in that position?


MS. CENTER:  I think that each of the


handicapped employees would be entitled to reassignment to


a vacant position.  If my client was in that position


already, it would not be a vacancy, so it wouldn't be


available.


QUESTION:  Well, but I -- it's my understanding


that these positions are deemed open at some point.


MS. CENTER:  Well I think, then, that the client


would be -- the more disabled individual would be entitled

to reassignment.  They both would be entitled to


reassignment.


QUESTION:  Well, that's -- I think you've missed


my point.  Why wouldn't that person be as entitled to the


position that your client occupies temporarily, when as a


part of his or her reassignment or accommodation,


reasonable accommodation?


MS. CENTER:  There could be conflicting requests


for accommodation, that's correct.


QUESTION:  Would that person be entitled to that


position --


MS. CENTER:  There would be a number of ways


to --


QUESTION:  -- using your argument?


MS. CENTER:  I don't believe that the more


disabled employee would be entitled to bump the less-


disabled employee.  I think that --


QUESTION:  Why?


MS. CENTER:  Why?  Because the employee that


needs the accommodation continues to need the


accommodation.  The other employee also needs the


accommodation.


QUESTION:  But you could say that about the


people who have the job in the first instance, couldn't


you?

 MS. CENTER:  Excuse me.


QUESTION:  The person who had that position and


had his or her life worked out, day care, et cetera, et


cetera, also needed that position.


MS. CENTER:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  So the argument's the same.


MS. CENTER:  But the argument is that there's a


Federal law in this case that requires reasonable


accommodation, including reassignment.


QUESTION:  Let me ask you this.  What is your


client's disability?


MS. CENTER:  He has a back impairment.


QUESTION:  What does that mean?


MS. CENTER:  He has an orthopedic disability. 


He has pain, he has problems in his disks.


QUESTION:  Has it been established that he in


fact qualifies as disabled, or is that something we're


just assuming arguendo at this stage of the case?


MS. CENTER:  It's disputed.  A summary judgment


motion was denied on that issue, and so at this point I


imagine we're assuming arguendo.


QUESTION:  May I ask about a hypothetical that's


running through my mind.  Under your opponent's view, as I


understand it, it would be at least theoretically possible


that the job your client has occupied up to now, and he

wants to move because of his disability, would be the job


most people on the seniority list would want if it were


available, but they could nevertheless say they don't have


to accommodate.  Am I right on that?


MS. CENTER:  Could you ask it one more time? 


I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  It seems to me theoretically possible


that he is -- because of his disability, he's leaving a


job that is a very attractive job for a nondisabled


person, and that everybody on the seniority list, if given


the choice of jobs, would pick his job, that under your


opponent's view it would nevertheless -- they could


nevertheless refuse to accommodate him.


MS. CENTER:  That's correct, and my client, Mr.


Barnett's goal is not to get the plum job.  Mr. Barnett's


goal is to get a job that he can do despite his


disability, so the purpose is not to prefer the disabled


employee.  The purpose is to enabled the disabled employee


to retain employment and to accommodate their limitations.


QUESTION:  But it does have the effect of giving


a preference.  That whole list of reasonable


accommodations -- let's forget a seniority system.  One of


the accommodations is part-time.  Suppose somebody who has


an exhaustion problem, can't work a full day, and then


there's somebody else who says, but I'm a single mom, and

I've got children at home, and they don't have to


accommodate to me, I don't understand it.


Your answer is, well, there's a Federal law and


it doesn't protect you, but that would create the same


kind of friction in the workforce.  People feel that they 


have been disadvantaged for no just reason, so -- but all


those, what the statute lists as reasonable


accommodations, every one of those could adversely affect


someone who has in that person's view an equally good


reason to get the break.  It is a preference system.


MS. CENTER:  That's correct.  The petitioner


concedes that the reasonable accommodation mandate


requires employers to do certain things for disabled


employees that they may choose not to do for nondisabled


employees.


QUESTION:  Sure, but preferring one -- I mean,


giving someone a benefit that someone else doesn't get,


such as allowing them to do a certain job sitting down


when everybody else has to do it standing up, or what-


not, that doesn't disadvantage the others.  That doesn't


destroy any of their expectations when they took the job,


and the same thing with allowing somebody to work part-


time.  It doesn't help me any that somebody can work part-


time now.


Sure, I'm not allowed to do it, just as I'm not

allowed to do the job sitting down, but it doesn't hurt


me, whereas what happens here is that the person who had


an expectation of seniority entitlement to a certain job


has been frustrated in that expectation.  It seems to me


that's quite different.  I mean, we're not talking about


whether one employee can be preferred over another. 


Certainly, the disabled employee can be.


But the question is whether it's a reasonable


accommodation when it requires you to harm another


employee in that employee's job or in that employee's


legitimate expectations, and I think that's really what's


at issue here, whether it's just the employer that's going


to be inconvenienced by this statute, or other employees


as well.  Why isn't it reasonable to say you cannot


destroy the expectations of other employees?  What in the


statute shows that you can?


MS. CENTER:  Well, it's true that in certain


cases providing the reassignment to a vacant position ends


up giving a priority to the employee over a nondisabled


employee.  That can happen, but that's not the purpose of


the accommodation.  The purpose of the accommodation is to


enable the disabled employee to retain their employment,


which directly serves the vocational and the equality


goals of the act, and the reverse --


QUESTION:  Yes, but to the extent that you think

reasonable, the word reasonable and reasonable


accommodation requires what happens to other employees as


well as a result of the accommodation, then you have a


different question.  If you approach it the way you do,


that it refers only to what's reasonable for the disabled


person, that's different, so we have to decide what


reasonable accommodation really means, don't we?


MS. CENTER:  And if you do decide that


reasonable takes into account other employees, in this


case the equities really favor Mr. Barnett, because Mr.


Barnett is the one that faced job loss.  The person who


came in and bid on Mr. Barnett's job had no compelling


need for the job.  He was perfectly able to continue doing


his existing job, and Mr. Barnett, by contrast, because


the accommodation was denied, became inevitably


unemployed, so the equities will frequently favor the


disabled employee who faces job loss, even if you pull out


reasonable separately like that.


QUESTION:  I hate to belabor the point, Ms.


Center, but the more disabled employee, someone who's


severely disabled, if that person has to be accommodated


and we only have to look at that person's needs in making


our reasonableness determination, I don't understand why


your client can't be bumped if he were in that position.


MS. CENTER:  If you pulled out reasonable?

 QUESTION:  And only -- and you limited that


determination to the disabled person who has to be


accommodated.


MS. CENTER:  Well, if you pulled out reasonable


in that way, I think there'd be a difficulty arguing it


would be reasonable to disrupt another effective


accommodation that's already in place.  It might be


reasonable to do some other things --


QUESTION:  But that's -- then your argument is


only different in -- slightly from the argument that you


have to take into consideration the disruption that's


caused in others' lives when you disrupt the seniority


system.


MS. CENTER:  Well, I think that the disruption,


as we state in our brief, can be considered in the undue


hardship defense.  It's a detailed defense that's drafted


to consider all of these factors.


QUESTION:  Well, could we consider the


disruption to your client in the undue hardship category?


MS. CENTER:  No.  I think the disruption to my


client in the job loss is the harm that results from the


failure to accommodate.


QUESTION:  But aren't you saying that in the


case that Justice Thomas poses you do consider the


disruption to your client as well as the interest of the

more --


MS. CENTER:  Correct.  I misunderstood.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Then why don't you do that


across the board?  In other words, why doesn't -- why


shouldn't -- why don't you have to concede that


reasonableness always takes into consideration the


interest of other employees?


MS. CENTER:  Because I think that's contrary to


the structure of the statute.  I think it's contrary to


the description of reasonable accommodations.  It's


contrary to the regulations.


QUESTION:  Yes, but can you find any textual


basis in the statute that says when you're dealing with


comparative interests of two disabled people you consider


the interests of both in determining what is reasonable,


but when you're considering the comparative interests of a


disabled person and others, you don't consider both?


MS. CENTER:  I was --


QUESTION:  Is there any textual basis for that?


MS. CENTER:  Perhaps I'm still misunderstanding,


but I was answering the question assuming that my reading


of the statute was rejected and that we were looking at


equities in the word reasonable.


QUESTION:  I see.  You weren't conceding -- all


right, just for argument.

 MS. CENTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Do I misunderstand?  I thought you


had agreed earlier that it would never be reasonable to


bump another employee.


MS. CENTER:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Okay.  So you're always talking about


transfer to a vacant position.  I don't understand the


competition between two disabled persons.  Each of them


has to be given a vacant job.  If the job's already


filled, it doesn't matter whether it's filled by another


disabled person or by a perfectly healthy person.


MS. CENTER:  That's correct.  It will often, I


think, just be the chronology, who requests accommodation


first, who gets reassigned, and then you go on to the next


disabled employee if there is one and deal with their


accommodation.


QUESTION:  And the reason you can't bump another


employee is that that's unreasonable, is that --


MS. CENTER:  No.  The reason is that the


accommodation listed is reassignment to a vacant position,


and that vacant language was put in there to prevent


bumping an occupied position, bumping an individual.


QUESTION:  Well, if you -- what you've said,


you're making of this statute in this respect something


different from, in title VII, where you have past proven

discrimination, so the employer may have to give a remedy,


that remedy may adversely affect other people, and the


calculus that the Court has to make is, yes, they can be


hurt, but not too much, and isn't that exactly what is


going on here?


If we reject your client-centered interpretation


of reasonable, it's just the same thing. 


Nondiscrimination, this statute goes beyond


nondiscrimination.  It requires reasonable accommodation. 


What's reasonable?  Of course, you always have to take


into account the interests of other people.


MS. CENTER:  That's correct.  If we -- if the


Court rejects my view of the term, reasonable


accommodation, you'd have to take into account all of


those considerations, but you could not adopt, I don't


believe, the per se rule suggested by the petitioner that


neutral, you know, selection criteria are always going to


trump the ADA.


For example, your part-time working scenario,


that could be eliminated by a neutral rule that no one can


work less than full-time, so that can't be the rule.  If


it's reasonable, pulled out and looked at in the different


criteria, then it has to be case-by-case.  It can't simply


be deference to a neutral selection criteria.


QUESTION:  When I got the case by case, I look

at the record here, and it doesn't seem to me as if your


client wants to prove anything.  They'll accept what the


other side says about it as we discussed, and then we just


have to decide in this case, is that enough or not.  Is


that right?


MS. CENTER:  Well, I think there are a number of


items in the record that show that the actual disruption


to the employer, as well as the impact on other employees,


would have been extremely modest, and that retaining Mr.


Barnett in the job he'd been successfully performing for


years was -- would have been an entirely reasonable


accommodation, if you want to pull out reasonable.


QUESTION:  It's not a matter of proof.  We're at


the pretrial stage.

certainly sufficient evidence under Reeves for our client


to have a trial on that issue, should --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, III


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DELLINGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, when it comes


to filling positions, which is fundamentally different, I

think, than adding other elements, there's nothing


anomalous about a per se rule, nor is that inconsistent


with giving individualized considerations.  The rehab act


and title VII both said that you don't displace seniority


systems.


In Hardison v. TWA, this Court did not say you


have to ask whether the more senior employee's reason for


needing the Saturday off was either trivial or serious. 


When it comes to positions, there is a good reason for


letting the more senior employee choose the more desirable


position.  I don't think either the line managers or the


Ninth Circuit engaging in an individual case-by-case


assessment could possibly make that a workable system.


The notion that there's no one who's going to be


hurt reduces to this, that when the more senior employee


claims the position under the regular operation of the


statute, their response is to say, well, that more senior


employee can always go and be a cargo handler on the night


shift.  We don't know that.  We don't know if that would


work.


In effect what you're doing when you promote


somebody to a greater seniority priority is that you are


promoting, and we do know that however reasonable it might


be in a particular case, if you did an intensive case-by-


case thing to say, why don't we promote this person to the


49 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

secretarial supervisor, that itself is never required,


because we think that in a sense you're really going to


lose your way in trying to manage a company if you move


away from bedrock proposition that an employer is never


required to choose the less-qualified or the less-senior


person once they've made all the other accommodations. 


That would be a major social change.


There is an argument that someone who loses one


position because of a disability ought to have a priority


claim for another position even over someone who is more


qualified or more senior for it.  That would be a major


policy change that we -- for which there are arguments for


and against.  The Congress --
