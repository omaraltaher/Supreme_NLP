P R O C E E D I N G S 

(10:02 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE 

REHNQUIST: 

We'll hear 

argument 

now in 

No. 00-1089, 

Toyota Motor 

Manufacturing v. 

Ella 

Williams. 

Mr. Roberts. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The 

Sixth 

Circuit 

below 

held 

that 

the 

respondent, 

Ms. 

Williams, was 

substantially 

limited in 

performing manual tasks 

and therefore disabled 

under the 

Americans 

with 

Disabilities 

Act because 

she 

could not 

perform the manual tasks associated with her assembly line 

job, 

specifically 

gripping 

a 

sponge 

and 

repetitively 

wiping down 

cars with her arms 

at shoulder level 

for an 

extended period of time. 

That test for 

disability status was wrong. 

It 

was 

wrong 

because it 

is 

inconsistent with 

the statute 

which requires a 

substantial limitation 

on a major 

life 

activity. 

Repetitively wiping 

down 

cars with 

arms at 

shoulder 

level for an 

extended period 

of time is 

not a 

major life activity, 

and being 

limited in that 

activity 

does not 

constitute 

being substantially 

limited in 

the 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

major life activity of performing manual tasks in general. 

A plaintiff 

must show a 

substantial limitation 

in 

a broad range 

of manual 

tasks to meet 

the statutory 

standard. 

The most 

that 

the 

court 

of appeals 

could 

extrapolate 

was 

that 

Ms. 

Williams 

was 

substantially 

limited in the 

tasks associated 

with jobs that 

required 

gripping 

tools 

and 

repetitive 

activity 

with 

arms 

at 

shoulder level for an extended period of time. 

That is a 

specialized and 

idiosyncratic limitation. 

It 

is not 

a 

substantial limitation --

QUESTION: 

Mr. Roberts, can 

I just ask 

you at 

the outset, so you have plenty of time to comment, there's 

expert testimony, 

as I read the 

briefs, that --

on your 

opponent's side that she suffers 

a lack of access to 

the 

labor market of 

from 50 to 55 

percent of the 

jobs, both 

nationwide and in Kentucky. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

A 

number of 

things about 

that. 

First, that was not pertinent on the manual tasks inquiry. 

That 

was 

submitted 

under 

the 

major life 

activity 

of 

working in an effort 

to show a substantial limitation 

as 

to working. 

The district 

court rejected that limitation. 

The court of appeals did not reach it. 

The district court 

rejected it for a 

number of 

reasons. 

First, the 50 to 55 percent was based largely on 

the assumption 

that she -- she 

could not do 

medium duty

work, but 

as the 

evidence showed 

-- and 

I would 

point 

particularly to 

page 24 of Dr. Weikel's deposition -- she 

never established that 

she could do 

medium duty work 

in 

the first place 

and had never done medium duty work. 

And 

what Dr. Weikel said is, if 

you take out that loss --

in 

other words, 

the loss of eliminating medium 

duty work --

her loss 

of jobs 

goes down 

to 10 

to 15 percent, 

which 

would not be 

sufficient to show a 

substantial limitation 

in working. 

The district court also said 

that that evidence 

was not geographically specific 

enough. 

It was based 

on 

national 

figures 

and it 

was 

not narrowed 

down 

to the 

particular job 

market, so 

that the --

the evidence 

was 

properly rejected by the district 

court and never reached 

by the 

court of appeals because 

it was submitted 

on the 

working life activity and not the manual tasks. 

QUESTION: 

When you say it 

was rejected by the 

district 

court, you don't mean 

it was inadmissible. 

You 

mean it was given no weight by the district court. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

The district court 

considered it 

and said 

it was 

not probative 

of what 

it purported 

to 

show, a 

loss of access to the job 

market. 

She failed to 

-- to meet the test for working because she didn't show an 

exclusion from a 

class of jobs. 

All she 

showed was that 

some assembly line jobs were closed to her. 

That 

was the

main reason. 

The other 

reason was because the 

evidence that 

she showed wasn't probative of what 

it purported to show, 

again an issue that the court of appeals did not reach. 

What the 

court of 

appeals erred 

in doing 

was 

artificially narrowing the manual tasks 

inquiry. 

It said 

quite 

clearly 

it 

was adopting 

a 

class-based analysis. 

We're only 

going to look 

at the manual 

tasks associated 

with your job. 

QUESTION: 

Mr. Roberts, 

in 

the same 

vein as 

Justice 

Stevens' 

question, 

how 

does 

the 

worker's 

compensation notion of disability fit in? 

As I understand 

it, she was assessed as having a 20 percent -- what was it 

-- partial disability for worker's compensation 

purposes. 

So, 

that's 

another 

statutory scheme 

--  

uses 

the same 

concept, disability. 

MR. 

ROBERTS: 

But 

--  

but pursuant 

to 

very 

different 

standards. 

And 

there 

are 

two 

worker's 

compensation proceedings. 

The first one, before 

she was 

rotated into 

this new job, was 

the 20 percent 

that Your 

Honor referred to. 

The second 

one, she sought 

worker's 

compensation also after 

this one, and that was 

denied in 

-- in a denial affirmed by the Kentucky Supreme Court. 

But 

there 

are different 

standards. 

Worker's 

compensation is looking 

to very different things 

than --

than the Americans with Disabilities 

Act. 

And under 

the 

Americans 

with 

Disabilities 

Act, 

you 

have to 

show 

a 

substantial limitation on 

a major life activity. 

That's 

not the standard --

QUESTION: 

Well, 

why 

wouldn't 

20 

percent 

limitation 

--  

20 percent 

occupational 

impairment be 

a 

substantial limitation? 

MR. 

ROBERTS: 

Well, 

first of 

all, it 

may be 

pertinent 

if the standards were 

the same, but only under 

the working category. 

The worker's compensation system is 

looking to 

impact on work. 

The court of appeals analysis 

was 

under 

the 

performing manual 

tasks 

category. 

But 

again --

QUESTION: 

Why 

did the 

court of appeals 

avoid 

addressing the 

work approach? 

Was it 

because it thought 

this Court had rejected that? 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Well, a 

couple of 

reasons. 

My 

brother, 

the 

respondent's 

counsel, 

represented to 

the 

Sixth 

Circuit 

that 

the 

strongest 

claim 

was 

under 

performing 

manual 

tasks 

and not 

under 

working, 

and a 

recent Sixth Circuit 

precedent, the 

McKay case, I 

think 

made 

it 

quite 

clear 

that 

she 

would 

not 

qualify 

as 

substantially 

limited 

in 

the 

major 

life 

activity 

of 

working. 

QUESTION: 

Should we address that, or because it

was not addressed below, leave that alone? 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Well, 

I think 

the more 

typical 

approach would be not 

to address the major 

life activity 

of working 

since it 

was not addressed 

below, except 

to 

this 

extent. 

The 

major 

problem 

with what 

the 

Sixth 

Circuit did in looking only at the manual tasks associated 

with working replicates, 

under that category, all 

of the 

problems 

that 

this 

Court 

has 

noted or 

the 

concerns, 

rather, 

that this 

Court has 

noted with 

respect 

to the 

major life activity of working. 

The test is circular. 

QUESTION: 

In --

in looking 

at a 

substantial 

limitation, 

do 

we focus 

on the 

things that 

the person 

cannot do 

or the things they still can 

do or both? 

What 

do we do? 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Certainly with respect 

to manual 

tasks, you have to look 

at both because it's not 

enough, 

obviously, to say there's one 

particular manual task that 

I can't do. 

That wouldn't show a substantial limitation, 

and that particular manual task 

is probably not going 

to 

be a 

major life activity. 

So, you 

have to look 

at the 

broad range. 

And 

that 

is what 

the 

courts of 

appeals have 

done. 

They've taken a list of everyday manual tasks that 

we all perform 

and said, well, 

where does the 

plaintiff 

fall in 

this -- in this --

against this list of everyday 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

tasks? 

The Sixth Circuit did 

not do that. 

They looked 

just at the work-related activities. 

When you do that, the record is quite clear that 

Ms. Williams can do a broad 

range of manual tasks. 

With 

respect to personal hygiene, she can brush her teeth, wash 

her 

face, 

bathe. 

With 

respect to 

everyday activities 

around the house, 

the record 

shows she makes 

breakfast, 

can cook, laundry, pick up and organize around 

the house. 

And, of course, 

what the 

district court, in 

particular, 

found 

most compelling, she 

can do assembly 

line work at 

the Toyota plant. 

QUESTION: 

Mr. Roberts, 

may I just stop 

you on 

something you just said? 

I thought the Sixth Circuit said 

in 

its 

opinion 

that 

it 

had 

considered 

recreation, 

household chores, living 

generally, as well as 

the work-

related impairments. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

A very important sentence 

that I 

think has to be 

read carefully. 

In 

the first place, 

it 

doesn't say that we've looked at the record and considered 

those. 

It was a 

generic assumption. 

The assumption 

is, 

well, if she can't do 

this assembly line work, that 

must 

affect other areas, recreation and household chores. 

A generic assumption like 

that is wrong, first, 

because 

the 

ADA 

specifies 

you 

have 

to 

look 

at 

the 

individual impacts; second, 

because the impairments we're

talking 

about, 

myotendinitis 

and that 

sort 

of 

thing, 

affect different 

people in 

widely different 

ways. 

You 

can't 

assume, 

just 

because 

someone 

cannot 

do 

the 

repetitive 

work 

for 

an extended 

period 

of 

time, that 

that's going to have an effect. 

Of course --

QUESTION: 

You can assume 

that, though, in some 

cases, couldn't you? 

I mean, you're not -- if -- suppose 

a person says I cannot 

be a watchmaker and the reason 

he 

can't is he's blind. 

That would be the end 

of the case, 

wouldn't it? 

I mean, it would be clear he's disabled. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Certainly. 

QUESTION: 

Even 

though 

he 

only 

mentioned 

watchmaking. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Certainly. 

QUESTION: 

All right. 

So, why can't this 

woman 

here say I cannot lift more than 

20 pounds ever, I cannot 

lift more 

than 10 pounds 

frequently? 

I cannot 

perform 

repetitive motions with both hands over an extended period 

of 

time, and I 

cannot work with my 

hands above my head. 

Now, that's the problem. 

Now, in addition, that --

I'll 

tell you that makes 

me too -- it makes it 

hard for me to 

find a job. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Well --

QUESTION: 

But 

it's 

--   

it's 

really 

the 

disability 

that 

we're 

focusing 

on, 

and

circumstances someone like that would be able not only not 

to perform the 

job but also not to do the things that the 

judge said below, 

a reasonable inference from 

the nature 

of the disability. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

First, 

because that 

type of 

an 

inference is contradicted by the 

record. 

She says I 

can 

do other assembly line work, 

including work that involves 

manual tasks. 

The record 

shows she 

can 

take care 

of 

personal hygiene. 

She 

can do 

chores around the 

house. 

The inference would be -- it's contradicted by the record. 

Second, the 

type 

of manual 

task 

that 

you're 

looking at 

-- the 

problem is 

no one 

suggests that 

she 

can't use 

a sponge and wipe down the 

side of a car. 

The 

problem is 

with the repetitive aspect of it, doing it for 

an 

extended period of 

time. 

The only setting 

in which 

someone would have to do that is 

in an assembly line job, 

and therefore, if 

anything, the -- the 

disability should 

be 

analyzed under the major 

life activity of working, if 

that is a major life activity. 

QUESTION: 

Why -- that's 

what I -- my --

until 

you said 

the last part, my 

thought was, well, we 

need a 

trial on this. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Oh, no. 

QUESTION: 

How serious is this disability? 

What 

does it 

disqualify her from doing? 

But 

do we have to go

on to categorize between 

whether it's working, gardening, 

what is a major life activity? 

I mean, isn't it just 

is 

this person 

hurt badly enough that there are an awful lot 

of things that she can't do? 

MR. ROBERTS: 

No, no. 

The statute sets forth a 

standard, substantial limitation on a major life activity. 

Therefore, the way the cases have been tried, you identify 

a major life activity. 

QUESTION: 

That's the 

part that's bothering me. 

You're 

absolutely right. 

And what 

I wonder 

is whether 

this statute intends the courts to be so rigid 

as to say, 

well, you've got 

to get 

into an 

argument about 

whether 

it's 

working, gardening, this or that or the other thing, 

or to use a more 

broad, general judgment, is this 

person 

incapable of doing a lot of things that people do in life. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Well, first of all, 

with respect 

to working, it is important I think to identify what major 

life activity you're talking about because as the EEOC has 

recognized 

in 

its 

regulations, 

as 

this 

Court 

has 

indicated, there 

are all sorts 

of problems when 

you say 

working 

is 

a major 

life 

activity. 

The 

problems are, 

first, that it's completely circular. 

The -- the need for 

an accommodation establishes the entitlement to it if your 

life activity 

is working. 

That's not 

how the 

statute 

should work. 

It should work by 

identifying a disability

and then seeing if it can be accommodated. 

Working is 

also unusual in the sense that it is 

not the individual's physical characteristics or condition 

that are primarily significant in deciding whether there's 

a disability, but the demands 

of the job. 

That's 

unlike 

the other major life activities 

that Congress was talking 

about, seeing, hearing, breathing, walking. 

Working -- it 

suddenly 

becomes 

not only 

circular, 

but it 

looks like 

you're talking more about the job than the individual. 

That's why I do think 

it is important to --

to 

draw a 

distinction, and what the court of appeals did, of 

course, 

was look at 

manual tasks 

but then say 

only the 

manual tasks associated with work. 

And with respect again to the record, the record 

shows 

that Ms. Williams 

can do 

a broad range 

of manual 

tasks. 

When you compare the approach here to the approach 

of the 

other courts of 

appeals, the Eleventh 

Circuit in 

cases 

that 

we've 

discussed 

in 

our brief, 

Chanda 

and 

Hillburn, or the Fifth Circuit 

in Dutcher. 

This 

doesn't 

come 

close. 

She 

can 

do 

a 

broad 

range 

of 

manual 

activities. 

Yes --

QUESTION: 

Well, 

Mr. 

Roberts, 

can 

I 

just 

interrupt again? 

I -- you've explained by the 50 percent 

figure is 

-- is wrong. 

But 

assume for the 

moment that 

there were -- she was 

disabled from performing 50 percent

of 

the job opportunities 

available in the 

State, and in 

addition, there were a random 

number of additional things 

like playing tennis 

and playing 

the piano 

and so 

forth 

that she could not do. 

Would 

it still not be -- would it 

be impermissible to 

analyze this as the 

disability being 

inability to 

use the hands like 

most people can 

and the 

major part of the evidence relates to work, but then there 

are these other things she also cannot do? 

Does she have 

to 

have the other 

things --

you have to 

separate them. 

Can't you look at the two together? 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Yes, you can, and -- and certainly 

in a manual tasks case, 

you can submit evidence and 

say, 

here's 

an example of 

manual tasks that 

I can't perform, 

the ones that are required at work. 

There's nothing wrong 

with that. 

The problem is in artificially limiting it to it 

and looking only at the manual tasks associated with work. 

That's not enough. 

But yes, it certainly could be part of 

her case that I can't do this job at work. 

But there 

has 

to 

be 

more 

because 

otherwise 

she 

hasn't 

shown 

a 

substantial 

limitation on 

the 

major 

life 

activity 

of 

performing manual tasks. 

QUESTION: 

Is it 

-- is 

it your 

view that 

by 

including the non-work 

impairment that she has, 

you sort 

of increase 

the 

universe of 

things she 

has 

to --

you

compare it to, and therefore, there's a smaller percentage 

of an impairment, and therefore, it's not substantial? 

MR. ROBERTS: 

If the 

claim is 

I'm limited 

in 

manual tasks, you 

do have to look, 

and this is 

what all 

the other 

courts of appeals have done, the broad range of 

manual tasks. 

It's not enough, obviously, at one 

extreme 

if there's a peculiar 

task that you can't do, but you can 

do everything else. 

QUESTION: 

What you're objecting to particularly 

I 

suppose is the 

sentence of 

the court's 

opinion which 

says 

the fact 

that 

Williams 

can 

perform 

a 

range 

of 

isolated, 

non-repetitive 

manual tasks 

performed 

over a 

short 

period of 

time, such 

as 

tending to 

her personal 

hygiene or carrying out personal or household chores, does 

not 

affect 

a 

determination 

that 

her 

impairment 

substantially limits her 

ability to perform the 

range of 

manual tasks associated with an assembly line job. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

That's right. 

QUESTION: 

In 

other 

words, 

it 

made 

that 

criterion of whether she's -- she's substantially limited. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

That's wrong. 

In 

that sentence, 

the 

court of 

appeals 

said, okay, 

you can 

do a 

lot of 

things, but 

you can't do the 

assembly line job, 

and not 

being able to 

do the assembly line job is 

enough for us. 

And that was what was wrong with the court of appeals --

QUESTION: 

So, 

the nub 

of it 

is 

the --

the 

limitation to considering one job; 

i.e., an assembly line 

job. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

With respect to working --

QUESTION: 

That 

if 

--  

if 

there 

was 

one 

overriding 

sin, that 

was 

it, 

wasn't 

it? 

Instead 

of 

considering a range 

of jobs 

-- I'm sorry 

-- a class 

of 

jobs --

MR. ROBERTS: 

If -- if they're going to look at 

it under 

manual tasks, you've got 

to look at 

all manual 

tasks. 

QUESTION: 

Yes. 

MR. 

ROBERTS: 

If you're 

going 

to look 

at it 

under working, 

you've got to look at 

either a class or a 

broad range of jobs. 

QUESTION: 

I was going to say if you're doing it 

under --

under the major 

life activity of 

manual tasks, 

you wouldn't just look at jobs. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Not just 

jobs. 

It has to be 

the 

broad range. 

And typically what the courts have done --

QUESTION: 

Yes, but 

it 

-- I 

didn't 

mean to 

interrupt you. 

I was going to say, but if --

assume they 

start out, our category is 

going to be manual tasks, 

and 

they had 

come up 

with 100 

jobs in 

which she 

could not 

perform manual tasks, would that not have satisfied the --

the required inquiry under -- under manual tasks? 

MR. ROBERTS: 

I would 

still need to 

know what 

about 

everyday 

activities. 

Maybe 

the 

jobs 

involved 

specialized, idiosyncratic manual tasks. 

Can she --

QUESTION: 

Yes, but 

at this 

point, aren't 

we 

getting sort of academic about 

it? 

If somebody --

let's 

assume the category is manual tasks, but they identify 100 

jobs which she -- I mean, a great range of things that she 

can't do. 

Isn't it a little unrealistic to say, well, she 

might 

be able to 

vacuum the floor 

at home? 

I mean, at 

that point, 

you've made a 

pretty good prima 

facie case, 

haven't you? 

MR. ROBERTS: 

The 

-- the 

evidence then 

would 

probably 

not 

be 

that 

she 

can 

take 

care 

of 

herself 

generally. 

She can cook. 

She can do laundry. 

She can --

as the evidence is in this case. 

QUESTION: 

No. 

But 

the question that 

he's --

what if 

the 

evidence did 

show she 

could 

do all 

these 

things? 

MR. 

ROBERTS: 

Then 

it would 

seem to me 

to be 

properly analyzed as 

a working 

case. 

That's where 

her 

problem 

is, according to the -- this unusual record we've 

hypothesized, only 

a problem at work. 

Then look at it as 

a working case. 

If it's a manual task case, 

you have to 

look at the broad range of manual tasks.

QUESTION: 

Very well, Mr. Roberts. 

Ms. McDowell, we'll hear from you. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 

MS. McDOWELL: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

We 

agree 

that 

the Sixth 

Circuit 

applied 

an 

incorrect 

test 

in 

determining 

whether 

a 

person 

is 

substantially 

limited 

in 

the 

major 

life 

activity 

of 

performing manual tasks. 

The 

correct 

test 

asks 

whether 

a 

person 

is 

significantly restricted relative to the average person in 

performing those basic 

manual tasks 

that are central 

to 

everyday 

life, 

tasks 

such 

as 

grasping 

objects, 

manipulating objects, 

holding objects. 

That 

inquiry is 

indicated by the statutory focus on substantial limits and 

major life activities. 

The Sixth Circuit's approach, which focuses only 

on 

a 

plaintiff's ability 

to 

perform particular 

manual 

tasks required by a specific 

job, seems to us both 

over-

inclusive and under-inclusive. 

First, the Sixth Circuit's approach would extend 

the 

protections 

of 

the 

act 

to 

persons 

who 

are 

substantially limited only in performing a particular job,

not in everyday life and not in performing a range of jobs 

or 

a class of 

jobs. 

That approach would 

undermine the 

established test for establishing a substantial limitation 

based on the major life 

activity of working. 

That 

test, 

as the Court recognized in 

Sutton, requires the plaintiff 

to show that she's substantially 

limited in a class or 

a 

range of jobs. 

QUESTION: 

Ms. McDowell, I didn't think that the 

Sixth Circuit had said 

we're looking only at one 

job. 

I 

thought they were looking at assembly line work as a broad 

category of jobs. 

MS. 

McDOWELL: 

No, we 

don't 

think 

so, Your 

Honor. 

And I would refer you to 

page 4a of the petition 

appendix where 

the court 

is engaging 

its analysis. 

It 

refers to certain types of manual assembly line jobs 

that 

require the 

gripping of 

tools and 

repetitive work 

with 

hands and 

arms extended out 

or above shoulder 

level for 

extended periods of time. 

So, it appears that the 

Sixth 

Circuit was focusing on a 

particular category of assembly 

line jobs and not assembly line jobs generally. 

QUESTION: 

Types. 

It 

uses the plural. 

So, 

it 

wasn't 

just talking about a particular job, which is what 

I 

thought you 

reduced this to, 

and I think 

that is not 

quite a fair characterization of what the court said. 

MS. McDOWELL: 

That may 

be 

correct, 

Justice

Ginsburg. 

It may be 

that the Sixth Circuit was 

thinking 

about 

categories 

of 

jobs 

that 

would 

require 

these 

particular limits. 

There is no 

indication in the record, 

though, of 

how many 

other assembly line 

jobs there 

are 

that would 

-- the 

plaintiff would 

be disqualified 

from 

performing. 

QUESTION: 

It refers to painting, plumbing, and 

roofing, et cetera. 

MS. McDOWELL: 

That's correct. 

And that appears 

to be an 

assumption by the court of appeals. 

There does 

not appear, at least 

from our examination of what 

record 

has been presented to this 

Court, any specific discussion 

of building trades, 

plumbing, roofing, 

et cetera in 

the 

record. 

QUESTION: 

I suppose 

it's perfectly 

obvious a 

person 

who 

can't 

raise their 

hands 

above 

heart level 

couldn't paint the ceiling at least. 

MS. McDOWELL: 

That may 

well be correct, 

Your 

Honor. 

The analysis, if one --

QUESTION: 

She'd 

have 

to 

paint 

floors 

presumably. 

Right? 

(Laughter.) 

QUESTION: 

And most painters 

are not limited to 

just painting floors, I don't think. 

MS. McDOWELL: 

That's correct.

And if one 

is focusing on limitations 

in work, 

the 

correct 

analysis 

is 

whether 

a 

plaintiff 

is 

disqualified 

from 

a 

class of 

jobs, 

jobs 

that require 

similar training, abilities, skills, et cetera, or a range 

of jobs, 

jobs that 

do not 

necessarily require 

the same 

skills and 

training, but 

jobs that 

the plaintiff 

could 

perform. 

We have no 

position at 

this point whether 

the 

plaintiff in this case could 

or couldn't demonstrate that 

she is substantially 

disabled under the working 

test the 

court --

QUESTION: 

Under 

the working test, do 

you just 

look at the whole scope of 

jobs, or isn't it just limited 

to 

jobs that 

this 

person is 

--  

has some 

demonstrated 

capacity for or interest in? 

I 

mean, you know, what if I 

can't 

be a 

-- you 

know, 

a jet 

pilot? 

You 

know, I'm 

disabled from being a 

jet pilot. 

I have no interest 

in 

being a jet pilot. 

My other abilities would not -- would 

not enable 

me to be 

a jet pilot 

anyway. 

Is 

-- is that 

irrelevant to the -- to working inquiry? 

MS. McDOWELL: 

No, it's not irrelevant, Justice 

Scalia. 

The 

analysis focuses 

on 

those jobs 

that 

the 

plaintiff, without 

her impairment, would have 

the skills 

and ability to perform. 

QUESTION: 

Right. 

And had 

she been 

a roofer

MS. McDOWELL:

QUESTION: 

I didn't think so. 

QUESTION: 

Under 

the Longshore 

Harbor Workers 

and Compensation Act, 

the courts 

routinely look at 

what 

jobs are in the community that this person is eligible for 

after they've 

suffered an injury. 

Is that about the same 

approach that we should use in this case -- in these kinds 

of cases --

MS. McDOWELL: 

I'm not 

entirely familiar 

with 

the statutory --

QUESTION: 

-- when we're looking 

at the -- when 

we're looking at the employment aspect? 

MS. McDOWELL: 

Yes. 

I'm not 

entirely familiar 

with the 

specific statutory 

scheme you're 

referring to, 

but it 

may be similar to 

that under the 

Social Security 

Act 

which 

looks 

at 

whether 

somebody can 

perform 

any 

gainful 

activity 

in 

the 

national 

economy, 

and 

the 

Disabilities Act 

doesn't require that 

broad a 

standard. 

It 

looks 

at 

-- in 

a 

more 

limited 

way at 

whether 

a 

plaintiff 

is 

substantially limited 

in 

performing jobs. 

There 

still 

may 

be 

jobs that 

she 

can 

perform. 

The 

question is whether there is a substantial limitation that 

would disqualify her from a --

manual 

task 

approach, 

how 

-- how 

is 

the 

fact finder 

supposed 

to decide 

which manual 

tasks are 

sufficiently 

important to constitute a substantial 

limitation? 

How do 

you 

weigh that? 

How 

do 

we decide 

it? 

Is 

there any 

guidance on that? 

MS. McDOWELL: 

The courts 

of appeals thus 

far 

have looked at -- aside from the Sixth Circuit, of course, 

have looked 

to 

those 

manual 

tasks that 

are 

basic 

to 

everyday life. 

We would say, perhaps in some disagreement 

with Toyota, that 

it's not necessary to 

be substantially 

impaired 

in a broad range of 

manual tasks. 

There may be 

certain manual 

tasks that are 

particularly important 

to 

everyday life, 

such 

as the 

ability to 

grasp 

a pen 

or 

pencil and write, that in 

themselves may be sufficient to 

constitute a -- a substantial limitation on the major life 

activity. 

QUESTION: 

On -- on a question like substantial, 

certainly you 

would get to a jury question at some point, 

wouldn't you? 

MS. McDOWELL: 

Oh, certainly it would 

become a 

jury question in many cases. 

QUESTION: 

Conceptually it 

seems to work better 

your --

your way. 

You 

say life activity 

is just 

like 

lifting 

or 

breathing, 

and 

the 

issue turns 

on 

what's 

substantial. 

What do we do about the EEOC regs 

that seem

to 

embody 

what you 

would 

call a 

conceptual confusion? 

They talk about working being a substantial life activity, 

that working shouldn't be there. 

It should be evidentiary 

of whether 

the -- of whether the impairment of being able 

to lift your hands is 

substantial, and if you can't 

hold 

half the jobs, that's fairly good evidence. 

And if you --

you know, whether it's enough or not, I don't know. 

But what do we do about the EEOC regs that don't 

seem to take the simple conceptual way you're advocating? 

MS. 

McDOWELL: 

The 

EEOC 

regs 

that 

you're 

referring to discuss the major life activity of working. 

QUESTION: 

Yes, that wrecks it. 

MS. 

McDOWELL: 

The 

regs 

also recognize 

that 

performing manual tasks is a separate major life activity. 

QUESTION: 

I know. 

I know, 

but they're taking 

the wrong 

-- they're 

taking the 

wrong approach 

in your 

view. 

So, 

whereas I find your view much simpler -- and I 

agree with you, it isn't any harsher or more lenient, just 

simpler. 

What do we do about the fact that the 

agency in 

charge seems not to have taken that route? 

MS. 

McDOWELL: 

I 

believe 

this 

route 

is 

consistent 

with what 

the agency 

has said, 

specifically 

that one should consider working 

as a major life activity 

only if 

a plaintiff cannot satisfy any of the other major 

life activities, including performing manual tasks.

May I ask you 

one question? 

Is it 

relevant that she may not be able to perform a lot of jobs 

she never performed? 

For example, is it relevant that she

may not, and

that 

we have 

a 

position on 

that 

at this 

point, 

Justice 

Stevens.

to 

come forward 

with 

evidence that 

a plaintiff 

couldn't perform, for 

example, in 

this case medium 

duty 

work. 

The mere fact that she hadn't done it --

QUESTION: 

But you don't -- you don't suggest we 

just look at 

her employment history 

and that's the 

only 

possible 

thing 

we 

look at 

in 

determining 

whether her 

working ability has been impaired. 

MS. McDOWELL: 

No, I don't think 

you look only 

at the plaintiff's working history. 

QUESTION: 

It 

would be 

relevant then that 

she 

couldn't be a roofer, electrician, 

or a painter or a 

lot 

of other things. 

MS. McDOWELL: 

It 

may well be relevant. 

There 

may also 

be countervailing 

evidence that 

she had 

other 

lack of 

skills 

and so 

on that 

would 

prevent her 

from 

performing those particular jobs. 

I'd also like 

to note that the 

Sixth Circuit's 

approach not only is over-inclusive 

in some respects, but

it's also under-inclusive in some respects. 

It would seem 

to preclude a plaintiff from 

establishing a disability in 

the 

performance 

of manual 

tasks 

based on 

manual tasks 

performed 

outside 

the work 

place. 

In 

many cases, 

a 

plaintiff may be capable of performing manual tasks in the 

work 

place, 

when 

the 

work 

place 

does 

not 

impose 

particularly 

demanding obligations 

in 

that regard, 

but 

still may be limited outside the work place. 

QUESTION: 

To 

what extent do we take account of 

the particular individual? 

For example, for 

someone who 

is 

making a 

high 

income as 

a 

corporate executive, 

it 

wouldn't matter that 

she couldn't vacuum the 

rug because 

she has paid someone else to do that for many years. 

So, 

to what 

extent do we -- are 

we thinking of a generalized 

person to 

what extent 

the particular 

individual who 

is 

claiming to be disabled? 

MS. McDOWELL: 

May I answer, Your Honor? 

QUESTION: 

Yes. 

MS. 

McDOWELL: 

In focusing 

on 

a 

major life 

activity of 

manual tasks, we would suggest looking at the 

generalized 

person. 

With respect 

to 

working, 

it's a 

somewhat more tailored analysis. 

QUESTION: 

Thank you. 

Thank you, Ms. McDowell. 

Mr. Rosenbaum, we'll hear from you.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may 

it 

please the Court: 

This case is not about 

the inability to perform 

a single job. 

The Sixth Circuit 

did not rest its opinion 

upon 

a finding 

that 

Ms. 

Williams 

was only 

unable 

to 

perform one 

solitary job. 

While I believe that there are 

inconsistencies in the Sixth 

Circuit opinion which cannot 

be reconciled 

and while I disagree with part of the legal 

analysis for reasons 

other than 

the reasons advanced 

by 

petitioner, it's not a single job case. 

The Sixth Circuit stated at 6a of the opinion of 

the 

appendix 

to the 

petition, 

here the 

impairments of 

limbs are sufficiently 

severe to be like 

deformed limbs, 

and such 

activities affect 

manual tasks 

associated with 

working, 

as 

well 

as 

manual 

tasks 

associated 

with 

recreation, household chores, and living generally. 

QUESTION: 

Mr. Rosenbaum, so far as the question 

presented here is, 

you would 

defend the Sixth 

Circuit's 

opinion? 

Justice. 

it I do. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

I defend the result, 

Mr. Chief 

QUESTION: 

But not the reasoning? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Not in its entirety, but part of

QUESTION: 

Well, where do you disagree? 

MR. 

ROSENBAUM: 

I 

disagree 

when 

the 

Sixth 

Circuit says 

that after 

you determine 

an individual 

is 

substantially 

limited, 

you 

must 

go 

farther 

and 

that 

individual must 

show that their 

limitation affects their 

work. 

And I think that that is the additional requirement 

that the Sixth Circuit would place on defining substantial 

limitation. 

I think it's, 

at best, superfluous 

and, at 

worst, makes every disability a working disability. 

But the Sixth Circuit --

I must defend them 

to 

some extent. 

They quoted the correct statute. 

QUESTION: 

Well, 

they 

ruled for 

your client. 

Yes. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Well, then I -- yes, sir, and I 

appreciated that. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

At 

-- at 

3a of the 

appendix, 

they cite the correct statutory 

language. 

They emphasize 

that the impairment 

must substantially limit. 

They know 

what the 

law is. 

They specifically refer to this Court's 

opinion 

in Sutton and 

says you can't 

prove a disability 

based upon a failure to do one particular job. 

QUESTION: 

Well, 

do 

you 

think 

a --

a 

fair 

reading 

of 

the opinion 

in 

the --

at 

the 

end of 

the

carryover 

paragraph 

at 

4a, it 

says, 

it 

would appear, 

nevertheless, from 

the language 

of the 

act, the 

EEOC's 

interpretation of the 

Supreme Court 

analysis in 

Sutton, 

that in order to be disabled, the plaintiff must show that 

her 

manual 

disability 

involves 

a 

class 

of 

manual 

activities affecting the ability to perform tasks at work. 

You want 

us to read that as saying 

to perform tasks at a 

class 

of 

work 

activities, 

at 

a 

broad 

range of 

work 

activities. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Your Honor --

QUESTION: 

I -- I think --

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

I'm sorry. 

QUESTION: 

--  

you want us to interpret 

it that 

way and that 

we have to interpret it that way in order to 

save it, don't we? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Your 

Honor, I 

would say 

that 

that sentence --

QUESTION: 

-- come close to saving it. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

-- that sentence has no place in 

the analysis 

at all. 

That's what's superfluous about the 

Sixth Circuit analysis. 

QUESTION: 

Okay. 

So, I'll 

x that out 

of the 

opinion then. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

That's correct.

QUESTION: 

I though 

that was the 

heart of the 

opinion. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Well, it is not, Your Honor. 

QUESTION: 

It's x'ed out now. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

The -- the Sixth 

Circuit found 

that 

she 

has 

the impairment, 

myotendinitis, 

myofacial 

pain, 

carpal 

tunnel 

syndrome. 

They 

found 

that 

she 

identified the major life activity of working -- excuse me 

-- of 

manual tasks. 

And 

then they 

found that 

she was 

substantially 

limited 

in 

performing 

the 

major 

life 

activity of 

manual tasks because 

of the 

uncontroverted, 

uncontradicted evidence as to how this affected her life. 

And they should have stopped there. 

It was when 

they went on, apparently out of some kind of concern about 

Sutton, that I think they lost their way, and I think that 

this concept of class probably only fits into 

an analysis 

of the major life activity of working. 

If you 

look at the 

regulations involving this, 

which are 

in the petitioner's brief on the merits at 19a, 

subparagraph number 2, it 

says with respect to 

the major 

life 

activity 

of 

working, 

substantially 

limits 

means 

significantly restricted in the 

ability to perform either 

a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs. 

I would suggest 

to you this only has to do with working. 

It 

doesn't have

to do with 

manual tasks. 

Manual 

tasks is at the 

top of 

page 19a. 

And 

really, 

in 

formulating 

what the 

correct 

analysis of 

substantial limitation 

under the 

ADA is, 

I 

think the question is 

obvious. 

It is spelled out 

in the 

regulation. 

No 

party to 

this proceeding challenges 

the 

regulations, 

says that 

the Equal 

Employment Opportunity 

Commission 

didn't 

have 

authority 

to 

promulgate 

the 

regulations. 

Everyone 

agrees that 

the regulations 

are 

valid, and 

in past cases in -- in that circumstance, this 

Court 

has 

been willing 

to 

accept those 

regulations as 

valid. 

And 

the 

regulations 

say 

what 

substantially 

limited 

means. 

It means 

that 

they 

are significantly 

restricted as to the condition, manner, or duration --

or 

-- that is disjunctive, not 

conjunctive -- under which an 

individual can perform a particular major life activity as 

compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which 

the 

average 

person 

in 

the 

general 

population 

can 

perform --

QUESTION: 

Yes, 

a 

particular 

major 

life 

activity, not a single major 

-- not a single manual 

task 

and 

not a 

limited number 

of manual 

tasks. 

But 

it is 

disjunctive, either the 

duration or the --

the severity, 

whatever. 

But of 

the major 

life activity. 

So, you're

talking about 

a 

person who 

cannot 

perform for 

a 

long 

duration substantial -- substantially can't perform manual 

tasks. 

And -- and 

the evidence here didn't support 

that 

except for -- except for 

certain manual tasks done for 

a 

long period above shoulder level. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Your Honor, I would respectfully 

differ 

with you. 

I think the 

record is to the contrary. 

I 

would point out 

to you 

the restrictions found 

in the 

joint 

appendix at, I think, 

page 45. 

These restrictions 

were permanent in nature. 

They existed since May of 1992. 

Justice 

Breyer referred to 

them a 

moment ago. 

I don't 

want to 

be unduly repetitive about this, but it said that 

she cannot repetitively flex or extend her wrists, flex or 

extend her elbows. 

She can't use her arms. 

She can't use 

her shoulders 

repetitively. 

She can't pick 

up more than 

20 pounds ever. 

She can only regularly pick up 10 pounds, 

and she 

can't use vibratory or pneumatic type tools. 

And 

a 

vibratory --

or appliance, 

I presume 

--  

a vibratory 

appliance would 

be a vacuum cleaner, a hair drier, a hand 

mixer. 

It's not that she wants to maintain that on each 

individual 

thing 

such 

as 

gardening, 

getting 

dressed, 

playing with 

her children, 

picking up 

a grandchild 

who 

weighs -- weighs 

more than 20 -- 20 pounds, 

that she has 

got 

to prove 

she's substantially 

limited as 

to all 

of

that, it's 

that she 

has the 

generic overall 

limitation 

which manifests itself 

in these 

specific examples. 

And 

when --

QUESTION: 

So, that's -- that's what I'd like to 

know how to deal with 

exactly. 

My impression, which 

may 

be yours, is that the simplest thing to say is the 

words, 

major life 

activity, refer 

really to 

the nature 

of the 

disability. 

For example, use of hands. 

A person who has 

torticollis, for 

example, would 

be restricted 

in moving 

his neck, 

and that interferes with 

lots of things. 

But 

you don't 

necessarily have to 

pin down one. 

You say it 

interferes with dealing with other 

people. 

It interferes 

with working around the house. 

It interferes with holding 

a job. 

It interferes with all of them. 

Then the issue becomes whether it's substantial. 

And all of 

these work-related things that 

you're talking 

to 

are 

evidentiary 

in 

respect 

to 

the 

question 

of 

substantiality. 

Is that the right framework? 

And if so, 

how do we get there? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

I think we are there. 

QUESTION: 

We are there. 

Good. 

Well, what about -- so, then I saw the EEOC reg, 

which talks 

about the major -- the major life activity of 

working, and 

that would be a category 

mistake because it 

isn't --

there isn't 

a major 

life activity 

of working.

What 

happens 

at 

work 

is 

evidentiary 

of 

whether 

the 

restriction 

on 

moving 

your 

hands 

is 

a 

substantial 

restriction. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

I would submit it's 

a question 

of substantiality 

always, that you're 

correct in stating 

that the degree 

of impairment and 

the definition of 

the 

major life activity are inevitably 

linked together in the 

analysis. 

But what this Court 

I hope will do is to 

give 

guidance 

and 

clarification 

as to 

how 

substantial 

the 

limitation has to be before it is a substantial limitation 

under the Americans with Disabilities Act, that this Court 

will 

view 

the 

regulations, 

which 

are 

uncontroverted, 

uncontradicted, not questioned, and will say that this, at 

least 

in this 

case 

certainly, is 

the 

standard of 

how 

substantial it is. 

QUESTION: 

Do 

you think 

we 

should 

say that 

working is a major life activity? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

It is my opinion that working is 

a major life activity. 

It is a 

major life activity which 

is separate 

from performing manual 

tasks, and we 

are in 

agreement in this case that, as 

regards the separate life 

activity 

--  

major 

life activity 

of 

performing 

manual 

tasks, we can consider how that affects work. 

QUESTION: 

It's a 

little 

hard to 

think of 

a 

disability that affects a broad 

range of employment tasks

that doesn't affect other areas of life. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Well, of course. 

QUESTION: 

I -- I can't -- and as Justice Breyer 

said, 

these are evidentiary 

matters that go 

to a larger 

point. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Well, that's why Ms. Williams --

QUESTION: 

But the statute does talk about major 

life activity. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

That's why this -- Ms. Williams' 

case is a strong case. 

QUESTION: 

But the Sixth Circuit did not rely on 

working being a major life activity. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

They 

never 

got there 

because 

they had 

already found Ms. Williams 

to be disabled 

as a 

matter 

of law and 

hence it 

was unnecessary to 

find her 

disabled. 

QUESTION: 

As 

a --

as a 

matter 

of law, 

Mr. 

Rosenbaum, 

no, 

they 

did 

not 

say simply 

that 

summary 

judgment should not have been granted for Toyota, but that 

summary judgment should be granted for Ms. Williams? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

It is my belief that that's what 

the opinion says, and I --

QUESTION: 

Well, 

but 

--  

but now 

surely 

we 

shouldn't have to talk about beliefs as to what an opinion 

said.

MR. 

ROSENBAUM: 

I 

-- I 

have to give 

a caveat 

about my remarks, which is 

that there are inconsistencies 

in this opinion. 

I know 

that on the 

first page of 

the 

opinion the court enunciates the summary judgment standard 

and 

says, we're 

here 

to determine 

whether 

or not 

the 

summary 

judgment 

against Ms. 

Williams 

was appropriate, 

giving Ms. Williams the benefit of the inferences. 

But at 

the end 

of the opinion, they 

say, because we 

have found 

her ADA disabled as 

a matter of law, we 

remand solely to 

determine 

whether 

the 

requested 

accommodation 

was 

reasonable or whether the employer had some other defense. 

I can't reconcile it. 

QUESTION: 

That's 

one --

that's 

one 

of the 

inconsistencies. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Yes, Your Honor, that is one 

of 

the inconsistencies. 

And 

there's 

-- and 

I 

also disagree 

with the 

legal analysis. 

They 

didn't make 

the mistake that 

the 

petitioner says they made. 

The mistake they met --

they 

made 

was by 

going 

that extra 

step, 

after finding 

her 

substantially disabled, and said you've got to relate that 

particularly 

to her work, 

and I don't 

think that that's 

the law, nor do I think it should be the law. 

QUESTION: 

The trouble, 

of 

course, is 

-- is 

defining 

what 

substantially 

disabled 

means.

of --

of 

disfavor. 

And 

now, do you 

think that --

that given that 

limited notion 

of the 

handicapped and 

what it 

meant by 

substantial 

limitation of 

a 

major 

life activity, 

it's 

sufficient to -- to refer 

to simply what you referred 

to 

in the appendix, the statement of Dr. Kleinert, which says 

she 

cannot lift 20 pounds -- she 

can only lift 20 pounds 

maximum and 

no frequent 

lifting or 

carrying of 

objects 

weighing 

up to 

10 

pounds? 

She 

cannot make 

constant, 

repetitive 

use 

of 

flexion/extension 

of 

wrist/elbow. 

Constant. 

She can do it, but not constantly. 

No overhead 

work and 

no use of vibratory 

or pneumatic tools. 

Those 

are the 

only things that he 

-- now, do you 

think that's 

enough to 

bring her 

within the 

-- the 

category of 

the

handicapped that this piece of legislation was addressing? 

And that's really the question here. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

It was several questions, 

Your 

Honor. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. 

ROSENBAUM: 

The 

--  

first 

of 

all, 

the 

evidence 

in 

this 

case 

that 

you 

recited 

I 

think 

is 

sufficient to bring her within the coverage of the act. 

Secondly, there 

is more evidence in 

the record 

that 

supports 

Ms. 

Williams' 

position 

than 

what 

you 

referred to, and I can go 

into it in detail if you 

would 

care for me to. 

QUESTION: 

I only used 

that because that's what 

you referred to. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

I can't -- I have limited 

time, 

and -- and I can tell 

you that this is not simply 

a sore 

wrist 

case. 

Ms. 

Williams 

was 

diagnosed 

by a 

board 

certified orthopedic surgeon. 

She had muscular spasms and 

knotting which were 

palpable. 

Those were injected 

with 

medications, with trigger point injections. 

There was an 

MRI 

of 

her 

shoulder 

showing 

inflammation 

and 

peritendinitis. 

There 

is uncontradicted 

testimony that 

she has trouble dressing. 

She has -- does do 

housework. 

She has 

pain when she vacuums. 

Gardening has been pretty 

much abandoned.

QUESTION: 

Well, 

now she 

did 

get 

workman's 

compensation benefits presumably. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

As a result of the initial event 

where she initially --

QUESTION: 

Does 

--  

does 

the 

existence 

of 

workman's compensation schemes 

help us in 

giving meaning 

to substantial limitation 

language under the Disabilities 

Act? 

I mean, it wasn't intended to replace workman's comp 

schemes, and 

somebody who gets a bad back or a tendinitis 

or 

a 

carpal 

tunnel syndrome 

presumably 

can 

resort to 

workman's comp to 

get some compensation and 

some relief. 

But do you think that 

the Disabilities Act had a 

broader 

scope and maybe was focused more on discrimination against 

people 

who are 

wheelchair-bound or 

something 

like that 

where employers 

tended to 

say, 

gosh, I'm 

not going 

to 

consider hiring anybody like that? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

The worker's compensation 

award 

is probative as to the issue of 

whether or not she is ADA 

disabled. 

It is not preclusive one way 

or the other, but 

it 

--  

but it's 

a 

good piece 

of 

evidence because 

the 

worker's compensation award says that this 

is a lady who, 

because 

of her injuries, 

has suffered a 

decrease in the 

earning capacity 

in the 

area of 

where she 

lives of 

20 

percent 

of 

what 

was 

available 

to 

her, 

and 

that's 

substantial.

I also want to go 

back, if I might, to 

Justice 

Scalia's comment 

on the limited number. 

When the ADA was 

passed in 1990, Congress specifically 

noted there were 43 

million Americans who would come 

within the protection of 

the act. 

The 

National Employment 

Lawyers amicus 

brief 

refers to 

census data 

of 

1989, the 

year before, 

which 

indicates 

that 

at 

the 

time 

Congress 

passed 

this 

legislation, 17.3 percent of the 

population were going to 

be considered ADA 

disabled, and 

it was anticipated 

that 

the number of 

individuals meeting 

that disability 

would 

increase as time 

went by. 

And 

so, I think it's 

fair to 

say 

that, 

yes, 

it's a 

limited 

and 

discrete group 

of 

people, but 

it's 

close to 

20 

percent of 

the 

American 

population. 

One 

out 

of five 

Americans 

is 

going 

to 

qualify. 

QUESTION: 

Well, 

you're 

exaggerating it 

now. 

It's -- it's under 20 percent, and -- and I wonder whether 

-- you know, when you 

count just -- just the 

wheelchair-

bound or, you know, the homebound, those who really cannot 

-- cannot walk, cannot 

walk outside the house, it 

brings 

you -- it brings you 

pretty high up towards that 

figure. 

And --

and when 

you start 

adding people 

who have, 

you 

know, relatively 

minor manual disabilities --

let's take 

carpal 

tunnel 

syndrome, 

for 

example. 

Is 

that 

a 

disability? 

Does 

it disable 

you 

from 

certain manual

things? 

Certainly it does. 

Would you consider that a --

a 

disability that qualifies 

as a 

-- an impairment 

of a 

major life activity? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

We know that the inquiry 

as to 

whether 

or 

not 

an 

individual 

is 

disabled 

is 

an 

individualized inquiry. 

That's 

per Sutton. 

You 

can't 

have 

a 

per 

se 

finding of 

disability 

based 

upon 

the 

nomenclature 

of a medical diagnosis. 

I understand and I 

think the AFL-CIO brief talks about what carpal tunnel and 

tendinitis and all of this in 

a medical sense. 

But there 

are varying degrees of severity, and so to tell me that an 

individual has 

carpal tunnel syndrome 

doesn't answer the 

question of 

whether 

that 

individual 

is 

ADA 

disabled. 

We've got to go on and look. 

QUESTION: 

So 

-- so, you 

think that 

the most 

severe case of carpal tunnel syndrome would qualify. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

If it --

QUESTION: 

Otherwise you could have 

answered my 

question no. 

You -- you think --

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

I -- I certainly --

QUESTION: 

-- there has 

to be an individualized 

determination 

because 

the 

most severe 

case 

of 

carpal 

tunnel syndrome could 

qualify as rendering that 

person a 

disabled 

person 

within 

the 

meaning 

of 

this 

--  

this 

specialized legislation.

MR. 

ROSENBAUM: 

That's 

right 

because 

the 

regulations 

say 

is 

that 

if 

they're 

significantly 

restricted concerning the 

condition, the 

manner, or 

the 

duration of 

the 

activity, then 

they 

are 

substantially 

disabled. 

And in this situation, 

no one would 

say that 

the average person in the American society can't flex 

and 

extend 

repetitively, 

can't 

do 

repetitive 

motion, 

is 

limited in lifting, has trouble --

QUESTION: 

Mr. Rosenbaum, do you have any notion 

of what 

percentage of the population would be taken in if 

we use the standard -- the 

class that she was put in 

for 

worker's compensation purposes, a 

20 percent occupational 

impairment -- how many people? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

I 

have no 

figures that 

would 

relate that to the population as a whole. 

QUESTION: 

Is there 

anything that suggests that 

those people, the 

people who are in a 

sense not the most 

disabled, 

but 

the people 

who 

are 

not 

quite 

in 

that 

category 

are 

the 

ones 

who 

are 

really 

discriminated 

against? 

Because 

the 

ones 

who 

can't 

work 

at 

all, 

obviously, are not 

discriminated against. 

The ones 

who 

would 

be discriminated against 

would be the 

ones who --

who might 

work, but 

-- which 

is something 

bothering me 

about using 

the major life activity 

of working. 

How is 

that -- how does that play out?

MR. 

ROSENBAUM: 

Well, 

I'm not sure 

that I can 

explain all of its ramifications, but I can say that there 

was 

certainly 

a 

concern that 

people 

who 

were labeled 

disabled would be stereotyped and 

that employers would be 

hesitant to give them the same vocational opportunities as 

non-disabled people would 

be, even though 

the disability 

had no effect on the job. 

They would perhaps be afraid of 

having 

more worker's 

compensation 

claims. 

They 

would 

perhaps be afraid 

of excess absenteeism, all of this type 

of thing. 

But --

QUESTION: 

One -- one of the problems with this 

is we're looking at the entry classification, 

disability, 

but on the facts of this case, she was able to do a job if 

the 

employer 

sliced it 

a 

certain way. 

And then 

the 

employer 

says, well, for 

the good 

of my work 

force and 

company, I don't want people to do just that narrow thing. 

I 

want them 

to be 

able 

to do 

four different 

jobs and 

rotate. 

That's a common business 

practice. 

And 

the --

the concern is 

does it mean if she is able 

to do, as she 

was able to do for 3 years, a simple job, she uniquely and 

all the people who work there has 

to be able to have this 

special job when the others 

all have to rotate into 

four 

different positions. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

That 

issue is 

not reached 

in 

this case. 

That is an issue 

of whether or not, 

with or

without accommodation, Ms. Williams can perform all of the 

essential tasks of the employment. 

And --

QUESTION: 

I -- I know that 

we -- we don't get 

to 

what 

is 

the 

--  

how 

much 

accommodation 

would 

be 

required, but 

it's a little hard 

to keep that 

from view 

because if 

the employer doesn't have -- would not have to 

make the accommodation that she's 

seeking, then this case 

is 

not very significant. 

It's 

just a question 

at what 

stage she loses. 

MR. 

ROSENBAUM: 

Well, 

let me 

-- let me 

say a 

couple of 

things. 

It wasn't 

an essential 

task of 

Ms. 

Williams' job that she 

performed the wiping in 

the shell 

body for 

3 years. 

She could 

perform a 

full job 

for 3 

years without 

having to 

do that, 

and so, 

we would 

say 

that --

QUESTION: 

But the 

employer decided 

to change 

what 

the workers do, and as 

I understand assembly lines, 

that's not 

uncommon to 

take people 

from doing the 

same 

thing 

every 

day, day 

in 

and day 

out, 

train them 

for 

several jobs, and then they rotate. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

In 

the Sixth Circuit, 

there's 

the case of Kiphart v. Saturn where that issue 

was put to 

the jury where the employer said, you've got to be able to 

rotate through all of the 

tasks in your group, and 

since 

you, 

the 

allegedly disabled 

person, 

were not 

able to,

we're entitled to fire you. 

The jury did not 

accept the 

employer's statement because the 

jury determined that the 

employer did not, 

in fact, 

require all 

employees to 

do 

every job. 

And 

in this 

particular 

case, the 

evidence is 

that 

the area 

that 

Ms. 

Williams 

went back 

into, 

the 

inspection job, was 

a job 

where medically placed 

people 

would be 

put, people who were known to have problems with 

their hands and arms and shoulders. 

That's the quote from 

Kendall Hall. 

And so, this 

entire group was made 

up of 

physically limited people and 

were put there as a 

matter 

of accommodation by 

Toyota. 

And in 

those circumstances, 

if Toyota on remand, if -- if we go there, wants 

to argue 

to the 

jury that it 

was essential, then 

this is a 

-- a 

matter the 

jury will 

have to 

determine, but 

we say 

it 

wasn't. 

QUESTION: 

Essential is 

not 

the 

standard of 

accommodation, is it? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Excuse me? 

QUESTION: 

Isn't 

--   

essential 

isn't 

the 

standard, is it, that the 

employer has to show that 

it's 

essential --

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

No. 

QUESTION: 

-- that their work be arranged --

MR. 

ROSENBAUM: 

No, 

no.

reasonableness considerations to accommodation. 

It is --

the definition 

of the individual 

who is eligible 

to ADA 

protection 

is 

that 

that 

individual 

is 

a 

qualified 

individual 

with a disability, 

meaning that although they 

are 

significantly and 

substantially 

limited in 

a major 

life activity, they can do 

all of the essential tasks 

of 

the employment either with or without accommodation. 

And there was a -- if I might go on, there was a 

refrain in 

the -- in the 

question that you 

asked about, 

well, if they can do all of these things, how can 

they be 

disabled. 

The 

ADA looks at what 

a person can't do. 

It 

doesn't help or further the 

inquiry to say what they 

do, 

if they can do all these things. 

QUESTION: 

Well, 

doesn't --

don't you have 

to 

look at 

both in 

-- in 

trying to 

assess 

the extent 

of 

somebody's incapacity to do a major life activity? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

You -- you inevitably --

QUESTION: 

What they can do and what they can't? 

MR. 

ROSENBAUM: 

In 

fact, 

inevitably 

by 

considering one, you 

consider the other, obviously. 

But 

it's not a defense to the ADA claim to say, look, they can 

do a lot of 

stuff. 

You've got to look at what they can't 

do. 

That's 

what the Southeastern 

Community College 

case is 

about. 

That's what 

Bragdon means when 

it says,

you don't 

have to be utterly unable. 

You have to have a 

lot of capacity to do ADA -- to be an ADA disabled person. 

The ADA is about working. 

It's about a lawsuit 

to 

try to 

keep a 

job. 

This 

is 

a basic, 

fundamental 

American value. 

Why shouldn't it be promoted? 

QUESTION: 

Mr. Rosenbaum, 

could 

-- could 

you 

tell us what 

you want us to 

do? 

Assuming we 

agree with 

you, you want us to 

take the Sixth Circuit opinion as 

--

as affirming a 

summary judgment for you on the disability 

portion. 

Correct? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Correct. 

QUESTION: 

Now, let's assume we don't agree with 

you 

on 

--  

on 

the 

point. 

As 

I 

understand 

it, 

the 

petitioner 

wants 

us 

to reverse 

the 

Sixth 

Circuit and 

reinstate the 

district court's 

summary judgment 

against 

you. 

Isn't that correct? 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Not in total. 

They --

QUESTION: 

I thought that's 

-- that's what they 

say, and I'm wondering --

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

They want --

QUESTION: 

-- wondering why we 

can do that when 

the 

Sixth Circuit hasn't 

addressed the --

you know, the 

other areas of disability. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

The case is before the Court 

in 

the 

procedural 

posture 

of 

proceedings 

for 

a 

summary

judgment. 

The outcomes in the case can be, as a matter of 

law, 

she's insubstantially, insignificantly 

disabled and 

she loses, or as a matter of law, she is substantially and 

is significantly impaired and she wins, or she's someplace 

in the middle, and there's a --

QUESTION: 

It goes to a jury. 

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

It goes to the jury. 

This Court, I think, can 

probably reach that as 

concerns 

manual 

tasks, 

but 

certainly 

this 

Court 

can 

clarify, say what the correct standards are, send the case 

back and 

let the lower courts 

apply the standard 

to the 

record before it. 

And 

-- and so, 

if -- if 

we are 

not 

going 

to prevail on 

our contention that 

Ms. Williams is 

disabled as a matter of law, 

then we want to go back 

for 

the jury trial, is what we want to do. 

And I know I'm 

almost out. 

I've got to 

say on 

the 

50 percent, 

Justice 

Stevens, the 

50 to 

55 percent 

vocational 

testimony, that was 

related to 

Ms. Williams' 

geographical 

area. 

It 

is 

in 

the 

record. 

It 

is 

appropriate evidence, 

and it is 

not mentioned at 

all by 

petitioner in any of petitioner's filings. 

And I think as 

concerns working, it is extremely strong evidence. 

I also want 

to say we have 

never conceded that 

Ms. Williams is incapable of prevailing on working. 

QUESTION: 

Thank you, Mr. Rosenbaum.

MR. ROSENBAUM: 

Thank you. 

QUESTION: 

Mr. 

Roberts, you 

have 

2 

minutes 

remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Thank you, Your Honor. 

Justice Kennedy, it will not 

be enough to x out 

that one sentence 

on page 4a. 

You would also have 

to x 

out the sentence on page 

5a saying that an individual 

is 

disabled if their impairment, quote, seriously reduces her 

ability to perform the manual 

tasks that are job-related. 

You would also have to x out the other sentence on page 4a 

that 

says a plaintiff 

is disabled if 

they're limited in 

performing, 

quote, 

manual 

tasks 

associated 

with 

an 

assembly line job, end quote. 

And you would have to x out 

the sentence on page 2a that says the key issue is whether 

the plaintiff 

in this case can 

use her arms, 

hands, and 

shoulders, 

quote, as required by 

her new job, end quote. 

I 

respectfully submit that 

by the 

time you 

get through 

x-ing out 

all those 

sentences, you 

should 

go one 

step 

further and x 

out the opinion as a whole 

by holding that 

it is reversed. 

Thank you, Your Honor. 

QUESTION: 

What about the other -- the other two 

issues? 

I mean, 

the 

-- the 

court of 

appeals did 

not

purport 

to 

reach 

the 

working 

as 

a 

substantial 

life 

activity 

and what 

else? 

Lifting as a 

substantial life 

activity. 

How can we reverse 

it without addressing those 

issues also, which I don't think 

we have the tools to 

do 

here? 

MR. ROBERTS: 

You 

can 

certainly reverse 

with 

respect 

to the 

summary 

judgment 

on 

performing 

manual 

tasks. 

The issues with 

respect to 

lifting and 

working 

were not addressed by the court of appeals. 

QUESTION: 

So, you acknowledge 

we would have to 

remand for -- for its consideration of those. 

MR. ROBERTS: 

Unless the Court felt, 

given the 

fact 

that 

the 

issues 

with 

respect 

to 

working 

were 

insinuated into the case by 

the Sixth Circuit's approach, 

that 

it 

was 

appropriate 

to 

address 

that 

major 

life 

activity as well. 

QUESTION: 

Even as 

to 

manual tasks, 

are you 

asking for a ruling in 

your favor on summary judgment 

on 

that, or are you saying it shouldn't have been effectively 

summary judgment for the plaintiff 

and then we go to 

the 

next stage, 

that -- that it 

could be a jury 

question on 

manual tasks? 

MR. ROBERTS: 

No, no. 

Summary 

judgment should 

be 

granted 

in favor 

of 

Toyota because 

you 

have, with 

respect to manual tasks, an undisputed factual record, and

the question is whether that 

meets the legal standard 

of 

substantially 

limited 

with 

respect 

to 

a 

major 

life 

activity. 

A jury can 

decide things like whether can 

she 

lift 20 pounds 

or not, if there's 

a dispute, can 

she do 

this 

or that. 

But those 

facts are all 

undisputed with 

respect to 

manual tasks. 

It 

is a purely 

legal question 

whether she meets the statutory standard. 

CHIEF 

JUSTICE 

REHNQUIST: 

Thank 

you, 

Mr. 

Roberts. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, 

at 

11:02 

a.m., 

the 

case in 

the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
