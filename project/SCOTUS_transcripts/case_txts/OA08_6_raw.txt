 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-6, District 
Attorney's Office for the Third Judicial District v. 
Osborne.

 Mr. Rosenstein.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. ROSENSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The State of Alaska fully recognizes the 

importance of DNA evidence.  The State provides criminal 
defendants with pretrial access to that evidence and it 
has postconviction procedures that give prisoners a fair 
opportunity to retest that evidence should new 
technology become available.

 So this case really isn't about the 

importance or power of DNA evidence.  Rather it's about 
three things:  First, it's about the proper procedural 
device for asserting in Federal court a right to 
postconviction testing.  Section 1983 is not the correct 
device because Mr. Osborne's claim clearly sounds in 
Federal habeas corpus.  The evidence he seeks has a 
singular relevance to support a direct attack on the

validity of his confinement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, he's -- he's not at 

this point.  All he's doing is seeking evidence.  We 
don't know -- he doesn't know presumably -- exactly what 
that evidence is going to show.  The evidence may prove 
to be exonerating and it may not be.

 Until one knows the tendency of the 

evidence, one can't say that we have a Preiser problem. 
So if -- if we don't have that kind of a problem, then I 
don't see -- I guess I don't follow your argument that 
this necessarily sounds in habeas.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, the --

Mr. Osborne's case is comparable to Balisok v. Edwards, 
where the Petitioner was seeking damages for -- as a 
result of a biased hearing in prison.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right.  And if he was 

seeking damages in this 1983 action for false 
imprisonment or imprisonment under an invalid 
conviction, I would understand your argument.  But what 
he is saying in effect is:  I want process to know what 
this evidence has to say.  And that is not seeking 
damages, and it's not seeking release.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

It's not seeking damages, but the proof -- the 
difference between this case -- the only difference

between this case and Balisok is that in this case the 
proof is going to be happening in a laboratory; whereas, 
in Balisok the --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  The difference -- the 

difference is that if he succeeds in this case in 
getting access to the evidence, that doesn't get him 
outside or even in position to go outside the prison 
door.  All it does is get him some evidence to test. 
And what he does with that later, if he finds it 
favorable, presumably is necessarily going to be in 
habeas.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  But this -- his request is 
simply a discovery request.  He's split his -- his claim 
away from his underlying claim of actual innocence, his 
--

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, he's got to because 
he doesn't know whether he has any evidence of actual 
innocence at this point.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  But he -- to assert a claim 
of actual innocence, he doesn't need to have the result 
of a DNA test, and --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  He's not asserting it.  He 
just says:  I want to get to this evidence and see what 
it has to say.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  But the -- this evidence

has a singular relevance, and his -- his true intent is 
to -- is to assert --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.
 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  -- a claim of innocence.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  He has a singular objective 

in getting the evidence, but we don't know what the 
evidence means.  The evidence may conclusively prove 
that he is guilty, for all we know.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That's true, Your Honor, 
but what this represents, what his request represents, 
is a discovery request.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it's a -- that's --

that's a fair way of putting it, but what he -- I think 
ultimately his strongest argument or his -- his basic 
argument is this evidence is potentially so important 
that the State has no valid interest in keeping me at 
least from seeing it; i.e., testing it.  And you can 
call that discovery if you want to, but it's something 
very different from the normal discovery that goes on as 
an ancillary process to a criminal prosecution.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Well, the State does have 
an interest in -- in insisting that Mr. Osborne follow 
the established procedures.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh, that may be.  I'm not 

getting into that here.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would the other side 

concede the premise that he doesn't say that this is 
going to exonerate him?  That he has -- you know --
here's some -- some evidence out there.  It may help me; 
it may hurt me.  I don't know which, but I'd like to see 
it.  Is that the only claim he's making?  If so, it's --
it's a lot less -- what should I say -- a lot less 
plausible a constitutional claim.  There's some evidence 
that I'd like to look at; I'm not saying it will prove 
me innocent.  I'd just like to look at this evidence. 
Might, might not.  That's a lot weaker claim than what I 
had thought he was making, which is the claim that this 
-- this new scientific evidence will -- will prove my 
innocence.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That's correct, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, which is he doing 

here?  Is he saying the latter or not?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Well, he hasn't -- he has 
never really asserted that he is actually innocent.  He 
holds out the possibility, and he's filed an affidavit 
which is at joint appendix --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's not a 

constitutional claim of entitlement to evidence which he 
asserts will prove his innocence, but rather a 
constitutional claim to evidence which might or then

might not prove his innocence?  Is that --

MR. ROSENSTEIN:  He has hedged, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Performance we should let 

the -- let Osborne, Osborne's attorney, address that 
question, because you're not really equipped to answer 
for the other side.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we're assuming the 

premise, though, in the questioning.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Well, as this case started, 

Your Honor, Mr. Osborne was asserting that it would 
establish his innocence.  But yet he has never -- he has 
never made a declaration under penalty of penalty of 
perjury that he is innocent.  So, Your Honor, you're 
correct.  He seems to be, for lack of a better word, 
fishing for evidence that -- that might help him. 
And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was evidence in --

at his trial at the state of the art at that time. 
There was whatever the test was.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, at trial 

the State performed what is known as DQ alpha testing.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That was not the state of 

the art at the time, was it?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That's my understanding, 
that the RFLP testing was a much more discriminating

type of -- would yield a much more discriminating result 
than the DQ Alpha.  -

JUSTICE SCALIA:  He didn't ask for that.
 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That's correct, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But when did the current 
technology become available?  When did the testing that 
he now requests --

MR. ROSENSTEIN:  I'm not certain about that, 
Your Honor.  My -- I would guess that it was around the 
late nineties.  It was available before he filed his --
this Federal action.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does the State 

routinely keep evidence of the sort Osborne is seeking 
available?  Or is there a cutoff point at which they 
dispose of the evidence.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  I can't answer whether the 
State has a policy.  It seems to be a decision that is 
made jointly with the police, the crime lab, and the 
prosecutors, and it depends, I would think, on the 
status of the case as it proceeds after conviction 
through direct appeal.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What now?  As far as I 

understand, there's a procedural problem.  I tried to 
figure out the Heck line once in Balisok.  My impression 
of it is that if, Mr. Prisoner, you're bringing an

action challenging some confinement or the effect of 
your action is going to be to let you go out of solitary 
or out of prison, then proceed your habeas.  But if what 
you're trying to get is relief that may or may not mean 
you get out of solitary or you get out of prison, then 
you go to 1983.  But, by the way, if you're in 1983 you 
are complaining about an action or inaction by a State 
official that violates a constitutional right.

 Now, as I look at this case the prisoner, if 
he wins, is not going to get out, and he is complaining 
about the State violating a constitutional right by 
refusing to give him DNA.  It seems to me that second 
question is the question that's the heart of the case: 
Does the State have a constitutional obligation to give 
him the DNA?

 So I would appreciate your telling me why it 

doesn't.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Justice Breyer, the State 
doesn't have an obligation to provide this evidence to 
him because there is no -- a -- prisoners have no 
Federal right to postconviction relief, and the State of 
Alaska has provided procedures by which -- which Mr. 
Osborne if he chose to use them could make available the 
evidence that he seeks.  But he hasn't chosen to invoke 
those procedures.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you explain that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any reason to 

think that if, in fact -- sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Breyer.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Just to clarify his 

statement, he said that the State of Alaska provides a 
means for him to get at this information; but if it did, 
I think we wouldn't be here.  So would you -- Alaska is 
one of the few States that has no statute.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what -- you say --

this whole controversy is whether the State is obliged 
to give him this information; but you're saying it's 
simply that he picked the wrong procedure.  That's what 
I thought I heard you say just now; that there is a 
means under Alaska law where he could get this DNA 
postconviction.  So would you please explain what the 
Alaska procedure is?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.
 Alaska has a postconviction relief statute 
and that is at page -- starts at page 10a of the blue 
brief.  And under that statute, a prisoner can assert a 
claim for -- for postconviction relief when there exist 
material facts -- I'm quoting from Alaska Statute 
12.72.010.  Postconviction relief is available when a

person claims that there exists evidence of material 
facts not previously presented and heard by the court 
that requires vacation of the conviction or sentence in 
the interest of justice.

 Now, if Mr. Osborne were to state a 

cognizable claim under that statute the Alaska rules of 
court then apply the full civil rules pertaining to 
discovery as of right to the applicant.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Has there been any case 

in Alaska where a defendant postconviction was, in fact, 
able to get DNA testing under the procedure you just 
described?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, 

there's -- there was one case and it's cited in the 
yellow brief, Patterson v. State, that a prisoner did 
apply in court and was granted access to the DNA 
evidence, but then it came to pass that the evidence had 
been destroyed by that time.

 So in that case the relief was granted, but 
through the destruction of the evidence no testing was 
possible.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you give me some idea 
of how many cases there are in, say, the last 10 years 
in which in State postconviction proceedings the 
convicted prisoner has asked for DNA evidence?

MR. ROSENSTEIN:  I believe --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Three?  300?
 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Less -- we did an informal 

search and found seven cases where there were actual 
requests; and I believe that five of them involved court 
cases, the one that I have just mentioned where the 
relief was granted, and I believe the remaining are 
pending decision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, that relief 

would require him to assert his innocence, wouldn't it? 
He would have to bring a habeas corpus action claiming 
that the State has no business holding him because in 
fact he's innocent?

 He doesn't want to do that?  He just wants 
to say, I'd just like to see this evidence.  It might 
help me.  It might not help me, but --

MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That's -- prisoners have 

never been able to postconviction simply seek 
over-the-counter the evidence that was used in 
their earlier -- in their --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't know that they're 
arguing with you on that score.  What they are saying --
I think what they're saying, and this goes to a variety 
of Justice Scalia's question, is that under the Alaska 
statute in order to get to the evidence, or indeed in

order to make his -- his postconviction claim, he's got 
to claim that the evidence of material fact requires 
vacation of the conviction or sentence.

 His argument is, I don't know whether it 
requires it; because I haven't been able to test it. 
What I want is to test it.

 And as I understand it, under this 

particular statute, he has no chance of doing so because 
he can't tell you in advance what the test is going to 
show.  Isn't that correct?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Justice Souter --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, first tell me whether 
that's correct or not.  He doesn't know what the test is 
going to -- he doesn't know what the test is going to 
show; so --

MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That is correct.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- he cannot say that it 

requires vacation of the conviction; isn't that correct?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That is correct.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  But, but -- but only Mr. 

Osborne knows whether he is innocent.  And if he is 
innocent --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But Mr. Osborne doesn't 
know what that evidence is going to show.  He hasn't

tested it.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Whether -- whether he 

believes he's innocent or whether he doesn't believe 
he's innocent, he can walk into court, as I understand 
it, and say, I am absolutely innocent.  But what he 
cannot do prior to testing the evidence is tell you, is 
allege, that the evidence is going to require the 
vacation of the conviction.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  But if he is innocent, then 

he does know the -- the result of the testing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought you said the 

State has -- has indeed granted a habeas request.  In 
that case, where it granted the habeas request, although 
it turned out that the evidence was destroyed, in that 
case surely the same situation -- the same situation 
existed.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Well, actually, Your Honor, 

it did not, because in that case he never asserted his 
innocence.  That was a request he made on 
reconsideration after the denial of his ineffective 
assistance claim.  And he said that under the due --
under due process, I am entitled to have this evidence 
so that I can present an actual innocence claim.  So the

did.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Well, in -- in Mr. 

Osborne's first postconviction relief case that was 
decided in -- are you talking about the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  I'm talking about the 
case you alluded to earlier where you say the State of 
Alaska had indeed provided DNA evidence or had agreed to 
provide it --

MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Oh, okay.  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- but for the fact that it 

no longer existed.  Now, in that case surely the same 
problem existed that Justice Souter is -- is raising. 
That -- that person also, while claiming innocence, 
couldn't say for sure what the evidence would produce, 
but that didn't stop the State from providing it; did 
it?

I really have only one question this morning and I would

impression is that Alaska refused the test because, 
among other things, they couldn't say -- they said the 
conviction rested primarily on eyewitness testimony, and 
they have a bunch of reasons.  But the Ninth Circuit, as 
a matter of fact, tried to blow apart those reasons. 
Okay?

 Suppose I agree with the Ninth Circuit. 

Then my question is this:  Does the Constitution of the 
United States require you to give this evidence to the 
defendant?  And one of the relevant points in my mind is 
I see it would be of significant advantage to the 
defendant.  Even if he's guilty, he can be proved to --
whatever.  It is an advantage to him.  Okay?

 Now, why don't you want to give it to him?
 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Because, Your Honor, the 

State of Alaska has a procedure that was not invoked in 
the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I -- there I -- that's 

the undergrowth I tried to clear away.  I am saying I 
read all that procedure.  Suppose I believe that the 
Ninth Circuit is right about that procedure, namely that 
the tests that they're using in that procedure are not 
favorable enough to a defendant who is seeking, as this 
defendant is seeking, the DNA.

 He just wants some DNA.  He'll pay for it.

The odds are eight to one he's going to lose.  But he 
thinks:  I'm willing to run those odds.  I won't put you 
at any trouble.  Now, why don't you want to give it to 
him?

 Because, Your Honor, the State of Alaska has 

a procedure that would enable him to obtain that 
evidence.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  The procedure has the 
tests in it that the Alaska court -- didn't the Alaska 
Supreme Court say, we will not give you DNA evidence 
unless you can demonstrate:  One, that the conviction 
rested primarily on eyewitness ID evidence; two, that 
there was a demonstrable doubt concerning his ID as the 
perpetrator; and, three, that scientific testing would 
likely would be conclusive.  Wasn't that their test?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  With respect, Your Honor, 

that was the test they applied in that case, but that is 
not the test that would apply if Mr. Osborne were to 
file a new postconviction relief application asserting 
that he is actually innocent.  If he were to do that, 
then the full civil rules of discovery would available 
to him.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And then -- are different 

-- then they'd give it to him?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Pardon me.

JUSTICE BREYER:  In other words, all he has 
to do is file a new piece of paper tomorrow, and he gets 
the DNA?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Right.  But Alaska --

Alaska has procedures for this.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you said something 

significant.  You said that he would have to allege his 
actual innocence, which he hasn't done.  So if he 
continues not to -- not to put in a sworn statement 
that, I am actually innocent, under your current 
procedure he still couldn't get the DNA.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  If he doesn't allege his 
actual innocence, Your Honor, then this is really an 
empty exercise, a fishing expedition.  He wants to just 
see what -- what the evidence says.  And that -- that is 
not the way litigation works.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You gave the one case in 
which in the habeas in Alaska the court granted access 
to DNA, but the evidence wasn't there.

 On how many occasions when postconviction 

someone moved for the DNA evidence did the Alaska courts 
deny the request?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  My -- my -- there were --

as I said, there were seven cases.  And my understanding

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  There -- well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought you said they 

were still pending.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  There were -- there are 

four or five that are pending.  One of them is Mr. 
Osborne's case, and another is being reviewed by the --
by the attorney general.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. KATYAL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Ninth Circuit created a novel 
constitutional right by extending Brady to the 
postconviction setting.  Mr. Osborne doesn't attempt to 
defend that rationale.  Instead, he attempts to mint a 

20 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

previously unrecognized liberty interest in access to 
clemency or State postconviction procedures.  Assuming 
the Court reaches the second question presented, it 
should not constitutionalize rules for postconviction 
access to DNA, an area of great legislative ferment in 
the last few years.  And even were it inclined to do so, 
the unusual facts of this case, which include failure to 
attest to actual innocence under threat of perjury, two 
recent confessions to the crime, and a tactical decision 
at trial to forego a highly discriminating RFLP DNA 
test, all together make this a particularly poor 
candidate for recognizing a new constitutional 
entitlement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What were the two 

confessions?  I know the one before the parole 
authorities.  What was the other one?

 MR. KATYAL:  There are two confessions to 

the parole authorities.  One is found at page --
petition appendix 71a.  There's a small reprint which is 
the written portion of the -- of the confession. 
There's also separately in the record -- this is at 
supplemental excerpts of the record, pages 248 to 261, 
in the Ninth Circuit, which --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but isn't it true 

that we've had DNA cases where the person has been found

innocent despite the fact they confessed?

 MR. KATYAL:  That is -- that is correct.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  How do we know this isn't 

one of those cases?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, I am not quite sure that 
we have had any situation like this, in which you have 
had so many different facts altogether that -- that 
suggested both that he -- that he's guilty and that --
and you are talking about a confession that's taken 
place years after.  I think the cases that are referred 
to by the amici are situations in which someone has 
confessed generally at trial or something like that.

 Here you have two confessions years later. 

They are very detailed.  The one in the -- in the 
supplemental excerpts to the record is a very long 
story.  And he says that he told his attorney about it 
and talks all about how he had confessed to his mother, 
how it was very difficult to exorcise.  It is a very 
in-depth confession, and it is a confession that the --
that the Alaska courts have credited.

 It is not just our word.  At joint appendix 

page 221, the Alaska court found -- listened to that 
2004 confession in light of the 2006 affidavit that Mr. 
Osborne makes much of claiming that he is innocent and 
put those two documents side by side and said, taken

together, they don't -- the 2006 affidavit does not 
really take --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Am I right in 

understanding that the State has agreed that this 
evidence is exonerating; that this evidence potentially 
could exonerate him?

 MR. KATYAL:  The -- the State has so agreed.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And is it true that all he 

has to do is file a piece of paper in the court that 
says:  Whatever I said before, I did it under pressure; 
I am innocent.  And if he says those words, "I am 
innocent," then he will get this DNA?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, it is -- it is not clear 

to me under State law.  I think as I understood my 
friend -- but that's what I understood him to say.  I 
can tell you, Justice Breyer, for purposes of the 
Federal law, 18 USC 3600 has a requirement in it which 
says that in order to get DNA testing you must attest 
under threat of perjury that you are actually innocent. 
That is a very serious requirement, done after years of 
congressional debate.  That is something that the Ninth 
Circuit rule would disregard, and it would permit 
someone to come in without that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You think we could attach 

that to the new constitutional right that we invent?  It

would be a constitutional right to get it if -- if --
but if you lose, you get another three years?  Could we 
say that?

 MR. KATYAL:  Our position, Justice Scalia, 

is that there is no constitutional right to DNA, but 
if -- were the Court inclined to find one and locate it 
somewhere in Brady or the procedural due process clause, 
something we think which would be very difficult to do, 
but were it -- if that were the Court's inclination, 
absolutely, it should at least mirror the Federal 
statute and the -- and the rock solid requirements of 
3600, which do require that perjury -- that perjury 
statement to be made in order to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think there's a 
constitutional right to establish innocence in some 
cases where there is new and -- evidence that could not 
previously have been discovered, that has a high 
likelihood of exonerating?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, this Court has struggled 

with that and so far has said no.  And the latest 
position is Herrera v. Collins.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm asking for your 

position.

 MR. KATYAL:  Our position is that the logic 
of this Court's precedents is that there is no right at

present to actual innocence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Katyal, the -- the 
right that they're asserting may be located not in 
procedural, but in substantive due process.  What I --
what I would like you to comment on is what the 
government's or any government's interest, the United 
States or that of a State, may be in, in effect, in 
denying that there should be such a right.

 And this question occurred to me when I was 

going through the briefs:  What if -- we'll make this 
Federal for your sake -- what if the United States had 
imprisoned an individual who came forward and said: 
Nobody realized it, but I was an eyewitness to the crime 
for which X is -- is -- has been convicted and is 
currently being incarcerated; and, in fact, I saw that 
crime committed and he did not commit it.  X's lawyer 
arrives at this individual's prison and says:  I want to 
talk to the guy.

 Would the United States have an interest in 

saying, you cannot talk to him?

 MR. KATYAL:  The United States wouldn't --

wouldn't have an interest as a -- would generally permit 
as a matter of prosecutorial ethics access to -- if the 
United States knew that there was some exculpatory 
material that it had within its purview, it would turn

that over.  It just wouldn't be a constitutional --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you know, prisoners 
say all sorts of things.  We don't know whether in the 
long run it is going to be exculpatory or whether this 
guy has some axe to grind.

 But the question is, would the United States 

have any legitimate interest in saying to X's lawyer, 
you can't even talk with him?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that it would --

it would have to -- if it adopted such a rule and 
allowed the talking in any situation --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why wouldn't it?
 MR. KATYAL:  Let me talk about DNA, for 

example.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why do you need a rule, I 

guess is what I'm saying.

 MR. KATYAL:  Let me talk about DNA.  The 

reason why with respect to DNA is it's a no-cost 
proposition for a defendant to say:  Hey, I'm innocent, 
I want to get tested --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh, okay --
MR. KATYAL:  -- So that's why --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Are you starting with the 

premise that the United States would not have a 
legitimate interest in my hypothetical in saying, you

can't even talk to him?

 MR. KATYAL:  Well, it depends on the 

circumstances of the hypothetical and whether or not 
there's some -- whether or not it would open up the 
floodgates, I guess, to other requests and so on.

 With respect to DNA, there is --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, let's assume that if 
you let this guy talk to -- X's lawyer talk to this guy, 
other individuals may say, boy, I can have my moment in 
the sun, too; I'm going to claim this.  You know, let's 
assume the worst case there.

 Would you still say, would the government 
still say, we have an interest for that reason in not 
even letting him talk to him?

 MR. KATYAL:  It's possible, because there --

it may be that as a policy matter they will allow it. 
But as a matter of constitutional law, Justice Souter, 
this Court has repeatedly said --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I haven't gotten to the 

constitutional law yet.  I just -- I just want to know 
whether there would be a legitimate interest in saying 
no.  I mean, you can see --

MR. KATYAL:  Again, there may be because of 

floodgates or other reasons.  But for the --

floodgates.  There are seven cases in this State in the 
whole history of Alaska.
 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is that right?  That's 

floodgates?

 MR. KATYAL:  Seven thus far, 

Justice Stevens.  If this Court were to recognize a 
constitutional right to DNA for all 50 States, there 
would really be, I think, quite a dramatically different 
result.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Especially, I would assume, 

one constitutional right in which you do not even have 
to assert your innocence.

 MR. KATYAL:  Precisely.  So we're talking 

about seven in one State right now, but I think the 
numbers could be great.  That was what Congress said 
when they passed 3600, which said there has to be 
something to lose on the stake of defendants, so that 
they can't come in, like Mr. Osborne, and have 
questionable statements as to whether they're actually 
innocent or not.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why can't you do this? 

Look at the consensus of the statutes in the States and 
the Federal Government and say there's a range of 
appreciation here, and there is a right but it catches

only the outliers?  And so, the worst that would happen 
is that the outlying States would have to bring 
themselves into conformity with the outer reaches of 
whatever the set of statutes is now in all the other 
States.

 MR. KATYAL:  Because, Justice Breyer, that's 
not the way this Court approaches due process questions. 
Were it, for example, non-unanimous jury verdicts, which 
two States have, would be impermissible.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not saying every 

instance in which there are outliers is 
unconstitutional.  I'm just saying in this instance for 
other reasons it might be unconstitutional; namely, you 
have a good way of proving guilty or innocence, and if 
that's so, the practical problem is not great.  You 
solve the practical problem in the way I just mentioned.

 MR. KATYAL:  But you enter the thicket of 

practical problems, it seems to me, Justice Breyer, when 
you do that, because the 44 States that have these 
statutes do it in a variety of different ways with 
respect to perjury requirements, felonies versus 
misdemeanors, who gets access, who pays for it, do they 
get lawyers.  There's a host of policy questions that 
arise --

is bring yourself within any one of them, unless that 
any one of them is a real outlier, which you can make as 
an argument that you will never win?

itself would be within that framework, because it 
already has a process in place.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER NEUFELD
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. NEUFELD:  Thank you very much.
 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the 

Court:

 It is absolutely undisputed in this case 
that there is a DNA test that Mr. Osborne seeks that 
could conclusively prove his actual innocence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there was a 

more reliable one at the time of trial as well, and his 
counsel made the tactical decision not to use it 
because, I assume, she was concerned it would show his 
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which apparently he had 

told her about.

 MR. NEUFELD:  The test actually, the RFLP

test I assume you are referring to, is not actually more 
reliable.  It's more discriminating.  And the reason it 
didn't get used -- even the prosecutor didn't want to 
use it as well, Mr. Chief Justice, because they felt 
that the evidence was so degraded that if they tried 
using that test there was a grave risk that it would 
destroy all the evidence and not get any result.  And 
that's why they chose that DQ alpha test, which is more 
sensitive, albeit not as discriminating.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But what was the reason that 

Respondent's counsel provided for not requesting that 
test?

 MR. NEUFELD:  Respondent's counsel said that 
she was doing it for strategic reasons, although I think 
it is quite important that Mr. Osborne at all points 
said he wanted the testing, okay, and that his counsel 
rejected his advice.  He even wrote to a Nobel Prize 
winner to see what he could do about getting this 
additional testing.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's assume for the 

sake of argument that there is some constitutional right 
to obtain DNA evidence for testing postconviction. 
Would you still -- would you say that that right 
includes the situation where, A, the prisoner refuses to 
assert under penalty of perjury that he or she is

actually innocent; and applies if there was a tactical 
decision at trial not to seek DNA testing at all or not 
to seek the most reliable form of DNA testing that was 
available at the time?

 MR. NEUFELD:  Justice Alito, first of all, 

he was never asked in this pleading to assert his actual 
innocence.  As represented by his counsel --

JUSTICE ALITO:  You think that -- you think 

that's a novel idea that never occurred to him?

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, no, no.  It's in the --
in 1983, it is not required or even asked that he make 
that kind of statement.  He did all through the State 
courts.  In the State courts he always asserted his 
innocence; through his lawyers he asserted his 
innocence, and indeed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Under oath?  Under oath 

so that he would be subject to penalty for perjury?

 MR. NEUFELD:  No, because it wasn't 

required.  Indeed, Your Honor, to respond directly to 
your question, to both of your questions, If this Court 
decided, as Justice Scalia mentioned before as well, 
that one requirement of this right is that a person 
swear under the penalties of perjury, knowing that he 
could be prosecuted, that he's actually innocent, then 
so be it.  It can be remanded for that purpose.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, he just --
MR. NEUFELD:  That is what the Innocence 
Protection Act requires, and no one has opposed that.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why isn't that the 
end of this case, because I heard opposing counsel say 
if you go tomorrow and file a piece of paper and swear 
on that piece of paper you're innocent, Alaska will give 
you the DNA.  Isn't that what he said?  I heard him say 
that, I thought.

 MR. NEUFELD:  He said it, but I don't 

believe that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if he said it in this 

Court in answer to a question, I don't see why that 
isn't binding.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, they took the same 

position in the trial court in Alaska.  They said that 
he is not entitled to DNA testing under the 
postconviction statute under any circumstances.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, wait.  What I heard 

was that if your client files a piece of paper that 
says, I am innocent, then under this new procedure, 
which apparently I hadn't read about because I didn't 
find it or it wasn't obvious in the brief, that then 
they will give him the DNA.  Now that's either right or 
it's wrong; and if it's right, I think that's the end of

it, and if it's wrong, well, then we'll have to proceed. 
But I would proceed on the basis that this swearing 
requirement is not sufficient.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, I don't believe that you 
need the swearing requirement, because he has previously 
asserted his innocence; but what's most important 
here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but the whole 
point is that, Justice Ginsburg brought out the point, 
that he hasn't asserted his innocence under oath.  So 
there's no cost to him for asking for the DNA evidence. 
If there's -- if we're writing up a new constitutional 
right and we require as part of that that he assert his 
innocence under perjury, and if he fails to do that, 
he'll be prosecuted for perjury, that might at least put 
some limitation on the number of people who can assert 
the right.

 MR. NEUFELD:  And I would agree with that. 

I think that's an excellent idea.  And the problem is no 
one's suggesting that Alaska can't do that as a 
restriction.  Indeed they can, but Alaska has had no 
mechanism at all.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you accept that -- of 

course it does; and this is not a new procedure.  I -- I 
didn't understand it to be a new procedure, as

Justice Breyer has described it.  It is the procedure of 
habeas corpus.

 They have a procedure for habeas corpus 

which includes discovery, and all he has to do is come 
in and say, you know, I have been wrongfully convicted; 
I am innocent; and I want to discover this evidence in 
order to establish it, so that I can get out of jail.

 MR. NEUFELD:  That contradicts the position 

they took in the -- in the State court, Your Honor. 
They specifically said in the State courts that it is 
not enough to simply assert one's innocence; that you 
actually have to have proofs, facts that -- that 
demonstrate your innocence before you get to that 
discovery.  It is a Catch-22 situation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, we can ask your 

opposite, opposing counsel.  We can put it to him point 
blank.  That's what I thought he said, and we -- we 
certainly will clarify that.  But there's another 
possible impediment here to your claim.  If we assume 
that there is this constitutional right, and it's 
available in 1983, this trial was in 1993.  He brings 
the 1983 action in 2003.  Counsel told us that this 
better method of testing has been available since the 
late nineties.

 With any constitutional right, there's an

obligation of due diligence on the part of the claimant. 
You can't come in 10 years later, for example, and say 
-- say there was a tainted juror or something like that. 
It was -- it -- when you're claiming even evidence that 
wasn't available at the trial, you have to make the 
application with due diligence.

 MR. NEUFELD:  I agree with that, Your Honor. 

I mean, not only is Alaska not making a claim that he 
did not act with due diligence here, but they're not 
doing -- they're making that claim for a reason.  As 
soon as he finished his direct appeal, he immediately 
filed a pro se petition seeking postconviction DNA 
testing, within months.  And then -- in the late 1990s. 
And then eventually he was assigned a public defender to 
represent him, and that led to the 2001 filing in the 
State court which predated the 2003 filing in the 
Federal court.

 So he's moved as quickly as he possibly 

could as soon as he knew that there was this powerful 
evidence that could be dispositive.

 This is the very first case litigated to our 

knowledge anywhere in the country where the prosecutor 
concedes that a DNA would be absolutely slam-dunk 
dispositive of innocence, but doesn't consent to it.

did they do that, I wonder.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well it's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There was a lot of other 

evidence in the case, wasn't there?

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what they 

thought they were doing.

 MR. NEUFELD:  10 -- 10 years ago, 
Justice Scalia, the U.S. Department of Justice 
articulated a materiality test for DNA testing; and they 
said, like you're saying:  Yes, let's look at the 
evidence of guilt; but then let's say to ourselves, 
looking out of the other eye, what if there's a 
favorable result?  What impact would that have on the 
favorable results?

 That was the position adopted by the United 
States Department of Justice 10 years ago.  That was the 
position, of course, that we're urging here.  That was 
the position adopted by the U.S. Congress five years 
ago, and that materiality test has been adopted by 41 
States to date.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if it is so 

clear --

MR. NEUFELD:  Only Alaska --

it is so clear that this is the right way to go, that 
the Federal Government, 41 States -- does it make sense 
for us to devise a constitutional right to displace what 
the legislatures have done?

 MR. NEUFELD:  It is not a question of 

displacing what the legislatures have done, 
Mr. Chief Justice.  It is a question of when the State 
of Alaska chooses to provide a mechanism for 
postconviction relief.  And here they do.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It is exactly a 

question of displacing what the States have done because 
now this question is going to be subject to 
constitutional law and it's going to be litigated in a 
variety of cases with a variety of claims.  Do you get 
the right to it when you confess?  Do you get the right 
to it when you've waived it at trial?  Do you get the 
continuous right to it as technology advances and makes 
the test more sensitive?  All of those matters will be 
Federal constitutional questions for us to decide.

 MR. NEUFELD:  I don't think necessarily, 

Your Honor.  I think first of all, here we have a clean 
slate if you will, because there were no mechanisms 
passed by the Alaska legislature.

 We have seen, and which is interesting, we 

actually think the Innocence Protection Act as passed by

Congress is a marvelous statute that no one is -- is 
questioning one bit.  It is odd that the Solicitor 
General walks into this courtroom and asks this Court to 
adopt a materiality test that was rejected by Congress.

 The one that we are asking for here is 

simply that you look at the evidence, the evidence of 
guilt that Justice Scalia pointed out --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but the whole 
question -- it is kind of along the same lines I've been 
talking.  The reason they might -- they're saying don't 
adopt that test, is because the question is whether it 
should be adopted as a matter of constitutional law. 
They may, and I suspect they do since they represent the 
government, think Congress's balancing makes perfect 
sense.  It is a different question here.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, I agree with you.  Our 
position is, is that the test that they're calling for 
here is irrational; that it's completely irrational when 
you have something as powerful and new as DNA evidence, 
which can conclusively -- unlike any other forensic 
discipline that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, just to get back 
to the point you were making earlier, it really doesn't 
matter what the Congress said.  It is a question of 
rationality under the Constitution.

MR. NEUFELD:  That is -- that is correct.  I 
only use what Congress said and what the other 41 states 
said to illustrate how there is an overwhelming 
consensus now that to do it the way that Alaska wants to 
do it is frankly irrational.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is the irrationality 

ultimately that they require an assertion, with some 
basis for the assertion, that in fact there is evidence 
that would show innocence?  Is the irrationality the 
cart before the horse?

 MR. NEUFELD:  I think I understand the 

question.  Please interrupt me if I don't and I 
apologize.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  You -- you were asked a 

question earlier what it was in effect about the Alaska 
procedure which -- which in effect was constitutionally 
frustrating.  I understood that you did not claim that 
the requirement to claim innocence was the problem, 
although they did require that; but that the -- that the 
real problem was that you not only had to claim 
innocence; you had to be in a position to claim that the 
evidence you were seeking would exonerate you.  And in 
the DNA case you couldn't do that, ultimately, until it 
had been testing.  And so it was that second point, in 
effect that they are putting the cart before the horse,

tell us what the test is going to show before you test 
it, that I thought was the sticking point for you.  Am I 
correct about your position?

 MR. NEUFELD:  You are correct; and 

Justice Souter, they never ever said in -- in their 
brief, in their petition for certiorari, that they 
believed that a condition for getting the test should be 
that a person swear out an affidavit asserting 
innocence.  They are raising that now in a reply brief a 
week before this oral argument.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, that goes -- that 

goes to the first point.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And I -- I was concerned 
with the second.  I will be happy to get back to the 
first, but I just want to know your position on the 
second, the cart before the horse point.

 MR. NEUFELD:  The second point is -- and 

that -- which is why the only rational test is the 
Catch-22 or cart before the horse that you're referring 
to -- which is we can't speculate, based on the other 
evidence, whether it's going to be a DNA exclusion or a 
DNA inclusion.  If you look at the amicus briefs that 
have been submitted here by exonerees, by people who 
received clemency, all kinds of people, you will see

cases where the evidence of guilt was much more 
overwhelming than it was here.  You will see cases where 
50 percent of the judges that reviewed those cases found 
the evidence to be very compelling evidence of guilt or 
indeed overwhelming evidence of guilt, but nonetheless 
DNA trumped all that evidence and excluded those.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you will see cases 

where the defendant maintained that the defendant was 
innocent.  Now, whether this was a requirement imposed 
by Alaska or not, it seems to me you cannot point to the 
practice of the other States and say Alaska must have 
the same practice.

 When, in fact, you don't comply with the 
practices of the other States.  Almost all of them do 
require an assertion of innocence, which your client has 
not made.  I cannot imagine how you can simply -- oh, 
look at all these other -- 44 other states, when your 
client does not meet the requirements that those States 
would impose.

 MR. NEUFELD:  I'm not ignoring it at all; 

I'm simply saying that 1983, by its very nature, doesn't 
require it, and Alaska practice --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why shouldn't --
MR. NEUFELD:  -- didn't require it, but if 

you do --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Whether 1983 requires it 

depends in part on whether we recognize a free-standing 
right to test DNA evidence.  As I -- as I conceive it, 
that sounds to me like substantive due process and 
rightly so.

 One condition for recognizing a substantive 
due process right could be that the individual claiming 
the right to test claims that he is actually innocent.

 What would unreasonable about that?
 MR. NEUFELD:  There would -- nothing be 

unreasonable about that, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is your client prepared to 

make that claim?

 MR. NEUFELD:  Your Honor, I assume he 

certainly would.  I --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm not asking you.  I'm 
asking for his position through counsel now.  Do you 
know?

 MR. NEUFELD:  I know he has told every other 

lawyer who has represented him that he was actually 
innocent.  I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Was his assertion 
before -- his confession -- his confessions before the 
parole board made under oath?

oath, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So he's guilty of 
perjury one way or the other, either before the parole 
board or in his assertions of actual innocence here.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, wouldn't it be ironic, 
Your Honor, if we do the DNA test and he's exonerated 
and it proves he didn't do it at all, then the State 
went ahead and prosecuted him for perjury because he did 
something just so he knew he could get out because, 
under Alaskan law, unless you accept responsibility, 
you're not going to get out.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, wouldn't it be 

ironic --

MR. NEUFELD:  Two of our --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Excuse me, counsel. 

Would it be ironic to say that you do not have access 
when you're guilty of perjury one way or the other?

 MR. NEUFELD:  I think that would be 

terrible.  If the -- if the primary goal of our criminal 
justice system or one of them is that someone who is 
actually innocent of the crime for which he is serving a 
sentence can't -- okay -- present the evidence that will 
win him his freedom.  He --

like any other governmental action, this action of 
refusing the DNA evidence is subject to the Fourteenth 
Amendment's requirement that there be a reasonable 
basis?  Can't be arbitrary.  Now, withholding DNA is a 
governmental action, and so you cannot do so 
arbitrarily.  If you were to do so simply because the 
defendant would not sign a new complaint under this new 
procedure, which I somehow missed in the reply brief, 
that's a good basis for withholding it.  He should be 
willing to do that.

 If the reason they won't give him the DNA is 
because before the parole board he said he was innocent, 
that, to me -- not to others but to me -- that would 
mean nothing.  Of course, he's going to say he's 
innocent.  He doesn't want to spend the rest of his life 
in prison.  Okay?

 So, I -- I would say, but not maybe others 
would say, that if that's their reason for not giving 
it, I'd hear further argument, but that would be 
arbitrary.  But if their reason for not giving it is 
just because he won't file a new piece of paper in which 
he says he's innocent or there's nothing to lose there, 
then I think the State's being arbitrary.  Okay?
 Suppose we said that:  The rule is 

non-arbitrary with illustrations, send it back to the

States.  And of course when they apply their own 
statutes, by and large they're not being arbitrary.

 MR. NEUFELD:  I think that's a very sound 

approach to this, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it does help you win.
 (Laughter.)
 MR. NEUFELD:  It has that added advantage, 

Justice Breyer.

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
 MR. NEUFELD:  But -- but, quite honestly, 

we've had two exonerees that are pointed out in the 
prosecutors' brief and in the exonerees' brief who did 
in fact that.  They actually said to the parole board, 
yes, they were guilty, because they knew that was the 
only way they could get out.  And then the DNA testing 
was done a couple of years later and, boom, it turned 
out they were completely innocent.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have a --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Sorry.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have a 

constitutional right to the DNA evidence if the accuracy 
of the test was the same as the one that your counsel 
submitted at trial?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well --

46 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, 

limits it to -- what was it -- 16 percent or something 
like that?

 MR. NEUFELD:  I think you would -- because 

number one --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, all right. 

Then, obviously, the next question is at level of 
accuracy does your constitutional right no longer apply?
 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, the constitutional right 

doesn't apply with a -- with a level of accuracy.  The 
constitutional right applies in prohibiting the State 
from arbitrarily preventing you access to the evidence. 
There's a very compelling record --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, just so to 
follow up on that -- so you -- if -- if the evidence 
showed that there was -- would show that there was a one 
out of two chance that your client was innocent, then 
you think you still have a right -- a constitutional 
right of access to that evidence?

 MR. NEUFELD:  No.  I think the reason you 
have it here, Your Honor, is that Alaska concedes -- I 
mean, when have you ever heard it before in a case? 
Alaska concedes that this powerful DNA test is so 
powerful that if he gets a favorable result, it is 
dispositive, he is actually innocent.  Okay.  That's how

powerful this is.

 And so when you try and compare this to 
other types of either earlier DNA or other types of 
scientific evidence, you can't.  And it's because of the 
unique power of these STRs, and the CODIS system, which 
allows for cold hits.  So, it's not just the 232 people 
who have been exonerated.  We've also identified --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So fingerprint --
fingerprints apparently are covered by it.  They have 
fingerprint evidence that they are not releasing.  So do 
you have a constitutional right of access to that 
evidence?

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, I know it's slightly 
outside the record, but just this week the National 
Academy of Science said that fingerprints don't have the 
same indicia of reliability that these DNA tests have.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I'm sure --
MR. NEUFELD:  And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sure they're not 
as accurate as the DNA tests.  I'm trying to figure out 
what the limit of the constitutional right you're 
asserting is.

 MR. NEUFELD:  The limit is -- the limit is 
-- it's the same limit, if you will, that the Innocence 
Protection Act articulated and at least 41 of the States

that passed acts have articulated, and by common law the 
other States all gave DNA testing, the ones that didn't 
have a statute, with the sole exception in the country 
being Alaska, is if there's either a reasonable 
probability that the DNA tests will -- that a favorable 
DNA test result can prove innocence, okay, and you did 
not -- you know -- that's the standard if you will, 
okay, to get the test.

 I would point out that I could understand 
people having some disagreement about where that bar 
should be in terms of how much proof of innocence the 
test would provide.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  How can this constitutional 
right be limited to DNA evidence?  I presume that there 
are -- that there may be other scientific advances in 
the testing of physical evidence, and if that happens, 
why wouldn't the right apply to those as well?  Advances 
in -- advances in detecting fingerprints or testing 
fibers or all sorts of other things?

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, again, fibers didn't do 
any better than fingerprints.  In fact, they did a lot 
worse in the National Academy report issued last week. 
I do think, however -- and I would hope that the day 
comes that will be more truth machines like DNA, which 
will make it easier for factfinders to have dispositive

evidence of guilt or innocence.  But right now, there's 
only one test that caused the President of the United 
States to appropriate billions of dollars for testing, 
that caused Congress to create a special statute saying, 
we don't even want this in habeas; we want this statute 
to be very special.  We'd like to give people --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I'd like to get back to the 
second part of the question I asked at the start, which 
you never really got a chance to answer:  Would it be 
unconstitutional for a State to say that a -- a prisoner 
can get postconviction access to DNA evidence, but not 
where it appears that the prisoner is gaming the system? 
Not where the prisoner declined at trial to ask for DNA 
testing for a tactical reason because there was a chance 
that the DNA evidence would be inculpatory?  Would that 
be unconstitutional?

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, first of all, in this 

case, that didn't happen.  The record is very clear that 
he personally requested the DNA testing, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  His counsel -- his counsel 
forwent the DNA testing, and we attribute the actions of 
counsel to the defendant.

 MR. NEUFELD:  And the prosecutor also 

forwent the DNA testing because they --

to Justice Alito's question -- a hypothetical, the one 
he put -- could you put that condition on a statute or a 
rule consistently with the constitutional of the United 
States?

 MR. NEUFELD:  I don't think so if you -- if 

you couch it in the loosest terms that Justice Alito 
did, namely, "gaming the system."  Because I don't 
believe a person in Mr. Osborne's position could ever be 
gaming the system.  Now, let me explain why so.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well -- well, let's assume 
that counsel and the defendant -- after full discussion 
and being fully advised, say this is too dangerous; we 
don't want the DNA test; we'll shoot the dice; we're not 
going to have the DNA test.  He loses.  Can you then get 
the DNA test?  Or, as Justice Alito's question pointed 
out, could you have a condition that when you've made 
this conscious choice, you lost your right for later DNA 
testing?  That's what he asked.  I still don't have the 
answer.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Okay.  I would say, yes, in 

much the same way that the Innocence Protection Act says 
if a defendant expressly and voluntarily waives on the 
record a right to that DNA testing, which is so 
fundamental because it goes right to the core of 
everything, innocence versus guilt, then it would not be

unreasonable to prohibit him from having the DNA test. 
But that was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sorry.  I'm sorry. 
With the different questions asked, I have lost where 
the answer is.  You say it is still part of the 
constitutional right if he forewent the test at trial, 
or it is not?

 MR. NEUFELD:  What I'm saying is it would 

not be an unconstitutional restriction like the 
Innocence Protection Act if the State of Alaska required 
-- which it does not now because there is no legislative 
scheme but in the future required -- that the -- a 
defendant who doesn't want DNA testing has to 
voluntarily and explicitly waive that on the record. 
That -- the voluntary and knowing waiver is a 
requirement in the IPA, and if -- if Alaska did 
something like that, I think that would be -- that would 
not be irrational.

 However, I must point out in all honesty 

that there are a number of people who are mentioned in 
the exonerating briefs such as Eduardo Velasquez and Mr. 
Tony, whose lawyers did just that.  They said, for 
strategic reasons, we don't want the DNA test.  And then 
-- boom -- years later they get the DNA test, and they 
are completely exonerated.  So --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you seem to be 

sympathetic to that position.  But as Justice Alito's 
question again points out, what you are doing is setting 
up a game in which it would be really unwise to have the 
DNA test.  Take your chances.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Why would it --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You have a -- you have a 

built-in -- you have a -- a built-in second chance.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Let's for a moment --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's just -- that's 

just not sound trial strategy, counsel, and you know 
that.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Justice Kennedy, let's for a 

moment think about it in a purely logical way.  If 
someone is innocent and wants to have a DNA test -- okay 
-- as Mr. Osborne did, they will do what they can to try 
and get that DNA test.

 If they get the DNA test years later, 

they're not getting a new hearing.  They are not getting 
a -- or they are not getting a new trial.  They are not 
getting any of the other things that this Court often is 
worried about.  All they are getting is a darn test. 
And they stay in prison while they get that darn test. 
And if that test shows that they actually committed the 
crime -- okay -- if it shows they committed the crime,

then they get nothing.

 Not only do they get nothing, they get 

punished.  They get punished because no -- no court in 
habeas or in any other postconviction relief will ever 
think about them again.  And, in fact, the parole board 
will --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they will have acquired 

the advantage of having a chance of the jury's 
acquitting them at the trial.  Because by not asking for 
the DNA testing, they was a chance the jury might let 
them off.  Had they asked for it then and had it shown 
conclusively, the game was over.  So it is gaming the 
system.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, the reason why I -- I 
don't believe it is gaming the system -- and perhaps, 
you know, you can help me with this -- is if he's 
getting the test now and he doesn't get out of prison 
while he's having the test and he's actually using his 
own money to pay for the test and if the test shows he's 
guilty, the parole board is going to turn him down.  He 
can't go back in any other courts asking for any other 
remedies.  So he is in a much worse position.

 On the other hand, if it proves he's 

innocent, then he's out.  So how does that game the 
system?

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ex-ante.  We're -- we're 
looking at it at the time of the trial.  Does its pay 
for the defendant to ask for a DNA test?  Well, of 
course, it doesn't.  Because if he asks for it and it --
it finds that he's guilty, that's the end of it.  There 
is no chance of the jury acquitting him.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well -- well, why --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So why not just not ask for 
it and if it turns out that the jury happens to convict 
him anyway, then ask for it?

 MR. NEUFELD:  In -- in all practice, it is a 
moot point.  Because this is a transitional right for a 
very small group of people who were tried during the 
1980s and early 1990s.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On that -- on that point, 

I just want to make clear:  In the present posture of 
this case, I take it that if the Federal Innocence 
Protection Act applied, he would not qualify?

 MR. NEUFELD:  No. He would -- he would 

qualify.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  He --
MR. NEUFELD:  All he would have to do is --
is go back and actually swear out a declaration under 
penalty of perjury --

case now stands he does not qualify.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, he's never been required 

to do that or asked to do that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  As the case now stands, he 

does not qualify.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Other than -- other than that, 

he meets every single other criterion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a biggie, though.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're -- you're, in 
effect, asking us -- and you would say the -- the 
Solicitor General appears here -- you're -- you're, in 
effect, asking us to say that the Federal Witness 
Protection Act on these facts is unconstitutional.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Oh, not at -- not at all, sir. 
All I'm saying is that if he was on notice that that was 
required as part of the procedure in Alaska, then no 
doubt he would sign that affidavit even under penalty of 
perjury.  The problem is that it's not a requirement of 
1983, and there was no legislative scheme.  I -- you 
know --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I am quite dubious that --
that he would indeed sign it.  I -- I was really struck 
by his affidavit in this case, number -- or paragraph 9 
of which says:  "I have no doubt whatsoever that 
retesting of the condom will prove once and for all

time" -- and one expects to follow -- my innocence. 
That's not what it says.  "Will prove once and for all 
time either my guilt or innocence."

 MR. NEUFELD:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, you know, what is 

this?

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, first of all, each and 
every time with his own counsel, Justice Scalia, he was 
adamant about asserting his innocence.  You have to 
appreciate that at this point in time, when there's a 
discussion about, you know, what a prize -- and it is 
our position that this action ends, if you will, okay, 
and the Court grants him access to the evidence under 
1983.

 And as was pointed out earlier during the 

argument of my adversary, there is a possibility that --
that the testing -- because, look, I wasn't at the -- at 
the commission of the crime.  I don't have a videotape 
in my head.  I'm trying to be as honest and forthright 
with you as I possibly can.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if there was a 
videotape?  Is that covered by the constitutional right 
you are asserting?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are there

MR. NEUFELD:  I don't think so.  Given what 

I now know about Photo Shop, I don't have -- I don't 
necessarily hold out that much reliability for that 
either, Justice Roberts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a good point. 

What -- how long under the Constitution does the State 
have to retain this evidence?

 MR. NEUFELD:  Under the Constitution there 
is no duty under current law to preserve the evidence. 
We --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would that be a 

corollary of the constitutional right you are asking for 
here?

 MR. NEUFELD:  I don't believe so.  I --

however, with one caveat.  And the one caveat is it is a 
different situation if a person like Mr. Osborne or 
somebody else specifically says, I want to do DNA 
testing in this case, files whatever appropriate 
procedure in whatever court to commence that action, and 
then, and only then, the other side goes out and 
destroys the res that is the subject of that litigation. 
At that point I think that would be in bad faith.

would be -- that -- yes.  I am just wondering if there 
would be any objection to an absolute rule that says 
what:  After two years, after one year of conviction?

 MR. NEUFELD:  No -- no objection.  But on a 
practical level again, what we're seeing is that States 
all over the country want to preserve this evidence, not 
just for the wrongful conviction cases but also to 
enable detectives who are working cold cases to have 
access to evidence.

 And if the evidence isn't there any more, 

they can't work them.  So we're seeing a movement across 
the country now to preserve that evidence.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  May I -- may I just ask 

one point.

 MR. NEUFELD:  Certainly.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I take it he is not now in 

custody for this offense?

 MR. NEUFELD:  I believe he is in custody --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Not for this offense?
 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, I -- I think what 

happened is -- and I -- and I -- I can't swear to this 
-- is -- is that he was -- he got a conditional release 
on the other matter.  And then the conditional release 
was violated as well.

changes.

 MR. NEUFELD:  That's right.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But he's not now in 

custody for this offense.

 MR. NEUFELD:  He's -- he's not, but I don't 

think that would make a difference in the outcome. 
Certainly, if a person had a death warrant in one State 
and then they were charged in another State, they would 
still have a liberty interest in the outcome of that 
other case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Was he released on 

parole with respect to this offense?

 MR. NEUFELD:  I -- I believe he -- he was 

released on what's called conditional release.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And was his 
confession a necessary predicate to that release?

 MR. NEUFELD:  Well, under Alaska law one of 

the key requirements to get parole is that you accept 
responsibility for the crime.  And so without a certain 
--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So a confession that 

would be perjurious if he claimed actual innocence now 
was responsible for his release?

actually innocent and they told me that the only way I 
could get out was to say I committed a crime, that I 
might say, forget it.  I'll spend the next thirty years 
in prison.  But I can certainly understand --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand that.
 MR. NEUFELD:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But he's been --

other than other crimes he committed, he's been released 
on the basis of what you say is an unprincipled 
confession.  And now he is --

MR. NEUFELD:  I believe he has been -- he's 

back in, though, I think, because of the conditional 
release.  It's been violated.  One second.

 He had a parole -- I'm -- I'm told that he 
had a parole revocation hearing on the other case and 
that he was given six more years to serve on the -- on 
the underlying case which is the core of this oral 
argument.

revoked because he committed another offense?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. ROSENSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I -- before you start, 

would you -- I want you to clear up the question that 
Justice Breyer asked.  Assume on remand he would now 
make the declaration under perjury that he's innocent. 
I understood you to say that would enable him get 
discovery, not necessarily to say he would get the DNA 
evidence.  Am I right?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  If he were to file a new 

application for postconviction relief with an affidavit 
that the civil rules of discovery would apply, and he, I 
believe, would be -- be able to obtain the evidence that 
he seeks.  However --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you resist that 

request?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Well, there are -- there 
are possibilities of procedural default.  Right.  And 
that would be for the court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You cannot confirm that 
you would acquiesce and recommend that he get the DNA 
sample under those conditions?

could.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you would still want 
to leave yourself open to make the objection that he had 
a chance to get this at trial and -- and -- and decided 
not to get it.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  As I say --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wouldn't those objections 

continue to apply?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  I'm --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, it -- it seems to 
me that -- that all -- all that you have to concede is 
that there is some means for him to get into court, with 
those -- those exceptions that other States make; and 
other States make an exception for gaming the system. 
So, so long as he can get in in habeas corpus it seems 
to me you can very well leave for later whether you are 
going to concede that even though -- even though he 
didn't ask for it at trial, he can get it now.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That's true, Your Honor. 

And -- and that was --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why give it away?

you do --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why don't we -- I'm 

sorry.  Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.  I just want to be --
if your answer, as I understand it, is he can now apply 
for discovery, but you don't know what will happen then.
 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Well, before you reach the 
discovery issues there would be the issues of procedural 
default.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.
 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Once those were cleared 

away then he would be able to --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the net result is that 

it is perfectly clear to me from the argument that you 
have not conceded that if he now files the paper, he 
will definitely get the DNA.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Not that he would -- that's 

correct.  Not that he will definitely get that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Okay.
 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  I want to clear up --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- you referred 
to the civil rules, and in discovery, in criminal cases 
as in civil cases, it -- ordinarily you have to prove 
that you have a basis for a claim.  Like you don't get

on the civil side discovery before you can pass the 
12(b)(6) threshold that you have stated a claim.

 Are you giving that up here?  Because he's 
seeking the discovery but he hasn't established that he 
has a tenable claim.

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, Mr. 

Osborne by filing an affidavit that would accompany his 
application, that would -- I think that would operate to 
state a claim.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would there be instances 

when you, as the Attorney General of Alaska, would waive 
procedural defaults, in order to determine if there was 
guilt or innocence in a case where DNA conclusively 
proved it, simply pause of your interest in not 
confining innocent people?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  That -- that's conceivable, 
Your Honor; but in -- in Mr. Osborne's case, he's had 14 
years to step forward and declare his innocence as any 
truly innocent --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All you're can say in 

answer to my question is, to your particular approach to 
your duties here, is that that's conceivable?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Yes, Your Honor.  It is.

possibility that DNA could exonerate is necessarily

sufficient -- a sufficient basis to then do the testing.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  This is where I --

look.

 He files a new piece of paper.  Now, if 
you're going to oppose that, on the ground that it 
wasn't procedurally correct, one; on the ground, two, he 
didn't ask for this DNA at trial, though he might have 
met with the charge, what was at issue at trial is 
something very different; three, that he wasn't 
guilty -- you know, too much evidence against him, met 
with the claim, there wasn't much evidence against 
him -- okay, we have the case in front of us; we'll 
decide it.

 But if you're prepared to concede "I'm not 

going to raise those things," then their client has what 
he wants -- the DNA.  So which is it?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  I -- I'm not sure I 

understand your -- your question, Your Honor.  I'm 
sorry.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm going to just repeat 
it.  He -- His client follows your procedure.  "Please 
give me DNA."

 Now will you give it to him?  Or are you 

going to meet him with the same defenses that you raise

MR. ROSENSTEIN:  The --

ask -- you could have gotten it at trial, which he says 
isn't true, and there was too much evidence, which he 
says isn't true.  Okay?  So what are we going to have, 
Mr. Rosenstein?

 MR. ROSENSTEIN:  If he -- if he were to do 

as you say, then with respect to the request for 
discovery, I believe that our only defense would be the 
procedural defense of -- you know -- lack of due 
diligence or -- or something along -- or untimely --

procedure --

perjury, "Please let me look at the DNA," as I

then raise issues of procedural default, waiver, et 
cetera.  You will not say, on the contrary, "let him 
look at the DNA."  Is that -- is my understanding
