(10:16 a.m.)


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 00-1543, Festo Corporation v. Shoketsu Kinzoku


Kogyo Kabushiki.  I hope I got that right. 


(Laughter.) 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Mr. Bork.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BORK:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the


Court:


I refer to them as SMC. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BORK:  The Federal circuit's rules in this


case ought to be reversed because it flatly contradicts


this Court's decision in Warner-Jenkinson, and


furthermore, it radically undermines the patent system.  I


think Warner-Jenkinson should be reaffirmed because it's


in keeping with the Patent Act, with the goals and


policies of the patent system, and because it is much


fairer than the harsh inequities of this new rule which


this case presents a prime example. 


Warner -- let me discuss the crucial differences


between Warner-Jenkinson and the Federal circuit's new


rules.

 In the first place, Warner-Jenkinson holds that


prosecution history estoppel arises only when an amendment


to a patent surrenders subject matter -- and clearly


surrenders it -- in order to achieve patentability.  The


Federal circuit holds to the contrary that any narrowing


amendment, regardless of the reason for it, creates


prosecution history estoppel. 


Second, the Warner-Jenkinson case holds that the


reason for an amendment determines whether an estoppel is


created.  The Federal circuit denies that and holds that


the reason is irrelevant, and if an amendment has the


narrowing effect, intended or not, it creates a complete


estoppel.  Thus, if the patent examiner said he found the


claims to be imprecise and the applicant made an amendment


to clarify what the examiner thought was imprecise, that


might be held to be a narrowing amendment and the patent


would be unenforceable.  And that is what happened to


Festo in this case.  And those results cannot be squared


with Warner-Jenkinson. 


Third, the Federal circuit holds that an


amendment creates an estoppel if it applies to any of the


statutory requirements for obtaining a patent, not just


patent -- not just patentability as defined by the Patent


Act, but any of the requirements for obtaining a patent.


Now, the Patent Act makes clear a distinction

between patentability and other requirements.  Sections


101 through 103 come under the heading of patentability of


inventions, and they state the substantive requirements


for getting a patent.  The invention must be new and


useful.  It must be not found in the prior art, and it


must not be obvious.  Those are the only elements of


patentability known in the law.  And this Court's opinion


in Graham against John Deere confirms that.  No other


requirement of the statute relates to patentability. 


The Federal circuit holds to the contrary, that


an amendment affecting any of the statutory requirements


for getting a patent may generate estoppel, and those


requirements include sections 111 and 112 of the act.  But


those sections relate to the form of the application and


not to the subject matter sought to be patented. 


QUESTION:  Is it clear most of the time, Mr.


Bork, whether the amendment is for purposes of 103, 111,


and 112?  Can you pick up the patent history and -- and


tell at a glance whether it's a 103 or a 111 and 112


purpose that generated the amendment? 


MR. BORK:  I think one can.  For example, in


this case you'll see in the Stoll patent -- there are two


patents, of course, in play here, the Stoll patent and the


Carroll patent.  In this case, the patent examiner says


that he objects on the grounds that the claim is stated in

an improper form, is multiply dependent, and also that


it's imprecise.  He's not sure what it means.  Now, that


is quite clear that those are 111 and 112 objections, not


to the subject matter sought to be patented. 


QUESTION:  But if you're the applicant and you


get that response from the Patent Office, during the


course of the amendment might you not rethink and -- and


clarify what you're doing under 103 as well?  That's


what --


MR. BORK:  Oh, if the -- if the applicant


decides to amend in a way that surrenders subject matter,


it disclaims subject matter, the fact that the process


began with a -- with the examiner's on grounds of form


doesn't affect it.  If he surrenders subject matter, that


subject matter is gone and the equivalents to it are gone


too. 


QUESTION:  But wasn't that the argument here


with reference to the seals and the magnetized or


demagnetized cylinder? 


MR. BORK:  There was an argument to that effect,


but if you look at the patent -- at the prosecution


history which is of both the Stoll and the Carroll


patents, which are in the volume 2 of the transcript,


there is no abandonment of any subject matter. 


In the Stoll patent, there is no abandonment of

subject matter.  In the Carroll patent, there is. 


However, the subject matter which was abandoned had no


relevance to the lawsuit.  It wasn't what was -- what was


sued on, so that there is, in operational terms, no


disclaimer or surrender of subject matter in either of


these patents. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Bork, both the Solicitor General


and an amicus, the IEEE, suggest that a -- a different


flexible bar test would be appropriate.  Would you comment


on those two proposals? 


MR. BORK:  Justice O'Connor, I think they're


much too narrow.  The only rationale that makes any sense


as to a flexible bar proposal or any bar proposal is that


if you've disclaimed something, then the equivalent of


subject matter -- the equivalents to the disclaimed


subject matter are barred by estoppel, but other


equivalents that don't go to what was surrendered are not


barred.  Therefore, the -- the rule of the -- the bar, the


question of the scope of the bar, relates closely to the


question -- the first question presented in this case --


QUESTION:  Let's say there's --


MR. BORK:  -- as to what was surrendered. 


QUESTION:  Let's say there's an amendment under


103 where -- where you agree that there can be an


estoppel.  Should there be a presumption there?

 MR. BORK:  A presumption -- if there is a clear


surrender, there's no presumption.  It's -- it's a -- it's


a waiver.  It's -- you've estopped yourself.  If it's


unclear what -- why you have done it, then this Court in


Warner-Jenkinson says there be a remand under a


presumption that what you did was for purposes of


patentability, what you surrendered was for purposes of


patentability, and if you cannot rebut that presumption,


then you lose. 


QUESTION:  Wasn't it more, Mr. Bork, than just a


presumption if you couldn't -- I thought Warner-Jenkinson


said where you do not establish any reason for the


amendment, the Court did use the word presume.  It said


the Court should presume that the patent application has a


substantial reason relating to patentability.  And then


the following sentence is, in those circumstances,


prosecution history estoppel would bar the application of


the doctrine of equivalents.  So, that sounds to me like


an absolute bar rule, that if you don't -- if the reason


is unexplained, the consequence is a complete bar. 


MR. BORK:  Oh, well, consequence is a bar as to


that.  Yes, as to that area.  But I guess I perhaps didn't


express myself well. 


If the appellate court, this Court, looks and


says, I don't know the reason -- as in Warner-Jenkinson,

it was unclear why there was a lower limit of pH 6 set on


that process -- I don't know -- I don't know why you


amended to set that lower limit, there is a presumption


that you did it for a reason related to patentability,


which would create a complete bar.  However, on remand,


you get a chance to rebut that presumption with evidence. 


If you don't rebut it, it's a bar. 


QUESTION:  The -- the Federal circuit is


supposed to be an expert in this and they say that


inventors or people who are trying to invent things are


supposed to be able to read the claims, and that's it. 


And if you didn't make your claim properly, particularly


when you had a second chance, that's your problem, and any


other system -- any other system is going to really go


back to what used to be called central claiming where the


claims point to rather than define the invention.  And


that's just not workable today.  We'll get an equivalents


claim in every case.  And so, let's make an exception


where the lawyer couldn't really do anything about it. 


That's called unforeseeability. 


MR. BORK:  Well, the fact --


QUESTION:  With that possible exception, which


they maybe should have mentioned but didn't, it's up to


the lawyer and it's his fault.  And the reason is if he


didn't do it properly, we punish him because we have to

have certainty for people who want to invent other things. 


Now, that I take it is the heart of what's being said on


the other side, and I'd like to know your response. 


MR. BORK:  Well, there are a couple of responses


to that, Justice Breyer. 


In the first place, let me say that the solution


the Federal circuit has devised is -- doesn't relate to


the problem.  If the problem is the unworkability of the


equivalents test, then the answer is to abolish


equivalents, not to -- and that doesn't depend on whether


or not there's been an amendment.  And if you're going to


abolish equivalents, the way to do it, so that you don't


have this terrible retroactive effect, is to have the


Patent and Trademark Office engage in a rulemaking


function, a rulemaking which has a prospective effect


only, or have Congress sit down and do a rule -- legislate


that has a prospective effect only. 


QUESTION:  Would the PTO have authority to do


that by regulation in the absence of congressional


authorization? 


MR. BORK:  I think it has authorization to do --


to make rules of that sort, Mr. Chief Justice.


But on the -- on the question that -- I'm sorry,


Justice Breyer. 


QUESTION:  They're not arguing for abolition.

They're not arguing for abolition. 


MR. BORK:  No --


QUESTION:  They're arguing for hold the lawyer


to a very tough standard, but a small equitable exception


in the instance where the lawyer really couldn't really do


anything about it, namely where it's not foreseeable that


this kind of really copied device is going to come


about --


MR. BORK:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- because the language isn't -- you


know, English doesn't work perfectly, the English


language, and because there could be future inventions


that might cause that to be unforeseeable. 


MR. BORK:  That is true, but what they have


suggested in effect is that the lawyer put into the


literal claims he files a claim for all the equivalents


that he can foresee.  Now, he can't foresee most of the


equivalents, and if he did that, I think you'd have a


patent claim that would look roughly like the tax code.


QUESTION:  No, because they have ways of doing


it.  They say all the things like, or they say -- you


know, I can't remember.  There's a special technical word


for it where you -- you try to do it in terms of function. 


There are ways of doing it. 


MR. BORK:  Function, way and result.

 QUESTION:  And the briefs are filled -- you


know, the briefs are filled with them, how -- how easy it


is.  The other side says, no, no, it's very easy, and your


side says, oh, really?  It isn't so easy. 


MR. BORK:  Well, you're referring, I think,


Justice Breyer, to the testing of -- for equivalents


called function, way and result? 


QUESTION:  No, no.  I'm not thinking -- I'm not


thinking that.  I'm thinking there's a -- there is a way


of drafting a claim where you put in the claim -- you


don't describe the thing exactly.  You describe what the


thing does. 


MR. BORK:  Well, if you do that, Justice Breyer,


I don't think you've solved the problem of unworkability. 


I don't think it's unworkable in the first place, but I


don't think you've solved the problem of the litigation


that's going to take place and the difficulty judges are


going to have in distinguishing the case that is covered


from the case that is not covered.  I think it's exactly


the same problem as you'd get with the application of the


doctrine of equivalents. 


QUESTION:  May I ask?  I've had a lot of trouble


understanding this patent, to be very honest with you. 


Some patents I can understand.  This one I found very


difficult.  And one of your -- the changes, as I

understand it, is in the early draft of the claim there


was no reference to the nonmagnetic material that was used


in the tube and that that was the -- that was one of the


changes that -- that was made.  And your suggestion is


that was -- had nothing to do with the subject --


patentability.  It's just change of description or


something like that, if I understand you. 


But the patent itself seems to be a patent on a


magnetic relationship between different elements of the --


of the item, and just at first blush, it seemed to me that


a -- that a -- an element that described a nonmagnetic


material would be rather important.  And your position is


it's of no importance.  Could you just comment a little


bit on this problem for me --


MR. BORK:  Yes, the --


QUESTION:  -- so I can get a better


understanding of it? 


MR. BORK:  The Festo patent specified a


magnetized material in the tube, and SMC used a aluminum


alloy. 


QUESTION:  This is in the Stoll patent I think,


isn't it? 


MR. BORK:  Yes. 


And SMC used a aluminum alloy, which is not


magnetizable material.  However, it does conduct magnetism

well enough -- very slightly, but well enough -- to


complete the circuit and to do what the Festo patent does


so that it is an equivalent in that sense to the


magnetizable sleeve.  If it were pure aluminum, it


wouldn't conduct the magnetism, but it isn't.  It's an


alloy. 


QUESTION:  Suppose that I was going to buy your


product and I knew what the German patents contained and


you were trying to sell it to me, and I asked you this. 


What does your product do that the product covered by the


German patents doesn't do?  What would you say? 


MR. BORK:  Well, I think I would -- I would


point to the sealing rings and the magnetizable --


QUESTION:  Exactly, and -- and therefore, they


are saying that's at the heart of this thing.  The sealing


rings enabled the -- enabled you to use a larger piston


because it could come closer to the side of the cylinder. 


And here they've copied -- they -- they -- so, you defined


it this way, we didn't follow it. 


MR. BORK:  I beg your pardon?  You defined it


this way and they didn't follow it?  They did follow it.


The only difference between their -- our claim said four


rings:  two guide rings and two sealing rings.  They had


two guide rings and one sealing ring. 


QUESTION:  Exactly, but the heart of your

invention was a way of wiping the inside of the tube --


MR. BORK:  The outside. 


QUESTION:  -- as I understand it, so that the


piston could come closer to the inside of the tube.  And


you defined that by using two rings.  And they say, well,


that's what the heart of the invention was, these two


rings, and we didn't use two rings. 


MR. BORK:  They used --


QUESTION:  We used one ring. 


MR. BORK:  They used one ring which performed


exactly the same function. 


QUESTION:  That's -- you say it performed


exactly the same.  They say it didn't quite work quite as


well.

MR. BORK:  Well --


QUESTION:  And now this is the heart of the


MR. BORK:  I don't know that they --


QUESTION:  The -- let me show you why.  Because


the Federal circuit is saying inventors generally have to


put this kind of an issue before a jury or a judge who


doesn't understand it too well.  And that's why there's a


lack of certainty and that's why we have to have the rule


we have. 


MR. BORK:  If they put before the jury or the

judge the question of whether a narrowing has taken place,


they'll be litigating just as much and there will be just


as much uncertainty as there is on whether this thing is


substantially the same as that thing.  You -- this -- one


thing this new rule does not do is eliminate uncertainty. 


In fact, we will -- it just shifts the area of litigation,


so that I don't think that anything is solved by this. 


It just -- nothing is solved by it and you pay


an enormous price in terms of future patents.  If you look


at future patents, the future patentee knows he's not


going to get the same protection he had before because if


he dares to amend -- and almost all patents are amended. 


It's just inevitable.  That's the way -- that's the way


the process goes.  If he's -- if he amends and if an


amendment is requested by the examiner, he can either


refuse it and appeal.  That adds about 4 years to the


time, to the 2 years the prosecution history usually


takes.  Now, the patent started running when you filed. 


So, now you've lost 6 years, the most valuable years under


your patent.  And nobody is going to like that. 


Or he can turn to the trade secret system, or he


can file a claim so narrow that they -- they don't fully


protect what he's invented but also that don't require


amendments.  The -- if you -- if you get patents of that


sort, which are of very little value, you don't protect

the innovation function that patents are supposed to


protect.  Pfizer and other amici have pointed out that to


get a drug to market costs in excess of $100 million. 


Nobody is going to spend over $100 million to


commercialize a product that cannot be protected.  So,


you've done -- you've done an enormous amount of damage to


the innovation process in this thing. 


Worse --


QUESTION:  Mr. Bork, --


MR. BORK:  -- the people who are really hard hit


are the people, -- the 1,200,000 patents that are


outstanding now because those people had no warning.  When


they -- when they got their patents, amendments were


freely made, and that was just the way it worked.  The


examiner and the patent attorney sat down and they


exchanged views and they worked it out and they amended to


satisfy the examiner.  Now all of those patents are


virtually worthless, which is a --


QUESTION:  May I just ask you a question about


they're virtually worthless because the doctrine of


equivalents is not available to those patentees?  That's


-- that's basically the point, is it? 


MR. BORK:  That's right.  Well, that's right. 


QUESTION:  Now, the one thing I didn't --


there's a volume of briefs in the file here and I can't

say I've read them all, but do the briefs anywhere tell us


what percentage of all -- successful infringement claims


rest on the doctrine of equivalents? 


MR. BORK:  I don't recall that the briefs ever


do tell us that. 


QUESTION:  Because your assumption is that a


very significant portion must be based on --


MR. BORK:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Well --


QUESTION:  Because there's a lot of -- a lot of


cases in which it's just an infringement, a literal


infringement.


MR. BORK:  That's true, but if a -- if a --


QUESTION:  And that area is not touched by this.


MR. BORK:  No, but if a copyist wants to avoid


literal infringement, he takes an amended element and


alters it slightly, and he's home free under the Federal


circuit rule.  And that's what happened here.  You have a


device which, for all practical purposes, is identical to


the Festo patents and has now destroyed the value of the


Festo patents because Festo didn't foresee back in the


1980's, when it got these patents, that the Federal


circuit was going to change the law as it has in 1997. 


And I --


QUESTION:  Or it didn't foresee that there


wasn't really a big difference between nonmagnetic

material and magnetic material.  I'm not using the right


words, but it didn't foresee that something he -- they


described as significant in the claims was really not


significant. 


MR. BORK:  Well, it's significant enough.  The


-- the fact is that the aluminum alloy -- the alloy makes


it perform the same function as the magnetizable material,


and what they didn't foresee was that the law was going to


change so that the amendment was going to destroy their


patent.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bork, would you -- would you


comment on the Federal circuit's view that they weren't


really changing anything, but they had two inconsistent


lines of decisions?  One was the complete bar rule and the


other was the flexible rule.


MR. BORK:  I think they had two decisions that


in -- in some sense were regarded as -- they claimed to be


complete bar rules.  I think that's a -- that's quite a


stretch.  If you look at the uninterrupted Supreme Court


precedent, there is no case like what the Federal circuit


has done now.  The doctrine of equivalents has been around


for over 150 years, and this Court has consistently


applied it.  And they -- there was no complete bar in the


Supreme Court jurisprudence.  I don't think there's much


-- any complete bar in the Federal circuit jurisprudence

either, but whatever it was, everybody went forward on the


understanding that the kind of law that was reaffirmed in


Warner-Jenkinson was the law. 


And that's why I find it particularly odd that


the Government should say that those people are charged


with knowledge back then of what was going to happen now.


And that is doubly odd because the Government in


Warner-Jenkinson filed a brief taking the position that we


take here today, and now they say that we should have


known better.  They didn't know better.  I don't know how


we would know better.


I should like to reserve the remainder of my


time, if I may. 


QUESTION:  May I ask you, before you step down,


whether you think there's a relevant difference between


claim elements and claim limitations? 


MR. BORK:  I think -- I think they're two words


for the same thing.

Government has changed its position from the time it filed

its brief in Warner-Jenkinson.  Do you agree with that?


MR. WALLACE:  I do not, Mr. Chief Justice.  We


did say that amendments made to avoid prior art and


amendments made for other purposes relating to securing


the patent present different problems because amendments


made to avoid prior art are almost always narrowing


amendments, and we think that the Federal circuit, in


speaking of narrowing amendments, really was speaking of


surrendering subject matter which is the formulation that


the petitioner prefers; whereas, amendments made for other


purposes have to be scrutinized with particular care


because they often are not narrowing amendments.  And


indeed, in some of the post-Festo decisions of the Federal


circuit, the court has held that there was -- it was not a


narrowing amendment and therefore there's no bar. 


But they can be narrowing amendments.  They can


be, even though in the guise of addressing the examiner's


concern under 112, they could actually be narrowing the


subject matter of the claim.  And in that instance, the --


the estoppel would apply. 


QUESTION:  How does one figure that out?  Give


us a -- an example.  Part of the argument is this is very


difficult to figure out, that -- that the new system


that's -- that's been brought in is -- is as complicated


to administer in -- in the courts as -- as the old.

 MR. WALLACE:  A simple example would be in


Warner-Jenkinson itself.  If there was an addition of a


limitation on the pH levels from 6 to 9 in the amendment,


if the examiner in that case had said that the


specifications are not clear enough and that amendment was


added in response to that, even though the examiner had


raised other concerns, but the applicant purported to add


that limitation in response to the examiner's concerns


about the specificity, it still would be adding a


limitation and it would be an implied disclaimer of 


subject matter in comparison with the initial claim.  And


our view would be that estoppel would apply.


QUESTION:  But the idea of estoppel, as I


understand it, is that a person is prevented from taking


contrary positions, and it seems to me in your example


that it's not necessarily a contrary position. 


MR. WALLACE:  Well, it's contrary in the sense


of what fair inferences can be drawn by the public from


the record of the prosecution history.  When he started


off -- the applicant started off without this limitation


and then added the limitation, the limitation speaks for


itself in narrowing the scope of the claim elements.  And


that -- that is the central problem of this case. 


If prosecution history estoppel is to have


meaningful effect, once we settle where it applies, which

seems to me to be the lesser question, it necessarily


follows, if it's to have meaningful effect, that the claim


elements that have been narrowed by the patent applicant,


in order to secure the issuance of the patent, cannot be


afforded the same or almost the same protection against


non-literal infringement that would be available to them


under the doctrine of equivalents if they had not been


narrowed.


QUESTION:  Is there -- is there a way of doing


this?  Look, the Federal circuit itself thinks that its


rule is a crude effort to deal with a problem that may


have the adverse consequences that -- that Mr. Bork


predicted.  And if so, they'll want to change their minds. 


Now, is there a way under the law that they could have the


authority to change their minds if it turns out that this


experiment doesn't work? 


MR. WALLACE:  Well, I -- I think so.  These are


doctrines that have been developed.  Prosecution history


estoppel and its effects are really equitable in origin,


and the courts have the authority to reexamine the


application of equitable doctrines in light of experience.


The -- the real question here, as we see it, is


what -- how do you reconcile the inferences that are


legitimately to be drawn by the public with the


patentholder's need for protection from unfair copying.

And this is not a matter of small moment because if -- the


doctrine of equivalents does not apply, but the all-


elements test still is applicable, as the opinions below


reflect, to claims of literal infringement or non-literal


infringement. 


So, we have suggested an answer that we draw


directly from this Court's decisions.  We first look at


Exhibit Supply, a 1942 decision, in which the Court said


that when the applicant narrows the claim, he necessarily


is recognizing the difference between what was originally


acclaimed -- claimed and what the narrowing amendment


claims, and there's an implied disclaimer of all that is


embraced within that difference.  And he's recognizing the


significance of that difference.  And it -- the Court


cited a number of its prior decisions at that time. 


So, we think that applicants have been fairly on


notice that prosecution history estoppel does apply to


narrowing amendments and that there is considerable risk


in narrowing claims and that they have to do that with


great care with that in mind. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, the Government is


proposing a change, a backing off from what the CAFC did,


but proposing some new formulation or test.  How does the


test you propose differ from that proposed by the


Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers do you

think? 


MR. WALLACE:  Well, I think they take -- they


start from what --


QUESTION:  They -- they key it into


foreseeability somehow. 


MR. WALLACE:  Yes, but they start by assuming


the validity of the flexible bar rule and trying to


tighten it a little bit.  We think that the court of


appeals was right. 


QUESTION:  And so do you apparently. 


MR. WALLACE:  Well, we -- we think the court of


appeals was right in saying that the way the -- it has


been applying the flexible bar rule did not properly


recognize what had been surrendered in the course of the


prosecution history estoppel.  But we -- we come out in


much the same place at the end even though the differences


between those and the Federal Bar Association also


recommends a presumption and shift of the burden of proof


similar to ours, but they're -- they're unwilling to


recognize that everything, as the Court said in Exhibit


Supply, that was surrendered is necessarily part of the


implied disclaimer.  They say, well, even if you went down


to your 9 pH in Warner-Jenkinson, as long as you could


show that you could have claimed 10, we should treat that


the same as if you did claim 10.  We think that the

inferences to be drawn by the public from the prosecution


history estoppel are not that loose. 


But we do think the court of appeals went too


far in saying that applicants were on notice that an


absolute bar would necessarily apply to all claims, and we


have made our suggestions about burden of proof and


presumptions to afford further protection in cases where


the applicant -- the patentholder can show that it would


be unfair to treat --


QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, with respect to that,


your second possibility, the second kind of escape hatch


for the patentholder, as I understand it, relates to a


case in which, in effect, it was impossible to be any more


precise, to exclude any more precisely than they did.  My


question is, doesn't that in effect invite the


patentholder to make that kind of a claim in every case? 


And if that is, in fact, going to be an exception to


absolute bar, doesn't it mean that we're going to litigate


it in every case?


MR. WALLACE:  Well, we're quite worried about


that.  We caution that the versatility of language


requires skepticism about that, but we -- we were also


sensitive about the difficulties in some particular areas


of new technology, biotechnology, and the like, although I


pressed the Patent Office and they couldn't come up with a

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Wallace. 


Mr. Neustadt, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR I. NEUSTADT


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. NEUSTADT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


First, I'd like to direct a response to Justice


Breyer's question concerning that section of the statute


that -- that you were looking for.  That's 112, paragraph


6, which says that you can claim the function of an


element and you get protection for everything that has


that function if it is the same as what's in the


specification or its equivalent. 


Next, I'd like to address my attention to


Justice Stevenson's question with respect to literal


infringement and doctrine of equivalents infringement.  We


were faced with the same question and we made an analysis


of all the cases that were decided by the Federal circuit


in the year 2000.  We found that there were 31 cases that


either held for the patentee or indicated they were going


to hold for the patentee with respect to preliminary


injunction.  With respect to those cases, all but four


were literal infringement.  So, the answer to your


question, for the year 2000, is that 27 of the 31 cases

were directed to literal infringement and not -- not


doctrine of equivalents infringement. 


And you must keep in mind that the Federal


circuit in this case, with respect to the doctrine of


equivalents, didn't rule on the doctrine of equivalents in


general.  They only ruled on the doctrine of equivalents


with respect to when a patentee switches from one position


to another.  He starts with one claim.  For some reason he


sees that in order to get his patent, he is going to have


to narrow. 


A good example is the example that Festo uses,


going from adhesives to glue.  You claim adhesives broadly


when you start.  You're going to get protection for all


adhesives.  Then you find there's prior art or something


else, maybe your specification isn't enabled, and you say


I'm going to have to go to glue. 


What the Federal circuit says for that


particular claim element, when you go from adhesives to


glue, you are telling the public that you're going to


rely --


QUESTION:  But may I just interrupt with this --


MR. NEUSTADT:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- this observation?  But -- but the


result of your rule is that if you do make that change and


go to -- to glue, you lose the doctrine of equivalents

with respect to that element, but someone who originally


framed the claim in the way that you ended up with does


not have the same opportunity to rely on equivalents that


you do.  Would you comment on that? 


MR. NEUSTADT:  That is correct. 


This was a point that this Court addressed in


Exhibit Supply and that is because claims are not


interpreted just as they stand.  They're interpreted in


accordance with their prosecution history.  Where you have


an original claim that has no prosecution history, then


it's much tougher for the public to read and figure out


what -- what glue or adhesives mean.  But where you have


this change from one position to another, a change that


every patent attorney resists, then the Federal circuit


says this is a narrowing that the public is entitled to


rely upon.  So, there -- there is a very significant


change even though you have the exact same words. 


To refer to Mr. Breyer's question about whether


or not the Federal circuit has the power to change what


they've done, the answer is, of course, prosecution


history estoppel is judge-made law.  There is no statute


concerning it. 


QUESTION:  This is scarcely an encouraging view.


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  I mean, if -- if we're looking for

some sort of certainty in the area, to say that the


Federal circuit has now come up with a relatively new


doctrine but they're free to change it if it doesn't work


is not the most auspicious recommendation for that


doctrine.


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  I presume it would be changed


retroactively, just as it was introduced retroactively.


MR. NEUSTADT:  Well, I don't -- I don't think


it's going to be changed, and I don't think there's


anything retroactive because the Federal circuit decision


was entirely consistent with this Court's precedent in


Exhibit Supply and also Warner-Jenkinson.  In Exhibit


Supply, this Court said that where a patentee makes a


change to avoid prior art for that particular element, he


disclaims and abandons everything between --


QUESTION:  But the Federal circuit went further


than that here.  It doesn't have to be a change just to


avoid prior art, does it? 


MR. NEUSTADT:  That is correct, Your Honor.  But


what they did was follow what this Court said in Warner-


Jenkinson concerning what relates to patentability.  The


Court in Warner-Jenkinson said -- this Court -- that --


that we have used this with respect to prior art, citing


Exhibit Supply, but they didn't say it is limited to prior

art.  What the Federal circuit then said --


QUESTION:  But in -- in the John Deere case,


certainly the term patentability was used just for that


purpose. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  For prior art? 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  I'm not sure, Your Honor. 


What the Federal circuit did was they said --


and there was almost virtually unanimity on the court, 11


to 1 -- that when you make this narrowing for a purpose


related to patentability or for a statutory requirement


for patentability, then the public can view that and


recognize and rely upon it.  So, the extension from, if


you will, 102 and 103 to 112 was of very little extension


at all. 


QUESTION:  Well, are you using the term


patentability to include 112? 


MR. NEUSTADT:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  I mean, that's part of the problem


here. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  Yes, yes. 


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I think that's one of the


issues in this case. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  Well, 112 is not just a matter of


form.  112 is addressed to some of the most important

issues for a patent application, such as whether or not


the application enables the invention.  The quid pro quo


for the public with respect to giving the exclusivity to


the patentee is they get an enabling disclosure.  If there


is no enabling disclosure, then the public gets nothing. 


Enabling disclosure is 112, so 112 is just not form. 


If you are talking about form and clarification,


usually when you clarify a claim, you don't narrow it and


so the result is that would not be controlled by the


Federal circuit rule. 


What the Federal circuit --


QUESTION:  Well, is -- is that really so?  I


mean, every time you have a vague claim, you at least have


an opportunity to say, well, it covers more than a


contrasting narrow claim would be.  So, I'm not sure that


you can draw this categorical distinction. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  Usually when a patent attorney


wants to -- is concerned with narrowing his claim, he


doesn't want to narrow his claim because he gets less for


his client.  He will try to clarify it in a way that


doesn't narrow, if that is the examiner's concern.  So,


usually clarifications are not narrowings and are not


affected by the Federal circuit rule.


What the Federal circuit issue is -- is directed


to is actually changing a position for a statutory

requirement for patentability.  That can be prior art.  It


can be non-enabling disclosure.  For example, this Court


has held in Crawford v. Heysinger in the 1800's -- applied


prosecution history estoppel to a inoperability rejection


which was a 112 rejection.  And so, this is the reason why


the Federal circuit had very little difficulty and ended


up with an 11-to-1 vote when they said that, yes,


amendments are not limited to avoid prior art.  They cover


other instances where you narrow. 


And the key -- the key is narrowing.  Patent


attorneys hate to narrow.  It gives their clients less


protection.  They don't want to narrow unless the only


choice is not getting a patent.  So, they put that


narrowing language in there.  And all that the Federal


circuit is saying when they put that narrowing language in


there, they should be held to it.  And the reason they're


held to it is because of the public --


QUESTION:  Well, they're saying more than that. 


They're saying they're held to it for the entire element,


and that's where I have -- have great problems with --


with what the circuit does.  And -- and it seems to me a


vast extension over what we thought about in Warner-


Jenkinson. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  In -- in Warner-Jenkinson this


Court said that if we do not know the reason for the

amendment, we're going to presume that it relates to


patentability, and when we make that presumption, if it's


not rebutted, it will act as a bar.  So, this Court in


Warner-Jenkinson set forth a complete bar.  Complete bar


is nothing new. 


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't that enough?  Why --


why is an additional rule sought? 


MR. NEUSTADT:  The -- the additional rule


relates to the fact that in the Federal circuit, not in


this Court, there was what was called a flexible bar rule,


and what they did was if you initially claimed glue and


came back to adhesives and then -- I'm sorry -- you


claimed adhesives and then you had to narrow it to glue,


then in a lawsuit you found someone using adhesives, you


would then say, well, my glue is really the same as


adhesives under the doctrine of equivalents.  And the


Federal circuit in this decision is saying that you can't


do that. 


But previously the Federal circuit had the


flexible bar rule, and the flexible bar rule said that if


you went from adhesives to glue, and you didn't have to go


all that way to glue -- maybe you could have stopped


somewhere in between -- they say you can then look at


where you might have been able to stop.  This is in the


Intel brief, could have, should have, and would have.  And

they say we can take it back to something in between


adhesives and glue.  And the problem with that is that the


public has no notice of what the claim covers.  Someone


out there who wants to innovate in the area between glue


and adhesives has to know what he can do, and the Federal


circuit rule enables them now to say that, yes, that claim


means glue and we don't have to worry about something if


we don't use glue.  And --


QUESTION:  How would the SG's test apply to


that, do you think? 


MR. NEUSTADT:  The -- the SG's test and also the


IEEE test that you referred to -- the SE says -- and his


-- his rule is a little better than the flexible bar rule.


The SG says we're going to have a complete bar


presumption, and the presumption is going to have to be


overcome by the patentee, and he's going to have to show


that this was unforeseeable.  But this rule has all of the


uncertainties that create all the problems with the


flexible bar rule, and therefore it really is not an


improvement. 


The court's decision has been in effect for 13


months.  It's really worked just fine.  There have been


really no problems.  Patent prosecution hasn't changed at


all.  There haven't been any cases that follow that --


QUESTION:  Can you give me -- can you give me

some sense as to how often patent applications are


amended?


MR. NEUSTADT:  I don't think there are any


statistics.  Patent applications -- I'd say 50 percent,


maybe more.  But -- but that doesn't distinguish between


amendments and narrowing amendments.  Usually it's the


narrowing amendments that -- that trigger the Federal


circuit rule. 


And with respect to --

going to transfer now the load to the appeals within the


Patent Office and we're going to have this long, long

QUESTION:  And it seems to me that that --


that's a -- a very serious consequence if -- if it in fact


will follow.

consequence and that just isn't happening in the PTO.  You


see nothing in the SG PTO brief.


QUESTION:  Well, maybe everybody is waiting for

MR. NEUSTADT:  The -- that may be but the


Federal circuit has -- has been applying this case in all

of its cases.  It's simplified a lot of the decisions. 


What it's meant is that patent attorneys can now advise


their clients that, yes, you can do this; no, you can't do


that.  Whereas, under the flexible bar rule, they were


unable to do so.


In -- in -- when you claim, the claiming is


central to -- to the system -- to our system.  The


applicant has a disclosure.  From that disclosure, he can


decide what it is he wants to claim, and he can claim


various elements and he usually does it as broadly as


possible.  The examiner then examines the claim on exactly


what he claims, not the disclosure.  The patentee is


master of his claims.  He decides what the issue is going


to be. 


If the examiner rejects the claim that was


selected by the patentee, then -- then the patentee or the


applicant says, well, there's nothing I can do now.  I


either have a choice of not getting a patent or I've got


to limit my patent.  So, he comes in and he limits his


patent.  He goes from adhesives to glue. 


That patent issues and the public can then look


at it.  The patent tells you what you can't do, but more


importantly, it tells you what you can do.  And the public


can do no better than look at the claim and its


prosecution history, and when it does that, it can look

and decide what it can do.  And this results in increased


innovation. 


This Court in Markman, interpreting claims, said


that claims, if they are uncertain -- and this was the


need for judges rather than juries to interpret them.  If


they're uncertain, they foreclose an area of technology. 


If you have uncertainty between here and here, no one will


innovate in that area because they recognize, if they're


successful, they're just going to be sued for infringement


under the doctrine of equivalents.  They may have an


injunction entered against them, which is going to stop


their production line, and they're going to have to give


back profits which the patentee is going to ask for in


lost profits. 


So, everything really turns on the claims, and


the patent attorney has the tools to do it.  He can use


112, paragraph 6.  He always claims as broadly as


possible. 


All that the Federal circuit has --


QUESTION:  The argument you're now making is a


wonderful argument against the whole doctrine of


equivalents, which I thought we had rejected. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  The difference -- the difference


between that is that the Federal circuit has limited its


holding to the time when the patent applicant goes from

one claim to another claim where he narrows the claim.  If


he doesn't narrow the claim, there's no problem with the


doctrine of equivalents.  Also, if he doesn't narrow an


element, there's no doctrine of equivalents. 


All that the Federal circuit has said here is


that the balance shifts with respect to the point that


you're referring to when the patent applicant, with his


eyes open, knows that he's got a problem and he's going to


have to narrow.


QUESTION:  Well, that may well be.  But -- but


if -- if the considerations that you're raising now are as


forceful as you think they are, we should simply abolish


the doctrine of equivalents.  That -- that would give


great certainty to the patent law, and all of the -- all


of the things that you assert would be achieved.  The


patentee is on notice and he should be as precise as


possible, blah, blah, blah. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  Well, that's not an issue before


the Court.  But the -- the Federal circuit does restrict


the doctrine in -- doctrine of equivalents in other areas. 


For example, you can have an argument that you make in


your -- in your amendment, and that argument can then be


used against you as an estoppel.  That's not an issue in


this case. 


The Federal circuit also handled an issue where

an applicant will disclose, say, three things, A, B, and


C, and he'll only claim A.  And then he'll come back and


he'll say, under the doctrine of equivalents, A covers B


and C.  And the Federal circuit deals with that.  But


that's not an issue in this case. 


What the Federal circuit has done is they've


handled the exact issue that this Court handled in Exhibit


Supply and in Warner-Jenkinson.  And that is that the


balance shifts when you make an amendment that relates to


patentability and --


QUESTION:  Mr. Neustadt, would you -- would you


tell us why the approach of a complete bar is consistent


with the approach taken in Warner-Jenkinson where the


Court did not want to have a rigid -- a rule with no


flexibility, and so it created this rebuttable


presumption?


MR. NEUSTADT:  Yes.  The Court in Warner-


Jenkinson was trying to decide between amendments that


relate to patentability and amendments that do not relate


to patentability.  And the petitioner in that case was


asserting that that distinction was not an important


distinction.  The Court in Warner-Jenkinson said we're not


going to have a bright line rule that this complete bar is


going to apply to every single amendment.  It's only going


to apply to those amendments that relate to patentability.

And the Court said in the past we've used prior art as


relating to patentability, but the Court did not limit it


to that. 


The Federal circuit then came back and one of


the questions they had, they said, is 102 and -- is


relates to patentability under this Court's decision


limited to 102 and 103.  And this is question one in the


Federal circuit.  And the Federal circuit held virtually


unanimous, 11 to 1, that relates to patentability is not


limited to 102 and 103. 


QUESTION:  But that's simply an interpretation


of our cases.  Or it should have been at any rate.  And I


dare say we're in a better position to interpret our cases


than the Federal circuit. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  Well, I think the -- the Federal


circuit was saying that the cases of this Court were not


absolutely controlling, but what they would do would be


consistent with this Court.  And that was -- that was the


effect of their holding. 


But if you look carefully -- look more carefully


at this Court's cases, this Court's cases we submit in our


brief actually do control and would have necessitated the


Federal circuit to reach that verdict.  This Court, as I


said --


QUESTION:  Well, there is an -- I think I agree

with Justice Ginsburg, as she suggested.  I think there is


an inconsistency between Warner-Jenkinson and the position


you're taking. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  An inconsistency? 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  I don't think so because the --


the --


QUESTION:  Well, the remand in Warner-Jenkinson.


MR. NEUSTADT:  Yes.  The remand in Warner-


Jenkinson, as specifically defined there, was for the


Federal circuit to determine whether or not the amendment


that was made to change the pH to 6 related to


patentability.  The petitioner was saying you don't have


to determine whether it relates to patentability.  The


remand said, Federal circuit, you now look and tell us


whether or not it relates to patentability, and that's


what the Federal circuit did. 


And then as they had a few more cases after


Warner-Jenkinson -- and they had -- they had disputes


among the judges -- they said we're going to resolve this


in this -- in this case.  And they not only said they're


going to rehear it en banc, but they said we're going to


have five questions.  And the first question was -- was


Justice Ginsburg's question. 


QUESTION:  But I didn't mean it to be.  I meant

to focus you on the second question which you say is the


more important of the two, and --


MR. NEUSTADT:  The complete bar, yes.


QUESTION:  -- and just saying that in Warner-


Jenkinson, the Court didn't want to freeze things, so it


had this rebuttable presumption.  You do want to, when you


get to your question two, say absolute bar. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  The absolute bar was in Warner-


Jenkinson.  In Warner-Jenkinson, this Court said if the


amendment relates to patentability, then there's going to


be an absolute bar.  The words this Court used was bar.


They didn't use absolute bar because a bar is a bar.  But


-- but -- and this Court was just following Exhibit Supply


which had that same bar in that. 


QUESTION:  Well, I thought everybody agreed that


the question was open, that this Court did not decide.


MR. NEUSTADT:  The Federal circuit said that


their decision was not controlled by Exhibit Supply.  Both


our side and the Government side said that it is


controlled by Exhibit Supply and that the Federal circuit


would have had to have reached that conclusion anyway. 


And -- and the -- the very plain language of Exhibit


Supply is that when a patentee chooses to go from the


claim as unamended to make a narrow limitations in there,


there's a complete bar with respect to the amended

element.  And Exhibit Supply, of course, talks about there


is an abandonment and disclaimer of everything between the


element as unamended and as amended.


And to --


QUESTION:  Could you explain to me a little more


clearly what -- what you assert relates to patentability


means?  I mean, if -- if you narrow the phrase to mean it


-- it relates only to prior art or to any impediment to


getting the invention accepted as novel or whatever, I


understand what it means.  But if it -- if it includes any


change that is made in order to get the examiner to accept


the patent, then what change does not relate to


patentability?  If -- if, as you assert, patent attorneys


are so reluctant to make any changes, what change would


not relate to patentability?  The only reason they're


doing it is to get the patent. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  Yes.  It's not changes.  It's the


narrowing changes.  You can make a lot of changes. 


QUESTION:  Fine.  What narrowing changes would


not relate to patentability? 


MR. NEUSTADT:  There are very few changes where


you have significant narrowing that do not relate to


patentability. 


QUESTION:  I can't imagine any because why would


you do it unless --

QUESTION:  -- unless to get the examiner to

MR. NEUSTADT:  If you take out narrowing, you


can have a lot of changes.  For example, you may file an


application and then broaden your claim. 


QUESTION:  But -- but why -- why talk about


changes that relate to patentability?  Why not just say


all narrowing changes?  Let's make it clear what we're


talking about.  You're saying all narrowing changes. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  And this is why the Federal


circuit had such virtual unanimity because --


QUESTION:  And -- and you think that that's --


that's what we meant in -- in Warner-Jenkinson by -- by


changes that relate to patentability.  All narrowing


changes. 


MR. NEUSTADT:  I think in Warner-Jenkinson the


subject wasn't specifically addressed.  The Court


recognized that you have narrowing changes with respect to


prior art. 


QUESTION:  It would be a very strange


terminology to use to refer to all narrowing changes.


MR. NEUSTADT:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  You know, it doesn't seem to me


synonymous with patentability.

 MR. NEUSTADT:  To -- to a certain extent, the --


the Federal circuit rule is even narrower than -- than


Warner-Jenkinson because this Court in Warner-Jenkinson


did not refer to narrowing.  It just referred to


amendments that relate to prior art, and there must have


been an implicit assumption that that was -- that was


narrowing. 


The Federal circuit, since they hear a lot of


patent cases, focused more in on the fact that it really


wasn't the fact that it was prior art.  What you wanted to


get at was important changes, and they -- they used the


language statutory requirements of patentability. 


For example, one of the most important things is


your claim being supported by the disclosure.  You can't


claim what you don't invent.  So, if your claim is real


broad, the examiner says, but you've only disclosed this,


so you can't foreclose all of this.  And so then you have


to narrow it down to this.  And that's a 112 change, and a


112 change is just as important as a 102 and a 103 change.


And so the Federal circuit says if it's for a statutory


requirement for patentability.  And these are not trivial


changes. 


A patent attorney, when an examiner makes a


change -- a suggested change, says, well, how can I do


that without narrowing.

 The same thing with respect to clarity.  You can


make changes with respect to clarity.  Maybe the examiner


likes 12 feet rather than 144 inches.  Maybe there are


other things that he thinks will be more clear.  As long


as they're not narrowing, the patent attorney is happy to


make them, but as soon as he -- he narrows, he knows that


he's getting his client less.


With respect to foreseeability, I just wanted to


make one comment.  Patent attorneys, when they draft broad


claims, they draft broad claims because they don't know


what is going to happen in the future.  They want the


broad claim because if something happens in the future,


they're going to be covered for it.  Also, the patent


attorney doesn't know everything that's happened in the


past, and so he wants the broad claim because he gets much


better coverage. 


For example, you don't want to go to -- from


adhesives to glue, because if you do that -- I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Neustadt.


Mr. Bork, you have 2 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BORK:  I wish to address this question of


narrowing.  The concept of narrowing has no limits.  In


this case, the Stoll patent moved one element -- an


47

element from one claim to another.  No change, just moved


from one claim to another.  That was held to be a


narrowing.  Now, if that's a narrowing, nothing is


unrelated to patentability.  That -- that's the extreme to


which the Federal circuit takes this case. 


Now, as far as the Government is concerned, the


Government I think didn't quote you the relevant language


from their brief.  They approvingly quoted as the law in


Warner-Jenkinson -- that is, in filing in Warner-Jenkinson


-- whenever a prosecution history estoppel is invoked,


there's a limitation to infringement under the doctrine of


equivalents.  A close examination must be made as to not


only what was surrendered but also the reason for such


surrender.  That's the position that the -- this Court


adopted in Warner-Jenkinson.  It's the position that Festo


takes before this Court today. 


I should say that I don't -- when I answered


you, Justice O'Connor, I did not mean to say that a


limitation was the same as an amendment.  It's just a


statement of the claim.  A limitation is where the claim


is when you first make it. 


This case -- if what happened to Festo here and


what's going to happen to other patentholders continues,


this case, were it not done by a court, were it done by


any other agency, would be a taking under the


48 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Constitution.  And that's why it's important that you --


this Court not approve a retroactive application of this


drastic new rule but require that it be done by Congress


or by rulemaking by the Patent and Trademark Office.


Thank you. 


QUESTION:  May I ask, since you do have a second


left, what -- what case of ours does -- other than Warner-


Jenkinson, does the new rule repudiate?


MR. BORK:  Almost all of them.  For example, the


doctrine of equivalents goes back well into the last


century.  Winans against Denmead, 1853.  There's an


argument there about -- they don't call it the doctrine of


equivalents then, but there's an argument there about


whether something fell under a patent claim and they say


that it's really the same thing, same principle as


involved, and therefore --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Bork.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 11:17 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
