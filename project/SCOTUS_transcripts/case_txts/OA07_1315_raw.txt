 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument this afternoon in Case 07-1315, Knowles v. 
Mirzayance.

 Mr. Mercer.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN E. MERCER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MERCER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Under the deferential review required by the 
ADPA, Mr. Mirzayance was not entitled to Federal habeas 
corpus relief on his ineffective counsel claim because 
the State court adjudication of that claim was not 
contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, the 
clearly established Strickland test.  And because the 
Strickland rule is a general one, the California Supreme 
Court had wide latitude in resolving that claim.

 In this case, the Ninth Circuit applied 

something different from Strickland, finding that Wager 
was duty-bound to present a State law affirmative 
defense because no other defenses were said to be 
available at that time and because it merely might have 
worked.  But even the Ninth Circuit conceded that this 
Court has never announced such a test.  And as in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  At some point during the 
oral argument, and perhaps at the beginning because it 
is the beginning inquiry:  When there is an evidentiary 
hearing, how does the standard for the court of appeals 
differ than when there has been no evidentiary hearing?

 MR. MERCER:  Well, I think it depends on 
whether the Federal habeas court is doing a section 
2254(d) analysis.  The fact is that section 2254(d), for 
example, doesn't speak to denying a claim on the merits, 
even if it's unexhausted.  So, in theory, a Federal 
habeas court could perhaps accept new evidence that the 
State court never had before it in order to deny relief. 
But we cannot envision a situation where it would ever 
be efficacious to hold a hearing in light of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let me put it --
MR. MERCER:  -- a --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me put it this way: 

We're the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, let's 
assume.  What effect do we give to what the district 
court did, and how would that -- how would the case be 
different than if we were simply reviewing the same 
situation and it came from the State court?  What's the 
difference?

 MR. MERCER:  Well, there shouldn't be a 

difference.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We just pretend the 

hearing didn't happen?

 MR. MERCER:  Well, I would say that in 
virtually every case it, in fact, is a meaningless 
distraction from what the State court did based on the 
record presented it, and here's why.  Because if the 
State court made a reasonable adjudication of the merits 
of the claim based on the State court record, then even 
holding a hearing wouldn't make any difference because 
relief would still be precluded under 2254(d).

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do we look to the Federal 

court evidentiary hearing as part of the analysis to 
determine whether what the State court did was 
reasonable?  And you -- and you have -- you have thought 
about this, and obviously the problem is, since the 
California appellate courts didn't see the hearing, this 
is an artificial exercise, and you know the problem.

 MR. MERCER:  Well, I think, again, the only 
question that matters is the 2254(d) question that says 
that relief shall not be granted unless that State court 
adjudication based on the State court record presented 
was unreasonable, and here is why.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I guess it could be 

-- it could be if we have an opinion that makes it clear 
that you -- you must grant an evidentiary hearing in --

in certain cases.  And if the State court did not grant 
an evidentiary hearing, I guess you could say that that 
was contrary to established Supreme Court law, couldn't 
you?

 MR. MERCER:  Perhaps, and -- and under 

extremely rare cases that may --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But unless -- unless there 

is a Supreme Court requirement that there be an 
evidentiary hearing, I don't see how holding an 
evidentiary hearing could show that the State court 
decision, which was legitimately held without an 
evidentiary hearing, was contrary to our opinions.  I 
don't see how you can do that.

 MR. MERCER:  Well, I agree, Justice Scalia, 

and this Court said in Holland v. Jackson that the 
pertinent question is what the State court had in front 
of it.  And the reason here is simple:  That it is 
unfair to find that the State courts made an 
unreasonable application of law based on facts that they 
didn't have.  So --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did at any point -- did 
the State at any point challenge the correctness, the 
propriety, of holding the Federal evidentiary hearing?

 MR. MERCER:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.  Mr. 

Mirzayance raised --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if so, is that before 

us?

 MR. MERCER:  I don't think so.  We -- we 
disagreed that there should have been an evidentiary 
hearing in the first place, and we argued that below. 
It's our position that there should not have been an 
evidentiary hearing in the first place.

 It's our position that, frankly, this was a 

straightforward, routine Strickland case that was 
uncomplicated, properly adjudicated by the district 
court when they first reached it in 2001 without a 
hearing, and that the Ninth Circuit has come at this 
matter with a -- a chestful of monkey wrenches in the 
sense that they should not have ordered the evidentiary 
hearing in the first place, and then when they did, they 
should not have disregarded the very factfinding that 
they ordered be done.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- so then -- so then 
we do look at the facts.  I don't want to take up your 
or the Court's time on this any more, but I remain 
puzzled, I have to tell you, about what to do with this 
hearing.  I went through it at great length.  It's very 
careful factfinding, really.
 MR. MERCER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I -- I just don't know

how to fit that with the standard when I look at the --
the reasonableness of the -- of the State court 
decision.

 MR. MERCER:  Well, I don't think it changed 

the standard because 2254 simply requires an 
adjudication on the merits, and we have that here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, would you -- would 
you agree just as a general rule that unless we find --
unless there is some rule under which we can conclude 
that the State court should have held a hearing, that 
there is no occasion to have a Federal evidentiary 
hearing?

 MR. MERCER:  Yes, I would agree with that.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That would be the general 

proposition.

 MR. MERCER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MR. MERCER:  And I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would that -- would 
that principle have to be clearly established by one of 
our decisions?

 MR. MERCER:  I think that question is 
unclear, Mr. Chief Justice, because this Court did 
recently say in Landrigan that the decision to hold an 
evidentiary hearing remains within the sound discretion

of the district court, but in the same sentence said 
that that discretion was circumscribed by the ADPA.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why should we hold a 

hearing ourselves in the -- in the hypothetical 
situation that Justice Souter mentioned?  Why shouldn't 
we just reverse the State courts for not having held an 
evidentiary hearing?  Remand it to them, let them hold 
it, and let -- let them make the factual determination 
on the basis of that, after which we would -- we would 
apply the rather strict 2254 standard to -- to the 
result of that hearing?

 MR. MERCER:  Well, if a petitioner or a 
State prisoner was somehow precluded from developing 
facts in the State court and should have had an 
evidentiary hearing under this Court's clearly 
established law, then that would be the correct 
solution.

 Here, however, we have a fully developed 

State court record.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I understand that.  So 
your -- your answer to Justice Souter would -- would not 
be that -- that you can conduct a hearing if the State 
should have conducted a hearing?  What you should do if 
the State should have conducted a hearing is send it 
back for the hearing.

MR. MERCER:  That is correct.  The point 
here under the ADPA -- and I think it is Congress's 
clear intent -- is that all of these claims are to be 
funneled through the State courts first.  And Congress 
has entrusted the State courts to be the primary and 
first interpreters and enforcers of Federal 
constitutional law for State prisoners' claims.  And as 
this Court has said many times, including in Sawyer v. 
Smith, they're co-equals to the Federal courts in doing 
so.

 So what should have happened in this case we 

contend is what the district court first did when 
confronted with the claim in 2001.  And that is you 
assess the facts and claims as presented to the State 
court and then decide whether it would be reasonable to 
reject the claim under either prong of Strickland.  And 
as this Court said in Strickland itself, the easiest and 
most direct way to answer that question is through the 
prejudice prong here.

 We have to remember the reality of this case 

that for an affirmative defense of insanity, or NGI 
under California law, Attorney Wager bore the burden of 
proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his 
client did not know the difference between right and 
wrong when he committed this crime.

And every bit of Mirzayance's own deeds and 
words show that he did.  Before the killing itself, he 
closed the curtains and waited until he was alone with 
the victim before entering her room with a gun in his 
pocket and the silent weapon drawn.  He struck with the 
silent weapon, delivering fatal blows, resorting to the 
gun only when she screamed and struggled, and then 
immediately collected the shell casings, turned off the 
lights, collected the knife, went back to his apartment 
where he showered, disposed of the bloody clothes, 
concocted a false alibi message on the machine -- excuse 
me -- and then, overcome with guilt at the wrongfulness 
of his conduct, he calls his friend and says:  "I messed 
up big-time."  And that's at page 120 of the State 
reporter's transcript.

 And then, further acknowledging both the 
legal and moral wrongfulness of his actions, he turns 
himself in to the police.  He says:  "I did a murder." 
When they asked him how he felt about it, he said:  "I 
felt very guilty, very bad for what I've done.  That's 
why I turned myself in."

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Was -- was -- is all of 

this factual material in the -- in the documents 
submitted with the habeas, with the State habeas and the 
response to the State habeas?

MR. MERCER:  All of this was in the State 

trial transcript, so, yes, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  What -- what did they do? 
Did they submit the trial transcript with the -- in --
with the response to the habeas petition at the State? 
In other words, how did it get in front of the State 
court, is all I want to know.

 MR. MERCER:  It was a direct appeal to the 
California Court of Appeals with a concurrently filed 
habeas petition.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Ah, okay.
 MR. MERCER:  Yes, okay.
 So he was faced with that.  And then on the 

flip side, there was not a shred of evidence that Mr. 
Mirzayance ever thought that doing what he did was 
legally or morally right.  So given all that, given the 
extensive effort to cover his tracks and his own 
admissions about the wrongfulness of his conduct, it was 
not reasonably probable under Strickland for this jury 
to believe that he somehow did not know.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about getting another 
jury?  That was -- one of the reasons that counsel gave 
why he, counsel, was withdrawing the NGI plea was the 
jury had just found -- rejected the second-degree murder 
charge and found that he had acted deliberately with

premeditation.  But couldn't -- because the first jury 
had -- in the guilt phase, couldn't the attorney have 
requested a brand new jury to hear the NGI plea?

 MR. MERCER:  Mr. Wager did not believe that 
he had grounds to do so in this case.  And the district 
court first addressed that opinion at the petition 
appendix H in a footnote -- I believe it was footnote 
21, but I don't have that in front of me right now --
where the district court talked about the standards for 
getting a new jury and that under Penal Code, California 
Penal Code 1026, you had to show some cause to the trial 
court why this jury could not fairly address the claim. 
Wager felt that he had no basis to do that at this time.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Mercer -- Mr. Mercer, I 

guess we could resolve the case by saying if there was 
any error it was harmless, but we didn't take the case 
for that.  That wouldn't be very helpful to the bar, 
would it?  I mean, I thought that the important issue 
here is -- is the one you've been discussing, whether --
whether, in fact, you're bound to stick with the facts 
that were -- were adjudicated by the State.

 MR. MERCER:  I agree with you, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So let's not do that, then. 

Let's -- let's decide something.

MR. MERCER:  Okay.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Good.
 MR. MERCER:  Well, I'm confident that, you 
know, as this Court addressed in Strickland itself, the 
claim fails for lack of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if -- if the 

Profitt -- the Fifth Circuit -- Profitt, the Fifth 
Circuit case, applies in the Ninth, Ninth Circuit, and I 
would think it would, just as the magistrate judge 
thought that it would, then that would be -- present a 
very close case and it would probably require reversal 
of the State court, wouldn't you think, if the Profitt 
rule applied?  What is it, the "all or" -- not "all or 
nothing" --

MR. MERCER:  "Nothing to lose."
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  "Nothing to lose."
 MR. MERCER:  Well, if -- we agree that 

nothing to lose, in fact, was what happened here, as in 
Profitt.  The dissent recognized it, the District Court 
recognized it, and I think you're right that this case 
smacks of application of something like a "nothing to 
lose" type rule.  And perhaps it's announced in Profitt, 
but it surely has not been clearly established by this 
Court in any decision, and that pre-AEDPA Profitt 
decision from the Fifth Circuit certainly did not compel

the California court or any other State court to apply a 
"nothing to lose" rule on Strickland performance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isn't that --

the fundamental question is what level of generality you 
look to determine what law has been clearly established? 
Certainly Strickland is clearly established.

 MR. MERCER:  Certainly.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But as far as I can 
tell, the "nothing to lose" issue has not been addressed 
by us and is not clearly established.  So why do we look 
at it at the latter level of generality as opposed to 
the former?

 MR. MERCER:  Well, certainly this Court 

could indeed take a more narrow view of what is clearly 
established law.  We agree that Strickland here covers 
the vast majority of ineffectiveness cases.  But 
certainly, this Court has never squarely addressed such 
an issue before, and certainly, this Court has never 
announced that test to bind the States to resolve this 
claim.

 I think that the fallback position is, 

absent a clear answer from this Court, as stated in Van 
Patten, absent a clear answer, the State courts are left 
with a very general Strickland principle, and as this 
Court stated in Yarborough v. Alvarado, the more general

the rule, the more leeway the States have in deciding 
cases on a case-by-case basis.

 So certainly we feel that Wager's decision 
was patently reasonable under a traditional Strickland 
analysis.  We're not asking for anything different. 
Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think -- I 
guess it's not open to us to issue a decision on the 
"nothing to lose" question or we don't have to.  It's 
the only -- the way we have to decide the case is to 
determine whether the Ninth Circuit's determination on 
the "nothing to lose" question was clearly established 
by one of our cases.

 MR. MERCER:  That's correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice.  And I think this comes back to our original 
point, that the only dispositive question here that 
really matters is where -- when the State court 
adjudicates --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me ask you this 

question.  Supposing we were convinced, and I'm not 
suggesting we should be on the record, but supposing we 
were convinced that only the dumbest, untrained lawyer 
in the world could have failed to advance this defense, 
and that therefore I would have no doubt about it as an 
original proposition that he was incompetent under

Strickland -- under the general Strickland standard. 
Would we be permitted to say that in the case, or would 
we have to say, well, this particular kind of attorney 
error has never been addressed before, and therefore, we 
can't look at it?

 MR. MERCER:  Well, I think that because this 

Court has never even addressed conduct anything like 
this by an attorney --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But isn't it true that 

there's a whole host of counsel errors that could 
violate Strickland?  But do you have to find one that we 
have addressed before before a Federal court can apply 
and say Strickland was violated?

 MR. MERCER:  I don't think you need one on 

all fours, exact fact patterns.  That would be 
unworkable.  What you do need to do is give the courts a 
clear answer to the question, and generally --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would it be -- wouldn't it 

be a clear answer in this case to say this was a 
terrible lawyer, and therefore Strickland -- Strickland 
applies?  Or could you say, we don't care how bad the 
lawyer was, Strickland -- we haven't adjudicated this 
precise set of facts before, so that's the end of the 
ball game?

haven't adjudicated this --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is that what you're asking 

us to do?

 MR. MERCER:  We're not asking you to say 
that a decision like this could never be unreasonable.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Oh, okay.
 MR. MERCER:  Okay?  We're asking that this 
Court continue its Strickland jurisprudence that says 
the Constitution makes one general requirement and, as 
stated in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, that requirement is that 
counsel make reasonable choices.

 So certainly, there could be a situation 

where counsel flipped a coin or made an arbitrary 
decision or made an unreasonable decision --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why is it, then -- if we 

say that and if Profitt is inconsistent with that, do we 
then remand or do we say on this record clearly it was 
reasonable?  Obviously you want us to do the latter, I 
take it?

 MR. MERCER:  Well, I don't frankly think 
this case necessarily should be remanded back to the 
Ninth Circuit.  They've had it three times already.  But

don't we have to say that this was reasonable?

 MR. MERCER:  No.  I think what this Court 

simply needs to say is that it was not objectively 
unreasonable --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course.
 MR. MERCER:  -- for the California courts to 

come out the other way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't understand 

why you keep talking about Strickland.  We sent this 
case back to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration 
in light of Carey v. Musladin.  In that case we said 
that the grant of relief was unreasonable because of the 
lack of holdings from this Court regarding the 
potentially prejudicial effect of spectators' courtroom 
conduct of the kind involved here, which seems to me a 
much narrower focus on the level of generality than 
Strickland.

 I would have thought you would have said --

maybe you are saying -- that because we don't have a 
precedent from this Court rejecting the "nothing to 
lose" case, that that should be the end of it.

 MR. MERCER:  Well, I did not make such an 
aggressive argument to this Court that a decision like 
this could never be unreasonable, but certainly there is 
no case from this Court that has announced such a

standard.  So --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  The issue is 

not whether it's unreasonable or not.  The issue is 
whether it's an unreasonable application of -- of 
clearly established Supreme Court law.

 MR. MERCER:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Reasonableness or 

unreasonableness is out of the question.  You -- you 
first just have to look to Supreme Court law and say, is 
it conceivably an unreasonable application of that.  And 
the -- and the answer to that is we -- we haven't 
decided the question of whether this is reasonable or 
unreasonable, and therefore, it cannot possibly be an 
unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's his argument, not 

the one you've been making.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right.  That seems 

to me --

Strickland.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  You say the standard is 

 MR. MERCER:  Well, what I say is that this 

Court has held that Strickland generally applies to 
almost all ineffective counsel cases.  And certainly 
this Court has stated it applies in specific type issues 
of conduct.  For example, counsel has a duty to conduct

a reasonable investigation; counsel has a duty to 
consult his client about filing an appeal.  But Justice 
Scalia is absolutely right, this Court has never said 
anything remotely like the rule applied by the Ninth 
Circuit here.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, they didn't.  But 

what we're going to discover, I suspect, when we 
actually dig into this record, which is pretty 
extensive, are two things.  The first is the California 
Court of Appeals does not seem to have dealt with the 
particular issue in front of us.  They talked about a 
due process issue at the end of their paragraph, they 
have talked about things that are close to it, but they 
nowhere say expressly how they are deciding the question 
of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel 
for the reason that he didn't put on this insanity 
defense.  That's going to be our first problem.

 Then I looked to see, I got the record out 
to see, if he raised it, and he didn't.  So we have the 
fact that they didn't talk about it, and then we have 
the fact that of course the Supreme Court of California 
says just one word, "Denied."

 Then when we discover round two in the Ninth 

Circuit, we are going to discover some language which 
says:  We are not relying on this rule, there is no such

rule, as a rule of you have to make a defense as a last 
resort.  Here's what they say.  Instead of that we say, 
forget about that, we were wrong the first time, we 
assume.  "Where the State court has provided an 
adjudication on the merits, that is, it did say denied, 
but has not explained its underlying reasoning or held 
an evidentiary hearing, we conduct an independent review 
of the record to determine the State court's final 
resolution of the case, whether it was reasonable or 
unreasonable."

 So they say:  We did conduct that record 

independent review.  And our conclusion is that it was 
unreasonable, okay?  Nothing to do with any special rule 
here or anything.  We just think it was unreasonable.

 All right; now, what are we supposed to do 

with this?

 MR. MERCER:  I think this Court needs to 
give full deference to the adjudication of the State 
courts.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What is that deference 
going to be?  I take it what it would be is that the 
person, the defendant, would have in his petition --
which we don't actually have -- would have said the 
facts are thus and so, and since they had no hearing, 
they would have to take those facts as being thus and

so.

 MR. MERCER:  Correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And then we would have to 
say, was it unreasonable of them on the facts as they 
might have taken them most favorable to the defendant. 
Is that what we're supposed to do?  Is it unreasonable 
of them to conclude for the State's favor in light of 
reading these facts as most possible favorable for the 
defendant?  Is that what we should do?
 MR. MERCER:  Correct, yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
 MR. MERCER:  And that's the situation and 

the circumstance outlined by the California Supreme 
Court in People v. Duvall, and it's a case and a 
procedure designed for judicial economy --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Then we have to reach this 

hearing issue because we have to say, insofar as the 
hearing reached a different result, we should ignore it 
for the reason that the statute tells us to consider the 
reasonableness of the State court's decision in light of 
the facts on the record before it.
 MR. MERCER:  Correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So we have to reach a huge 

number of issues which we've never decided.

issue is not really properly before this Court.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then how are we 

supposed to do it?  That's why I raised it.

 MR. MERCER:  Based on the State court 

adjudication, a straightforward analysis under 2254(d) 
of the California Supreme Court's legal resolution of 
this claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We should treat the 

district court proceeding as though it had never 
happened on the ground that the Ninth Circuit never 
should have remanded it to the district court, and we 
just take it as though we had a 2254 petition from the 
State supreme court in the district court.  And then the 
district court doesn't conduct any hearing; it just 
applies the standard.  So that the whole thing about 
clearly erroneous at the district court, that -- that 
should be out of the case.

 MR. MERCER:  That is our primary contention, 

yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then if we get to that 
point, I think your argument is as follows.  I'm not 
sure.  I want you to tell me.

 If the State court adjudication was -- was 
contrary to what Justice Stevens' hypo suggested might 
be the "total fool" rule, in other words no one but a

complete nincompoop would have failed to -- to press 
forward with this defense, then we can decide the case 
simply under Strickland, because Strickland 
unreasonableness is certainly going to cover the total 
fool case.

 But if we have something less egregious than 

the total fool case, then we've got to look for more 
precise Supreme Court precedent, and that's what gets us 
into the Musladin or Musladin rule.

 MR. MERCER:  Correct.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And if we get to the 

Musladin sort of level of generality, we do not have any 
determination from this Court, any clearly established 
law from this Court, that would indicate that the State 
court's adjudication or determination was unreasonable 
here.

 MR. MERCER:  Absolutely.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is that your road map?
 MR. MERCER:  Yes, it is.
 And if there are no further questions, I 

would like to reserve the remainder of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

MR. SEVILLA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to begin by addressing the 
so-called "nothing to lose" rule, which is a fiction 
attributed to Profitt v. Waldron, which -- it does not 
say that in Profitt v. Waldron.  It's a fiction 
attributed to the Ninth Circuit, because the Ninth 
Circuit not only did not say that; they rejected the 
idea that they were relying on a "nothing to lose" rule. 
The Ninth Circuit applied -- well, I might also add that 
in a case called Lowery v. Lewis, which is cited at the 
Petitioner's appendix for cert 94, the Ninth Circuit 
specifically and in no uncertain terms said it rejected 
a "nothing to lose" rule.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you reject it as 

well, I take it --

MR. SEVILLA:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS -- and concede it is 

an improper -- it is not a basis for ineffective 
assistance that somebody did not pursue a "nothing to 
lose" case argument?

 MR. SEVILLA:  It -- essentially, because 

it's an irrelevant concern because the decision has to 
be made on whether counsel's decision, as he faced the 
trial facts, was objectively reasonable.

Now, in that calculus if there is nothing to 

lose by going forward, if there is a great benefit to 
achieve by going forward, if he's got a credible 
defense, as it was determined by the district court at 
the evidentiary hearing on insanity, then it's 
objectively unreasonable on the morning of trial on the 
way to court, to, out of a sense of despair or 
hopelessness, subjectively speaking, to decide that: 
I'm going to jettison this defense that's been prepared 
over the year.  There was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well I -- I don't 

under -- I didn't follow that answer.  You're saying if 
he does have nothing to lose, it is objectively 
unreasonable for him not to go ahead with it?

 MR. SEVILLA:  I'm saying that's one of the 

factors.  I'm not saying that's the sole factor, 
because, as the case that I cited, Lowery, there was a 
motion to suppress which attorneys were making in this 
case.  They all lost, and his -- the client in that case 
argued, well, there was nothing to lose in presenting 
this motion to suppress, and the Ninth Circuit said: 
That's not the rule; it's under the circumstances 
whether the performance is objectively unreasonable, so 
we need to take into consideration the compete --
competing factors.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So we have to look 

at this counsel's performance under Strickland, I guess, 
and determine whether it was objectively unreasonable in 
light of Strickland filtered through Yarborough?

 MR. SEVILLA:  Correct.  And in -- in that 

regard, the State has argued --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that precisely what we 
have to decide?  Or wouldn't it be whether it would be 
unreasonable for the State court not to come to that 
conclusion, which is one step removed?

 MR. SEVILLA:  It would be one step removed 
were it not for the fact that there was an evidentiary 
hearing which resolved facts that should have been 
resolved in the State court.  Appellant filed a separate 
petition in the court of appeal in California, filed the 
same petition in the California Supreme Court, asked --
first argued up front that this was unreasonable 
performance under Strickland, and then said if the court 
disagrees, then it ought to be remanded to a referee for 
fact development.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so the usual test 
that the State court has to be affirmed unless it's 
unreasonable application of Supreme Court law is altered 
when the State court has not had an evidentiary hearing 
that the Federal habeas court believes should have been

held?

 MR. SEVILLA:  And holds it.  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do you get that out of 

the statute?  I don't understand it; it makes no --

MR. SEVILLA:  Well, there's a hole in the 

statute, there's no question about it, under 2254(d)(1).

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
 MR. SEVILLA:  When you have the -- the 

statute requiring the application of, or nonapplication 
of law contrary to the United States Supreme Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
 MR. SEVILLA:  -- or an unreasonable 

application thereof, what happens when that issue really 
cannot be decided without an evidentiary hearing under 
Strickland?

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but you're saying --
the need for the evidentiary hearing, as I understand 
it, was raised by you in the following way.  You said to 
the California Supreme Court:  There is on the face of 
the papers filed here a violation of Strickland and a --
or a misapplication of Strickland in -- in the way the 
California trial court came out; but if you do not find 
a facial violation of Strickland based on these papers, 
then you should remand for an evidentiary hearing.  And 
it doesn't seem to me that that follows at all.

If there's no Strickland error, that seems 

to me a -- a -- an odd premise to say you ought to 
remand for a hearing.  Aren't you under an obligation to 
specify factual issues that -- specifically that need to 
be developed, before you would make out a case for 
saying they were in error in not holding the evidentiary 
hearing?

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well, we argued that because 

Mr. Wager, defense counsel, presented a declaration 
which was contradicted by other declarations as to the 
reason he gave up this defense, we argued it was 
objectively unreasonable if the court -- the State court 
took all of the intendants in favor of our declaration 
and Mr. Wager did not really address the reasons for 
giving up the defense, he just said, I felt it was 
hopeless.

 It took the evidentiary hearing to determine 

why he felt it was hopeless.  So we argued that on the 
face of it it is Strickland error.  If the court 
disagrees, then we're entitled to an evidentiary hearing 
to determine --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you're saying that you 

specified the evidentiary issues that you wanted to 
develop?

rationale was unreasonable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, with that, I'm just 

asking you --

MR. SEVILLA:  And we --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm asking you -- I'm 

throwing you a softball.

 MR. SEVILLA:  Right.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Are you saying that that 
was, in effect, an adequate way to tell the California 
Supreme Court that these are the issues that we want to 
develop in an evidentiary hearing that aren't 
sufficiently developed in the documents?  Is that your 
position?

 MR. SEVILLA:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But there is no hole in the 

statute.  What it says to do, quite explicitly, is it 
says that you have to see whether the State court 
decision was unreasonable in light of the evidence 
presented in the State court.  So it tells us what to 
do.  It says, look at the evidence in the State court, 
and like any other instance where there is no hearing, 
every day of the week, judges refuse to give a hearing. 
Now, when they do that, they have to assume the facts in 
favor of the losing party.  So the question is, assuming

the facts in favor of your client, was the decision that 
he loses unreasonable?

 MR. SEVILLA:  We argued yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And you said yes.  Is there 

any finding on that in the Federal court?  No.

 MR. SEVILLA:  No.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, that's --
that's why I don't know how to proceed because it seems 
to me to decide that question just as I said it.  When I 
said it, I don't think what I said is clear in the law 
of this statute.  There are two sides to it.  We just 
had a case where there were many briefs on this 
question.  So I'm slightly uncertain what to do.
 MR. SEVILLA:  Was that Bell v. Kelly?
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's a good one.
 MR. SEVILLA:  I think it was, and the Court 

dismissed as improvidently granted, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  What do you 
rely on for the proposition that if -- if you deny a 
hearing, all of the facts for which the hearing was 
demanded have to be assumed in favor of the party who 
asked for the hearing?

 MR. SEVILLA:  That's California law.

Federal Government, I would have thought.

MR. SEVILLA:  That is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's summary judgment law.
 MR. SEVILLA:  In order to deny relief, one 
has to -- the court has to presume the adequacy of the 
showing, or the truth of the showing made by the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but that can't be. 

What if I deny the hearing because there are ample facts 
that show what the situation was, and a hearing would in 
my view be absolutely redundant?  And therefore all of 
the facts that support the other side have to be washed 
out simply because I've denied a hearing?

 MR. SEVILLA:  No.  We're not making any 

claim that there has to be a hearing in every Federal 
case when there is an argument that could be deemed on 
its face cumulative evidence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wasn't addressing that. 
I was addressing the proposition that when you deny a 
hearing, all of the facts for which you demanded the 
hearing have to be assumed in your favor.  I -- it seems 
to be --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's my fault.  I'm 

referring by shorthand to a Rule 56 summary judgment 
type standard.  All those facts are assumed on your side 
in which they're material, and there has to be in the 
evidence a reasonable basis for dispute.

MR. SEVILLA:  I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's my mistaken refusal 

to -- I should have said Rule 56.

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well, it's -- it also is 

California law, and I believe it is habeas corpus law, 
that when the petitioner files a petition and attaches 
declarations, in order to deny those, assuming that the 
truth of those declarations is presumed in order to 
evaluate the prima facie case -- for example, in this 
case, in Strickland, that if that can't be resolved 
without a hearing, the hearing should be held.  And the 
court of appeal on the first go-around held exactly 
that.  The court said there are competing reasons here 
why the defense counsel waived this defense on the 
morning --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, talking 

about -- in Strickland -- right here.  In Strickland, we 
said that if a decision by counsel is made upon, quote, 
"thorough investigation," it is, quote, "virtually 
unchallengeable."  Now, which of these facts in the 
Petitioner's brief is wrong:  That Wager retained eight 
expert doctors to evaluate Mirzayance's mental health; 
he retained jury consultants; he conducted a mock trial 
in which he presented mental health defenses to two 
juries; he hired a private investigator to interview

friends and associates; he consulted with Mirzayance's 
parents and their attorneys; he discussed the case with 
a retained expert doctor after decision and his 
co-counsel?

 Now, that sounds like pretty thorough 

investigation of the defense you say he should have 
raised.

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well, there are a couple of 
problems with -- all of that is true.  I might quibble 
with one, but what -- Mr. Wager was operating under a 
fundamental misunderstanding of California law.  All of 
that was ready to go, to present.  He had a great not-
guilty-by-reason-of-insanity case supported by lay 
testimony, childhood history, and these psychiatric 
opinions of very formidable experts.  But he had a 
fundamental error that was only revealed at the 
evidentiary hearing in the understanding of California 
law.  He said -- and he said this six times at the 
evidentiary hearing -- he said that when a jury has 
found the defendant has maturely and meaningfully 
deliberated, that that means they found the equivalent 
of wrongfulness.  That is absolutely wrong.  He was 
quoting from a statute that was repealed in 1982, when 
California had a major revision of its statutes and 
moved mental health concepts --

that your friend began with, which shows his conscious 
deliberation, his knowledge not only about how to go 
about killing somebody, but also guilt, the recognition 
of the wrongfulness of what he had done -- all that 
under California law doesn't enter into a consideration 
of insanity?

 MR. SEVILLA:  Surely it enters into the 

consideration, and every one of the experts considered 
precisely that evidence, which was for the most part 
after-the-fact evidence.  And as the State's doctor --
and, again, this came out at the evidentiary hearing 
because it's certainly not discovered in the State 
doctor's report that was submitted.  The State doctor, 
Dr. Anderson, stated at the trial in Federal court that, 
yes, he was aware of the consciousness-of-guilt evidence 
that came about mostly after the event, but that did not 
speak to his intent, his mental state at the time of the 
offense.  And he stated, which was a great surprise in 
the Federal evidentiary hearing, that he believed Mr. 
Mirzayance was, because of the psychosis, feeling that 
he was justified --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand that, 

but counsel here at the time retained eight expert 
doctors to evaluate his mental health.  He conducted the

mock jury trial.  He interviewed the parents.  He hired 
an investigator to interview friends.  What you're 
saying is, well, here's -- if he had hired a ninth 
expert, he might have come out differently.  That sounds 
like a thorough investigation under Strickland.

 MR. SEVILLA:  It was a thorough 

investigation.  But this case -- this Court has said, in 
Terry Williams, counsel has a duty to investigate and 
proffer mitigation evidence in a capital case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So isn't that --

aren't you back to the "nothing to lose" argument?  He 
conducted this investigation, which under Strickland we 
said makes the decision virtually unchallengeable, and 
you're saying, well, he has an obligation to proffer it.

 MR. SEVILLA:  He had an obligation to 

proffer it because he was operating on a fundamental 
misunderstanding of California law.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You say that repeatedly, but 

what is there to show that he misunderstood, that he 
misunderstood California law, as opposed to making a 
practical calculation about how juries would look at 
this evidence, having found -- having heard the evidence 
of premeditation and having found premeditation, even 
though that doesn't decide the NGI issue, as a matter of 
law.  As a practical matter, it makes it quite unlikely

that they're going to accept the NGI defense.  Where --
and you say that repeatedly.

 MR. SEVILLA:  Yes.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Where in the record does it 
show that he misunderstood the law, as opposed to making 
a practical evaluation of what the jury was likely to 
do?

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well, I will -- I could rattle 

off page numbers from where he said that the jury 
finding of premeditation and deliberation was the 
functional equivalent of a finding of sanity.  That is 
absolutely not true.  Here's the quote --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  He didn't use the word 

"functional equivalent" in the portions I read.  Maybe 
you can correct me if I'm wrong about that.

 MR. SEVILLA:  He did not say "the functional 

equivalent."  He said --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And he told the trial 

judge, "I've got an uphill" --
MR. SEVILLA:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- almost perpendicular. 

And he had -- each and every one of those experts in 
their affidavits, in their reports, had said that he 
didn't have deliberation or premeditation.  They were 
getting ready for that.  And he felt that this would be

devastating cross-examination material because the jury 
had already found the opposite -- they had already 
disbelieved the expert on this point.

 Now, it's true, it's true, that knowledge of 

wrongfulness is probably slightly more extensive than 
premeditation.  But based on the defense that he was 
going to present -- he didn't know what he was doing at 
this time -- he had a very, very difficult obstacle to 
overcome.

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well, that -- that's a 

challenge that faces every criminal defense attorney in 
-- a case when you have a -- a credible defense like 
this.  There -- there are going to be challenges to that 
by vigorous, trained prosecutors.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't there something on 
the other side?  You seem to present this as a case, but 
counsel did a careful job, and then he lost faith.  He 
lost hope, and so he acted irrationally.

 But wasn't there on the other side 

consideration of the sentence that he was going to get, 
and might not a -- a lawyer perfectly rationally think: 
If I give up this defense, it is just going to waste 
everybody's time.  The judge is going to give me the 
benefit of -- of having done that in the sentence, in 
giving a lower sentence, in giving -- making the

sentences on the multiple offenses concurrent rather 
than consecutive.

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well, if there had been a 

tactical purpose such as that, that would have been an 
interesting fact to add to the calculus here, but he 
absolutely denied there was any benefit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, maybe -- maybe he 

did, but when we come to judge prejudice, don't we have 
to judge prejudice by considering exactly what Justice 
Ginsburg just said?  In other words, our standard, the 
-- the standard -- No. 1, the standard for Strickland 
prejudice is -- is an objective -- I mean the standard 
for -- for -- of -- of performance is an objective 
standard.  And the standard for prejudice has got to be 
an objective standard, too.

 And even though he said, I didn't do this 
for tactical reasons, if a -- if a sound lawyer would 
have entertained exactly the tactical reason that 
Justice Ginsburg just outlined, isn't that crucial to 
the determination of prejudice?

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well, it -- it may well be if 

there was a --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, shouldn't that be?

that there could be any difference whatsoever at

sentencing.  But he testified, well, what was going to 
happen to Mr. Mirzayance if he were to -- he was going 
to get 25 or 29 to life, which is exactly what happened. 
So there was no --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  How did he know that?
 MR. SEVILLA:  How did he know that?  Because 
if you -- he had already been convicted of first-degree 
murder, which --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but the judge hadn't 

sentenced him yet.

 MR. SEVILLA:  Correct, but under California 
law there is a mandatory prison sentence for the use of 
a gun, so -- and the sentence for first-degree murder is 
25 to life.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you are saying the 

judge had no discretion whatsoever?

 MR. SEVILLA:  That is correct.  So, 

therefore --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Twenty-five -- 25, 26, 27, 

28, he has 25 years worth of discretion, doesn't he?

 MR. SEVILLA:  No, no.  It's a minimum 

mandatory 25 to life.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But couldn't he also give 
life.  He could also give the maximum, which was life, 
couldn't he, or am I wrong?

 MR. SEVILLA:  Correct.  Correct.  And this 
-- the defense counsel said as much when answering the 
question as to whether there was any possible benefit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So he's got nothing 

to lose?

 MR. SEVILLA:  He's got nothing to lose and 
something to gain.  There was no benefit in taking the

which was credible.  He was prepared to present it until 
the --

back to what -- what I thought the case was postured in, 
which is whether or not a case from this Court clearly 
establishes when you have nothing to lose, you've got to 
go ahead and present the defense, or it's a violation of 
Strickland.  And what case is that?

Court has so pronounced.  And we are not arguing for

that standard, nor should we have to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I -- I 

understood your responses to the various questions here 
to, in effect, be arguing for that standard.  You are 
saying, look, he was going to get the same sentence 
anyway.  You know, all -- all your answers sound to me 
like nothing to lose.

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well, they're all part of the 
calculus of reasonable performance.  Certainly, the fact 
that there is nothing to lose, that he is going to get 
an automatic 25-year minimum sentence, that he is -- on 
the other hand, he's got a credible defense for which 
there is absolutely no benefit in giving up, and -- and 
then he decides for reasons --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He made a 

determination -- he made a determination after a 
thorough investigation of the various points I went 
through with you earlier that it was not a credible 
defense.  Now, maybe that was reasonable or 
unreasonable, but it doesn't seem to me to be -- under 
Strickland we said it is virtually unchallengeable, and 
it doesn't seem to me to be objectively unreasonable in 
light of clearly established law from this Court.

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well, the -- the -- this Court

Court has said that failure to fact-investigate can be a 
basis for objectively unreasonable performance.  The 
same is true with failure to legally investigate what's 
the law governing your case.

 And he stated on six occasions that the fact 

that the jury, quote, "had already found Mirzayance 
guilty of first-degree murder," and, whether they knew 
it or not, under the facts of this case legally sane, 
well, then, the question is:  Well, how do you make that 
determination?  By the way, he said the equivalent of 
that six times during the year.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't -- I didn't take 
that to mean under California law, since the jury found 
the one, it has to find the other.  He wasn't making 
that argument.  He was saying any jury that found that 
this was done intentionally, that this was done, you 
know, with -- with planning, with -- with cover-up and 
what not, that jury is not going to find that he was 
crazy.  That's all he was saying, and -- and that seems 
to me entirely reasonable.

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well -- well, I -- that might 
be the case if he did not misunderstand California law.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's hard for me to 

believe that he didn't.  He -- he has tried a hundred 
cases.  He had moot or mock -- mock trials where he was

asking the experts these questions with the co-counsel. 
And you want us to say that he didn't understand the 
law?  And there is no -- there is no finding to that 
effect.  There's no finding to that effect:  That he did 
not understand the law by the magistrate.

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well, the circuit --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  By the magistrate, there 

was no finding to that effect.

 MR. SEVILLA:  That's correct, because the 
magistrate did really not make a finding on prong one. 
The -- the magistrate misapprehended the intention of 
the circuit's first remand by thinking that it had 
mandated a nothing-to-lose rule.  And if there was 
nothing to lose, it was prong one ineffectiveness, so 
there was no need to make a finding.  So we're left 
without a finding.

 But the circuit on -- on its second and 

third opinion noted that his concept of premeditation 
and deliberation as having mental-health concepts was 
wrong because of the 1982 amendment to the statutes, 
which removed many of the mental-health concepts and --
and put them over into the insanity phase.  And so when 
he said to the court at the hearing, Mr. Mirzayance --
after the jury found him maturely and meaningfully 
deliberated, that's language that was eliminated in --

in 1982, and that is the mental-health concept.

 And -- and this point is very important to 

this argument.  When he was arguing to the jury, he said 
he can't premeditate and deliberate because he's 
mentally ill.  He's mentally diseased.  And he was cut 
off by the prosecutor and the court who gave an 
instruction that said -- 853 of the trial transcript, 
saying the fact that Mr. Mirzayance may have deliberated 
for irrational reasons brought on by mental disease is 
not a defense to this case.  His reasons can be 
irrational in deliberating.

 And that should have tipped him off that 
this jury was precluded from taking the psychiatric 
testimony -- the psychological testimony of the one 
witness at the guilt phase and -- and deeming that a 
negation of any ability to win on a wrongfulness 
standard.  And -- and I might also add --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But they didn't -- they 

didn't strike the experts' testimony.  The experts 
testified at some length, the -- the psychiatrist.

 MR. SEVILLA:  He did.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So that was relevant to 

premeditation and deliberation, and the jury did 
consider what the mental health expert said.

 MR. SEVILLA:  They did consider what he

said, but they were precluded from channeling that into 
a defense to premedication and deliberation.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what about -- what do 

you do with the last sentence of the supreme -- of the 
California Court of Appeals' opinion?  "None of the 
exculpatory evidence defendant recites, including 
evidence of his mental disorder, was reasonably likely 
to persuade a jury that defendant did not premeditate 
and deliberate the killing."  And from that they 
conclude that there is no reasonable probability that, 
but for the errors, a different verdict would have been 
reached, i.e., that it does not satisfy the second part 
of Strickland.

 MR. SEVILLA:  And -- and you were reading 

from the California Court of Appeals --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I was just reading from the 
California court of Appeals.  Because I look at that.  I 
think when I go back and see what was the evidence in 
front of them, I am going to find all of these -- all of 
these things.  Not the last part by the way, not -- not 
the part about the counsel admitting he was wrong or 
whatever this argument we are having.  We won't find 
that, but we'll find everything else there.

 And so they're using that as the basis to 
say there was no prejudice, and now I guess that the

Ninth Circuit and the Federal courts would have to defer 
to that finding on prejudice.  Now, what's your response 
to that?

 MR. SEVILLA:  Well, the California Court of 
Appeals did not have before them the evidence that came 
in by way of petition, which was all of the psychiatric 
opinions of the forensic psychiatrists who gave 
declarations saying that Mr. Mirzayance was insane at 
the time of the homicide.  That is not within the court 
of appeal opinion because the court of appeal opinion is 
on the four corners of the record, and this was 
collateral to that.

 So any statement along those lines did not 

encompass the most powerful evidence that was presented, 
which would have been all of the psychiatric opinion 
testimony about his mental state at the time of the 
offense.

 And then, of course, we know that at the 
federal evidentiary hearing, this defense was found 
credible, and one of the state doctors came over to the 
defense side and testified that Mirzayance did not 
understand wrongfulness at the time of the homicide 
because of the psychosis.  And this doctor made an 
error, and its clear from the record at the evidentiary 
hearing, he had an error in his understanding of the NGI

test in California.  He thought if you met prong one you 
understood the nature and quality of the act, you were 
sane, and he never went to wrongfulness.

 But when he was asked by the State at this 

hearing, well, what about his ability to understand 
wrongfulness, and the doctor said he didn't understand 
wrongfulness.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Please correct me if I'm 

wrong, but as a general rule psychiatrists don't --
don't testify as to the ultimate standard.  They testify 
as to the condition and -- and the symptoms of -- of the 
defendant, and then the jury makes that conclusion.

 MR. SEVILLA:  In California in 1982, there 

was a statutory amendment which prohibited forensic 
experts from testifying to opinions at the guilt phase, 
so that -- on legal issues like premeditation, 
deliberation, so they could not, Dr. Satz could not 
testify at the guilt phase on premeditation and 
deliberation.  At the insanity phase, they absolutely 
can testify as to whether he was sane or not.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Had Wager ever 

represented a defendant who pled NGI?

 MR. SEVILLA:  No.  He testified this was his 

first NGI defense.

raised the issue about couldn't these -- in the 
prejudice calculus, couldn't these psychiatrists have 
been impeached with the fact that they found no 
premeditation and deliberation?  Well, California 
statute under Penal Code section 28 prohibits their 
opinion on premeditation and deliberation at the guilt 
phase where the issue is premeditation and deliberation. 
So, I can't understand how a court would let in their 
opinions on premeditation and deliberation when there's 
a totally separate issue of insanity at the insanity 
phase.

 It's -- if it's irrelevant or prohibited at 
the guilt phase, where premeditation is the issue, it's 
surely going to be irrelevant at the NGI phase, where 
it's not an issue, and we have a totally different 
standard.  As the courts of California have said, one 
can be guilty of first degree murder and be insane. 
That's -- that's clear.

 So, in this case, we have an attorney who, 

for whatever reasons, based on a subjective sense of 
hopelessness, gave up his client's only and best 
defense, a defense that was found credible at the 
federal evidentiary hearing.  Once -- once that defense 
is found credible, that bespeaks of the unreasonableness 
of counsel giving it up.  It's a credible defense, it's

the only defense available to him, and counsel gave it 
up for no tactical benefit.

 There was no upside to this.  There was a 

clear downside to it, because it consigned his client to 
29 years to life as opposed to the possibility of 
treatment in a mental hospital, and potentially, upon 
the restoration of sanity, potential relief -- release 
if he could prove his restoration.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Has he served his time so 

far in a regular institution?

 MR. SEVILLA:  Yes, he has.  He is in Mule 
Creek State Prison just south of Stockton, California, 
and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that the special -- he 

made a request for a particular prison.  Is that the 
one?

 MR. SEVILLA:  I don't think so.  I don't 

believe -- I think at the sentencing hearing, the trial 
judge did not do anything special except sentence him to 
prison?  Although both -- in terms of the bona fides of 
his disease, both the prosecutor and the judge at the 
time of the sentencing said he was clearly a mentally 
diseased person.  So that -- this -- this bespeaks back 
to the credibility of the defense which was established 
by the mental disease evidence which stemmed from

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN E. MERCER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MERCER:  Just a couple of points I would 

like to make briefly to clarify a couple things.
 First off, there was no finding that 

Attorney Wager misunderstood California law or somehow 
was under the impression that a finding of first degree 
murder was legally precluded a finding of NGI.  He 
argued at the State trial that there's no question that 
an insane person can deliberate, and surely while the 
jury's verdict was as devastating under the facts of 
this case, he didn't close up his books and go home.

 He told the trial judge, we need to reassess 
this, I need to decide who I'm going to call, I need to 
consult with my doctors and my co-counsel and decide 
what we're going to do.

 And as the district court found here, and as 

Wager stated in the State court declaration, there was 
no final decision made until the morning of trial when 
the parents expressed a profound reluctance to assist

their son.  And this was, in fact, his first NGI 
defense, but as Mirzayance's family attorney stated in 
his State court declaration, Attorney Wager was a 
ten-year expert on mental health and sanity issues with 
the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.  He had 
tried more than a hundred trials.  He was the expert. 
He had done his homework here.  He knew what he had to 
present.  He did not make a rash decision.  He consulted 
with co-counsel, and concluded reasonably under his 
professional valuation that the defense could not meet 
its affirmative burden of proof here.

 The second thing I would like to clarify on 

Justice Ginsburg's point, there was some sentencing 
discretion left here.  It's correct that Wager in 
hindsight said, well, perhaps there was nothing to lose. 
But he argued to the sentencing judge the very fact that 
his client knew the wrongfulness of his actions and was 
so remorseful should entitle him to a lesser sentence on 
the weapons enhancement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  What discretion did the 

judge have?

 MR. MERCER:  The -- that the -- the 

sentencing judge could have imposed a high, middle or 
low-term for the weapons enhancement.  The underlying 
sentence was 25 to life, my friend is correct, it's set

by statute.  But he had discretion on sentence 
enhancement, and he was convinced that Mirzayance was 
remorseful, and gave him a mid-term instead of a 
high-term, despite the fact.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there was also 
something about the revocation?  There were three 
revocations involved, I thought, two years on each.

 MR. MERCER:  I don't believe that's correct. 

I think it was a straightforward 25 years to life 
sentence plus a weapons enhancement of four years added 
on.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You keep saying 29 years. 

Is it 29 years or is that just a misprint --

MR. MERCER:  It's -- the aggregate sentence 
is 25 -- excuse me.  The aggregate sentence is 29 years 
to life.  It's 25 years to life for the first degree 
murder, plus four years for the weapons enhancement in 
this term, a mid-term, because Wager successfully argued 
that his client was remorseful.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What would he have 

gotten in the high term?

 MR. MERCER:  I believe that it was -- I 

believe that it was six years as opposed to four.  It 
may have been eight as opposed to four.  I don't know. 
That's not discussed in the State court record.

And finally, Mr. Mirzayance concedes that 

"nothing to lose" would be an inappropriate new rule by 
this Court.  He no longer calls it that.  He doesn't --
he disagrees with the dissent view on this.  What he 
calls it is this:  This is the rule, in his own 
description, at page 30 of his brief, how the Ninth 
Circuit granted relief here.  Excuse me, I see my time 
is expired.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why don't you --
MR. MERCER:  That the decision fairly read 

states only that counsel has a duty to present 
substantial viable defense where there was an objective 
prospect for success and no strategic or other benefit 
abandoning it.  This Court has never held such a rule to 
bind the states.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
