CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

11 

            

Congress adopted the Handicapped Children's

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19

Protection Act to make clear that the IDEA is not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive vehicle for protecting the rights of children 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with disabilities, and Congress also sought to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear that cases brought under other Federal statutes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, may proceed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly to court so long as they are not actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking relief that is also available under the IDEA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under that statutory text, it is irrelevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the plaintiff could have sought some other form 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of relief that would have been available under the IDEA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose -- suppose that 

  

 

 

 

 

there is a school district and two surrounding school 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts within the same Federal court jurisdiction and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same circuit.  Have each been ordered to make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

accommodations under FAPE -- under FAPE for a dog?  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then the person in the third school district just sues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the ADA.  Is there an exhaustion problem? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, I think the question 

   

  

 

 

 

5 

6 

would be:  What is the relief that the plaintiff is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking in that third lawsuit? 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So it just depends on what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

the complaint says? 

 

 

9 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  I think it depends on the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

relief the Plaintiff is seeking, because that's what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory language says.  So the --

  

 

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then you're saying 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

that the artful form of the complaint suffices to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject the district court to damages that it might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- the school district to damages that it might not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise have had to pay. 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, a couple of points 

   

  

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

about that.  First, I don't think it's the artful form 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the complaint; I think it is the relief the Plaintiff 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is seeking.  But, secondly, remember, this is damages 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

being sought under a separate Federal statute that would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fully apply even if exhaustion existed.  The question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't whether the school district is going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subjected to damages under the ADA or not.  That is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that might exist anyway. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

            

The question is whether IDEA proceedings 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

have to first be exhausted and what Congress said about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in this statute, unlike in other Federal statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where it said exhaustion is required whenever any remedy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

is available. 

 

6 

            

 

Here, what Congress said is when the 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

plaintiff is seeking relief that is also available under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the IDEA --

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you could -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

could have -- you could have, as Justice Kennedy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested, gone the IDEA route.  You could have asked to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accommodate the dog, and -- and if you had done that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you were turned down, could you then switch to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ADA track, or would you have to, having started under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IDEA, continue on that route? 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, under Respondent's 

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

position here, I think we would have -- and under the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth Circuit's position certainly, we would have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow all of the IDEA procedures through to their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion before filing a lawsuit under the ADA.  I --

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

I don't think -- I think we still would be able to file 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ADA lawsuit. 

 

 

23 

            

Now, the -- there's a difference not just in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

terms of relief in the lawsuit that would be filed under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ADA versus the one that would be filed under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

IDEA, which is, under the IDEA, in order to get any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief, the plaintiff would have to show not just that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a denial of a dog, but that that actually 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprived the plaintiff of a free appropriate public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4

education. 

6 

            

Under the ADA, the -- the rights that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

individuals with disabilities have to bring their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service dogs to public facilities are the same in all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public facilities.  You have a service dog; you can 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

bring it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I understand 

    

   

 

 

you'd be making two arguments.  One is that you don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to exhaust because you're asking for damages, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those aren't available under the IDEA. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Yes. 

  

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the second one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is, you don't have to exhaust because you're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaining about the fair and appropriate public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

education provision.  Are those separate arguments or do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to satisfy both of them? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  No.  I think they're 

    

  

 

 

independent arguments, Mr. Chief Justice, so I think the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact that we are seeking emotional distress damages, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those damages, as the Sixth Circuit recognized, are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available under the IDEA, is fully sufficient for us to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

1 

prevail here to say that exhaustion was not required. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

case, why -- I would suspect that the denial of what is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sought under the IDEA for a fair and appropriate public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

education is something that could well cause emotional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distress in -- in most cases.  And so is all you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying is that you have to tack on to an IDEA claim, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim for damages for emotional distress and then you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have to exhaust, and so whenever a school district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denies an element of an FAPE or a proposed element, they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will always face two-track litigation? 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  I don't think that that's 

    

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

right, Your Honor, because -- because it's not the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that every time there is a denial of a free appropriate 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

public education under the IDEA there is also going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a violation of the ADA.  Right, these -- these are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

overlapping --

 

18 

            

19 

            

20 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true, but --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- you could find -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

mean, in -- I have exactly the same question, in a very 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

large number of suits, you know, in a very large number 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of suits brought -- or controversies -- where a child is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking a special plan, there is a statute that gives 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

him that right, and it rests -- rests heavily on his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

getting together or his parents getting together with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the school board and trying to work something out that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

makes sense. 

 

4 

            

Now, it seems to me, as the Chief Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

just said, that if we accept your first argument, not in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all cases, but in many cases, where their lawyer wishes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to avoid this exhaustion requirement, all he would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do is wait and then sue, not for putting the child in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a private school but rather for emotional suffering. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

Now, if that argument -- if what I have just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

said is right, which I think is what was just said by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Chief Justice, that would seem to gut the carefully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

written procedural system that the IDEA sets up.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what is concerning me, and I don't think the word 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"relief" has to be read in the technical way in which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're reading it. 

 

 

17 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, so -- so I think this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

goes not just to what the word "relief" actually says. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think, you know, this is a highly carefully crafted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural regime as Your Honor says, Justice Breyer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

But part of the careful crafting of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

regime is the Handicapped Children's Protection Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which, remember, overruled a decision of this Court or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

overturned a decision of this Court that had sought to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

channel all disability education claims into IDEA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

proceedings. 

2 

            

What Congress said in the HCPA was there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

other statutes that may provide independent remedies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under -- at that point it was the Rehabilitation Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1983.  Congress later added the ADA to that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list, and those cases may be pursued independently, said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress, so long as the plaintiffs are not actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking anything they can get in IDEA proceedings. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The answer to me, and I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

think to the Chief, so far is, so what?  Because that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Congress wanted.  Is there any answer other than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

that? 

13 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, so I -- I mean, I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

think there are a couple of answers other than that.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do think -- I do think it's what Congress wanted, and I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think if you look at both the text and the legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history, Senator Weicker's brief goes through this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shows that it's what Congress wanted. 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

But, in addition to that, yes, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

there -- there is -- there's a lot of reason to believe, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and we have an amicus brief here from former special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

education administrators Thomas Hehir, Melody Musgrove, 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and -- and Madeline Will, who specifically say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look, we think that what parents are going to do based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on our experience is go through IDEA procedures, because

what they want is to get the relief that's available in

IDEA proceedings. 

 

3 

            

 

 

There are some cases, like this case, like 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

the Fry case -- or I'm sorry -- like the Payne case in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ninth Circuit, where you have a case of abuse, where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the principal injuries are not injuries to education, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are emotional injuries.  Those are the cases that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are going to proceed to court.  So I think it's --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess that's 

    

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

why -- but even if what you say is right, and it makes a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of sense, a lawyer advising a client might advise 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that, look, this is what you want the school to do so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you can have a free and appropriate education for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your child.  You will have a lot more leverage getting 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the school to do that if you also sue them under the ADA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Section 504, and the school board is sitting there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at it and say, gosh, we are not only exposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what relief is under the IDEA, but we are going to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to pay damages.  You understand my point? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

21 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  I do. 

    

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As a practical 

   

  

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

matter, it would be -- could well be in the child's and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parents' interest to proceed along two tracks because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes it much more likely, even if what all they really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want, they don't care about the money.  They really care 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

11 

1 

about education for their child. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  But I think the point about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

that -- I think that is right about a lot of practical 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues here.  The crucial point there is that exhaustion 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not change the leverage that the plaintiffs have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, right?  So even under the Sixth Circuit's rule, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the plaintiffs, our clients, could have exhausted IDEA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings, said at the time we filed an IDEA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative complaint, by the way, school district, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are also going to sue you under the ADA and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rehabilitation Act for damages. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Later on, once we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are done with this. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Once we are done with this. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

And --

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think one of the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

important things in this type of proceeding is timing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  I mean, we are talking about a school year, and 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

all this takes time.  So the idea that well, when all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this ends, you know, who knows, I mean, it gathers a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debate about how quickly these things are resolved, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we might bring this.  But if you do it at the same time, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that gives you the leverage when you need it to get the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accomodation in place that you want for the child. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

there are obviously a lot of variables.  I think a lot 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

of defense lawyers would certainly say being threatened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with long, drawn-out proceedings at the end of which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a damages award is pretty significant leverage as well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I think the point is that time also works both ways 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, right?  One of the things that Congress was trying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do in the HCPA was recognize that the ADA and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rehabilitation Act in 1983 are independent, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring parents to first proceed through what are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely to be time-consuming proceedings under a separate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute, the IDEA, that can't give them the relief that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are seeking under those independent statutes.

10 

11 

12 

13 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your whole point again 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

is it depends on what's in the complaint.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute says that before a filing of a civil action, you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to exhaust.  If the statute were written your way, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would have said at the time you filed a complaint, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the complaint must ask "only for."  That's what you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, but that's not what the statute says. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  So -- so I'd say a couple of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

things about that, Your Honor.  I mean, first of all, I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think seeking relief might naturally be read to look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's in the complaint.  But in any event, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think our argument turns on what we asked for in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint, particularly.  We have made clear throughout 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

these proceedings, not just in the complaint but as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings have gone on, that what we are asking for is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensatory damages for emotional distress. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could -- could I ask about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

5 

that, Mr. Bagenstos? 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And this takes you back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

the first part of the Chief Justice's question, just so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I can understand the argument, is you're really making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

two arguments. 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

            

One argument is initially when we filed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint and ever since, we've really only sought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emotional distress damages, and emotional distress 

 

 

 

 

 

damages are something that can't be given under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

IDEA. 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that's one argument. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

But there is a second argument which says, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you know, putting that aside, the reason why we don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need to exhaust is because we are not alleging that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've been denied a fair and appropriate public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

education.  You know, we are alleging some other denial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or -- or deprivation, but we are not alleging that.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree that the school has given us a free appropriate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public education.  And that, in itself, as I understand 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

1 

it, would also mean that you don't have to exhaust, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

right? 

3 

            

So it can be one or the other.  Is that what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

you're saying. 

 

5 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Yes.  So -- yes.  So I 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

6 

tried -- I -- to say -- yeah. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, this -- this case is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

actually the combination of the two, is what you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying.  So in some ways, you're saying this is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easiest case where both are true.  You're neither 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleging the denial of a FAPE, nor are you seeking the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of damages that an IDEA officer could provide.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's the intersection of the two theories.  But -- but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if I understand your argument, either one of those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

things would mean that you don't have to exhaust.  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

that right? 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  I agree with that, Justice 

    

 

 

 

 

Kagan.  Yes.  I think this -- I think under either 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

theory we wouldn't have to exhaust, and because --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because this is a case where both what we are seeking is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that categorically is unavailable in IDEA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings.  And --

  

 

23 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what --

  

 

 

 

24 

25 

Mr. Bagenstos, could you clarify what you are giving up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by taking this route, by suing under the ADA and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

under the IDEA? 

 

 

2 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  So -- so what -- what we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

giving up and what parents are giving up generally by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuing this route is anything you can get under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IDEA.  So that is reimbursement of educational expenses. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is compensatory education.  That is changing an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

IEP. 

8 

            

Now, we are seeking none of that.  We are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

seeking none of that in this lawsuit.  What we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

seeking --

 

11 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you might be.  I mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

and this goes to -- I mean, suppose -- suppose that you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't alleging a denial of a FAPE, but you were 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

seeking damages that included, you know, I sent my kid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to private school.  I had to hire a tutor.  Damages that 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you could get from an IDEA officer, but for some reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that didn't have to do with the denial of a FAPE. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're saying that you don't have to exhaust in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

context either. 

 

20 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Right.  And so -- so that is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

the second argument, and I agree that the Court does not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to reach that argument in order to rule in our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor here, but yes. 

 

 

 

24 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if we did, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

 

 

mean, it seems to me that that might address many of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

concerns that have been raised about the impact of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-track proceeding.  In other words, if, in fact -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your argument were to be that no, you need both, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to me that would address a lot of the practical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems.  Now, I appreciate the fact that you think, in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, both are present --

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- but yet you want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

to make a more aggressive argument that you only need 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

one. 

11 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Right.  And I think we -- I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

think we would certainly prevail under the "you need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both" theory, and that's why we alleged and we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argued throughout this case --

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And I suppose one 

   

  

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

understanding of this is we don't have to really deal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with what happens if you only have one, because you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying you have both.  Is that right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  That is entirely right. 

  

 

 

 

 

So -- so let's be clear about the second point here.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendants have said all along that because they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave my client a one-on-one aid, that all of her 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical and educational needs were satisfied.  And we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have not challenged that, and it would be difficult for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us to challenge that.  I know this Court has a different

free appropriate public education in front of it later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this term that may clarify what FAPE means, but under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current Sixth Circuit law it would be difficult for us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to challenge it.  What we have said is the injury my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client experienced is not a denial of education, but, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example, the humiliation that she experienced when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she was forced to go to the toilet with the stall door 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open and four adults watching her because defendants did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not trust her to use her dog to transfer to the toilet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bowl.  That is not a free appropriate public education 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

claim, Your Honor. 

 

 

            

And, Mr. Chief Justice --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that claim could be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

made by someone who doesn't qualify, who is disabled but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't qualify for ADA because she doesn't have any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

learning disability. 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Absolutely.  A person that 

    

  

 

 

has a disability that does not require special education 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

so is not covered by the IDEA would still be covered by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ADA and be able to make exactly the same claim in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school here, yes.  That's right, Justice Ginsburg. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What would happen if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

claim was that the child suffered emotional damages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of the denial of educational benefits? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  So -- so I think that would

be a harder case because that would present only the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first -- the first of our two theories, that would be we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be seeking damages that are not available under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the IDEA.  And remember, the statute says seeking relief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is also available, not alleges in injury that might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be addressed in IDEA proceedings.  Now, under that plain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text, I think exhaustion wouldn't be required, but our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case is stronger because we have both here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And if I may reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The parties, both parties, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

government now all agree that the rule under which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth Circuit decided this case is wrong, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion is required only if the relief that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff actually seeks in the case is available under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the IDEA.  In light of that agreement, we think the most 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sensible way to resolve the case is simply to reverse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the decision below and let the claims go forward.

As the Sixth Circuit pointed out, the relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

actually sought in this case is money damages, not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change to the IEP, and that relief is not available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the IDEA. 

 

 

5 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Martinez, that begs 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

the last question that was asked, which is the Payne --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know the Ninth Circuit Payne decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It doesn't do just that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

It doesn't just look just at the relief.  It looks at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the nature of the claims and decides whether they are a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact claim or not, whether it is seeking a change in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FAPE or not, in essence in substance.  So it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at it technically as we are asking for relief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But it's -- it's looking at whether or not a FAPE claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the substance of the allegation.  You're disagreeing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the Ninth Circuit approach, presumably. 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  Justice Sotomayor, I just 

   

  

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

want to be clear, I -- we understand the Ninth Circuit's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach.  We understand the Ninth Circuit, and we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained this in our -- our brief at the petition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage, to be departing from the other circuits, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually saying that what matters is what the plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually asks for. 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  What they -- what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

2 

3 

4 

they are saying is, is the nature of the relief that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are asking for, would it require or necessitate a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change in the fact?  That's one of the three prongs that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they look at. 

 

 

5 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  Are you talking about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

third prong in --

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes, exactly. 

  

 

 

MR. MARTINEZ:  We do disagree with that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

third prong, Your Honor.  But I think that third prong 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is addressed to circumstances in which the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements of the non-IDEA claim that's being brought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overlap entirely with the -- the provision of FAPE.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

just --

 

14 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let's go to the last 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

argument -- the last question directly, then.  Complaint 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says the FAPE was all wrong; it's hurt my child.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the nature of the complaint. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The -- and it seeks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

injunctive relief for the future --

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

23 

            

24 

            

25 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- not to be hurt. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. MARTINEZ:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right. 

  

 

 

MR. MARTINEZ:  You have exhausted --

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

FAPE -- when -- no other thing is said?  It's just, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want compensatory damages? 

 

 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  Yes.  We think that if you're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

seeking injunctive relief in a circumstance in which you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that the FAPE --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about no injunctive 

  

 

 

 

 

relief?  Past and future damages for emotional distress? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  I -- I think if there's -- if 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

the only relief sought in the complaint -- and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the statute says you look for is money damages --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we think that the text of the statute says that you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to figure out whether that relief sought is available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the IDEA.  And I think there's common agreement 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that that relief sought is not available under the IDEA, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so you would not need to exhaust. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now I want to address --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- if it's that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

simple, if it's that simple, why are we in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument?  You apply ordinary exhaustion principles. 

  

 

 

 

 

Under ordinary exhaustion principles, you never have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaust and exhaustion would be futile.  Okay?  So you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say exhaustion applies, it would be futile, I can't get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what I want, end of the matter.  That's -- what is all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this complexity?  I had thought that it might be because 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

-- well, you tell me. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  I -- I agree with that, 

    

   

 

 

 

3 

4 

Justice Breyer.  And we think that what Congress did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here was adopt a rule that essentially embodies that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

principle. 

6 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So could I say that?  Could 

   

  

  

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

I say, very well.  What they did here was adopt --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well-known, for a hundred years or more -- exception to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the exhaustion requirement where exhaustion would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

futile?

MR. MARTINEZ:  You can --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Judge, you go back and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

apply that to this case, end of case.  No reason for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special law, for prisons, for IDEA, for other things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think you could adopt the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  And it's set out in the McCarthy decision.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set out in the House report on page 7 --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I haven't memorized 

   

  

 

 

that.  Are they essentially --

  

 

 

 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- what I am saying?  If I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

go to Pierce on administrative law, I look up Davis, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will find some words --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  What --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and those are the words? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. MARTINEZ:  The words I would suggest are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

the words that -- that you use are as follows:  That if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hearing officer lacks authority to grant the relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sought -- those are the words of the House report --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then exhaustion is not required.  Those are also --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just want to make sure 

    

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

of the government's position.  Is the position of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States that a FAPE cannot include relief for this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of problem:  Personal assistance during the school 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

day to accommodate the particular disabilities? 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  In some circumstances, a FAPE 

   

  

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

can accommodate that, but we don't think that that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant question for purposes of applying the statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the statute turns -- says that the exhaustion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question turns on whether the relief that the plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is actually seeking -- those are the terms that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute uses -- the relief that the civil action is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking is available under the IDEA.  Now --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but it talks about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

before filing the complaint. 

 

 

 

21 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  It says before filing the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

complaint after the loss --

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose it was -- suppose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

it was very clear that most FAPE plans cover precisely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this kind of problem.  Same case? 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think that if -- if -- the

7 

8 

facts of whether a FAPE would -- would allow for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school to take account of the service dog really isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question because the question under the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turns on what the -- what the person is asking for; what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the relief that he seeks.  And if the statute says that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the civil action has to be seeking particular form of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief, and if that --

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All you're talking 

  

 

 

 

10 

about -- all you're talking about is artful pleading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

then. 

12 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  No, not at all, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

And I want to address your question and the -- and the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns that came up, the practical concerns about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parents who actually do want -- what they really want is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a change to the IEP. 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

If the parent files the lawsuit, the ADA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

lawsuit, and says I want an injunction that's going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require the service dog, that is the kind of relief that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have to be exhausted.  I want to be --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So would he have to get a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

service dog if in fact it's going to cost him $5 million 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in damages?  And they are talking about before filing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the complaint.  All right?

in negotiation with the board.  And you think I'm also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to this under this ADA statute, let's file a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint and asked for damages.  It will be res

might work in this case, there are thousands of cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where parents don't have the money to litigate, where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some do or some don't, where boards are in difficult

cases which are worked out through negotiation won't be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  No, I don't think that's 

   

  

 

 

 

right, Your Honor, because I think it's a practical 

   

   

 

 

 

 

matter.  I'm -- I'm a parent.  If one of my children 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were being harmed in a school, I would try -- and I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought that this was -- this was wrong, I would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately be looking to -- to find the most -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quickest form of relief that the law could provide me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the quickest form of relief for a parent who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually wants a change on the ground to the situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is to follow the IDEA procedures. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  No.  But the 

  

  

  

 

 

 

point is you're likely -- they are going to listen to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you a lot more carefully if you say, by the way, I'm

Justice, I think what I would do in that circumstance is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursue the IDEA process and say up front, you know, if I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lose in this IDEA process, I'm going to bring the ADA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim with all the damages involved.  So I can make that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threat at the beginning because everyone agrees here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that at the end of the day, regardless of whether or not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I exhaust, I can ultimately go to the ADA process and --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or file a suit under the ADA or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

don't think that's what you would do, but I guess you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the better judge of that than I am.

18 

19 

20 

your position on the question I asked earlier about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-track proceeding?  Is it enough that they're seeking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages, or -- and is it enough that the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  We think --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- they're fine with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

the FAPE or the IEP, or does it have to be both? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  No.  We think that these are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

two different, independent reasons why exhaustion is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

27 

1 

required here. 

 

2 

            

The plaintiffs in this case are seeking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

money damages.  Money damages is not available under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IDEA; therefore, they don't have to exhaust.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

argument one. 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

            

Argument two is every one on both sides of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case agrees that a FAPE was provided and that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IDEA was not violated.  It therefore makes very little 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense for the Court to say that you need to go to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative process so that the question of whether a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FAPE was provided in the IDEA process -- the IDEA was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated can be resolved, because both parties already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree on that. 

 

 

14 

            

Our legal system does not require parties to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

go into any proceeding in court, in an agency and make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments that they do not believe are true. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is the parties' 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

concession sufficient to answer that question? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think the parties' 

    

 

 

 

concession is sufficient to answer that question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What if you had a complaint 

   

  

 

 

 

 

where the parties did concede that IDEA was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated, that a FAPE had been provided, but as you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked in the allegations in the complaint, it really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems that there is grounds to think that a FAPE was not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

28 

1 

2 

provided and that the IDEA was violated?  What do you do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a complaint that looks like that? 

   

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think if the parties agree 

    

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

that the FAPE was provided, that should be enough.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't think -- because I don't think that the statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has in mind a sort of process by which either a Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court or an IDEA hearing officer is given some sort of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

roving commission to go sniff out FAPE and IDEA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

violations. 

10 

            

The IDEA haring process is an adversarial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

process.  It depends on the parties to come together, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring their disagreements forward, bring evidence, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then a decision is made.  It's not some of process where 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hearing officer is supposed to say, well, I know the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties agree that there is no legal violation, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're going to go ahead and maybe there is one anyway. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

And I think that -- that the rule that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

Respondents advocate here, which would require people to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring claims that they do not believe has merit, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only is it unheard of in American law, but it actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is inconsistent with the IDEA itself, which would allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for an award of attorney's fees against a parent who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brings a claim that's frivolous, unreasonable, or 

   

 

 

 

 

24 

without foundation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

The complaint that was actually filed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

this case, in response to Justice Kagan, illustrates the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point -- the type of dispute Congress chose to channel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through local education experts.  They don't have both. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

They got neither. 

 

 

11 

            

The brief in opposition, Appendix page 21, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

has the complaint's prayer for relief, and it contains 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three forms of relief that we believe are available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the IDEA. 

 

 

15 

            

First, a declaration that E.F. was entitled 

   

 

 

 

 

16 

to attend school with her dog. 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

Second, money to pay for the cost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

Petitioners incurred in home schooling E.F., and for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

counseling. 

20 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell us what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

page that's on? 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  That's page 21 of the -- of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orange brief in opposition. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I know.  The 

   

  

  

 

Respondents -- appellants --

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

MR. KATYAL:  Yeah, the orange one.  The --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- what allegation 

  

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

says they want reimbursement --

 

 

 

 

4 

            

5 

            

6 

cetera? 

7 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- for her schooling, et 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  So first they want a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

declaration, okay, and that's -- that's number B.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then C is --

   

 

10 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the declaration was that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

the ADA had been violated. 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  Correct.  And our point is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

that the statute requires you to look at, is this relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available under the IDEA?  Here, the relief --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it's not available; 

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

you don't get a declaration that the ADA has been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated or the Rehabilitation Act has been violated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from IDEA officer. 

 

 

19 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely, Justice Kagan. 

  

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

That's -- you know, we couldn't read the statute to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the second half of Section 1415, the exhaustion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement, to say you've got to show a -- you know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the IDEA gives that form of relief.  Really, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think what 1415 does is it has two parts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

The first, as Mr. Bagenstos started his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

argument with, was it's about the what.  It's about what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can -- it's about -- it's saying that Smith v. Robinson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was wrong; that, basically, you know, there was rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above and beyond the IDEA. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

The second part, though, is the timing.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

it says if you're choosing to bring one of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuits, you got to first exhaust the IDEA procedures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the relief available is one that you could get from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- from the IDEA.  If you read it to say, oh, you've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got to show in -- an IDEA violation, that they've got to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask for an IDEA declaration, then you're essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gutting the statute. 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Katyal, any relief? 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

I mean, that -- the -- again, your furthest argument is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if any relief is available under the IDEA, you must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursue that route first.  But that's exactly what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress declined to adopt when it was proposed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

National School Board Association.  So -- so you must be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying something short of if any relief is available. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. KATYAL:  We'd certainly caution the 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

Court about failed legislation, trying to read too much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into that.  But, you know, you're right, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg.  That's our broadest argument. 

  

 

 

 

24 

            

And the argument works like this:  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

complaint has invoked the idea that they're seeking any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

appropriate relief.  And here, any appropriate relief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

means anything that is available that could be granted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by a Federal court.  If you do --

   

  

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's boilerplate. 

  

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

That may or may not be significant.  But I -- do you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concede -- and I couldn't quite tell from your brief --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they will be able to get money damages for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything they're seeking under the ADA in Section 504 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the IDEA? 

 

 

10 

            

MR. KATYAL:  We don't concede everything, 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

but we do think that they can -- that they get a part. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And our red brief at pages 44 to 50 explains here the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only thing the complaint seeks is the word "damages." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's at the brief in appendix at page 21.  And to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand the damages, you have to look to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

complaint. 

17 

            

The complaint isolates, as our red brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

 

 

goes through in quoting chapter and verse of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

complaint --

 

20 

            

21 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  -- things like compensatory 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

education, things like home schooling. 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They're asking --

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

they're asking for other things; right?  I know 

    

 

 

 

 

 

basically -- all right. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

1 

            

So are you saying they'll get some of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

damages they're seeking, but not all of them? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Correct.  That is --

  

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then under 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

Jones case, isn't the rule, well, then, you know, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get to proceed with the things that they're not going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be able to get under the IDEA? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely not, Your Honor, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

a few reasons. 

 

 

10 

            

First, the Jones case itself is -- your --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

your opinion is about letting good claims go forward 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

versus bad claims.  Here, there are only two claims. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One is a violation of the ADA; the second is a violation 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Rehabilitation Act. 

 

 

 

15 

            

Now, it is true that one of their prayers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

for relief is damages.  Not, by the way, emotional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages, which is what their reply brief paints it out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and says it 27 times.  It just says "damages."  And so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in order to -- Jones does not permit, and, indeed, no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision of this Court has ever permitted a plaintiff to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try and slice and dice a prayer for relief in one way or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another.  Rather, the question is:  Is this claim under 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your opinion a good claim or a bad claim? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

24 

            

Liberty Mutual, your decision in Liberty 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

Mutual says a claim is a cause of action.  And here the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

1 

2 

question, then, under 1415 is, is the cause of action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that requires exhaustion?  Here --

  

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When I look at the 

   

  

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

claimed harms, which the only allegations besides the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prayer for relief at the end is in response --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's Appellate 11, 51A through F, every one of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those harms alleged is a component of emotional harm. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nowhere are they saying she was harmed by having to pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for -- to pay for a tutoring program, or harmed by her 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mother losing her job, which is what your brief was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

talking about. 

 

12 

            

Here, all of the harms alleged are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

essentially compensatory emotional harms:  A, the denial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of equal access; B, the denial of the use of Wonder; C, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interference to form bonds with other kids; D, denial of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an opportunity to interact with other children.  And F 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says it very directly:  emotional distress and pain, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

embarrassment, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

of enjoyment. 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Those are -- every one of these are the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classic damage harms that are compensatory. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  So --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how does the IDEA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provide compensatory damages for these injuries? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MARTINEZ:  Our brief goes into this in

detail at those pages. 

 

 

 

2

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

to look for it in the complaint, and I couldn't. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, I do think that the only 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

place in which emotional is isolated is F.  This is, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, a non-exhaustive list in paragraph 51.  And the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

things like interference and denial of the opportunity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to interact are exactly the kinds of things IDEA relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers provide in the form of counseling.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Katyal, think of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

it this way:  Suppose this girl wanted to go into a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public library a couple of times a week and the library 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, you can't take your dog here; we're going to just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide you with a librarian who will help you do all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the things that your dog otherwise helps you with, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the girl brings a suit. 

   

 

 

17 

            

Isn't that suit exactly the suit that she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

brought, except that instead of a library, it's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

school?  But that's her -- that's her claim and those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are her damages, that she was deprived of access to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public facility in a way that caused her distress and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

emotional harm. 

 

23 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Kagan, that may work in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

that case, as opposed to this one.  That's because 1415 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a unique exhaustion statute geared to the school

setting.  It's a carefully calibrated situation where 

   

  

 

 

 

the IDEA -- Congress --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this goes back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg's point.  I mean, the entire point of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute and the overruling of our prior case was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress saying the fact that the IDEA exists for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schools does not mean that you don't have separate ADA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Rehabilitation Act claims.  And if you bring those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate kind of claims, which are essentially denial of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access claims to public facilities, and then you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking in addition to that for a form of damages that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has nothing to do with what any IDEA officer can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide, then you can go forward without exhaustion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  That's exactly right in terms 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of explaining the first half of 1415.  It doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain the second half, the timing provisions of 1415. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And to understand this, one nice way of doing it is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just look at the government's brief that they filed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Payne, and this is going back to your question about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jones and Bock. 

 

 

            

The money damages suit, the government told 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ninth Circuit that a money damages suit would not go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward because implicit in it is a declaration that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is an IDEA violation. 

 

 

 

 

            

So if you -- Mr. Martinez said in response 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

37 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

before, if the complaint only sought emotional distress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money damages, could that suit go forward?  In Payne, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government said the reverse.  And the reason for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is that when a Federal court awards money damages, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first thing it is doing is issuing a declaration 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the underlying problem was a violation in some way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

or another. 

 

8 

            

 

So if you accept it, E.F.'s complaint here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

what you'd be doing is accepting the idea -- ordering a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaratory judgment that the school --

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see that.  I see this is 

    

    

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

what -- where -- where I am.  I want a quick reaction 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

from you, if you can give it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

The problem of deciding against you is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

necessarily in this case, but in other cases where, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, it would be fairly easy by how you write the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"damages" in your complaint to have judges deciding IEPs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without the preliminary negotiation and views of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school board, which would seriously undercut and hurt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- this statute, which is designed to get the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

educational plan. 

 

22 

            

The trouble with deciding it your way is, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

think, exactly what Justice Kagan said:  Almost anything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be written into an educational plan having to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the child's day at school.  And, therefore, when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

there is nothing more to it than a claim that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

librarian wrongly kept the dog out of the library -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school librarian, you wouldn't be able to bring the suit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because, after all, you could have written such a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing -- don't keep the dog out of the library -- in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan.  So what to do? 

  

 

 

 

            

 

Now, I'm here thinking in the back of my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind of words that have come up in other cases, like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"gravamen" of the complaint or -- which we've had in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many cases involving sovereign immunity or all kinds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things, which Holmes and, you know, Frankfurter talked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about.  What is the gravamen of the complaint? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And were we to say, let us look to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gravamen of the complaint, the heart of the complaint, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what it's really about.  If what it's really about is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant matter in respect to the IEP, then you do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to exhaust, unless, of course, it's futile.  If it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not, you don't; and then let the lower courts decide

this one. 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So three points. 

  

 

 

 

            

First, in response to the first half 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about -- about whether or not this would gut the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion provision, we absolutely agree.  And I found 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the answer Mr. Bagenstos gave to the Chief Justice in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your question about leverage and destroying the kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

carefully wrought system astonishing.  He said that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right, in that he admitted that this would destroy the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carefully wrought system. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

Now, second, would ours do that, going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

your other point.  Is this going to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought he simply said 

    

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

that if you're going the IDEA route, you must pursue it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the end.  But he said, we're not going the ADA route. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're asking the same thing that we would ask if this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child didn't have an IEP.  We are asking for access to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

the facilities. 

 

12 

            

MR. KATYAL:  As I understood his answer, 

   

  

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

Justice Ginsburg, to the question is that, yes, a lawyer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could walk in on day one and sue for money damages, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then -- and then extort or possibly leverage that into a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better situation in terms of money.  The amicus brief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the school board explains that this actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens in real life. 

 

 

 

19 

            

Now, with respect to the concern that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

had, I think this case is an easy one because in this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case the IEP, the complaint itself says the IEP denied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the dog.  If a Federal district court, going back to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan's first question, orders a declaratory 

   

 

 

 

 

judgment, which is what they sought expressly, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'd be calling the IEP into question.  That's why the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

1 

district court at petition appendix page 49 --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what does that say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

other than it's a recitation of fact?  There was an IEP, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it didn't include the dog. 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

MR. KATYAL:  And what that means is, if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

Federal district court said, here are money damages, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because you denied the dog, implicit in that -- and this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the government's brief in Payne as well as this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's own decision in Fair v. McNary, which I'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain in a moment.  That means that there is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaratory judgment that the government -- that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school erred and that itself called the IEP into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

question. 

14 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the Plaintiffs here are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

not suggesting that the IEP was deficient.  They are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying the IEP was perfectly efficient.  If all you look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at are the kinds of educational criteria that IEPs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually look at, then the dog isn't necessary.  What the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dog is necessary for is things that don't have anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do with the IEP, is what the plaintiffs say.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after all, that's what they are saying, and that's what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are seeking.  And that's what this statute suggests 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we ought to look to. 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Kagan, I think that's 

   

  

 

 

 

25 

wrong on the facts on the law.  On the facts, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

think you can affirm on that theory.  This is a new 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory that they have put through this Court that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow they've conceded there's no FAPE violation.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint itself --

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Katyal, you're --

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

you're supposed to look at a complaint as a whole, okay, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the moment it's filed. 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

What's clear in this complaint, because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

allegations say it, this is what happened.  It didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have it in the IDEA.  We asked them to do it; they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't do it.  They finally agreed to do it, and then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've placed our child in another school.  They have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph that says, She is now happily in another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school that welcomes her and her dog.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They then talk about all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the emotional distress.  At that moment, either because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of futility, because she can't change the IDEA at a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school she no longer attends, the school she is in is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already giving her her dog, there is no declaratory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief being sought that her current IDEA is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deficient -- forget about the past one -- is deficient. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why in the world, at the moment she filed the complaint, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would she have to go back or should have gone to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school earlier?  She no longer is seeking anything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

1 

related to the IDEA facet. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So, Justice Sotomayor, two 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

answers, and we agree with you, absolutely.  Read the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text of the complaint as we were having that interchange 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier.  The text of the complaint, including the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraphs you read, talk about how the denial of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dog undermined her independence.  And part of the IDEA, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of the three statutory goals, and this is in 20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.C. 1400(d)(1), is independence.  That's why your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

former colleagues on the Second Circuit --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We are now getting -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are now going past where I am, okay, or you're going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behind what I'm saying but not getting to the point, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

Mr. Katyal. 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

            

Maybe, before she changed schools, she might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been entitled to something related to her IDEA, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the moment this complaint was filed, on its own face, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where is it asking for any change, potentially or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise, to the IDEA that is no longer in effect? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  And that is my second answer to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

you. 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

So the second answer is the complaint asks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a declaratory judgment, and that's what we were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about at the beginning, to ask for declaratory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment under this Court's decision in Golden v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

Zwickler and City of Lyons, the only way they can invoke 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III jurisdiction is by saying there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable prospect that the situation would occur. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is not a word in the complaint that says she won't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

return to the school, and indeed, the Sixth Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grapples with this all the time, when children leave the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school and file these lawsuits.

2 

3 

4

8 

            

There is a case called Woods, which is at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

487 Federal Appendix 979, and what that case says is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even if you leave the school, the school has an ongoing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation to keep an IEP current in case the person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes back to the school. 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

If you adopted, if the Federal district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

court granted their declaratory judgment, the only way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they can do so, and the only way they can invoke Article 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

III processes is by saying, look, there is a chance E.F. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might come back. 

 

 

18 

            

And that happens all the time.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

happens, you know, in the Payne case itself.  People 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file lawsuits.  They leave the school, and then they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come back.  That's what they asked for, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor.  They didn't ask -- and, indeed, the Sixth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit briefing is very clear on this point.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never asked for emotional damages, or even the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"damages" doesn't appear --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would you fit into the

Payne three criteria, the Ninth Circuit's three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

criteria?

22

24 

25 

            

MR. KATYAL:  That -- that --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The Ninth Circuit uses 

  

 

 

 

 

to evaluate --

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Yes.  So we think that if 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's a denial, that -- that they can't just concede 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and say, oh, we think there is no FAPE violation, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then that allows an end-run around 1415. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Rather, we think 1415 asks:  Is the relief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

available?  And to understand whether the relief is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

available, it's not a subjective inquiry.  It can't be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff-centered.  It's got to be:  Objectively, is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

relief available?  So just --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How much relief -- going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

back to what you said before, I think you told me you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not pressing any relief.  So how much relief? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, I -- I do think that if 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

the complaint seeks relief that is available under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IDEA, then at least that claim can't go forward, going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to the Jones v. Bock thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, if, for example, Justice Ginsburg, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had a claim like the dog one here and then you had a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate claim that said something like the child was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

45 

being abused in the bathroom or something like that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that didn't implicate a FAPE or an IDEA, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly I think that claim could go forward.  That's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate claim.  It's a good claim under Jones v. Bock. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

What can't go forward is something like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

this, because Congress had this in mind.  They had the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea that you -- that a plaintiff can gut 1415 by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, oh, I don't want IDEA violation.  I just want --

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't want IDEA relief.  I want money damages, because 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then they could file that lawsuit on day one, evade the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cooperative process that Congress has set forth, get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief from the district court, and then, by res 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

judicata --

 

14 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The cooperative 

  

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

process -- the cooperative process you're talking about, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given their position that they are not asking for any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief under the FAPE, would be kind of a charade.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get into the -- the meeting room, and they say, well, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't want anything that you can give us.  We want money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's not available. 

 

 

21 

            

MR. KATYAL:  We certainly agree that if it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

triggers that kind of futility exception, if they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

literally can't get the relief for one reason or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another, absolutely, they don't have to go through it --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Here -- here this might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

46 

also be peripheral.  I mean, this is a dog for a child 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

who is not blind so is not subject to the regulations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They have a teacher who is going around, or a person who 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is acting as a guide within the school, and this is, to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that degree, a peripheral matter in respect to the plan, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, perhaps, at least arguably, more like the librarian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the school who -- or the person who does beat up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody or treat them badly, which could be the subject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but a pretty minor part of an IEP.

9 

10 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So this is going back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

something I was trying to get to earlier about your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second half of your question.  Look, we agree that if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a circumstance in which the IEP or FAPE 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processes are not directly implicated in some way, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a different case.  That's not this one. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

16 

            

In this one, you have them seeking, invoking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

the IEP process for the very same thing they are asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal district court to do, which is a declaration 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the school erred by not --

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't understand that, 

    

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Mr. Katyal.  I mean, you yourself have an example in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your brief of abuse towards a handicapped disabled 

   

 

 

 

 

 

student that would result in money damages and maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emotional distress, but maybe also the parents took the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kid out of school and -- and is asking for the school 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

to -- the private school tuition that they had to incur, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so all kinds of things.  But it was -- it was -- it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not because of anything that the IEP said or didn't say. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was because there was discrimination on the basis of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

disability. 

6 

            

Now, it was in a school, and it could be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

remedied by school-type things, like stop discriminating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or abusing against a disabled student.  But even you in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your briefs say that doesn't have anything to do with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the IDEA.  And so why isn't this the same thing? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Because -- because, 

  

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

Justice Kagan, as that page, page 37, explains, a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower courts have said that when you have a discrete 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance of abuse, that doesn't violate the IDEA --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't -- discrete 

    

 

 

 

16 

instance.  How about if you had a continuing stream of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

abuse? 

18 

            

MR. KATYAL:  If it's a continuing stream of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

abuse, something that does implicate IDEA processes and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deny FAPE, absolutely it would require exhaustion in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

that circumstance. 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The IDEA doesn't care about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

particular instances but cares about --

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. KATYAL:  There are some things, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

Kagan, that are dealt with through the IDEA process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

Typically those are things that would occur as opposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to one-offs, yes.  And so I can imagine a one-off being 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

so significant maybe that would be different.  The Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't need to get into it here.  Here you've got a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

core situation in which they have invoked the IEP 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process to --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Katyal, are you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting that there is no such thing as continuing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination that happens in a school setting that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

actually does not have anything to do with the IEP? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  To an extent -- to the extent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that something like that exists, we're not -- our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position does not require exhaustion there.  That is in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order -- there has to be -- you know, relief has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available under the IDEA.  Here, relief is available 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the IDEA.  Indeed, they invoked exactly that

process. 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But as I understand it from 

   

  

 

 

 

 

one of Amicus briefs, just to sort of put a fine point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on this.  There are close to a million students who are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled in some way but who do not get an IEP.  So if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is discrimination or if there is a failure to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide access to one of those students you don't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to exhaust the IDEA procedure, do you? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, I'd caution the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

1 

2 

3 

4

into saying the IEP is the only thing that's necessary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But the IEP is a good template.  As this Court said in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honig, it's the kind of center piece of the IDEA.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a good template for whether or not there is an IDEA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation.  It may not always map on perfectly, but it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a pretty good proxy.  And so when you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance like this in which they have tried -- they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invoked the IDEA process for the dog.  They invoked --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not sure I understood 

   

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

the answer to the question.  In that case, you would not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send the -- the -- the child to the IDEA officer, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

you? 

13 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well -- well, Justice Kagan, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

you talked about a million different possible 

   

 

 

 

 

15 

situations --

 

16 

            

17 

the --

 

18 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  700,000, if I can read what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  Or 700,000.  So -- so some of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

those may be circumstance in which for one reason or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another the IEP just didn't govern the situation, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should.  And in those circumstances, yes, we think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion would be required.  In others which follow 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

more like the examples in our page 37, the kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrete one-off things, those are situations when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely they wouldn't require exhaustion in those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

circumstances.  Congress had something -- a simple in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

mind in 1415, which is that if you can get the relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through the IDEA, if that's what it's set up for, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the scheme Congress wanted to channel that stuff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, then go through that first.  Here, you need no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better evidence that that happened and that they invoked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those very processes here.  And if you allow their legal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory to proceed -- to disclaim FAPE, disclaim seek 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only monetary damages, then you are --

10 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, no.  The --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

the -- there will often be situations where parents will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seek relief under the IDEA and then be told early in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process or whatever -- maybe the school will tell them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we can't do that and here's why.  And the parents will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, okay, so it isn't available.  We're not going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursue that relief under the IDEA.  We're instead going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to sue under the ADA. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So certainly if it's futile, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

they say, look, we lack the authority to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, they say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

you know, we could press ahead with this.  We could sit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down with them and say, no, you got to do this and that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it's going to be easier for us just to proceed under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

the IDEA. 

 

25 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Yeah, and the choice Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

made in 1415, and going back to an earlier question, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know it seems a little bit unusual to say -- and strange 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say, why are you forcing plaintiff -- parents into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- into a scheme that they don't want, but that's the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme Congress laid out.  That's a consequence of an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion statute which is to say --

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it can't --

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

just not a scheme they don't want.  It may be a scheme 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they decide, no, the relief we seek is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available under this.  This isn't a case.  They do have 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the human who is taking care of these things, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the -- that's enough for FAPE.  But, you know, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still have this discrimination complaint. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

            

MR. KATYAL:  And, Mr. Chief Justice --

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And when you do, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

you'll agree that that's an awkward position for them to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to the meeting and say, we don't want anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. KATYAL:  It's -- it's really awkward, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what Congress said there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is it's not up to the individual parents subjectively to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, hey, I don't want any part of this process.  Rather 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Congress said is you got to go through the process, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then at the end of the process, and then at the end 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the 105 days -- this is a very short statutory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process -- then you can come into Federal court.  This

is about timing.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Katyal, my problem 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

is, what were they -- is the only argument that you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making is that they are not entitled to their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaratory judgment because they didn't exhaust that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Are they entitled, whether they exhaust it or not, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ADA claims for monetary compensatory damages for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pain and suffering? 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Sotomayor, they may be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

at the end.  They first have to exhaust -- this is all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about timing --

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it's now -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

now too late to exhaust, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  No, not at all.  The equitable 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

tolling rules of this Court --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about if they just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

waive all of that and say I want my money? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  You know, so, again, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that it can't be for the reasons that the Chief Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Justice Breyer said that just plaintiffs can kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waive things around.  Congress had an object standard in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind:  Is relief available under the IDEA --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I am -- I am so confused 

    

   

 

 

 

 

by your position.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm so horribly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confused.  What is the purpose of all of this?  Throw 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

this case out now.  Let them go back to school they are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no longer in.  They are going to say to the school, give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me money, and what else? 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Sotomayor, that is 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

their position in the reply brief.  That is not -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told me to look at the text in the complaint.  None of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that appears in the complaint.  None of that they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to a different school, won't come back.  If 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything, the complaint says the reverse.  They want the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaratory judgment that the school erred.  The only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way they can invoke that is by saying that this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation that is bound to occur.  The purpose, why are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we -- why are we standing here?  What are we worried 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

about? 

15 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The school already 

  

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

admitted that.  They let her bring the dog back in.  She 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just said I don't -- I don't feel welcomed here and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

left.  So they already got the relief they wanted.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got an admission by the school that she was entitled to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring the dog there. 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

23 

that. 

24 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Notably --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They have already said 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  Notably, Petitioners never make 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

that argument, and it's certainty not in the complaint. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

54 

And the reason for that -- what is in the complaint is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they felt that the dog wouldn't be able to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

welcomed back. 

 

4 

            

And so the idea that they could allow money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12

17

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

damages for this type of situation without first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhausting the state processes is an end-run around the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert agency statute that Congress set up, which they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to give states and localities the first crack at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolving this instead of allowing parents to abandon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the IDEA system and march into Federal court, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what happened here.  And I understand that there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is awkwardness here, but that's an awkwardness of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute Congress laid out. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not necessarily 

  

 

 

 

awkward.  You -- you forgot the words "before filing the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint."  Damages are something you get when somebody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't give you something.  But go back in time before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they make that decision.  At that point, what you want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the dog, not the money.  Now if that's the truth, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to go to the board.  Once the board makes clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they won't give you the dog, at that time you're free to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue.  You've met any exhaustion requirement because it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

futile.  They have made clear they won't. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And this suit has been brought after that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was done.  So I don't see how this suit is going to ever 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

55 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

get back for exhaustion, because the school has made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear they won't.  So say exhaustion replies to future 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suits before anything happens, but not after the board 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes clear exhaustion replies, but the futility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception also applies.  Am I right? 

   

  

 

 

6 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Breyer, we agree with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

the futility exception.  On the facts of this case, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Sixth Circuit found, it's not available.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for that -- the reason for that is they haven't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gone through the independent due process hearing.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't just say, oh, I met with some administrators, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they didn't like the dog.  You've got to go through the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated process that IDEA says.  It's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

time-sensitive one -- it's only 105 days, start to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finish -- but you've got to go through the whole thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They walked out on the process before it was over. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  105 days is a big 

   

  

 

 

 

 

18 

part of the school year. 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Correct. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, so I think 

    

   

 

 

 

21 

22 

saying, all they have to do is go through a 105-day 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process is not particularly responsive. 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MR. KATYAL:  We don't mean to minimize that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

Your Honor.  The statute says, you know, short 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

timelines.  But again, we are only talking about money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

56 

damages, so this isn't about injunction or the type of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school year that -- all they are seeking is money, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so the 105 days doesn't deal with that problem of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

school year. 

 

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Bagenstos, four minutes. 

 

 

 

7 

        

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

10 

Justice. 

11 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

So let's first be clear about what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

statute says.  Right?  The statute keys exhaustion on 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the relief that the plaintiff is seeking in the present 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

participle. 

15 

            

And what are we seeking here?  I think it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

would help to clarify a lot of what happened in the last 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half of the argument to explain what we are and are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

seeking. 

19 

            

We are seeking money damages.  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

Sotomayor, you're exactly correct.  We are seeking money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages for emotional distress.  Our allegations are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about emotional distress.  They are not about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

out-of-pocket costs or anything compensable under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

IDEA. 

25 

            

We are not seeking any of the types of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

57 

relief that defendants say are available under the IDEA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We are not seeking reimbursement of educational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expenses.  We are not seeking compensatory education or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

counseling.  We are not seeking to change an IEP, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether through a declaratory judgment or otherwise, 

   

 

 

 

 

because there is no IEP between the defendants and my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client at this point.  We do not have standing to assert 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prospective relief or to seek prospective relief against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3

defendants. 

10 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about yours is an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

ideal situation.  Conceded for the purposes you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguing.  But how about the mixed complaints, because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what has been bothering my colleagues from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

beginning.  Okay? 

  

15 

            

Let's assume that you had brought this case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

not after you had moved her, but while she was still in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

the school. 

 

18 

            

19 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you didn't say, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

you conceded now, that you don't want the -- the FAPE 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed.  The complaint says they haven't let the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

service dog in.  It's causing and has caused emotional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distress.  We want damages.  It's not clear, but you do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want the fact changed. 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Sure. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

58 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What happens? 

  

 

 

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Okay.  And I want to -- I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

4 

want to answer that question.  Let me just say one thing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the facts here. 

 

 

 

5 

            

Of course, standing is something we would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

have to assert in our complaint.  We would have to have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asserted a desire to return.  We didn't do that.  Okay. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

I understand --

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I just gave you a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

10 

different hypothetical. 

 

11 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Yes, I understand.  And --

   

  

  

 

 

12 

and I will answer the hypothetical. 

   

 

 

 

13 

            

And so I think the answer there is the Jones 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

case, right?  I mean, Jones does say that when you have 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- when you have one part of a complaint that is seeking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief that is not barred by an exhaustion requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and another part that is barred, the thing to do is let 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the good part of the complaint proceed and leave the bad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the complaint by the wayside. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

And I want to respond to what my opponents 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

said about -- about Jones and what claim means in Jones. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

In Jones itself, this Court cited, as an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

example of a court applying the right approach, a case 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

from the Seventh Circuit, Cassidy v. Indiana Department 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Corrections.  If you look at Cassidy, what Cassidy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

59 

did was it said, well, some requests for some relief are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed to proceed, and requests for other relief by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same plaintiff are not allowed to proceed.  So the right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing to do is apply the Jones partial exhaustion rule, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which this Court said is the general rule in that case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If this Court concludes that our complaint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be read to embrace -- notwithstanding everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've said -- might be read to embrace requests for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything that might be available in IDEA proceedings, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proper thing to do is allow the damages claim to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

proceed forward. 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does the Court have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

power to stay that until the IDEA claim is exhausted? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Well, so -- so I --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The government appears 

  

 

 

 

to suggest that in their brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  So I think, you know, in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

some circumstances, the Court actually addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

something similar to this in the Rhines case, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited in Jones about habeas where a total exhaustion 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

rule applies. 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

And even Rhines said that staying is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that shouldn't be done as a matter of routine; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it might be something done occasionally as a matter of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion, but that the ordinary process should be even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

60 

1 

2 

3 

where total exhaustion applies to allow the plaintiffs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide do we want to proceed with these unexhausted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requests or not, which is what we would ask for. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

After all, a stay in this case would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

meaningless.  My clients have not lived in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants' school district for a while.  My minor child 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

client has not --

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

--

10 

            

11 

            

12 

case. 

13 

            

14 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I really -- I appreciate 

    

   

 

 

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the nature of your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Got you. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  But your 

  

  

 

 

 

15 

suggestion is likely to raise --

 

 

 

 

 

16

MR. BAGENSTOS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- a lot of hesitation 

   

  

 

 

 

18 

 

in this Court, amongst some, maybe even me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  I'm getting that. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because if what you're 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

saying is we're going to be on a dual track in every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

case --

 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. BAGENSTOS:  I --

    

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- it's not going to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

very attractive to the Court.

is you're going to be on one track, which is the things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that aren't barred by the exhaustion requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed.  Everything else goes by the wayside.  That's
