CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first this morning in Case No. 15-118, Hernandez v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mesa. 

            

Mr. Hilliard. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. HILLIARD 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

15-year-old Sergio Hernandez was standing in 

 

 

 

 

 

Mexico, barely across the border, unthreatening and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unarmed, when he was shot and killed by a U.S. Border 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patrol agent standing inside the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This tragic case is one of the most simplest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritorial cases this Court will ever have in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

front of it for five reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First, all of the conduct of the domestic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police officer happened inside the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second, it was a civilian domestic police officer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Third it was a civilian plaintiff, not an enemy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

combatant.  Fourth, it was one of the most fundamental 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights, the right to life.  Fifth, the other government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved supports -- the government of Mexico supports 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the claim.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So is that -- I was trying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

to figure out from your brief what exactly your rule is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So are all five of those necessary, in your view, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there to be a Bivens claim?  Is anything else necessary? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is that exactly the rule that you want us to adopt? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Justice Kagan, the rule that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're asking this Court to adopt to avoid the anomalous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result, when a U.S. domestic officer on U.S. soil shoots 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there's no constitutional constraints, is that when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a cross-border shooting involving a Federal law 

   

   

 

 

 

 

enforcement officer on U.S. soil, and the resulting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury is in close proximity, then Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constraints on that officer should apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's a --

   

  

 

 

 

that's a test that, surprisingly, fits the exact facts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of your case. 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the principles you're arguing for can't be so narrowly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confined.  And -- for example, how -- how do you analyze 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case of a drone strike in Iraq where the plane in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

piloted from Nevada. 

 

 

            

case? 

Why wouldn't the same analysis apply in that

MR. HILLIARD:  Chief Justice, if it was a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

drone strike, I'm assuming that it was -- it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably military.  I'm assuming that there was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cooperation with other governments.  Here, in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if this were, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your case, somebody from the -- the State National Guard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or whatever, then it'd be a different result? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Well, if it was a State 

   

  

 

 

 

 

National Guard, I'm not sure that they would be shooting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across the border, Your Honor.  I mean --

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you can 

  

 

 

 

 

imagine a situation that is not precisely like the facts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of your case where military officials may be involved. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  I can imagine that scenario, 

    

 

 

 

 

but that's not the purpose or the intent of this rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The purpose of intent -- and intent of our rule is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply to involve this Court in addressing an ongoing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic routine law enforcement issue along our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

southwest border. 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your --

  

 

 

MR. HILLIARD:  So the --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your brief -- your brief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

excluded military personnel and intelligence personnel. 

 

 

 

 

 

Your -- your brief is limited to, as you said, civilian

border patrol officers.  So your drone -- your drone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, I take it from your brief, your answer is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a military operation. 

   

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  That's right, Justice --

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg.  And we -- and we also recognize --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I understand 

   

  

 

 

that, but I'm trying to see what the logic is, other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than yours happened to involve a nonmilitary actor and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

my hypothetical involves a military actor.  Under a -- a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Bivens analysis, I'm not sure that that makes a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference. 

            

Maybe there will be some defenses once you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize the cause of action that have to do with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

military operation, but I'm not sure why you wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a cause of action under your theory. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Our theory is meant to -- to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address the ongoing problem along the southwest border 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that has resulted in at least ten cross-border shootings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and six Mexican national deaths.  And every time the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution, according to the government, turns off at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the border, even though all the conduct happens in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States. 

 

              

I recognize that under the military 

 

 

 

 

situation, there are orders that may be being followed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here we have a rogue officer who actually is not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

following his own Federal regulations which says you

can't use deadly force without imminent peril. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

question. 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean --

   

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But that isn't the 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I suppose the --

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  The question -- the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

question that we -- is our problem, but we have to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your help in solving it, is you have a very sympathetic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  We write some words.  And those words you're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

delighted with because you win.  That isn't the problem. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The problem is other people will read those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, and there are all kinds of things that happen, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe military, maybe not.  Perhaps a foreign country 

   

  

 

 

 

 

with the collusion of people in our country sets off the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drone.  That's what the Chief Justice brought in. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And are we, in deciding for you, A, deciding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well that anyone who suffers a drone strike can come 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to New York and bring a law case?  Are we deciding that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the matter is unclear so that when the proper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorities get advice from their lawyers over in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Executive Branch, they have to say we're confused? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Okay? 

            

So what are the words that we write that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enable you to win, which is what you want, and that

avoid confusion, uncertainty, or decide these other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases the proper way?  That's the question you've been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given three times, and -- and I would certainly like to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

know your answer. 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Justice Breyer, this -- this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

world does not involve a drone strike, and I do not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

intend to suggest that it should.  This involves only --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We know that part.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

question is:  what words do we write so that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion doesn't affect the drone strike, which is what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you seem to want? 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Again, so the -- the rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we are suggesting has a close proximity element to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  It has all of the conduct of the United States, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the officer on the United States' soil shooting across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the border.  So --

  

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, we can take --

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Perhaps --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- your test point by point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and ask you whether it would apply in a situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where each of those factors was a little bit different. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So the -- your client was 15.  What if he was 19?  Would 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that be different? 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  No, Justice Alito, of course 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it wouldn't be different.  But the -- the --

there. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So the rule would apply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

MR. HILLIARD:  The rule would apply if he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was 19, standing unarmed in Mexico, when he was shot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  What if he was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

armed, but he had his hands up? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Again, we're not asking for a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

win here.  We're simply asking if the Constitution 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies and that he can -- he can -- the defense of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self-defense by the officer can happen at the trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court then. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if he wasn't in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

culvert, but he was 200 yards beyond in Mexico.  Would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it be different then? 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  It may be under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Boumediene element of nature of the site.  So this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culvert is unique.  If the -- if the Court -- I would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invite the Court to look at Exhibit 180 of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petition's exhibit -- appendix, which is a picture of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the culvert. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And what if the officer was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not standing in the United States, but actually ran a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

short distance across the border into Mexico?  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would seem to be worse, wouldn't it?  But would you say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the rule would be different there?

MR. HILLIARD:  Justice Alito, it may be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

because the -- first, the Border Patrol agents are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strictly prohibited from crossing the border, like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

federales are strictly prohibited from --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.  So suppose he 

  

  

 

 

 

violates that rule.  He -- he --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Well --

then he shoots the --

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- the Mexican nationals. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. HILLIARD:  Right.  It may not -- the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

rule would not apply, but it doesn't mean that under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Boumediene standards that there's not constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

protections.  Did he not know where the line was?  Did 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he intentionally go in hot pursuit?  Was he called over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by a federale?  The specifics of the facts would affect 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the decision of whether the Constitution applied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under our -- under our proposed rule, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mexico pointed out in its brief, there's been 243 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shootings along the border with the Border Patrol using 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deadly force, 10 of those across the border. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I understand that.  But 

   

  

  

 

 

as Justice Breyer said, we have to articulate a rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that applies.  We can't just say that in -- that -- that

on the particular facts here, there was -- the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Hernandez's -- the -- the Petitioner's have a --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

have a Bivens claim and -- and they're -- it states a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of the Fourth Amendment.  We have to have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule to -- that can be applied in other cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I don't know what the rule -- what rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want us to adopt other than to say you win.  And, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, that's what you -- you need to do for your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client.  But you need to give us a principle that is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workable. 

            

Is it -- is your rule that if the U.S. agent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commits on foreign soil an action that would be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation had it occurred within the United States, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a Bivens claim and there is a Fourth Amendment 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation?  Is that your rule? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Justice Alito, no.  So our --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

our rule involves all of the conduct occurring on the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the United States side. 

 

 

 

 

            

And I -- and I acknowledge a W, as Justice 

   

   

   

 

 

 

Breyer said, would be nice for our side.  But more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

importantly, the Border Patrol is 44,000 strong along 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our southwest border, and they only interact with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mexican nationals.  We've had 10 shootings across the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

border.  So that we might get the W, it will at least 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not turn off the Constitution.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hilliard, if --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, your rule 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

would be the same if this was the first time it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened, if it was one person and the other facts were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same; right? 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  My rule may be the same, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my response to the question wouldn't have as much meat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on it because we're here after many of these shootings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have occurred.  And we're here because the interaction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Border Patrol in this area, the government has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken the position that on the border, the Constitution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turns off if the deadly force goes across the border. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do -- an anterior 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question.  It has been argued that the Constitution is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only for people who are within the United States; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, an alien injured abroad has no Fourth or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fifth Amendment rights.  How do you answer that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Well, I think that the 

   

  

 

 

 

Boumediene made clear, Justice Ginsburg, that aliens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abroad have constitutional rights, depending on whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not there is a -- after the evaluation, whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functionally, the Constitution should apply.  This Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that was dealing with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

habeas.

MR. HILLIARD:  That was dealing with habeas. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

But the Boumediene court did a full survey of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirety of the extraterritory -- extraterritory cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they said there's a common thread. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Now, what this Court does is it looks at, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where are we sending this -- where are we sending the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution and what are we asking it to do?  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledge and recognize and this Court has already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said it's not a worldwide Constitution.  But it has gone 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

abroad many times, depending on what it needs to do and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what it's being asked to do. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think you said what your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

rule is in a pretty clear way.  You've said essentially 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a border area and the shot came from the United 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States.  So that, I take it, is your rule. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

So it seems to me that the harder question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is actually -- and this goes back to the Chief Justice's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question -- why is that your rule?  You know, what makes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that confluence of factors different from everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else? 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Justice Kagan, the reason 

  

 

 

 

 

that's our rule is because the interaction at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

border, at our southwest border, has -- has resulted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

often in shots being fired across the border.  It's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unique to Sergio Hernandez.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess you keep 

   

  

 

 

 

14 

saying that, Mr. Hilliard, that there's a problem here, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I respect that.  But there are problems -- there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be problems in other situations as well.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be problems when U.S. officials go into a foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nation's territory.  So -- so that leaves me still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncertain why -- I mean, you're saying as a practical 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

matter, this is where the incidents are.  But is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all you have as to why this is your rule, why the border 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases are different? 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  So using the -- the framework 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Boumediene and the factors in Boumediene, and given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this fact pattern is unique to the case we're here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about today, but not unique to the situation on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

border, yeah, the Boumediene factors are -- are used to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plug in the rule that we're asking for. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For example, the -- the Boumediene factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are nature of the site, status of the person seeking the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional protection, importance of the right.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

those factors we plugged into this rule to address not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just this specific problem, but in reliance on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Boumediene opinion, which said there's a common thread 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in all these cases.  And as the functional application, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we took the -- we took the four elements of -- of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framework of Boumediene and applied them into our rule.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but the one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

obvious difference with Boumediene is in there, you were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing with an area subject to an exclusive control of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States.  Here, you're dealing with Mexico, an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely different situation. 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, I would --

   

  

 

 

 

 

I would acknowledge that you're right.  We are in --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Boumediene is in Cuba, but it's a -- it's a -- it's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically, as Boumediene recognized, United States 

 

 

 

 

 

territory. 

            

Here, you have a U.S. law enforcement 

   

 

 

 

 

officer whose -- 100 percent of his conduct is inside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States, de jure and de sovereign United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States property.  No other government could control his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions but our government.  And while inside the United 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States under his own Constitution, which he has sworn to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abide by, he shoots. 

 

 

 

            

may --

 

You know, the hypothetical that I have 

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but just to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

stop you there.  So is it any time that the U.S. officer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is in the United States that that's -- that satisfies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question under Boumediene?  It's --

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  No, it does not. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's because the 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

injury occurs in a different jurisdiction; right? 

   

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  It's because the injury 

  

 

 

 

 

occurs in close -- close proximity.  And this is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unique area.  Again, I would invite the Court to look at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exhibit 180 of the appendix, which shows this culvert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not delineate where the United States ends and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where Mexico --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I assume 

   

  

 

 

that's true of a lot of borders. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Well -- and the reason that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's important in regards to the truth of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement is because the United States exercises some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

degree of control into the culvert.  And as Michael 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fisher said in his testimony to Congress, they project 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outwards from the border. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does the government 

  

 

 

 

 

of -- of Mexico agree with that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  The government of Mexico 

  

 

 

 

 

agree -- agrees that their sovereign is violated when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States shoots bullets into their land and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kills their citizens. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The question is 

  

 

 

 

 

whether the government of Mexico agrees with your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement that the jurisdiction of the United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extends beyond the Mexican border.

MR. HILLIARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, at -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not that the jurisdiction extends beyond the border. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's that the control projects from our physical border 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

as Michael Fisher, the head of Border Patrol said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outward.  It's not the first or last line of defense. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The -- the government of Mexico has not addressed his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement, but as a fact, along the entirety of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

southwest border, the Border Patrol stays on the border 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and projects authority outward. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  May I ask about an anomaly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

created by your rule?  I take it everybody agrees that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if there were a Texas State trooper who was involved in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the exact same conduct, that trooper, you -- you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be able to sue that trooper. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So why is it that Bivens, which is usually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought of as a more limited remedy than 1983, I mean, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

why should you have this situation where you can sue the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal agent, but not the State agent? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Justice Kagan, in all 

  

 

 

 

 

respects, except where the victim lie, this is a typical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens case.  You have a U.S. law enforcement officer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

exercising unreasonable force, and Sergio Hernandez is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the group of victims that are injured as a result of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excessive force. 

 

            

The issue is, is where he fell and where he

shot, does it take it out of his right to a Bivens? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, my -- I -- I -- I've 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

18 

waited while the rule was being discussed because that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important; but as Justice Kagan's question indicates, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not there can and should be a Bivens action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is critical to your case. 

 

 

 

 

            

Since 1988, this Court has not recognized a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single Bivens action.  We look for special 

  

 

 

 

 

 

considerations.  You've indicated that there's a problem 

   

  

 

 

 

all along the border.  Why doesn't that counsel us that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is one of the most sensitive areas of foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affairs where the political branches should discuss with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mexico what the solution ought to be?  It seems to me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this is an extraordinary case for us to say there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Bivens action in light of what we've done since 1988 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where we haven't created a single one. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Justice Kennedy, there is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

alternative remedy for the family.  There has been 283 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shootings, and when those shootings with the border --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that -- that means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's a critical area of foreign affairs. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  We're not attacking the 

  

 

 

 

 

policy of the United States government in regards to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mexico.  In fact, the policy of the United States is a

imminent peril.  We're asking that when this --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the policy of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

United States, I suppose we can ask them if they're not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to give any compensation from a special bill for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress or it might be picked up by an executor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement, the policy of the United States is that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury, a serious injury, goes unaddressed.  And if we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

assume that the officer was completely at fault and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's really no defense, we -- we don't know what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts are, but if we assume the facts most favorably --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorably to you, there should be some relief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But isn't this an urgent matter of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separation of powers for us to respect the duty that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the -- the principle rule that the executive and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the legislative have with respect -- respect to foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affairs? 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Justice Kennedy, I would say 

   

  

 

 

 

it is an urgent matter of separation of powers, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be the opposite. 

 

 

 

            

The -- the fact pattern, if the Court may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recall, is Officer Mason had actually grabbed one of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sergio's friends and had him by the scruff of the collar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

next to him in the United States.  Had he shot that boy, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there would be a Bivens claim. 

   

 

 

 

            

If a Mexican national is shot just inside

the United States, and the only thing the government can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say is it implicates one policy in national security, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that situation, then you've taken away Bivens claims for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the largest police force in this country in the area 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they operate.  The -- the location of the boy in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regards to being shot from the United States should not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel hesitation.  If --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, Mr. Hilliard, you want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

me to put down in my notes the location of the boy is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrelevant to this case.  That's what -- that's what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're going to put in our opinion? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  You start with -- you start 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in your opinion that the -- that if all of the conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens inside the United States and -- and there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close proximity cross-border shooting, then the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment -- Fourth Amendment constraints on deadly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force apply. 

 

            

To -- to hold otherwise, Justice Kennedy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is to prevent Bivens in the area of the border, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's south or north of the line, because if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- if national security and foreign relations is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected 30 feet across the line and the -- and an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer stands in the same place and shoots Sergio's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend right next to him, then you have one kind -- one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens case and one non-Bivens case.

JUSTICE BREYER:  When I write the reason for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

21 

that, I write the opinion just as you said it, and it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, but if it's only 30 feet away, the victim, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Bivens action in the Fourth Amendment apply.  But if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's 30 miles away or 300 miles, they don't.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what you want me to write. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, the next sentence has to have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why I drew that distinction, and that's what I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think people have been looking for.  And so just please, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if -- if there's anything else you have to say, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't have anything else to say, but if you do, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would say this is a good time to say it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  My point is the -- the close 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximity takes it away from your analogy, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer. 

            

            

My -- my point is that if all the conduct --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That isn't a reason you 

   

  

 

 

 

normally can give in the opinion.  I -- I had a few 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

problems with applying it across the board.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe I could, but is that what I'm supposed to say? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because it took away from the problems that Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer had. 

 

            

No, of course, you can't say that.  So --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so -- so what -- what is it I can say? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  If I understand your 

   

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

question -- question, Justice Breyer, the reason that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

Bivens should be allowed if all of the conduct happens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the United States, is -- is because the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anomalous --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, all the conduct 

  

 

 

 

 

happens in the United States with the drones. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Right.  But it would be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

anomalous to say -- anomalous to say that if the Border 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patrol agent shoots north, west, and east --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Same with the drones. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. HILLIARD:  There's a Bivens claim --

   

  

 

 

 

if -- it's -- if -- with all due respect, it's not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same with the drones because there is no proximity and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no cross-border shooting.  There's a drone that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

goes somewhere else to do something else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  What about a 

  

  

 

 

 

different approach.  And I just want your reaction 

   

  

 

 

 

 

because you suggested at the end of your brief, if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have anything to add, do it.  And yes, all the action 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took place in the United States, but it took place at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the border.  Not beyond the border.  At the border. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The border is the river.  We have a treaty 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that says the river.  We also have a treaty that says 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there will be a line down the middle of the culvert, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the culvert will be maintained by Mexico and the United

States jointly.  And there are many documents, including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Treaty of Hidalgo -- you know, that famous treaty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which I'm drawing a blank on, but --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Hidalgo? 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Hidalgo, yes.  Right.  It's 

  

  

  

 

 

referring to the river as the border. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So it has not taken place in a foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

country.  It's taking place on territory that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictionally, of course, is Mexico's, but which is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special kind of -- you -- you started talking about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curtilage.  Is there any other word?  "Curtilage" 

  

  

 

 

 

 

suggests a house.  Then you started talking about cannon 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

shots going off somewhere.  So you did research into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this. 

            

Now, if I want to say, this is a special 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

kind of physical place, what words do I use? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  I -- I think, Justice Breyer, 

    

   

 

 

 

I -- and I -- if I get -- get your question in, in the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

middle of the river, according to the Treaty of Hidalgo 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the -- the -- the deepest trench of the middle of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

river.  And there's no river here anymore.  It's simply 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a flat culvert, which is part of the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We are responsible for 

  

 

 

 

 

maintaining it, not by ourselves, but with Mexico and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reason we are maintaining it is because at one time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the whole river and now the line down the center are the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

boundary, and we don't want the river to jump its banks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and create new boundaries.  So this is a boundary case. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now -- now, you obviously explored that and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then I think you gave up on it.  And so I would like you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to tell me what you want me to hear about it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  So the curtilage cases were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

used in order to show that there is a -- a substantive 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness evaluation in -- in regards to the close 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximity requirement of our rule. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you -- are you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

relying at all -- I -- I'm not sure you did in your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief -- but there in -- in tort law, generally, when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's an act outside that causes injury inside, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating rule can come from the place where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct occurred.  So that that act outside, injury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

inside, is a familiar category in tort law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

As I understand it, the -- the regulating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

rule can come from either place, the place where the act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurs or the place where it's effect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  That's right, 

  

 

 

Justice Ginsburg.  And as a practical matter, as the --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Mexican juris brief points out, there is no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical way for the courts of Mexico to review this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct.

So I appreciate, if I can get back to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

25 

Justice Breyer's concern and inquiry, and that is, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of the conduct happens in the United States and as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact there is some exercise of control right at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

border, then if the injury occurs in close proximity to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that border, then that's a rule that would both be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workable and would take care not only of the issue with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sergio Hernandez, but would also take care of the issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the entirety of the southwest border of the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States where the conduct continues to occur even today. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you to go back 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to Justice Kagan's question?  If the -- if the officer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here was a State or a local officer, would you be able 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to file a claim for damages in the United States in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court? 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  The issue in that regard is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if -- what does "jurisdiction" mean under 1983?  And if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction -- if you're not a citizen and you're not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the jurisdiction, are you precluded under 1983? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the point I was trying to make for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer is there is some issue of control in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culvert, and it's -- it's never been decided what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction is in regards to --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Oh, well, put that aside. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Let's assume this is in Mexico.  Plainly in Mexico.

MR. HILLIARD:  You would not have a claim 

   

  

 

 

 

 

over the State officer, but if you don't -- but a Bivens 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim -- a constitutional Bivens claim could apply to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State officer.  The issue --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Why not?  If 

  

  

  

 

 

 

it's a State officer who lives in -- I guess this is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas, right?  Why couldn't the family sue that State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer under the theory that Justice Ginsburg raised, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is if all the acts happened in the United States, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but were projected injuries into another State, most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States -- I think including Texas, but I could be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

wrong -- we have counsel for -- for Officer Mesa to tell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us -- the family could sue the State officer in Texas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He did the acts in Texas.  He lives in Texas. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. HILLIARD:  That's right.

MR. HILLIARD:  Justice Ginsburg -- I mean,

MR. HILLIARD:  I apologize. 

    

 

27 

Justice Sotomayor, I agree with you, but the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

issue under 1983 is -- is citizenship and jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of where it occurred.  If I take Justice Alito's

exclusion to -- based on jurisdiction.  If he came into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States or was within the -- the control area, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that might be jurisdiction, then there would be a 1983 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How often do State 

  

 

 

 

 

officers act under cover of State law and outside --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with an impact outside the United States? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Justice Ginsburg, I've never 

  

 

 

 

 

heard of that.  Generally, the interaction at the border 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the Border Patrol with Mexican nationals on the south 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- south and north side of our border.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally the Border Patrol. 

 

 

 

            

If there are no other questions, I'd like to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserve the rest of my time.

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The Fourth Amendment does not apply in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross-border shooting of a Mexican civilian on Mexico 

   

 

 

 

 

 

soil by a United States Federal agent. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The Petitioners' claim for Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

protection was answered in Verdugo.  I don't think this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court gets to the question of the functionality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attest --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In Verdugo, the U.S. 

  

 

 

 

 

officers were acting in collaboration with -- with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approval and cooperation of Mexican officers.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

quite a different case, isn't it? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  It is.  However, in Verdugo, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the person claiming protection was in the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The act occurred in Mexico. 

 

 

 

 

            

Here we have Mr. Hernandez who was seized in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mexico.  He was never in the United States.  The border 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is very real and very finite.  It's not elastic. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought in Verdugo 

   

  

 

 

 

the -- the question was a search that occurred wholly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inside Mexico with the cooperation of the Mexican 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorities. 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  And this Court denied to extend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that protection.  I believe those facts provide or 

    

 

 

 

 

 

provided even a greater rationale for this Court to

extend those protections, given the fact that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

United States planned the acts in the United States with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Verdugo in the United States and the search 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurring in Mexico. 

 

 

            

Here, the seizure occurs in Mexico. 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Hernandez is in Mexico.  He is outside the sovereign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territory of the United States.  There is no de facto 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction of the culvert in this area.  It's -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very -- it's dissimilar from Boumediene. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If Boumediene had control, 

  

 

 

 

 

who controlled the base?  And here we know that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culvert, at least as far as paving it, keeping it up, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spending many millions of dollars, seeing that trade, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it ever is filled with water, goes across and ships are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

free, et cetera, is a joint effort of Mexico and the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States.  So this is not just like a fence.  It is 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an area of two fences, and between those two areas is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint exercise of border maintenance authority. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I guess it's like nothing I've seen 

   

 

 

 

 

 

before.  But if it's like nothing I've seen before, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's the problem with taking Justice Ginsburg's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach and applying it to that kind of area where, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might add, 500,000 people walk across it every day and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a fair inference that -- perhaps that American 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens, adolescents, play in the culvert, too. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. ORTEGA:  Your Honor, the culvert, if I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

may, is not an area where anybody plays.  I have been 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there.  It's not an area --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We'd have to take as a fact 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

here that the children were playing.  A jury could find 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the contrary, but we have to take that as a fact. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  The border in that area is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

still finite, Your Honor.  A -- a Border Patrol agent 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

cannot step into the sovereign Republic of Mexico.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he were to do that, he would be subjected to a five-year 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimum mandatory penalty for stepping into Mexico with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his weapon. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He was riding a bike in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the culvert there, correct?  The wall is on one side, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's on the Mexico side of the wall in the culvert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

riding his bicycle.  That's American territory? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ORTEGA:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so the dividing line 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is just the overpass pillar? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ORTEGA:  The dividing line --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was the boy at that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pillar?  The boy was at the pillar or behind it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  The boy was at the pillar on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Mexican side --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On the Mexican side.

MR. ORTEGA:  -- in Mexican territory. 

  

 

 

 

 

Yes, your Honor. 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The dividing line isn't even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

marked on the ground; isn't that right?  You can't tell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

on the ground where Mexico ends and the United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

begins. 

              

I think the point that Justice Breyer is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making is this does seem like a very -- you know, it's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sui generous kind of case.  It's this liminal area.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't want to -- I don't know whether to call it a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no-man's land, but it's this liminal area, which is kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of neither one thing nor another thing.  So maybe it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that both countries maintain it, maybe it's that -- it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of neither country.  Whatever it is, it's something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very different from most areas where we know exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whose jurisdiction operates and how. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  It is very different, but it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the center of the culvert that's the dividing line. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We know from Boumediene 

  

 

 

 

 

that the word "sovereign," and even the legal concept of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign, which in Boumediene belonged to Cuba, is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily the line that distinguishes where the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment does or does not apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  But what was distinguishing in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that case, Your Honor, is that we exercise control over

Guantanamo --

 

32 

            

Correct. 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Yes.  Correct. 

  

  

  

 

MR. ORTEGA:  -- at least --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Absolutely right.  And 

  

  

 

 

here, the control is significantly diminished compared 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the base at Guantanamo.  Absolutely correct.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the point is -- there are other factors which we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heard for half an hour at least, you know, here that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no, suggests maybe the Fourth Amendment should apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  But the United States does not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise any de facto jurisdiction beyond the middle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We do two things.  We do at 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

least have a commission that draws the boundary and with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mexico also repairs the culvert.  And that's expensive. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So we do two things with Mexico there.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fences are on either side of the culvert.  And it is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a border.  And all -- and those things, taken together, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either are or are not enough to apply the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment.  That's why I say add Justice Ginsburg's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

point and add the fact that Mexico would like the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment applied. 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  They would like it applied in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, but they have never ceded any of their

jurisdiction beyond the middle of the culvert. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I understand that the maintenance of the 

 

 

 

 

 

culvert is a joint maintenance; however, the laws of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States do not apply beyond the middle of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culvert. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the law of the United 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

States, the law is directed to an actor.  The actor is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Border Patrol member.  And the instruction from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States is very clear:  Do not shoot to kill an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unarmed, nondangerous person who is no threat to your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

safety.  Do not shoot to kill.  That's U.S. law.  And 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's U.S. law that governs the conduct of the Border 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patrol police. 

 

            

So I don't understand all this about Mexico. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

It's the United States law operating on the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States official who's acting inside the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This case has, as far as the conduct is concerned, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States written all over it.  There's nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about Mexico.  The Border Patrol guard doesn't take his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orders from Mexico. 

 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  And then I think it would be up 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the United States to prosecute Mr. Mesa criminally if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were to choose -- choose to do so, which would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide a remedy to the Petitioners via a restitution --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They wouldn't get any 

  

 

 

 

 

damages for the death of their 15-year-old son for their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emotional suffering. 

 

            

But I think I have, following up on what 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg is saying, a more fundamental question, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

which is I don't think you or the U.S. government is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting that anyone is condoning people standing at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the border and taking potshots at passing Mexicans. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ORTEGA:  Absolutely not. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  And, yes, 

  

  

 

 

 

there's a remedy -- criminal remedy for the government 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to vindicate its position, but why should there be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be a civil remedy to ensure that border police are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complying with the Constitution?  The entire -- either 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Fourth or Fifth Amendment?  Wouldn't shooting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

potshots at Mexican citizens be shocking to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conscience? 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  It is shocking.  But -- but 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

where would the line apply?  The ad hoc totality of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance test as presented by the Petitioners, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it be as far as the bullet can travel?  Would it --

-- and that's why we use their analogy.  It would apply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

when the action that violates the amendment takes place 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the United States and where the victim is at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

border.  And "at the border" is defined as including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those areas that are jointly administered as part of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

border set forth in the treaty, where administration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means spending significant amounts of money on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upkeep of those border positions; where, if you want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some additional limitation, where both American children 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Mexican children might play. 

 

 

 

 

            

And why do we do that?  Because without such 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a rule, the people of the United States who might play 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, too, are not secure in -- from unreasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seizures such as this one. 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, I made that up. 

   

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But he has quite persuasive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

analogies in the law with curtilages, cannon shots, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joint administration, and the purposes of the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment, which is to protect the people, we can say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe American and maybe beyond, from unreasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

searches.  Okay?  There is a set of arguments. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

Limitation, absolute limitation.  No worry about drones. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Flows directly from Boumediene and carries out the

Now, that's a whole long argument.  What do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

36 

you want to say? 

 

 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  Well, Your Honor, I believe 

   

  

 

 

 

that if -- even if the approach, if taken as framed by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor were to be applied, it would still plunge the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower courts into a sea of uncertainty as to where that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line actually ends.  I understand that your question is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused on the United States' care and upkeep of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area and that it would end in that area.  But I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ramifications and the tentacles of such an ad hoc 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Ortega, you say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"ad hoc," but --

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kennedy. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Justice Ginsburg outlined 

  

 

 

 

all of the U.S. factors here.  Was the U.S. officer in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States subject to U.S. regulation?  If we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were to pull the officer here under Bivens, what would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be the practical obstacles that would prevent orderly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administration of that rule?  It's a U.S. officer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

subject to U.S. supervision.  That's it. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  The largest, or the most 

  

 

 

 

 

 

profound practical obstacle, I -- I believe, would be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

the application of the rule itself and not applying --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not giving lower courts a clear certainty, a clear

defined rule on which to apply --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Ortega, the rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is very defined.  If the shot comes from U.S. territory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it hits somebody in the culvert, then there's a --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a -- there's an action.  That's a very defined 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

rule.  There's nothing unclear about that.  You can 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

argue is that a good rule?  Is that a bad rule?  Is 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

there a good reason behind that rule?  But it's a very 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

clear rule. 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  But in areas of the United 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

States that -- where there is a clearly defined border, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as we have here, the Fourth Amendment stops unless the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person seized -- in this case Hernandez -- had some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntary contact with the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could I ask you 

   

  

 

 

 

briefly, because we haven't talked about it yet, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question on the qualified immunity point. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It seems very odd to me that qualified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity would turn on a jurisdictional issue.  Most of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

our cases, you're interested in the conduct of the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the officer and whether that conduct was reasonable and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lacked a precedence, not an issue about whether or not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he can be sued by the particular plaintiff.  Are you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aware of any of our cases where qualified immunity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turned on -- in a -- a legal jurisdictional issue?

38 

            

In other words, it's odd to say the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer's conduct is reasonable so long as it turns out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the victim, you know, is -- is Mexican, but it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable if the exact same conduct and it turns out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the victim is American.  I'm not aware of any qualified 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity case like that. 

 

 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  I don't know of any case that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

fits that fact pattern, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you recognize 

  

 

 

 

that -- let's say it was the -- the boy that the Border 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patrol grabbed and then shot him, so the -- the -- so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the death would have occurred in the United States, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens claim? 

 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  Well, absolutely.  Then he 

  

  

 

 

 

would be in the territory of the United States, and all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional protections would apply. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So does it make a whole 

   

  

 

 

 

 

lot of sense to say if the officer shoots somebody on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the U.S. side of the border, good Bivens claim?  If the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer standing in the same place shoots somebody who's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just across the border, no claim?  That doesn't make a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole lot of sense, does it, to distinguish those two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victims? 

            

MR. ORTEGA:  I think it's very 

    

 

 

 

distinguishable because of the very real border.  Wars 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

have been fought to establish borders.  The border is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very real. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Kneedler. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

 

 

 

 

 

          

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The antecedent question in this case is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether this Court should create a cause of action for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages under Bivens.  As Justice Kennedy pointed out, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for many years, this Court has declined to extend Bivens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to new contexts because -- out of recognition that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creation of causes of action is for Congress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You're quite right, 

  

 

 

 

Mr. Kneedler, but there is a difference between this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case and I think -- I think all -- maybe all but one --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these other cases, which is in all of these others, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court has been able to point to some alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy.  It might not have been the complete relief that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a plaintiff in a case wanted, but it was something.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was an ability to say, Congress has given you some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way to address the harm that you've suffered. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And here, there really is nothing.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

there's the idea that you might prosecute this person

criminally, but what does the family get from that?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

anyway, you almost never do. 

 

 

 

 

            

So -- so here, there's just no remedy.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't that really quite different from all these other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens cases that you referred to? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  First of all, the Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

made clear in Stanley and Wilkie that the presence or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absence of a remedy is not the only factor, that there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the additional --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, we said that, but, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, Stanley might be the only case on your side.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Stanley is a military case where there is like the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimate special factor.  So for the most part, every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time we've said no Bivens, we've said because there's an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative remedy.  And here we can't say that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, when you say Stanley 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and Chappell v. Wallace, ultimate special factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of the political branches' control over the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

military.  That is directly applicable here.  Here, you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have a -- a cross-border incident which necessarily 

   

   

 

 

 

gives rise to foreign relations problems, which are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed to the political branches. 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the -- and when Congress has chosen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to address remedies as a statutory matter under the --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Federal Tort Claims Act, it has created an

exception for -- for injuries occurring in foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

countries. 

            

And in response to Justice Ginsburg's 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

question, as a matter of Federal law, under the FTCA, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under this Court's Sosa decision, if the injury occurs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside the United States, it is excluded from liability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even if the conduct occurred in -- in the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's the U.S. -- U.S. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

liability, not the officer liability. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, but I -- but I think if 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

the Court is considering whether to fashion a judicially 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

created remedy, looking to what Congress has done where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it has acted -- and 1983 is another very prime 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example -- and where Congress has chosen to create 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monetary compensation for persons injured abroad by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States, it has always done it in an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why -- why -- why do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you use words like "create," "extend," et cetera, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"fashion," if, in fact, a Federal policeman, a Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

agent violates the Fourth Amendment and seizes someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonably in Alaska, does the victim have a Bivens 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy? 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, but --

it in Puerto Rico, does the victim have a Bivens remedy? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll tell you by making this up, but there never has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a Bivens action in Puerto Rico.  It's the first 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

one. 

            

            

            

            

            

Does he have a Bivens action? 

   

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, but there's --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Okay. 

  

  

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  But there's something --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, let's see where I've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

gotten -- I'm trying to go somewhere with the question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  But -- but there's something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

fundamentally different about creating a Bivens remedy 

   

 

 

 

 

for --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why creating?  I 

  

  

 

 

 

would have thought if you want to say in there --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Or extend --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait.  Extending.  You see, 

  

  

  

 

 

there those words assume the answer to the question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I can absolutely see you're saying that if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court fashions a civil remedy for a violation of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the Third Amendment or the Second Amendment, you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be extending Bivens, but I thought Bivens made 

   

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely clear that where a Federal agent hurts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

someone by violating the Fourth Amendment, there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens action.  Now we have an exception.  And the

exception is the military. 

 

 

 

43 

            

So I think you can look at this either way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I think the -- the more -- I would tend to look at 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it as saying, of course there is a Bivens remedy if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a Fourth Amendment violation unless you're in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the military, which no one says this is true. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So that's how I've been thinking about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens action.  I've been thinking the answer to that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question turns on the answer to the Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

Now you can tell me why it's better to use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the words you've been using. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  The -- the Court -- just 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the Court has recognized a Bivens action for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of a particular constitutional provision in 

   

 

 

 

 

one context or with respect to one set of defendants, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't mean that it should extend it.  And that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word the Court has used. 

 

 

 

 

            

Rico? 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, yes.  In, like, Puerto 

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, no, in the -- under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth Amendment, under -- in Carlson v. Green, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court recognized a Bivens remedy against Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

employees that --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's Eighth versus 

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Fourth. 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  I --

    

 

44 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm saying that's Fourth in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto Rico. 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  No, I'm -- I'm -- what -- my 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point about the Eighth Amendment is that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declined to recognize a Bivens remedy for Eighth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment violations --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kneedler, you --

  

 

 

 

 

Mr Kneedler:  -- for private confirmations. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- you get the point.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

point of it is that it's the heartland of Bivens for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law enforcement officer to use deadly force in violation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Fourth Amendment.  That's the heartland of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens.  We don't have to make up anything new.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have to extend it.  We don't have to create 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything.  That's just Bivens. 

  

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  It is the heartland of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens' special factors analysis for the Court to create 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a damage remedy in a situation fraught with foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

relations issues.  And this ties directly into your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point about --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, could you say -- let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk about that.  How is this fraught with foreign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relations issues?  Because Mexico would surely prefer

that -- that its citizen have a Bivens remedy. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

            

So you seem to be using foreign relations as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if sort of this touches some other country.  But in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usual case, I think we've asked what's the interference? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

What's the disruption?  So tell me what the interference 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or the disruption is. 

 

 

 

            

            

create --

 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Any -- any --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The problem we would 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Any time --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- not just the fact that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has something to do with another country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Any time -- any time the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers of one country injure someone in another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country, that creates the potential for a foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

relations incident and it's illustrated here by a number 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of factors. 

 

            

Mexico requested the extradition of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mesa in this case, and the United States refused because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it had done its own investigation of this incident and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded that the -- that prosecution should not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sure Mexico cared a lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

about this.  The question I'm asking is how does the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence of the Bivens remedy disrupt or interfere with

the United States' ability to carry out its foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy? 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  And another illustration, and 

  

 

 

 

 

I think -- I think it's tied to that is one of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons is that -- why there is not a remedy in Mexico 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is because Mexico would recognize the official immunity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Officer Mesa in this circumstance according to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amicus briefs.  I have no reason to disagree with that. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is a recognition by Mexico itself that the conduct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a -- of a U.S. officer in these circumstances 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

involves foreign sovereign problems. 

 

 

 

            

And the -- another -- another issue here is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the plaintiff here is -- plaintiffs here are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking to insert the courts into the resolution of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute about which the United States and Mexico have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- a different view of the facts.  And -- and --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But suppose -- suppose 

  

 

 

 

 

the -- the victim, the same -- the same location across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the border, but were a U.S. citizen, as Justice Breyer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned, many -- and many transients will go -- go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across from Juarez to El Paso.  Suppose it had been a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S. citizen that was the victim of the shooting? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  We -- we think there would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be a Bivens remedy there either because of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritorial applications.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And then if it were, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

it were the young man who was grabbed by the Border 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patrol guard and shot on the U.S. side, Bivens? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, there would be.  But --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

but in -- in terms of the questions about line drawing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that were raised before, the two nations have drawn a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line here, and this is a circumstance where this -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct here is clearly extraterritorial.  The fact that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there may be joint maintenance of the culvert is a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor factor considering that the only law that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governs --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If it -- but that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point.  If, in fact, all that mattered were the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existence of a well-recognized boundary line, this case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is over.  You win. 

  

 

 

            

But that well-recognized boundary line was 

 

 

 

 

 

present in Boumediene, and certainly Boumediene 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests, while it is a factor, it is not the only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor that determines the reach of the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment.  So there -- there we are.  We're in court, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it is not the only factor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And now you add in all the stuff about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culvert and who's playing there and who might be playing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, and the 500,000 people who cross every day, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the joint maintenance of the culvert, and the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

all this conduct happened in the United States, that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

what your opponent brother over there is trying to do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Boumediene had to do with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the substantive application of the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment, which I want to get to in just a minute. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But the antecedent question is whether this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court should answer those questions in a private damage 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy when it hasn't recognized a new context for one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 35 years. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what would the 

  

 

 

 

 

government --

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  If they're thinking --

  

 

 

 

 

think --

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What would the government of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mexico say if we wrote an opinion that says because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States spent a lot of money to pave this culvert, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we think that the United States' authority with respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the culvert is basically the same as the authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we have in Guantanamo. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  I think the Mexican 

    

 

 

 

government would be very offended by it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sure it wouldn't have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be written that way. 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.)

no, but this -- this -- this case is -- this case is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

fundamentally different than Boumediene. 

 

 

 

            

In Boumediene, the Court said that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States is not answerable to anyone else.  Here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States is answerable to Mexico.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Boumediene, the Court said only --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How?  How? 

  

  

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Pardon? 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You did say in your brief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States is answerable to Mexico for any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross-border use of force.  How is the United States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answerable to Mexico? 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Mexico -- Mexico holds us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

accountable for doing something about it.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

investigated criminally and -- and concluded that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal prosecution should not be brought, but Mexico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regards it as the United States' responsibility to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control this conduct. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The responsibility to 

  

 

 

 

Mexico is prosecution in the United States?  That's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  To -- to control -- to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

control the conduct, yes. 

 

 

 

            

And -- and let me just reemphasize here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where Congress has -- has decided the damage remedies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are important, it has never provided for judicial

remedies.  It has provided for administrative remedies 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and it has not done it in this context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you wanted to talk 

  

 

 

 

 

 

50 

about the Fourth Amendment? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  This Court's decision 

  

  

 

 

 

in Verdugo, as we read in this, established a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical rule that the Fourth Amendment does not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply to some mass of persons outside the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nothing in Boumediene changes that. 

 

 

 

 

            

Boumediene, looking at the insular cases and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatnot, was talking about territory over which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States exercised jurisdiction, independent of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incident that was at issue there. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

Here the United States --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can we --

  

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Does not --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- go back to my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical.  Border policemen are shooting 

  

 

 

 

indiscriminately from within the United States across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the border.  This is the allegation in this complaint. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I understand you say the government has investigated 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and sees the facts differently. 

 

 

 

 

            

Have you seen the -- the film that appeared

square the police officer's account of this incident 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that film.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm just curious. 

  

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  -- there was other evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and other video -- surveillance videos that were taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into account in the investigation.  If I could --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

question. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me ask one other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Are -- are there examples in the past ten 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years of the Congress of the United States passing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special laws for -- to compensate victims for instances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat like this where the United States has either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accidentally or deliberately transgressed on the rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of foreign persons? 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't know if the -- if 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

there have been private bills, but that would be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solution.  This is -- this is something that should be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up to Congress.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, I guess you 

   

  

 

 

 

52 

could say that with reference to Bivens acts generally, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even in the United States. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, and this -- this Court, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in deciding whether to apply Bivens, has -- has looked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the question of whether Congress is the right body to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide rather than the courts. 

 

 

 

 

            

And here we think it clearly is because of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the foreign relations implications, not to mention the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deeply-rooted presumption against extraterritoriality, 

 

 

 

all the more so in -- in with respect to this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creation --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  As far --

  

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  -- of a cause of action. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  As foreign relations are 

  

 

 

 

 

concerned, at least a Justice of this Court has said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the behavior of our law enforcement agents abroad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sends a powerful message about the rule of law to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals everywhere.  And you're asking us to make a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction that if the law enforcement agent shoots and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kills somebody who's on one side of the border, there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens liability, you tell me that.  If it's just on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side, although the conduct is identical, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer is standing in exactly the same place.  I don't

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, Bivens has to do with a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular remedy and -- and who should create that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy.  The rule of law can be enforced and

the Border Patrol --

instructions on the use of deadly force, it has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted -- and this -- this does go to the rule of law.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- if the Border Patrol 

  

 

 

 

 

 

agent stood where he stood and took the shot he did, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only difference was that the teenager in the culvert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was an American citizen, is there a Bivens action? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  We think there would not be, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but that -- that's obviously a different question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

than -- than whether an alien should have a cause of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action given 1983, and Congress's action in this area,

And, Mr. Hilliard, you have a minute left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. HILLIARD 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. HILLIARD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

To Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, both of 

 

 

 

 

 

my friends on the other side have now said there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens claim for the boy who shot next to the officer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Take that position into this hypothetical. 

 

 

 

 

 

The officer shoots the bullet -- shoots the gun.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bullet leaves the gun.  It's constitutionally -- there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional consequences as the bullet travels all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way to the border. 

 

 

 

 

            

If there's a boy between the bullet -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, the gun and Sergio, and that bullet goes through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that boy in the -- in the U.S., and then the same bullet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hits Sergio, their position is that there's a Bivens 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim and there's a constitutional constraint as to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

first boy who dies, but not the second boy that dies. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the -- the conduct occurring in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States, a hundred percent of it, if it gives a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens claim, if it gives a normal, standard Bivens 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim to the boy who shot somewhere with the -- with the

bullet and then does not give one to Sergio Hernandez 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- ends up being anomalous. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As to Justice Kennedy's question on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment, Boumediene decided that it is a -- it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a functional test.  It's a question of judgment, not 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

compulsion, as Justice Harlan said in Reid, and as -- as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Boumediene suggested. 

 

            

Verdugo has nothing to do with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application of the seizure by shooting someone dead to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the search inside the property.  I think Boumediene --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Boumediene confirms that the fact pattern of someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being killed is enough in a practical way to provide 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited constraints. 

 

            

            

            

            

Thank you very much. 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the
