CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in Number 01-46, the Federal Maritime


Commission v. the South Carolina State Ports Authority.


Mr. Hughey.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP C. HUGHEY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION


MR. HUGHEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The adjudication of a Shipping Act complaint by


the Federal Maritime Commission is an administrative


regulatory process through which the agency makes findings


of fact and applies its interpretation of the Shipping Act


to those findings of fact.  This is an exercise of


executive power.


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't that adjudication, if


it applies the law to findings of fact?


MR. HUGHEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, it is


adjudication, but what we're suggesting is that it's not


judicial.  It is an executive branch adjudication that


permits the agency to determine what position it would


like to take with respect to potential violations of the


Shipping Act.


QUESTION:  But doesn't it involve a decision as

to whether this particular respondent before the


commission has violated some provision of the act?


MR. HUGHEY:  Yes, and in that sense, Your Honor,


it is an exercise of ad hoc regulation.  It's regulation


on a specific and discrete set of facts.


QUESTION:  Well, you could say the same thing


about a court, that it's not making an -- making an ad hoc


regulation on these particular facts.


MR. HUGHEY:  However, Your Honor, in the case of


a court and a decision issued by a court, such an order


would be self-executing, whereas a Federal Maritime


Commission regulatory determination is not self-executing. 


Rather, in the event that it's not voluntary compliance


with whatever order the agency reaches at the end of an


adjudication, the Attorney General or a private


complainant must go into a Federal district court and seek


to have that Federal district court compel compliance.


QUESTION:  Suppose Congress --


QUESTION:  Well, presumably a State would


feel -- would hesitate not to appear because it might


ultimately be enforced against the State by the Attorney


General, isn't that right?


MR. HUGHEY:  Yes, I think that is correct,


Justice O'Connor, that a State might --


QUESTION:  Well, if the State is compelled to

participate, does that alter our analysis of it?


MR. HUGHEY:  No, I don't think so, because the


extent to which the State feels compelled by a potential


action by the Attorney General of the United States is


compulsion that arises from an action of the Federal


Government itself in the name of the United States.


QUESTION:  What if a -- is a private plaintiff


entitled to take a decision, or order, whatever you want


to call it, of the commission, and seek to have it


enforced by a court?


MR. HUGHEY:  Yes, Your Honor, under the Shipping


Act a private plaintiff is permitted to go into a Federal


district court --


QUESTION:  And would the Eleventh Amendment


defense raised by the State there prevail?


MR. HUGHEY:  I think that that case would


present a much more significant Eleventh Amendment issue. 


The Shipping Act provides that the district court hearing


and, of course, an action brought by a private complainant


must have jurisdiction of the parties.  I would suggest


that to the extent there's any Eleventh Amendment interest


that requires vindication under the Shipping Act, that


vindication can be explored in the Federal district court


proceeding.


QUESTION:  Do you concede that at least as to

reparation, where as I understand it the Government can go


into the district court to seek reparations, only the


private party, at least as to seeking dollars from the


State agency, that the Eleventh Amendment would preclude


that?


MR. HUGHEY:  Well, in its order in this case,


Justice Ginsburg, the commissioner finds that it would


like to see its reparation orders deemed to be enforceable


by a Federal district court, so I can't concede that they


wouldn't be, but what I can say is that determination is


not within the agency's jurisdiction.  That would be a


determination for the Federal district court to make in


the event that the State instrumentality raised an


Eleventh Amendment immunity defense to the attempted


enforcement action by the private complainant.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hughey, why do you assume that if


this is not judicial action, sovereign immunity doesn't


apply?  I mean, I guess whatever sovereign immunity the


States retained upon the formation of the Federal


Constitution was the sovereign immunity that existed in


international law at the time.


Can foreign sovereigns be summoned before


executive or legislative tribunals in this country?


MR. HUGHEY:  I don't know whether foreign


sovereigns can be summoned before the --

 QUESTION:  Well, but the State sovereign


immunity is just what -- the sovereign immunity that they


had at international law.  That's what -- the Eleventh


Amendment is just a reflection of the fact that they


retained that sort of sovereign immunity, and I don't


think it makes any difference that, you know, if the King


of England summons George Washington, President of the


United States, to appear before a parliamentary commission


or some royal tribunal instead of an English court.  I


think George Washington would say, you know, go fly a


kite.


(Laughter.)


MR. HUGHEY:  Well, I think that one can turn to


the text of the Eleventh Amendment itself for some


guidance on this issue, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  No, you can't, because the Eleventh


Amendment is just -- we have held that it represents just


a reflection of the fact that the States retained that


sovereign immunity that they had before the formation of


the Federal Republic, and --


MR. HUGHEY:  It's a reflection, Your Honor, of


the immunity from coercive judicial process.  I think


that's why the Eleventh Amendment begins that the judicial


power of the United States shall not be construed to


any --

 QUESTION:  That's the conclusion, but what


Justice Scalia's asking, and I think we're interested in,


is whether there's any precedent that you could cite, any


historical source that says that an administrative


tribunal can summon a sovereign before it and render a


judgment.


MR. HUGHEY:  Well, if I may suggest a different


side to that is that there is no precedent to suggest that


it can't.  It's been held by this Court in California v.


United States that State-run courts are subject to


commission regulation.


QUESTION:  Well, but if it's the dog that didn't


bark theory, it seems to me that cuts against you.  If


this has never been done, that's probably because it can't


be done.  At least we can make that inference.


MR. HUGHEY:  No, I think it has been done since


the Shipping Act was first passed, and it simply --


QUESTION:  I'm not talking about the Shipping


Act.  I'm talking about other authority.  If you're saying


that the Shipping Act is the precedent-breaking ground, it


seems to me that you're then on somewhat a slender


foundation for your argument here.


MR. HUGHEY:  This Court held in California v.


United States that the Shipping Act as a regulatory


statute applies to all State-run courts.  What the

commission is suggesting, Justice Kennedy, is that that


applies equally with respect to agency adjudications.


QUESTION:  But California v. United States, the


United States was a party, so there was no Eleventh


Amendment question there.


MR. HUGHEY:  No, the question I think was


whether the entire statute, which at that time included a


regulatory procedure that could be initiated by private


complainants, whether the entire statute, which was a


coherent regulatory scheme, applied to State-run ports,


and that's what the Court held.  The Court specifically


referred to the scheme for regulating waterfront


terminals, not the specific provision within that scheme


that permits the United States itself to initiate an


investigation.


QUESTION:  But the case itself, United States v.


California, raised no Eleventh Amendment problem.


MR. HUGHEY:  No, that's correct.  That's


correct, it didn't raise an Eleventh Amendment problem,


but the issue was whether the regulatory scheme as a whole


could be applied to State instrumentalities, and this


adjudicatory proceeding under the Shipping Act is part of


that regulatory program.


With respect --


QUESTION:  Is there any -- I mean, it's sort of

an interesting question, but I wonder if there are laws or


rules which say that the Congress says that any ship,


including ships belonging to foreign States that enter New


York Harbor, will abide by the rules of the New York


Harbor Authority, and if they don't, you can -- there's


some argument about whether the pilot comes on or


something, that ship, including a military ship of a


foreign nation, or any other, has to adjudicate the


controversy in front of the New York Authority or other --


I don't know how that works, but maybe you do.  I imagine


they are subject to our rules when they come here, and


bring their ships into the harbor.


MR. HUGHEY:  Yes, I would think so, and the


commission does have some jurisdiction over foreign-


operated and -- foreign operated vessels that are owned by


sovereigns.  The commission regulates sally-to-port


controlled carriers which are vessels that are owned by


Governments.  If a complaint were to be filed against such


an entity, I see no reason why the commission would not


attempt to assert its regulatory adjudicatory jurisdiction


over such a complaint, but I know of no such specific case


under the statute.


QUESTION:  How do you get around the, sort of


the principle of dignity which has been emphasized in


every case, I think, since Seminole, and it's been given a

prominent place in the reasoning of the court majority in


those cases, that it's the dignity of the States, and so


on, which must be preserved.


If under the rule of sovereign immunity which


overarches the Eleventh Amendment there were indefeasible


dignity interests in the adjudication, say, in Seminole


and all of them, doesn't it follow, a fortiori, that there


are dignitary interests that would be offended by hauling


the State in front of an Article I, a purely


administrative tribunal?


MR. HUGHEY:  I think I would have two responses


to that, Justice Souter.  First is that I understand the


dignitary interest to be co-extensive with the sovereign


immunity interest, and second --


QUESTION:  Well, that leaves the question in


a -- unanswered, I guess.  The --


QUESTION:  Justice Souter says the sovereign


immunity interest is co-extensive with the dignitary


interest.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Let's assume the co-existence. 


What's the answer to the question?


MR. HUGHEY:  Well, I think the answer would be,


then, that sovereign immunity doesn't apply, that a


State's dignity is not offended.

 QUESTION:  I certainly agree with you.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Because dignity seems to have been


taken, in fact, as one of the interests to be served by


sovereign immunity.  Why doesn't the doctrine of sovereign


immunity, why doesn't it apply if applied in those other


cases?


MR. HUGHEY:  Well, I think that the dignity of


the State is less offended by this type of regulatory


adjudication, given the fact that the agency has no


coercive power to compel anything from the State.


QUESTION:  I -- it seems to me intuitively just


the opposite.  I mean, these are tribunals that -- if


we're going to talk about dignity, these are tribunals


that do not have the dignity of the judicial forums that


were at stake in the preceding cases, and I would have


supposed that the offense to the sovereignty of the State


was even greater to pull the State before these lesser


tribunals.


MR. HUGHEY:  Well, I think the offense to the


dignity interest of the State occurs when a State is


forced to do something which is the result of a coercive


act.  Under the Shipping Act --


QUESTION:  Everything was fine in Seminole and


all of them, until we got to the point of judgment?  I

mean, is that the way you're trying to cut the argument?


MR. HUGHEY:  No.  I think in cases like Alden


and Seminole Tribe it was the threat of judgment that hung


over the United States that was the problem, because in


those cases, if the court entered an order against a State


it was automatically self-enforcing them.


QUESTION:  Well, they could have made them


appear and just said, you know, we understand that -- just


as you're saying, we understand that an order can't issue


against you, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't show up.


We haven't said that in sovereign immunity. 


We've said the State does not have to appear.  It is


hauling the State before the tribunal that is the offense,


not just the judgment.


MR. HUGHEY:  Well, I think with respect to your


hypothetical this Court has found the power of coercion or


contempt is the judicial power necessary to the exercise


of all others, so I don't think that a court could just


tell a State, well, appear and we're not going to be able


to issue an order against you.  I think the fact that


coercion can result from the judicial proceeding is the


point of the judicial proceeding and is what


differentiates it from this type of regulatory


adjudication.


QUESTION:  Well, but the court can't say it, but

the Eleventh Amendment says it.  I mean, and whereupon the


court can say, look, you know, by reason of your sovereign


immunity, we understand if you show up we can't issue any


contempt judgment, we can't issue a merits judgment


against you, but that doesn't mean you don't have to show


up.  But it does mean you don't have to show up, doesn't


it?


MR. HUGHEY:  Well, yes, the State can move to


dismiss any suit that's filed against it in a court, but I


still think that it's the threat of coercive judgment


against the State that is the reason that the State can --


QUESTION:  There is no threat of coercive


judgment.  The Eleventh Amendment makes it very clear that


you can't issue the coercive judgment, but the State still


doesn't have to show up.


MR. HUGHEY:  I don't think that analysis should


apply to this statute, Justice Scalia, because under the


Shipping Act the agency can -- cannot compel an appearance


by the State.  If the State just doesn't show up under the


Shipping Act, the only way to do anything about that is to


go into a Federal district court and seek a court order,


and if the agency determines to do that, it then has to


ask the Attorney General to do so.  Under the statute, the


Attorney General may, rather than shall, enforce any order


the commission issued.  That is therefore, by definition,

an exercise of the executive discretion that this Court


found acceptable in Alden v. Maine.


QUESTION:  Does the commission have contempt


powers?


MR. HUGHEY:  No.  No, it does not.


QUESTION:  Well, if it issues its process to a


State and the -- like the entity in the present case, and


the entity simply fails to show up, what can it do?


MR. HUGHEY:  If the entity failed to show up,


Mr. Chief Justice, the commission could issue an order


telling it to show up, but again, that would have to be


enforced by a Federal district court, and if --


QUESTION:  At the behest of the Attorney


General, or --


MR. HUGHEY:  Yes.  Yes.  The commission would


have to ask the Attorney General to enforce it.  Under the


statute the Attorney General doesn't have to, but if he


determined to do so, he could then go into a district


court and try to enforce the order.


QUESTION:  And what would be the Eleventh


Amendment situation there, when the commission went into


district court to try to enforce its order to require


appearing?


MR. HUGHEY:  Oh, I would suggest that there


would be no Eleventh Amendment problem there, because the

enforcement action would be in the name of and by the


United States.


QUESTION:  It would be by the United States?


MR. HUGHEY:  Yes.  It would be in the name of


and by the United States.  In this case, it would be, for


example, United States v. South Carolina State Ports


Authority.


QUESTION:  How many agencies have a pattern like


this, where they determine the rules by rule-making, this


kind of adjudication, and a commission-initiated


proceeding?


MR. HUGHEY:  I know that the Surface


Transportation Board, which used to be the NSA Commerce


Commission, has this authority, and I think that the


Federal Communication Commission does, but I'm not


entirely certain of that.  I would suggest, if I may, that


to uphold the State's claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity


in this case will have an adverse effect on the regulatory


scheme that the Congress has created in the Shipping Act


by undermining the notion of national uniformity in


maritime commercial regulations.


QUESTION:  Well, Congress could certainly handle


that by making it very clear by legislation that if the


State runs one of these operations, the State waives its


sovereign immunity.  Couldn't Congress make that clear?

 MR. HUGHEY:  I'm not sure if that kind of waiver


is still acceptable after this Court's opinions of recent


years.


(Laughter.)


MR. HUGHEY:  I would suggest that it's probably


not, but we think that, under the statute as it's written


now, there's no need for something like that, because it's


merely a regulatory action that the commission is


attempting to utilize to find facts to determine what


constitutes a Shipping Act violation, and again, there's


no use of coercive power.  In order for there to be


coercion, the commission has to go into a Federal district


court.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES


IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER


MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


States enjoy no sovereign immunity from Federal


executive branch action, even when it takes the form of


adjudication.  It is well-established that States have no

immunity from a suit brought by the Federal Government. 


That's true not because of some preexisting notion of


sovereign immunity, but because that consent to suits by


the United States Federal Government is implicit in the


plan of the convention.


Now, proceedings before the Federal Maritime


Commission are a necessary predicate for the United States


Government to bring a Federal suit to enforce the Shipping


Act.  Given that the States enjoy no immunity from such a


suit, they should not be allowed to reach back into the


administrative process and assert an immunity from the


preliminary proceedings before the agency.


QUESTION:  But I'm not -- I don't understand the


argument.  Sovereign immunity is based on parties, and we


have said that when the United States is a party, there's


no sovereign immunity, and not, incidentally, because that


was inconsistent with some earlier notion of sovereign


immunity, because the Constitution changed it.


MR. CLEMENT:  No --


QUESTION:  But here we have a private party. 


That's all -- isn't that all the difference in the world?


MR. CLEMENT:  But we have a private party that's


not initiating a lawsuit, but is initiating executive


action.  Private parties are free to complain to the


Federal Government and say a State government is violating

Federal law.  In fact, the Petition Clause rightly


protects the individual petitioner's right to petition the


Federal Government and complain about that violation.


Now, I don't think it violates the Constitution


for the United States Federal Government to say, we take


citizen complaints seriously, and we're going to


investigate each and every one of them, and I wouldn't


think that it would violate the Eleventh Amendment for the


Attorney General to give the party who's the subject of


the complaint, even if it's the State, an opportunity to


come before --


QUESTION:  Yes, but --


MR. CLEMENT:  -- the executive branch and


explain why there wasn't a violation.


QUESTION:  But the commission isn't just like


kind of an ombudsman here.  I mean, it's got very definite


procedures that greatly resemble adjudication.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, they do resemble


adjudication, and that's part of the process to formalize


and regularize this process of getting complaints from


citizens and response from others, but I don't think the


formalization and regularization of that process turns it


into a judicial act.  It remains an act --


QUESTION:  Well, isn't it the case that if the


State defaults and says, you have no jurisdiction over me,

and the commission therefore comes to a conclusion --


we'll leave the word adjudication out of it.  It comes to


a conclusion.  That conclusion itself is enforceable as


such, at the behest of the National Government, in a


district court, isn't it?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, first I want to clarify


something.  If there's a case where the State doesn't


appear, and the private party is asserting a view of the


Shipping Act that's contrary to the view of the Federal


Maritime Commission, then there will be no order.


QUESTION:  Let's assume it's not contrary. 


Let's assume the Maritime Commission says, you, private


party, are right, and we hold that the State has committed


the following violations, and I presume should be enjoined


from further commission, whatever order it might come up


with.


Once the commission has come to such a


conclusion, isn't that conclusion, as such, enforceable at


the behest of the United States in the district court?


MR. CLEMENT:  It is -- it would be enforceable


through a judicial procedure under the Shipping Act.


QUESTION:  So -- if that is so, there's


something much more involved here than merely an agency of


the National Government taking a complaint seriously and


investigating it, and the difference is that in the --

under the act, its conclusion on the investigation becomes


an enforceable order at the behest of the National


Government in a district court, and isn't that the


difference?


MR. CLEMENT:  But I don't think it's a critical


difference, because the reason that that becomes


enforceable, subject to whatever defenses there are, the


reason that becomes enforceable is not because it's the


midway point in some litigation.  It's enforceable because


it reflects the executive branch's definitive


interpretation of the Shipping Act.


The cease-and-desist order --


QUESTION:  Well, the Federal Government could


have an interpretation of the Shipping Act and go into


it -- assuming there is otherwise a statutory jurisdiction


here, the National Government could have a view of the


shipping Act and go into the district court and say, this


is our considered view, and the other party would have an


opportunity to oppose it.  We'd have a lawsuit.


As things stand now, when the United States goes


in with what you call its considered view, that is the end


of the issue on the merits, as I understand it.  The only


thing the district court is there for is to enforce it.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, there are some challenges


that can be brought to that, and I guess the problem with

this --


QUESTION:  Could they have a trial de novo on


the merits?


MR. CLEMENT:  No, they can't, under the current


system.


QUESTION:  Could they collaterally attack and


say, look, it doesn't mean anything to us, because we


can't be hauled in front of the commission by a private


party.  Can it -- is such a plea recognized?


MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think it currently is, but


if that's --


QUESTION:  No, I don't think it is, either, and


that's why your argument that this is nothing but a way


for the National Government to take a considered view of a


complaint and come to a conclusion seems to me beside the


point.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, it -- but the point, I


think -- first of all, if the problem is the level of


review that's given at the end of the process, then that's


what should be adjusted, not throwing out the entire


proceeding ab initio as the Fourth Circuit did.


But more to the point, I think the reason


there's deference is because it reflects the executive


branch's view, and it's the same in that order whether


it's the product of a privately initiated complaint and

adjudication, or whether it's an agency-initiated


complaint.  In both cases there's going to be practical


pressure for the State-regulated entity to participate in


the proceeding, but neither should they get an immunity.


The practical pressure is not the same as the


compulsive process that the judiciary has.  Nobody's


summoned before the commission because a summons is


necessarily enforced through the contempt power of the


court.  This is --


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Clement, when I began to


read your brief and I sensed that the sky was falling, and


so I was turning my pages to see all of the horrible


things that were going to happen to the Federal scheme if


the court of appeals judgment stood, and I didn't see much


there.  There's the Vending Stand Act in one of the


circuit courts, but do Federal agencies call Governors


before them all the time and say, well now, Governor,


you're not enforcing the Federal laws?  I don't see that


as part of our constitutional tradition.  I don't see that


we would create a great revolution in traditional practice


by pulling the Ninth Circuit.


MR. CLEMENT:  What there is a tradition of is


the executive branch having the flexibility to determine


how it is going to enforce Federal law.  There aren't many


of these cases precisely because there just aren't that

many State-run entities that are regulated, but the


executive branch has the flexibility to regulate them


through rule-making, through agency-initiated


adjudications, or through private adjudications.


In each one of those, there are practical


pressures to participate.  In each one of those, the rule-


making can be initiated by a private complaint.  There's a


specific provision in the commission's regulation to allow


rule-makings to be kicked off by a private complaint, but


that doesn't turn it into something other than the


executive branch's determination of what the law is and


how it should be enforced, and this Court has generally


deferred to the executive branch's need to determine how


best to take care that the laws are faithfully executed.


QUESTION:  What about the labor board?


MR. CLEMENT:  What's that?


QUESTION:  What about the labor board,


universities?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, --


QUESTION:  State universities and the labor


board.


MR. CLEMENT:  I don't know the specific


application, but --


QUESTION:  No, but I'm thinking that the


universities often have unions, and I gather that -- why

hasn't the labor board been involved in adjudicating


complaints about the State university as an employer in


respect to the labor unions?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well --


QUESTION:  Maybe it hasn't.  I wouldn't know why


it wouldn't have.


MR. CLEMENT:  I mean, but one thing that's


certainly clear about the labor board is that that's a


perfect example of an administrative agency that decides


to proceed by adjudication.


QUESTION:  I'm not arguing with you.  I'm just


wondering why there were not more examples.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, another example is the


Railway Labor Act, because the Railway Labor Act is --


defines its jurisdiction coextensively with the Interstate


Commerce Commission.  There are State-run railroads under


the Railway Labor Act.  Typically those kind of employment


disputes are initiated by a private party.  This court in


California v. Taylor said that the Railway Labor Act can


apply to a State-run railroad.


Interestingly, in footnote 16 of that opinion,


the Court reserved the question of whether the Eleventh


Amendment provided protection for the suit in court, but


it didn't say anything about Eleventh Amendment protection


before the board itself, and I think the relevant history

here is almost exactly the opposite of the case in Alden.


In Alden, this case had a long history of State


sovereign immunity, and very few and only recent efforts


by the Federal Government to abrogate that immunity. 


Here, by contrast, there's a 115-year tradition of State


entities being subject to regulatory commissions, and very


few and only recent efforts to invoke any kind of Eleventh


Amendment immunity before them.


I also think that the text of the Eleventh


Amendment has a special relevance here that it lacked in


Alden.  In Alden, the determination that State courts not


exercise the, quote, judicial power of the United States,


only began the analysis of whether or not the States


enjoyed their sovereign immunity free from congressional


disturbance.


Here, the recognition that the commission


exercise -- does not exercise the judicial power of the


United States necessarily means it exercises the executive


power of the United States, and this Court has


traditionally held that the executive branch may initiate


process against the States without an Eleventh Amendment


bar.


The fact that this proceeding --


QUESTION:  Well, it's not -- you keep speaking


about an Eleventh Amendment bar.  The bar is sovereign

immunity.  We're not concerned about the textual


limitations about the Eleventh Amendment.  We're concerned


with sovereign immunity.


MR. CLEMENT:  But in this particular context, I


think the text is relevant, because this is not a free-


floating, pre-existing notion of sovereign immunity.  What


we're saying is that the Eleventh Amendment waiver in the


plan of the Constitution that allows the United States


Government to sue a State also allows it to take the


preliminary steps in the administrative process.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Clement.


Mr. Dean, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN L. DEAN, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. DEAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may


it please the Court:


This case presents the question of whether


sovereign immunity protects a State from a private suit


brought before a Federal administrative tribunal.  We have


heard today arguments and suggestions that this proceeding


is not a suit within the meaning of the doctrine and


principle of sovereign immunity.


In 1868, this Court addressed this question.  It


held in Nichols v. United States that a proceeding before


an Article I administrative tribunal, a so-called

legislative court, just like the Federal Maritime


Commission, was a suit for sovereign immunity purposes. 


The case was appealed from an appeals court.


The Court confirmed that legislative court


status of the claims court twice, in Ex parte Bakelite in


1929, and then in Williams v. United States in 1933, and


later in 1934 the court again, in United States v.


Sherwood, unanimously confirmed both conclusions, that


States -- that claims court was an Article I legislative


court, and its jurisdiction was dependent upon a waiver of


sovereign immunity.  There were no dissenting justices in


any single one of those decisions.


QUESTION:  Mr. Dean, but that was an Article I


court that just adjudicates.  Here we're being told that


the Maritime Commission is in the business of making rules


for the governance of people in the trade, and it makes


the rules three ways.  One through rule-making, another's


through commission proceeding, and a third through private


complaints, and why couldn't the private complainant be


regarded as a kind of delegate to the commission?  I take


it if the commission itself decided to investigate, you


would have no question about sovereign immunity, is that


true?


MR. DEAN:  We've made that clear throughout this


proceeding, Justice.

 QUESTION:  All right.  So why can't the


commission say, one of the ways that we investigate is, we


listen to what private people tell us, so that in effect


we're taking that private complaint and we're making it


our own by processing it?


MR. DEAN:  That's exactly -- that is exactly


what does not happen in this case, Your Honor.  A private


complainant files a complaint before the Federal Maritime


Commission, we receive the notice, we either respond or


we're in default.  It is quite clear -- and I submit with


all due respect that Mr. Clement is absolutely wrong on


this.  It is quite clear that the agency can find both


findings of fact and findings of law against a


nonresponding party.


That's been established administrative procedure


law for sometime and, in fact, the private party controls


the disposition of this proceeding.  The executive arm of


the Federal Maritime Commission, its Bureau of


Enforcement, does not even have a right to intervene in


the proceeding.  It has to petition like any other private


party to get involved in the proceeding.  They did not do


that in this case.


QUESTION:  Can the private party ask --


QUESTION:  -- have standing?


MR. DEAN:  They have to show cause for

intervention, Justice Kennedy, just like any other private


party would do.  They have no greater standing than any


other private party.


QUESTION:  But could a private party say to the


commission, commission, here's a serious complaint,


something wrong has been done, I don't have the resources


to prosecute it, would you please investigate it?


MR. DEAN:  Oh, absolutely.  That's the way the


commission traditionally does business.  That is an


entirely separate proceeding.  That is the proceeding to


which we would not object.  If a private party came into


the commission and said, we have this grievance against


the South Carolina State Port Authority and we'd like you


to look into it, and the Bureau of Enforcement came to us


and said, we think you're doing something wrong, we would


obviously talk to them, and if we couldn't reach some kind


of accommodation with respect to that matter, then we


would -- and they brought a complaint against us, they


would be entitled to do that if -- provided the complaint


was brought in their names and formed by the United


States.


And I might add that, in a reparations


proceeding -- this is not a sanctionless exercise.  In a


reparations proceeding, if the agency issues an order


against us, a judgment against us, and we fail to comply


30

with that judgment, we incur statutory liabilities,


automatic, of up to $25,000 a day.  Now, they can be


compromised by the agency for a period of 5 years after


each violation, if it so chooses, but any time somebody


says to me, for example, that if you don't do XYZ you're


going to incur an automatic statutory liability of $25,000


a day, I consider that a sanction, and --


QUESTION:  Well, is that statutory liability, is


that enforceable by the commission without court order, or


did it have to go to court to do it?


MR. DEAN:  Ultimately, if push comes to shove


and there's a confrontation, they have to go to court, but


Mr. Chief Justice, I think anybody faced with a statutory


liability of the United States imposed by Federal law


considers that a sanction, and we do not have the


opportunity to protect our interests, to say, no, no, no,


this wasn't a violation, this is what we did, when the


agency, the only standard for the enforcement of the


agency's order in court is whether or not it was duly and


regularly issued.


So the position of the United States that this


is not a -- that this is a proceeding that is essentially


equivalent to a petition by a private party for executive


action is absolutely incorrect, and they don't even


believe that position themselves.

 QUESTION:  Could I go back to your opening


statement?  Why is it an exercise of the judicial power of


the United States?  I mean, we have an ordinary


administrative agency.  What's the theory of it?


I mean, I grant you, I'm sure you're right, that


there's some case that said once the court of claims,


which is a court in exercising -- though set up under


those Article I exercises the judicial power of the United


States, so my Constitution says it has nothing to do with


whether it's a lawsuit, not a lawsuit, I don't care.  I


want to know, is it the judicial power of the United


States, and frankly, I didn't know that the executive


branch could exercise the judicial power of the United


States.


MR. DEAN:  The court below held --


QUESTION:  Whatever they held, I want to know


what the reasoning of it is.


MR. DEAN:  Well, the reasoning -- the


judicial -- you don't need to find the judicial power.


QUESTION:  You don't?  My Constitution happens


to say, the judicial power of the United States shall not


be construed, so I'm -- maybe I don't have to find it, 


but I'd like to know on what basis I wouldn't have to .


MR. DEAN:  This is a case brought by a citizen


of the State of South Carolina, like Chisholm v. Georgia,

I might add, against the -- against a -- the State of


South Carolina.  It's not technically for those terms and


those terms alone within the scope of the Eleventh


Amendment.


QUESTION:  All right, fine, it's not within the


scope of the Eleventh Amendment.


MR. DEAN:  It's Hans v. Louisiana.


QUESTION:  Oh, no, no, I want to know if it is


with -- forget the fact -- I think it is within the scope


of the Eleventh Amendment if a -- I believed, as far as I


know, when a citizen of a State sues the State itself, of


which he is a citizen, it is an interpretation of the


Eleventh Amendment, and I didn't know that for that


purpose you didn't have to find the judicial power of the


United States, so I'm open to that argument.


MR. DEAN:  Well --


QUESTION:  I want to know, is this the judicial


power?  If so, what's the argument?  If it's not the


judicial power, what part of the Constitution forbids it?


MR. DEAN:  First, it is -- we have stated it is


the judicial power, but you need not find that, and I'll


give you the reason it is the judicial power of the United


States, is because this agency acts as an adjunct to the


court, just as this Court has held in Northern Pipeline

Act entails the exercise of judicial power, Justice


Stevens.  You can look at this either as an organic


analysis, as you have done under the Appointments Clause


of the commission itself, or you can look at the statutory


process and procedure that is involved.


QUESTION:  Does the Federal Trade Commission


exercise the judicial power, does the State Department,


does the Commerce Department, the Post Office -- I mean,


what is the principle under which this is or is not?


MR. DEAN:  Well, the --


QUESTION:  What about the President, let's say,


when he's -- you see the point.


MR. DEAN:  In your book, Justice Breyer, you


call this an uneasy constitutional area, and I certainly


agree with that.

States, this Court has held in a number of cases,


including the cases that I just mentioned, that the


judicial power can -- at least some component of the


exercise of the judicial power in a comprehensive

proceeding can be delegated to nonjudicial officers,


provided it is subject to judicial supervision and subject


to some specific supervisory parameters that exist in this


case, but it's a complicated question, and the Court has


disagreed on it, and various court have disagreed on this


question for sometime, and in fact, in some of the cases


that I just mentioned, the United States Supreme Court


took appellate jurisdiction from an Article I tribunal in


the executive branch, and under those circumstances


something was going on before the court of claims.


QUESTION:  You know, now that I can quote one of


my favorite authors, Justice Scalia, he says it is no


doubt true that all such administrative bodies adjudicate,


they determine facts, apply a rule of law to those facts,


and thus arrive at a decision --


MR. DEAN:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- but there is nothing inherently


judicial about adjudication.


MR. DEAN:  Granted, but --


QUESTION:  Then what is it that makes it the


judicial power?


MR. DEAN:  What is it that makes it subject to


sovereign immunity, or what is it that makes it the


judicial power?


QUESTION:  The judicial power is what we're

all -- and I'm --


MR. DEAN:  Well, the judicial power, if you look


at a proceeding, an administrative proceeding like the


Shipping Act, and this Court held that, held this in the


Far East Conference case, it said, you can't take one


isolated aspect of it.  You cannot take the organic entity


which is the Federal Maritime Commission and consider its


functions independent of the rest of the proceeding that


is involved.


Ultimately, this proceeding ultimately, in


combination with the courts of the United States, this


proceeding invokes the judicial power, whether the FMC is


acting --


QUESTION:  All executive action does.  I mean,


that's just too broad a principle.  I mean, the fact is,


since we don't have a  -- we have a Constitution that has


a Habeas Corpus Clause.  There's nothing the executive can


do to you that can't be challenged in court.


MR. DEAN:  Well, this is --


QUESTION:  Ultimately, the court is the moment


of truth, but that doesn't convert every executive action


into an exercise of the judicial power.


MR. DEAN:  I know, but this is clearly not


purely executive action.  This is an independent agency,


and this Court has held repeatedly that officers that

exercise quasi-judicial power can be subject to special


removal requirements, and that is --


QUESTION:  Ah, so if this wasn't an independent


agency, it would be different?


MR. DEAN:  No, but let me -- both in Hensel and


in Artistani, and in this Court's decision in West v.


Gibson --


QUESTION:  Would you -- may I just interrupt


you?  What if this were an executive agency, rather than


an independent agency?  Could you make the same argument?


MR. DEAN:  Like -- the claims court was within


the Department of Treasury at the time these decisions


were handed down.  That doesn't necessarily resolve the


matter, but it does instruct the Court's analysis that


this is a quasi-judicial independent agency --


QUESTION:  Well, but that's not answering my


question.


MR. DEAN:  -- and its officers are not subject


to executive supervision.


QUESTION:  What is your answer to my question? 


If it were a pure executive agency, would it be the same


case for you?


MR. DEAN:  No.  It would be the same case


depending on the statutory process involved, Justice


Stevens.  The agencies --

the Department of Treasury at the time, and customs


officials have done --


QUESTION:  You're a little too fast for me.


MR. DEAN:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  What is your answer?  Is it the same


case entirely within the executive branch?


MR. DEAN:  It is.


QUESTION:  Okay.


QUESTION:  Let me ask you a slightly different


question.  If we assume for the sake of argument that it


is not the judicial power that's being exercised here, do


you lose?

MR. DEAN:  No.

 MR. DEAN:  Because sovereign immunity --


QUESTION:  Sovereign immunity -- in other words,


you've got a sovereign immunity argument which is at least


distinct from the Eleventh Amendment argument?


MR. DEAN:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. DEAN:  And the United States has a sovereign


immunity argument, and they apply sovereign immunity --


QUESTION:  That's what I thought.


MR. DEAN:  The United States applies its


sovereign immunity in proceedings just like this.  It has


for all time.  As a matter of fact, this Court has held


sovereign immunity applies to the United States in


administrative proceedings consistently for the last 130


years, and there has not been one single dissent from that


proposition that I've been able to find.


In West, all the Justices of this Court assumed


for the purposes of that analysis that sovereign immunity


principles apply before the EEOC.


QUESTION:  Well, but sovereign immunity for the


United States may not be co-extensive with sovereign


immunity for the States.  Granted that sovereign immunity


to the States goes beyond just the literal language of the


Eleventh Amendment about the judicial power.


MR. DEAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, I agree with that

proposition in the abstract, but in this particular case,


I think there's a lot of similarity, and I'll give you


exactly -- I'll tell you exactly why I think why.


Firstly, the courts have held that it's a


reciprocal -- this Court has held over the years that it


is a reciprocal privilege, but the United States in its


brief in this case --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  What do you mean by that,


that it's a reciprocal privilege?


MR. DEAN:  Well, in Alden and in Hans and -- the


Court has held that the privilege of Federal sovereign


immunity -- State sovereign immunity is a reciprocal


privilege to the privilege enjoyed by the States.


QUESTION:  By reciprocal you mean that it's co­

extensive?


MR. DEAN:  Co-extensive mirror image, yes,


Justice Scalia.


The United States has suggested in this case,


and it's a proposition that I agree with, that the


sovereign immunity of the United States at least as it


applies to money judgments -- and it's much broader than


money judgments, but let's just talk about money judgments


for a minute, that at least as it applies to money


judgments is informed by the Appropriations Clause, which


reserves to the legislature, to the Congress the right to

spend, and we all know the right to spend is the right to


tax.


So our body politic, our -- the public -- the


people of the United States have made a determination that


their Constitution, which is their sovereign, commits to


the legislative branches the exclusive right to expend the


public's money, and that's a very fundamental principle in


our Federal Constitution.  That principle is also


reflected word for word in this constitution of South


Carolina --


QUESTION:  Well, you don't think the States


have --


MR. DEAN:  Pardon me?


QUESTION:  -- the exclusive right to determine


when their money will be spent in a proceeding brought by


the United States, do you?


MR. DEAN:  Excuse me?


QUESTION:  You don't say that the States have


the same power over their own money that the United States


has over its money, in an action brought by the United


States?


MR. DEAN:  I do.


QUESTION:  There's sovereign immunity -- even in


an action brought by the United States?


MR. DEAN:  No, this Court has held that they

have consented to suit, so it doesn't apply in that area.


QUESTION:  So they don't have sovereign immunity


in cases brought by the United States.


MR. DEAN:  That's correct, but in this


constitution of the State of South Carolina that was


adopted 9 years before this Constitution was adopted,


there is the same Appropriations Clause.  The same


principle is reflected, that no moneys may be obligated --


QUESTION:  But that was before the Supremacy


Clause was adopted in the Federal Constitution.


MR. DEAN:  But this is a constitutional


principle Justice Stevens.  It is a question --


QUESTION:  It is not a constitutional


protection -- principle that protects the States from


liability to the United States.


MR. DEAN:  I ask you this question as a


hypothetical.  The Constitution of this --


QUESTION:  No, counsel doesn't ask questions.


(Laughter.)


MR. DEAN:  I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.


The constitution of -- I'll state it in a


declaration.  The constitution of the State of South


Carolina reflects the same principle reflected in the


Appropriations Clause.  We have two sister sovereigns,


both of them organized on the same fundamental principle

that only the people have the right to levy on the public


treasury, and only the people through their elected


representatives, and only the people have the right to


spend, and therefore only the people have the right to


tax.


QUESTION:  Mr. Dean --


MR. DEAN:  Now, you have these two comparable


constitutions.  How do you put them together and violate


that principle?


QUESTION:  Mr. Dean --


MR. DEAN:  I don't know the answer to that


question, Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  -- you recognized a case called Ex


parte Young, and let's say that the private complainant


says, okay, I'm not going to sue the State court


authorities.  I'm going to sue the commissioners, and so


as the FMC to please substitute for the entity the


individual commissioners, and they said go ahead, and they


don't have sovereign -- individuals, at least with respect


to prospective relief do not have sovereign immunity.


Why couldn't -- is that then just a matter of


amending a complaint to name different parties?


MR. DEAN:  That suit belongs in Federal court,


and I doubt very seriously that the commission has that


statutory jurisdiction.  The reason is that it has


43

jurisdiction over persons engaged in the business of


operating, or internal operators.  I very sincerely doubt


that any individual employee would satisfy that test, but


the test certainly exists under Ex parte Young.


The opportunity might exist, except for the fact


that the proper way for the individual to proceed in this


particular case would be to file a declaratory judgment


under State law, which is available, to obtain the relief


the individual requested.


QUESTION:  But you haven't answered the


question --


MR. DEAN:  I'm sorry, Justice --


QUESTION:  -- why couldn't the FMC say --


MR. DEAN:  I don't believe the Shipping Act


gives the FMC jurisdiction over individuals who are


employees of entities that are engaged in --


QUESTION:  Not employees, the commissioners


themselves, the members of the State body.


MR. DEAN:  The officers of the -- I don't


believe the Shipping Act gives the FMC jurisdiction over


officers of entities that it regulates.  I don't believe


it has that kind of personal jurisdiction, Your Honor. 


That issue has not -- I am not aware that that issue has


decided, but I frankly have grave doubts that it would.


QUESTION:  But if that matter were clarified so

that Congress, wanting the FMC to have this third way of


regulating said, in the case where State agencies are


involved you can sue the individuals, individuals who


compose the entity --


MR. DEAN:  Well, the proper way for the Federal


Maritime -- as I said, I don't think the FMC has that


jurisdiction.  It does have jurisdiction over us.  All it


has to do is initiate its own complaint.  When the ALJ


dismissed the complaint in this case, he invited the


commission, if the commission deemed the case had merit,


satisfying the test in Alden, he invited the commission to


initiate a proceeding through its own Enforcement Bureau. 


The commission did not do so.  Instead, they reversed the


ALJ's order, which is in turn reversed by the Fourth


Circuit.


The parties in this, the Federal parties in this


case do not challenge the holdings of this case in


Nichols, Hans, Sherwood, Alden, or Seminole, so in effect


what they're asking this Court to decide is the following


three propositions, and all of the following three


propositions:  that lesser tribunals established under


Article I have powers that both State and Federal courts


lack, even though they constitutionally may adjudicate


only subject to the supervision of the latter; 2) that


Congress, merely by assigning a private cause of action to

administrative tribunal, acquires and exercises power it


does not otherwise have to abrogate State sovereign


immunity, thereby bypassing this Court's sovereign


immunity jurisprudence, and 3) that States lack the


reciprocal right to assert sovereign immunity in Federal


fora where the immunity of the United States clearly


applies.


QUESTION:  Well, you really don't need your


third argument, do you, that the State sovereign immunity


is co-extensive with Federal sovereign immunity?


MR. DEAN:  I don't need that third argument, Mr.


Chief Justice, that's quite correct, but what the United


States asserts, says about administrative proceedings, if


they were purely executive action -- for example, if it


was purely an executive branch matter, this -- the United


States has come into this Court on numerous occasions most


recently in Artistani and West, and asked this Court to


intervene in what they now say is a purely executive


branch matter.


There was no inquiry.  There was no special


analysis that the court did to determine whether or not


the intervention in that kind of purely executive branch


matter was warranted.  There was no discussion of that. 


The court assumed that the doctrine of sovereign immunity


as it applied to the Federal Government applied to it, and

I might add that --


QUESTION:  Oh, what is the boundary?  Apparently


you're now talking about a principle of state sovereign


immunity outside the scope of Amendment 11 of the United


States Constitution, and I haven't really heard of that


one.  I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but where do I go


to discover what its bounds are, to discover what the


implications are, to discover if it applies when the


President does anything?  I mean, I don't know what the


scope of that one is, so where do I go to find out about


that?


MR. DEAN:  If the President does something and


the President --


QUESTION:  No, I'm just asking -- my question


is --


MR. DEAN:  Hans -- Hans v. Louisiana is the only


place you need to go. 


QUESTION:  In other words, Hans you say is


outside the scope of the Eleventh Amendment.


MR. DEAN:  By its terms it held it was outside


the scope of the Eleventh Amendment.


QUESTION:  All right, so Hans does not have to


do with the Eleventh Amendment.


MR. DEAN:  It does not by its terms have


anything to do --

MR. DEAN:  -- it reflects the --


QUESTION:  Then how do I discover the scope of


this principle of State sovereign immunity outside the


Eleventh Amendment?


MR. DEAN:  Well, the same way you discover the


principle of Federal sovereign immunity.  You look at what


the nature of the proceeding, and the nature of the


affront to the dignity of the sovereign is being involved,


you identify what the sovereign's interests are, and in


this particular case, in the money judgment it violates


the same clause of our constitution that it violates in


the case of the Federal Constitution, and that's pretty


persuasive.


QUESTION:  But as I understand your argument,


it's not limited to the reparations part of the case. 


There's --


MR. DEAN:  No. 


QUESTION:  -- also a request for a cease and


desist order.


MR. DEAN:  Although I might add, Justice


Stevens --


QUESTION:  You don't really need the reparations


for your position.


MR. DEAN:  -- that the pure participation in

this lengthy proceeding has had consequences for the


Treasury of the State of South Carolina, but nonetheless,


it's much broader than that, yes, Your Honor.  It goes to


the nature -- as this Court held in Seminole, and I might


add, when I was -- when we argued the case before the


Fourth Circuit we had a little discussion about whether or


not the State of South Carolina was willing to be a


scofflaw.


In other words, whether we were willing to have


our -- to have allegations, whether they be frivolous or


serious, against us go unanswered in an administrative


tribunal that concededly regulates us in Washington and


have as the United States maintains this become a


precedent that would affect their dealing with us in the


future without defending ourselves, and that's simply not


a realistic option for the State of South Carolina.


It's not a realistic option for anyone, much


less a sovereign.  If there's anything to dignity, there's


a dignity to that, to be able to defend yourself against


allegations and not have people who are decisionmakers


make judgments against you --


QUESTION:  But let me just --


MR. DEAN:  -- based on unanswered allegations,


or unanswerable allegations.


QUESTION:  May I interrupt you for just a

moment, please?


MR. DEAN:  Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  Let's put the reparations to one


side, and let's assume you're dead right on the monetary


aspect of the case.  Is it your position that it would be


in everyone's best interest to have proceedings like this


initiated ex parte, and then the agency makes up its mind


whether to go -- bring an enforcement proceeding, or it


would be better to have a formal proceeding where you 


have a chance to respond to the charges and so forth?


MR. DEAN:  No, it's far better, Justice Stevens,


to have a person come to the agency, present its concerns


to the agency, and the agency approach the State of South


Carolina, one sovereign to another sovereign.


This case involves the regulation of gaming


ships.  The Congress has committed that to our discretion


under State law.  We are given that right.  The Johnson


Act, which gave us the right to regulate gaming ships,


does not say that it's subject to review by the Federal


Maritime Commission.  It does not say, for example that


the Federal Maritime Commission --


QUESTION:  No, but if you have --


MR. DEAN:  -- has the right to preempt the


Congress.


QUESTION:  If you have an issue such as this in

which the agency thinks there's a colorable basis for a


proceeding, do you think the only way they can proceed


against you formally is to first of all get all the


information ex parte from the private parties, and then


make up their own mind as to whether to bring a formal


proceeding in the name of the agency?


MR. DEAN:  Just like the Department of Justice


does when it enforces the laws against the States, yes,


Your Honor, that is the proper way of doing it, because we


can and will address those allegations at that time, but I


can assure you that the -- this case implements policies


of the State of South Carolina that are important to it,


the regulation of gaming ships, the Johnson Act Congress


has said it's up to the State of South Carolina to make


those policies and to implement those policies --


QUESTION:  Well, but the Johnson Act certainly


didn't say that South Carolina was exempt from the


requirement of the Shipping Act, that it not discriminate.


MR. DEAN:  No, but I can -- that's correct, but


in -- any regulatory system has at its core the right to


make discretionary, discriminatory judgments about what


does and does not comply with the policies of that regime.


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. DEAN:  And the FMC is now sitting in


judge -- as a judge of the -- of our implementation of

than on a sovereign immunity basis, are you?


MR. DEAN:  No, we're not, but what we're saying


is that if they exercise the executive discretion that


they ought to act, that the Constitution envisions them


enacting, that they would approach us as a sovereign, we'd


say, these are our sovereign interests, they'd say, they


are their sovereign interests --


QUESTION:  Well, yes, but --


MR. DEAN:  -- ultimately they would trump ours,


if there was a disagreement --


QUESTION:  Yes.  In 1787 we adopted a


Constitution so they didn't have to approach one another


as sovereign to sovereign any more.


MR. DEAN:  That's true, but in this particular


area the Congress has decided that the sovereign State of


South Carolina gets to do the regulating, Mr. Chief


Justice, so we would come down and we would have two


different regulatory regimes, and we would approach each


other, and we would resolve the differences between them,


and if they disagreed, if ultimately they disagree, they


could bring a complaint against us, which they have the

right to do, and we would defend it, and we would


participate.  We would have the opportunity to defend


ourselves, and we would defend ourselves, and so that's --


QUESTION:  It would not be, perhaps, as


intellectually satisfying as resolving the case


specifically on the merits.  Is it open to us to say that


there's no clear statement that waives sovereign immunity,


as we did in Vermont Yankee?


MR. DEAN:  There is no statement that waives


sovereign immunity.  I think that's been conceded in the


proceedings below.  There's no waiver of sovereign


immunity in this case.  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  But there's no clear statement by the


Congress of the United States intending abrogate --


MR. DEAN:  Oh, no, clearly not.  There's no


mention in the Shipping Act at all of intention to waive


State sovereign immunity.  I can't find a mention in the


Shipping Act of intention to waive Federal sovereign


immunity if and when the Federal Government ever wants to


get into the business of operating ports.  It operates two


airports in the Washington area, so I don't think it's


inconceivable that it might do so at some point, but it is


clearly -- it is clearly no waiver of sovereign immunity,


even if -- even going back to the law where it said the


Congress could waive the sovereign immunity of the United

States, of the States, I'm sorry, there is no evidence of


any intent whatsoever in the Shipping Act to do that.


The fact that the Federal Maritime Commission


may bring its own actions against the United States --


against the States as it did in the California case proves


the opposite proposition, that the Congress, that was the


proper way to proceed, and I think that is the proper way


to proceed.


The -- I'd like to go back to -- this complaint


is a verified private complaint.  It is -- calls for


reparations in the broadest form of reparations, including


consequential damages, interest and attorney's fees, the


commission has no discretion in the handling of this


complaint, it's required by law to adjudicate it, and the


agency's findings become final subject only to judicial


review.


This is precisely the kind of anomalous


proceeding suit that the Court had in mind in Hans, and


Hans came 30 years after --


QUESTION:  But only to the extent they're


seeking a money judgment.


MR. DEAN:  No, Your Honor, I think the sovereign


immunity --


QUESTION:  Well, Hans was purely a money


judgment.

 MR. DEAN:  Yes, but they held that the Court


was -- they held the State immune from the proceeding. 


Obviously, the proceeding had already been completed, but


I think it's fairly clear now that the dignity of the


sovereign entails to the entire proceeding, applies to the


entire proceeding, but you know, this question about the


dignity of the sovereign, the Court in Hans gave us some


instructions, some future instructions --


QUESTION:  But Hans was a court case.


MR. DEAN:  Hans is a court case.


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, it's not a case, then,


in which they say it's not the judicial power --


MR. DEAN:  Just like Federal sovereign immunity


is a court case.


QUESTION:  And why is it a case in which they


say -- isn't it -- I mean, I'm back on my judicial --


forget it, I'm sorry.


MR. DEAN:  My time is up.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Dean.


MR. DEAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hughey, you have 3 minutes


remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP C. HUGHEY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION


MR. HUGHEY:  If I could keep going with your

inquiry, Justice Breyer, I think we are suggesting that


there is a line in this case, and that line is Freytag v.


Commissioner of Internal Revenue.  We're not suggesting


that State instrumentalities would never have sovereign


immunity in administrative proceedings.  Rather, we're


suggesting that they might in proceedings in which


contempt power can be exercised, and this is not one such


proceeding.  This agency doesn't have coercive authority


over the entities that it regulates.  It has to rely on a


Federal district court for that.


To make another point, I think Mr. Dean


emphasized that the Shipping Act allows the agency to fine


instrumentalities that don't comply with its order. 


However, I should point out that in this case the


commission has never indicated that it has the authority


to fine a State instrumentality for not complying with a


reparation order.  That was something that ended up in the


Fourth Circuit's opinion.  We've never said we could do


it, and the United States in its reply brief to this Court


has specifically expressed the view that the FMC could not


fine a State-run court for not complying with the agency-


issued reparation order.


And finally, with respect to the issue of


whether and when the agency's Bureau of Enforcement can


intervene in an agency proceeding, I should point out that

whether or not the Bureau of Enforcement intervenes in the


adjudication does not get to the point of whether it is an


agency action, because the agency always retains the


ability to review, sua sponte, any administrative law


judge order that comes out.


QUESTION:  Why is it that you cannot fine the


State?


MR. HUGHEY:  I think the United States has


suggested that because the commission and the Attorney


General don't have the authority to enforce a reparation


order against a State, that the authority to fine the


State for not complying with that reparation order would


not be an appropriate interpretation of the Shipping Act.


Again, that's something, the commission has


never said that it has the authority to, or that it would


fine a State for not complying with an agency-issued


reparation order.


QUESTION:  Could the commission substitute the


commissioners of the South Carolina Ports Authority for


the port authority itself?


MR. HUGHEY:  I'm unsure of that, Justice


Ginsburg, but we would suggest that the pleading


requirements of Ex parte Young need not be imported into


the Shipping Act, and that a request for, for example, a


cease and desist order against the ports authority would,


57


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

under the Shipping Act, be sufficient, and that the


complaint need not name the commissioners of the ports


authority themselves.


Thank you -- oh, sorry.


QUESTION:  I think what Justice Ginsburg's


question went to, you're saying you don't have to name the


individuals, but suppose that we held that you couldn't


name the State, do you think you have authority to name


the individuals?


MR. HUGHEY:  I'm unsure of that, Justice Scalia. 


The Shipping Act provides that complaints must be filed


against persons.  I think the question would be rather


whether the port commissioners are persons.  It may be


that a fiction could be conceived that they would be under


the Shipping Act, but again, that issue has never come up


in the commission's administration of the statute.


Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Hughey.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11;04 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
