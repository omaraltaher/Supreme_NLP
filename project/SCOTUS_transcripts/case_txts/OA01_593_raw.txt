CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-593, the Dole Food Company versus


Patrickson, and a companion case.


Mr. Paden.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER R. PADEN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. PADEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


The Dead Sea Bromine Company is an


instrumentality of Israel under the Foreign Sovereign


Immunities Act for three principal reasons.


QUESTION:  Is it -- is it owned in the same


capacity now as it was earlier?


MR. PADEN:  No -- no, it is not, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And was it owned at the time the suit


was filed?


MR. PADEN:  At the time this suit was filed, the


company had been privatized.  It was privatized in 1995.


QUESTION:  Right.  Right, and so are you going


to address, then, how it comes under the statute at all in


those circumstances?


MR. PADEN:  I certainly intend to do that, Your


Honor.

 QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. PADEN:  The three reasons, in sum, are that,


throughout the period of time giving rise to the claims,


Israel owned a majority of the shares or other ownership


interests in the company.  We contend that this broad


phrase plainly encompasses the majority ownership of Dead


Sea Bromine that Israel indisputably possessed through a


tiered ownership structure.


Secondly, a contrary interpretation cannot be


reconciled with the basic purposes of the act.  The same


policy that Congress found applicable to directly owned


entities apply equally to their subsidiaries where the


foreign State retains a majority interest.  To restrict


instrumentalities to entities in which States hold legal


title to the shares of stock would exclude a large number 

of the very types of State-owned commercial enterprises,


shipping and airlines, mining operations and the like,


that Congress specifically intended to bring within the


reach of the statute.


QUESTION:  Yes, but it's a lot of trouble to


track these things back, you know, who owns shares many


tiers up, and Congress might well have simply determined 


we will honor the sovereignty of other States when they're


the principal stockholder of a corporation.  Where --


where they are not, we are not impugning their sovereignty

by going ahead and permitting -- permitting suit against


the entity.  That's certainly a rational -- a rational


disposition, and the language seems to suggest that.


MR. PADEN:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't


disagree that that would be a rational disposition, but I


don't think there's any indication in the case law, and


there have been numerous cases where tiered entities have


appeared before courts, that it's posed any particular


problem to identify the tiered ownership structure.  I --


I'm not aware of any cases where -- where that's posed an


enormous issue, and the computation of ownership and


corporate -- corporate responsibility for subsidiaries is


an issue that lawyers deal with every day in commercial


litigation, and lawyers have well-established techniques


to ferret out the corporate change of ownership and 

it's -- it's done all the time.


We don't think -- it clearly can be an issue,


but we don't think that that's a particularly


insurmountable issue here, and, in fact, there's certainly


no indication --


QUESTION:  Your -- your principle would apply no


matter how many tiers up they go?  I -- I assume you don't


think the second tier is the limit?


MR. PADEN:  So long as the State's ownership


interest is the majority ownership interest, Your Honor,

there could be --


QUESTION:  Even though the name of the State


does not appear until you get six tiers up?


MR. PADEN:  That's correct.  Our position would


be that so long as the State's interest is a majority


interest, that would be the limiting principle, and I


think that's what the words of the statute seem


to suggest --


QUESTION:  Why do you limit to the majority? 


Supposing they have practical control as in other


situations, you look at who really runs the company.


MR. PADEN:  Well, the statute says majority


ownership, Your Honor, and we think that --


QUESTION:  But it doesn't say majority ownership


of grandchildren of the parent.


MR. PADEN:  It says a majority ownership


interest, Your Honor, and we think a majority ownership


interest is about as broad a term as -- as could be


conjured up to try to describe generically the concept of


ownership.  I think Congress had in mind that this statute


was going to apply to entities from nations all around the


world, with many different kinds of economic systems, and


in some countries the notion of ownership isn't even so


clearly established.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I suppose it could mean

ownership of other forms, for instance, an oil-drilling


venture, a working interest of 70 percent, which is not


usually called a share.  It's --


MR. PADEN:  That's true.


QUESTION:  So -- so there -- there's work for


that phrase in the statute to do without adopting your


position, it seems to me.


MR. PADEN:  There is.  There are certainly other


kinds of ownership in our legal system -- partnership


interests are an obvious example -- which don't


necessarily refer to share ownership.


But ownership interest is a very, very broad


term, and it -- we think that if Congress had intended


this to be so specifically limited to direct -- directly


owned entities, it would have said directly owned --

QUESTION:  Well, it can --


QUESTION:  Your argument would be stronger if it


were a stand-alone term, but it isn't.  It comes after


shares, and so one can say, well, we're going to read


ownership interest, shares or other ownership interest as


something, say, equivalent to a stock certificate.


You -- it -- it doesn't just say, ownership


interest, and I think that that's why the statute itself


doesn't answer the question.


MR. PADEN:  Well, we think, Your Honor, that the

phrase needs to be read as a whole, and we do not believe


that this is a situation, when the statute is read as a


whole, that the -- that the principle of redundancy and


superfluousness which Judge Kozinski felt, decided in this


case dictated the -- the restriction to direct ownership


should apply.


QUESTION:  Do you -- do you agree with the


respondents' contention, the United States' contention


that foreign countries would not -- would not give us this


break, that generally speaking, in international law


they -- they'll only look to the ownership of the


immediate company?


MR. PADEN:  I -- I think that that's true, Your


Honor, but I think it requires a comment.  I think that


the -- the structure of this statute very uniquely 

reflects our Federalist system, and -- and the -- this


alleged disparity between treatment in this country and


other countries I think is something of a red herring. 


Congress for the most part, in establishing this system,


I believe it's fair to say contemplated that commercially


owned ventures of foreign States would be subject to suit,


that --


QUESTION:  I -- I thought -- I remember when


they enacted the FSIA.  I was around, and I -- I recollect


quite vividly that its object was to bring United States

domestic law into conformity with the new, accepted


international determination of when -- when sovereign


immunity should be respected and when it shouldn't, and if


that's the case, and if you acknowledge that the general


principle internationally is not to go beyond the


ownership of the immediate company, then I don't know why


language which -- which is susceptible of that meaning


shouldn't be given that meaning.


MR. PADEN:  I think there's an answer to that


question, Your Honor.  In -- in foreign nations, an entity


would be subject to suit, but it would typically be


subject to suit -- I don't think there are too many


foreign countries that have our Federalist system, and


certainly not too many foreign countries that have our


deeply ingrained right to a jury trial.  Congress, for the


most part, was saying these suits should go forward.


One of the purposes of the act was to bring


commercially owned ventures of foreign States within the


subject of -- of litigation and make them susceptible to


claims, but Congress said that in doing that, because of


potential sensitivities that could exist, they would


accord those entities the same kinds of privileges that


the Federal Government gets when the Federal Government


waives its immunity, so that --


QUESTION:  How can they be sensitive to

something that they're willing to do to us?  I mean,


the -- the potential sensitivity, if -- if they would hold


the United States liable in such a situation, I mean,


would -- would not recognize sovereign immunity of the --


of the indirectly owned United States entity, how could


they be offended by our doing the same?


MR. PADEN:  My sense is that the Congress'


concern about sensitivities was -- was a little different


than that.  I don't think the notion was offense at being


sued.  I think the notion is that foreign States would


have a -- an -- a -- an interest, potentially -- not in


every single case, but potentially significant interest in


the manner and treatment of claims against entities


that -- that they owned.  They may have --


QUESTION: 


Is your point that there are no other 

countries that have our dual Federal system with State


courts and Federal courts, so you're not urging that


there's substantive sovereign immunity.  You're saying, on


the jurisdiction side, you should have a right, or


Congress meant to give you a right to have access to


Federal court rather than State court.


MR. PADEN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


There -- there are cases, but I think they're quite rare,


where a commercial entity might actually be able to


contend that it has immunity, but for the most part,

Congress was thinking --


QUESTION:  Are you contending that here?


MR. PADEN:  Well, we've pled it in our answer,


Your Honor, but the issue has -- has not been crossed in


this particular case, because the judge in -- in the


district court held that we weren't even a foreign State,


so the question didn't even arise.


There are -- whether or not an entity is immune,


of course, if it is a foreign State, depends upon whether


one of the exceptions in the statute applies, and the


commercial activity exception requires direct effects on


the United States, and so forth.  There's -- there are


issues of treaty waivers, there are a number of issues --


QUESTION:  For purposes of your argument now,


can we assume that you are not claiming the substantive 

immunity and the question is a forum question, whether you


can have access to a Federal forum?


MR. PADEN:  I think you can assume that, Your


Honor, but I think --


QUESTION:  Counsel for -- I'm just not sure we


ever get to this question.  This statute, the foreign


sovereign immunity statute is written in the present


tense.  It talks about an entity that is a separate legal


person, and a majority of whose shares or other ownership


interest is owned by a foreign State, and when the action

was filed, there was no such ownership, so how do we even


get to the first question?


MR. PADEN:  We get to the first question, Your


Honor, because the use of the present tense does not


clearly indicate the point in time at which the present


tense exists.  This statute uses the present tense in many


circumstances in some of the subsequent provisions that


discuss immunity to discuss actions that clearly took


place at the time the events arose.


QUESTION:  Well, what do we do with diversity


jurisdiction?  Supposing a person -- supposing diversity


jurisdiction exists at the time the suit is filed, but by


the time it gets up on appeal, it does not?


MR. PADEN:  I don't -- the font, the


jurisdictional font of this statute, Your Honor is not 

diversity, it's Federal question.  This --


QUESTION:  No, but I -- I would like to know


just for purposes of analogy, the -- when something exists


at the time the suit is filed, but is lost during its


process.


MR. PADEN:  I think that's going to have to be


an issue that is decided in -- in cases as they develop. 


There have been some cases where entities were privatized


during the course of litigations, and courts, I believe,


have consistently held that in that case, the immunity --

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act jurisdictional


premise is not lost because it existed at the time of the


claim.


The preponderant case law here, Your Honor, has


been to look either to the time of the acts that gave rise


to the claim, or to the time of the filing of the suit,


and there's a -- a nice opinion by Judge Kaplan in the


Southern District, in -- in the Belgrade case, which kind


of synthesizes those cases.


We -- the -- in the jurisdictional determination


under this statute, the way it's structured, a court very


frequently has to look at the acts giving rise to the


claim in order even to decide if it has jurisdiction,


because, as Your Honor will recall, in section 1330,


jurisdiction depends upon a determination, a) that a party 

is a foreign State, and b) that one of the exceptions


applies, and most of those exceptions require an


examination, whether or not the acts that gave rise to the


claim were commercial in nature, where they took place, so


that the -- it's not at all unusual in the context of this


statute to say that the actions that gave rise to the


claim are the point of reference for the jurisdictional


determination.


QUESTION:  Why -- why would we do that?  If


we -- if we took your view, there are quite a few

jurisdictional statutes, I guess, which talk about action


against a foreign State.  Wouldn't we then have to read


all those to say they mean actions against a former


foreign State, so if you sued Illyria or Bohemia, you


would suddenly discover you could get into Federal court,


while if you don't take your -- your approach, you'd say


the -- the question of -- that you're worried about will


arise when they get to the substance of the issue in the


State court.


MR. PADEN:  Your Honor, we think that looking at


the time of the events that gave rise to the claim is the


approach that most closely comports with the policies and


purposes behind this act.


What Congress was sensitive about is when the


actions of foreign State instrumentalities are called 

before the courts of the United States to be adjudicated,


and Congress indicated that there were sensitivities in


those situations that -- should be respected by according


a broad right to hear in court --


QUESTION:  What's -- what's the sensitivity if


somebody decides to sue Czarist Russia?


MR. PADEN:  Well, there's probably a statute of


limitations claims on that, Your Honor, but I think the


question is whether the -- whether the acts that gave rise


to the claim are at issue in the case, and I don't think

it's difficult to imagine --


QUESTION:  You know, there -- I -- I just don't


agree with you that that's -- that's the policy of the


United States.  There -- apart from who can get into


Federal court, there -- there is in Federal law a thing


called the Act of State Doctrine under which we will -- we


will honor and accept the action of a foreign country


conducted within its own borders and will not allow that


to be challenged in a suit in the United States.  It's


a -- it's a longstanding doctrine, and yet we do --


certainly do not say that any time an act of State is


involved in a piece of litigation, there's Federal


jurisdiction.


This act doesn't seek to do that.  It seems to


me the Federal jurisdiction has nothing to do with whether 

the actions of a foreign State are the -- are the subject


matter of the litigation, but rather whether the foreign


State is a party to the litigation.


MR. PADEN:  Well, Your Honor, except for Judge


Kozinski below, every circuit court that has looked at


this and looked at the legislative history has concluded,


as did the ABA working group, which recently did an


extensive study of this statute, and that group was made


up of prominent international relations professors and


practitioners, that actions of foreign States remain

potentially politically sensitive even after an entity is


sold.


The potential here is the point.  This is kind


of a prophylactic statute.  I don't think anybody's saying


that in each and every case, there will be intense foreign


relations issues, but I -- for example, the foreign State


may very well have ongoing financial obligations for


pre-privatization acts.  That's the case with one of the


amici before the Court today in the State of France.


QUESTION:  Mr. Paden, if you would look


particularly to the diversity statute, and now there's


a -- a provision that expressly deals with a foreign


State, everything else in diversity, you would agree, it


depends on the time suit was brought, and so if you moved


in the interim -- there was diversity when it happened, 

but you move in the interim, when the complaint is filed


there's no more diversity.


I take it you're asking us, within the very same


statute, 1332(a), to interpret a foreign State differently


so that its nationality at the time of suit doesn't count,


only at the time of the act, and that would be anomalous


within very same provision, 1332(a), that you would treat


one one way, citizens of different States, that has to be


as of the time the complaint is filed, but a foreign State


only at the time the event occurred.

 MR. PADEN:  Well, two responses, if I may. 


First of all, we're not suggesting that it should only be


the time of the events that gave rise to the claim.  We


believe the appropriate rule is the rule expressed in the


consensus of case law today, that it would be either the


time the claim was filed, or the time of the acts.


But your question about section -- section 1330


is -- is a very good question.


QUESTION:  It was 1332 I'm --


MR. PADEN:  1332, that refers to claims by


foreign States.  When a foreign State entity is -- is a


plaintiff and chooses to come to this Court.


The -- the statute that we're alluding to is


when -- when people are trying to assert claims against


these entities and -- and bring them into court and have 

their actions adjudicated in courts that the State --


QUESTION:  So you're saying in court -- to be a


plaintiff, the foreign State would have to be -- it would


have to be a foreign entity at the time suit was brought?


MR. PADEN:  The instrumentality has a choice


whether or not to come to court in that circumstance, Your


Honor, and invoke -- and -- and --


QUESTION:  It's not a question of whether it --


it chooses to.  It -- does it have access?


MR. PADEN:  The -- the --

 QUESTION:  In other words, does it have to


qualify as a foreign instrumentality when it brings the


suit?


MR. PADEN:  I don't think --


QUESTION:  Suppose it's been privatized.  Can it


come into Federal court and say, we were at the time of


this incident that we're suing about?


MR. PADEN:  I believe that if the acts at -- at


stake took place at the time it was a foreign sovereign,


it should be able to do that, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Those are -- then you are


interpreting within the very same statute a citizen of a


State would be treated one way, or a -- a -- an entity


that was once a foreign State but is no longer would be


treated another way?


MR. PADEN:  That's correct.  I think the


question -- whether or not an entity is a foreign State,


the analysis is the same, but for purposes of when that


analysis is pertinent, it may be different.  It may be


different when we're talking about what -- the rules about


execution of judgments than at the time of filing a claim.


The -- the opposite rule, we think, leads to


greater anomalies.  Under the opposite rule, you --


there's a very clear prospect.  There's almost an


inevitability that liabilities attributable to acts of

State instrumentalities are going to be adjudicated


outside the structure and protections of this act.  State


court juries all around the country will be sitting in


judgment on acts of State-owned entities, and that is


fundamentally contrary to what Congress wanted to -- to


have happen.


In this very case I think we -- we posed a


hypothetical that, if we just change the facts


significantly but slightly, if -- if Dead Sea Bromine was


the sole manufacturer of the toxic, the pesticide at issue


in this case, and if Dead Sea Bromine, the acts of a -- an


instrumentality of the State of Israel, closely monitored


and overseen through the Government company's law


structure, have been alleged to be the sole manufacturer


of this product, the man -- the party that sought and 

obtained approvals through, as alleged in the complaint,


not being entirely candid about known health risks, had


knowingly marketed it in the Third World, had been --


whose actions had been called appalling by Senator Leahy


in a public hearing, if that entity was on trial before a


lot of different juries in various parts of Texas and


Louisiana, being called up as a Israeli chemical company


who had done all these things, I think it's not at all


difficult to imagine that the State of Israel might have


some interest in that case.

 QUESTION:  Well, you've made another significant


change, because it wasn't the plaintiffs who brought the


Israeli corporations into this action.  The plaintiffs


sued Dole, I thought, and Dole impleaded the Israeli


company.


MR. PADEN:  That's definitely true, Your Honor,


but I'm simply trying to show that there could be a


hypothetical situation that's not entirely far-fetched,


where -- where a State's ongoing interest in litigation


against an entity for acts that took place when the State


had responsibility for it in the sense that it owned it,


were at stake.


QUESTION:  Well, but if the State gives up the


corporation, and no longer is part of it, I would have


thought that that's just one of the risks that they'd have 

to run.  Why -- why -- I mean, they -- if they want -- if


they're worried about it, keep control of the corporation. 


If you're not that worried about it, then when you release


the corporation, you're subject to a lot of State court


lawsuits.  Is that -- why is that --


MR. PADEN:  Well --


QUESTION:  I can't get much of a feeling one way


or the other about that, to tell you the truth.  I --


I don't -- can you say something that will make it quite


clear that would be a terrible thing?

 MR. PADEN:  That's clearly a policy judgment,


and what we're left with is this -- the wording of the


statute and the purposes and policies that lay behind it,


and we think that with that information before us,


Congress' concern about the risk and the sensitivities


both in terms of uniform -- the desirability for uniform


decisions and potential risks and bias that can take place


in multifarious State court juries, those were to be not


present when we were going to allow claims to go forward


against State entities, and where the acts at issue are


the acts of the State entity, those same interests would


seem to be implicated.


Many States -- privatization, of course, is a


fairly widespread phenomenon in the last decade, and what


happened to our client has happened to many formerly State 

majority-owned entities.


QUESTION:  And a lot of those tort claims are


going to be for continuing actions, so in your view, if


the chemical is disseminated partly while the State is the


owner of the company and partly while it isn't, then what


happens?


MR. PADEN:  If -- so long as within the


allegations of the complaint, actions of a foreign State


instrumentality are at stake, then it should be within the


claim.

 Your Honor, this case poses an even, I think


more stark example.  As -- as noted by the court below,


this particular litigation is, I think in Judge Kozinski's


words, one part of a large broadbased litigation, I think


he used the word war.


The Delgado case out of the Fifth Circuit was --


it arose out of cases that began in 1994 in Texas, based


on the same claims, based upon the same structure of


parties, and at that time we were majority-owned by


Israel, so under the rule propounded by the respondents


and the Solicitor General there would be Federal


jurisdiction over the -- that part of the cases, but if


someone waited to sue until later, there wouldn't be. 


I think Credit Lyonnais seems to be in the same position,


based upon the -- the information in the -- in the amicus 

brief.


QUESTION:  Mr. Paden, because --


QUESTION:  I have one -- one small procedural


question.  Why is Dole properly before us?  I want to make


you feel welcome here, but --


[Laughter.]


MR. PADEN:  I do, Your Honor.

the Dead Sea Companies, and they're the ones --

Federal court over this case and the jurisdiction of the


Federal court will be established if our position is


established, and to this extent, we have a common interest


in this case, apart from --


QUESTION:  Did you -- did you join in removing,


or did Dole file the removal petition?


MR. PADEN:  We filed the removal petition, Your


Honor.  I believe that Dole filed a supplemental removal


petition on different grounds alleging Federal question 

jurisdiction, which --


QUESTION:  Right.  That's how it got up to the


Ninth Circuit.


QUESTION:  Yes, and -- and Dole was dismissed on


that -- on that ground, and that hasn't been appealed.


MR. PADEN:  Correct.  That's --


QUESTION:  That -- that hasn't been brought --

QUESTION:  And is there diverse -- there's no


diversity because there isn't complete diversity?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. MASSEY


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. MASSEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


I'd like to begin with the first question


presented.  Owning shares of stock in a parent corporation


in our view should not be equated with owning shares in


the subsidiary.  I'd like to deal with the text of the


act, the structure, and its purposes, beginning with the 

distinctive text of 1603(b)(2), which, as Justice Ginsburg


noted, does not refer to ownership in the abstract, it


refers to a special legal kind of ownership.  It says, a


majority of shares or other ownership interests and, in


using that familiar phraseology of corporate law, it's


borrowing something which is related to the Meyer opinion,


I think, that Justice Breyer delivered this morning, the


notion that there's a degree of separateness between a


corporation and a shareholder.  That case, as we heard it,


turned on the liabilities that the shareholder would not

bare --


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what is the phrase that


you say is familiar from corporate law?


MR. MASSEY:  Well, the concept of a majority of


shares. 


concept?


QUESTION:  Are you talking about a phrase, or a


MR. MASSEY:  Well, the phrase in particular,


Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. MASSEY:  The -- as -- I'm sorry, the


concept.


QUESTION:  So you're not saying that the phrase,


shares or other ownership interest, is a familiar


phrase --


MR. MASSEY:  Phrase -- no, Your Honor, I'm


saying it's a concept, the concept of what it means to own


a majority of shares in a corporation and, in particular,


1603(b)(2) is written from the perspective of the


subsidiary.  It's written from a bottom-up perspective,


rather than a top-down perspective, and it asks, from the


subsidiary's perspective, who owns the majority of its


shares and it is, in our view, the corporate entity which


sits directly atop the subsidiary, rather than the foreign


State, which may stand several tiers removed.

 It's sort of telling that in the Dead Sea


Company's own corporate disclosure statement, they list as


their -- as the owner of Dead Sea -- Israel Chemicals


Limited, which is the company which sits directly above


Dead Sea Bromine.  The corporate disclosure statement then


goes on to say that Israel Chemicals Limited is, in turn,


held by another company, which is the Israel Corporation,


and it doesn't claim that the Israel -- it doesn't state


that the Israel Corporation is the owner of Dead Sea


Bromine.  That's just the natural way we talk about it in


the -- in the -- especially in the corporate law realm,


which Congress was adopting in 16(b) -- 1603(b)(2).


There are several textual clues in section 1603


that Congress was adopting the principle of corporate


separateness. 


1603(b)(1) requires that a corporation 

be -- a -- a showing that the agency be a separate legal


person.


1610(b), which governs attachments, limits


attachments of property to claims against the particular


agency or instrumentality against whom the claim is


raised, and this Court, in the First National Citibank


case, held that the -- under the FSIA, the -- the property


and assets of a foreign-owned corporation are distinct


from the property and assets of the foreign State itself,


so this is not even a case like Bestfoods, where this

Court said that Congress' silence was audible in -- in


that Congress was legislating against these background


corporate law principles.  Here, there are quite clear


textual signs that Congress was adopting a principle of


corporate law.


Now, the primary argument on the other side,


this is a -- the indirect shareholding is a form of other


ownership interest, and I -- we think that is not a proper


reading of this statute.  As Justice Kennedy pointed out,


there are other forms of ownership interests in the world. 


There are shares in an oil venture.  The Tennessee Valley


Authority, for example, doesn't have stock.  The Federal


Government simply owns it.  The stock has been retired.


Congress was dealing here with foreign legal


systems which may have different ways of framing equity 

interests.  Socialist countries, for example, you can


imagine there might not be shares, so in our view the


phrase, other ownership interests, is meant to take into


account those sorts of equity holdings, so in this case --


QUESTION:  Because?  Because?


MR. MASSEY:  Well, because Congress was dealing


with other foreign owners, other --


QUESTION:  You know, I mean --


MR. MASSEY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- nobody doubts that there are other

ways of owning corporations.  They're just saying, one


other way of owning it is like, under the Public Utility


Holding Company Act, you have a -- a pyramid of shares


with intervening corporations.  They're not saying that's


the only other way.  They're saying that's one other way,


and then you say, no, that one other way is not another


way, because?


MR. MASSEY:  Because there -- we believe it's --


there are two reasons, primarily.  First, is -- the first


part of the phrase, shares, already takes care of stock. 


It would be unreasonable, in our view, to say indirect


stock counts as other --


QUESTION:  Because?


MR. MASSEY:  Because stock is not an other kind


of interest.


QUESTION:  Because?


MR. MASSEY:  Because it's already been listed --


QUESTION:  No -- nobody's saying stock is.


MR. MASSEY:  Sure.


QUESTION:  What they're saying is, stock in


intervening corporations organized in certain ways --


MR. MASSEY:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- as under the Public Utility


Holding Company Act, is one other way, and I still haven't


heard the word -- you see, that's why I keep asking,

because.


MR. MASSEY:  Right.


QUESTION:  Because to me it's an unusual way,


not that unusual.  The -- the law books are filled with


cases involving that, under the act I cited, and -- and so


they say, that's one way.


MR. MASSEY:  That --


QUESTION:  Now I want to know why that isn't one


way.


MR. MASSEY:  Because it --


QUESTION:  One other way.


MR. MASSEY:  Right.  First, because it's still


stock.  Even if it's indirectly held, it's still stock.


QUESTION:  And I don't quite see that,


because --


MR. MASSEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  Go ahead.


MR. MASSEY:  Okay, and then second is, you're


absolutely right, the law books are filled, the U.S. Code


is filled with many other phrasings of direct, indirect


references to affiliates, references to beneficial


ownership, all the kinds of things, a control test, as


Justice Stevens mentioned, all the kinds of things that


could capture this kind of interest, but instead we have


the very distinctive phrasing that says, stock, and in our

view, once you count stock first as a direct majority


ownership, you shouldn't go back and count it again as an


indirect form.


QUESTION:  Now --


MR. MASSEY:  The other ought to be reserved --


QUESTION: 

-- I know that's your -- your view.


MR. MASSEY:  I know.  I know.


QUESTION:  Now -- but let me push the because --


MR. MASSEY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- one step further.  Suppose I


thought that the word, other ownership interest, is at


least open to this unusual type of arrangement as one form


of ownership interest.


MR. MASSEY:  Right.


QUESTION: 


Still you should say, you shouldn't 

interpret it that way, because?


MR. MASSEY:  Because the number of principles


that animate the statute, first, this is a jurisdictional


statute.  Jurisdictional statutes should be construed


precisely with clear, bright line rules and, in our view,


the -- the kind of direct legal ownership of stock is a


kind of bright line rule and the Court should not depart


from it.


Second, the statute already contains, in the


first clause of 1603(b)(3), the -- the so-called Oregon

test.  The Oregon test captures governmental entities


which perform sovereign functions which are staffed by


Government employees over which the Government has a


significant degree of control.  That's not at issue in


this case.  That was decided both by -- in both courts


below adverse to the petitioners, and it's not before this


Court, but that clause would capture all of the


stereotypical cases at the heart of the Foreign Sovereign


Immunities Act, so we ought not stretch this part of the


statute to cover it.


QUESTION:  All right, now if I think it is not a


stretch, but just another form of ownership --


MR. MASSEY:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- I'm putting this hypothetically --


MR. MASSEY:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- I then go on to think, you know,


I cannot think of a reason in the world, not even one, not


even a shadow of one, as to why Congress would have wanted


to say, when country X owns business A, it gets into


Federal court, but when everything is the same, but for a


stack of papers this thick which puts a bunch of


intervening paper corporations between A and Z, it doesn't


want it to get into Federal court, I think what could


they -- what human being could possibly think of any


conceivable reason for drawing that difference, and at

that point -- I'm putting it as strongly as I can --


I come up with a blank.  I can't think of one.


I used to have relatives who had little tiny


corporations, and the number in between was a matter of


tax law or something.  It was the same person sitting at


the same desk --


MR. MASSEY:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- doing the same thing.


MR. MASSEY:  Right.


QUESTION:  Now, I put it as strongly as I can.


MR. MASSEY:  Right, and of course Congress is --


Congress has to legislate by category.  It's not simply


dealing with the example of 100 percent subsidiaries. 


Congress is drawing a general rule and, as a general rule,


the -- the line it drew was reasonable because Congress 

was interested in facilitating suits against foreign


States in the United States courts.  That's one of the


purposes that's laid out in 1602 in the statute, and


reading the statute the petitioners' way would disserve


those purposes.


First, it would impose important procedural


burdens on litigants that Congress did not want to impose. 


It would eliminate traditional State long arm statutes. 


It would eliminate the right to jury trial.  It would


create immunity questions, because once immunity is

invoked --


QUESTION:  Why -- why would it eliminate the


right to jury trial?


MR. MASSEY:  Well, under the FSIA, once a --


a -- an entity is deemed to be a foreign State, the right


to jury trial is lost, even if an exception to immunity is


subsequently found to apply.


It would -- the -- the other burdens it imposes,


it eliminates the traditional attachment provision


that's --


QUESTION:  Of course it does have a few -- but


nonetheless my question is, what conceivable reason could


there be for saying those special advantages disappear


when there is country A, and when there is country A to Z,


since the only difference between A and A to Z, I'd 

repeat, is a bunch of paper?


MR. MASSEY:  Well, again, as I said, Congress is


not just legislating with that specific example of


100 percent subsidiaries, it's using a -- the general


category.  It -- it has to operate by general rule.


I think other examples, though, would show that


when you have multiple tiers, there -- the surprise factor


significantly increases.  Congress was concerned that


litigants would be surprised to discover that they were


not dealing with an ordinary commercial entity but,

rather, a foreign State, and that surprise factor


increases as you go down the corporate tier to the nth


tier.


Also, there are potentially complex factual


inquiries as you go down the -- a -- a tier.  In this


case, there are organization charts which show how the


shareholdings have been computed, but consider, when


ownership is not expressed through shares but through some


percentage of assets or partnership interests which are


not going to be reflected in a shareholder ledger, but are


going to be the potential subject of controversy in a


court, and I think the potential for factual disputes


increases.


QUESTION:  Mr. Massey --


MR. MASSEY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- we're trying to find out, not


was -- what Congress did was reasonable --


MR. MASSEY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- but what did Congress do.


MR. MASSEY:  Of course.


QUESTION:  Of course if it -- what it did was


reasonable, that -- nobody would doubt that that would be


fine, and in determining what -- what Congress did, the


petitioners pointed to a number of statutes that use the


word, directly, when they meant to cut out the

subsidiaries.


MR. MASSEY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  They say, shares, or -- or a company


directly owned by, and this statute is silent.  It doesn't


say, directly owned.


MR. MASSEY:  That -- that's -- that's correct,


Your Honor.  In our view, Congress didn't have to use


directly, because it was using this familiar corporate


concept of a majority ownership of shares.  That implies


direct, because the owner of a majority of shares in -- in


this tiering relationship is the corporation immediately


above the subsidiary, it's not --


QUESTION:  Is there any context in which we have


held that a majority ownership of shares, that -- that


phrase is satisfied by -- by second-tier ownership? 

MR. MASSEY:  Where this Court has held it?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. MASSEY:  I'm -- I'm not aware of any -- of


any case, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Do you plan to address the other


question --


MR. MASSEY:  Yes.

MR. MASSEY:  Yes, Your Honor.  Let me do that


right now, because I think the timing question is -- is a

independent way of resolving this case.


Ever since 1824, when Chief Justice Marshall


announced Mollan against Torrance, the rule has been that


jurisdiction is determined as of the date of filing the


complaint.  The Chief Justice asked, what is the rule in


diversity cases?  Well, since Anderson and Watt in 1891,


diversity cases have been held to be -- to be governed by


that rule, and the response we hear is that this is a


Federal question case, but, of course, even Federal


question cases are governed by the familiar rule that the


date is given by the -- the filing of the complaint. 


That's -- United States against Keene Corporation in 1993


reflected that principle.


And as Justice Ginsburg noted, even if some


parts of the act are a Federal question, it's also telling 

that in 1332(a)(4), Congress created a new species of


diversity jurisdiction, so accepting the petitioners'


argument here would lead to the anomalous situation where


there's a diversity part of the statute that's going to be


governed by the Mollan against Torrance rule, and there


will be a Federal question part of the statute that would


be governed by a different rule.


QUESTION:  Mr. Paden said that that (a)(4) would


be interpreted by the different rule, so he's being


consistent with --

 MR. MASSEY:  Okay -- well, I misunderstood. 


I apologize, but then that also means that there are some


diversity rules that are being interpreted one way, and


other diversity rules being interpreted a different way. 


Either way, there's an anomaly, and it appears to us the


simplest way to resolve it would simply be to adhere to


the longstanding principle that the date on which the


complaint is filed is the relevant time to take a


snapshot.


That's also more administratively feasible,


because you can imagine that the rule of when the


underlying conduct occurred is a -- is a -- might be


difficult to determine in some cases.  In this --


QUESTION:  Or it might also extend over a


considerable period of time.


MR. MASSEY:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


I agree completely.


And so it's -- it's more reasonable to assume


Congress was legislating against the background


understanding that the date of filing of the complaint


would be determinative.  It used the present tense in


1603.  In 1441(d), which is the removal provision at issue


here, it talked about a case against a foreign State, and


in our view, it's more reasonable, it's more naturally


read to think that a case is a case against a foreign

State only if the entity actually is a foreign State at


the time, as opposed to being Czarist Russia.


1608, which is the special service provision,


also indicates that Congress is contemplating entities


that actually were foreign States, because --


QUESTION:  Well, their point, though, is that,


first my examples were slightly absurd, and -- which they


were -- and secondly, that in any real case where -- where


you have, say, Communist Russia you're suing, or -- or


more recent former States, you're -- you're actually suing


the State, and the -- the defense is, but that State no


longer exists, like Bosnia or something.


There are a few things that are more involved in


foreign relationships, and -- and boy, to suddenly throw


that to 50 State courts is a total nightmare if you're 

really worried about the foreign State, so even though it


creates differences between the diversity jurisdiction and


the other, we better keep these in Federal court, or we're


all in trouble.  I mean, that's what I took them to say.


MR. MASSEY:  Right.  Well, I think the -- the


answer to the jurisdiction point and the sort of State


court point is that they're already is a provision in the


diversity statute, 1332(a)(3), I believe it is, that deals


with citizens of foreign countries, so there's already


diversity jurisdiction for suits against foreign

corporations after they've been privatized.  They would be


able -- any claim against the Government would be


protected by the act of State doctrine, as Justice Scalia


noted.  There could be no -- of course, no direct


liability imposed --


QUESTION:  It works all right with the


corporations, but what if you're actually suing the State,


which still has some assets somewhere?  How does that


work?


MR. MASSEY:  Well, that, of course, isn't --


that's not going to be before this Court today, but --


QUESTION:  Oh, no, but if we go into the foreign


State, former foreign States don't count, we've decided


that, and so I -- just curious.  I don't want to do it


blindly.


MR. MASSEY:  Well, no, I'm -- we're not asking


you to decide anything about -- about former foreign


States.  I think --


QUESTION:  Is there a reading that -- that


throws out the corporation that used to be owned but now


isn't by a foreign State, but keeps the former foreign


State within?


MR. MASSEY:  Well, the -- the whole immunity


that foreign States enjoy is governed by 1604 and 1605,


and -- and the provision that we're focusing here is -- is

just the definition of agency and instrumentality, so I --


I think this Court could safely leave for another day the


issue of the former foreign State.  It -- it's not at


the -- it's not in the provision that we are asking this


Court to interpret, and -- and it's governed by different


provisions which Your Honors could -- could leave for


another day.


QUESTION:  Mr. Massey, practically, is it so in


these litigations that if you can't remove to the Federal


court, the State courts keep them and try them, whereas if


you remove them to the Federal court, they are then


dismissed on forum nonconvenience?


MR. MASSEY:  Well, it's -- undoubtedly the forum


nonconvenience defense would be raised in State court as


well. 


In this case, the -- no proceedings of any 

substance have occurred, so nobody --


QUESTION:  But in this category of case --


MR. MASSEY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- is that the general pattern?


MR. MASSEY:  That is the -- yes, that's the


general pattern.  It's -- that's correct and, of course,


I think there would also be an immunity asserted.  The


Dead Sea petitioners have preserved that.  It's in joint


appendix 57, and -- and the -- the issue of whether they


would be entitled to immunity, or whether the commercial

QUESTION:  When was the Foreign Sovereign


Immunities Act passed?


MR. MASSEY:  1976, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  We presumably lived, then, for 200


years without it, these cases being tried in State court?


MR. MASSEY:  That's correct, Your Honor.  The --


the -- under the -- the prevailing doctrine of the


separate entity rule, any separate unit or corporation was


not entitled to immunity, that's correct, and it was


governed by, after 1952 the Tate letter, which the --


which the State Department issue didn't -- this Court has


described the procedural history in Verlinden, but you're


absolutely correct, Your Honor.


I -- I think that in the -- at the end of the


day, what -- what is at issue here is a statute which


Congress adapted in 1602, set outting out -- setting out


the purposes to facilitate suits against foreign entities,


and also, as Justice Scalia noted, it referred to


principles of international law in 1602, and here,


we're -- the petitioners are asking this Court to


aggravate the difference between U.S. law and the law of


every other country.


These petitioners do not receive immunity even

about State courts and juries could be addressed through


other provisions which enact -- which are enacted in the

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Massey.


Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS


MR. MINEAR:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Congress enacted the FSIA against the backdrop


of venerable corporate law principles, including the 

principle that a parent corporation and subsidiary are


distinct, and that the shareholders of a parent


corporation are not the shareholders of a subsidiary


corporation.  We submit that the FSIA refers to share


ownership in that familiar legal sense.


Viewed in that light, a foreign State's majority


ownership of the shares of a parent gives the foreign


State control over the subsidiary, but it does not give


that foreign State ownership of the subsidiary's shares. 


If Congress had intended that the FSIA would extend agency

or instrumentality status to the foreign State's control


of the subsidiary, it could easily have said exactly that.


QUESTION:  Well, they don't think of these


things all the time, so -- so what -- what about -- they


just don't.  It's -- and that's -- we have -- that's why


we have a difficult problem, so I wondered, with the


language, and nobody accepts -- I just want to know the


reason for this, and I'm sure it's not a tenable


interpretation, because nobody's advanced it, but if you


look at the first part, literally speaking, it says a


foreign State includes an instrumentality of a foreign


State, and so an instrumentality of a foreign State, is,


among other things, a corporation, the majority of shares


of which the foreign state owns.  And that's true as to


the first corporation in the tier, A.  Well, now, since A


is included in the term, foreign State, it therefore is a


foreign State.  That's what it says.  And therefore, B is


a company whose shares, the majority of which are owned by


a foreign State, and so forth down the line.


Now, literally, that's what it says, and so


what's wrong if I can't think of any reason why they'd


want a difference, and the -- that language literally


covers it, what's wrong with that?


MR. MINEAR:  There's a very strong textual


indication that that's not a correct reading, and that is

found in section 1603(b)(2), where it speaks of a majority


of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by


the foreign State, or political subdivision thereof.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. MINEAR:  Now, obviously, if Congress had


intended that recursive use that you've described, they


would not have included, political subdivision thereof,


which is also a part of a foreign State and, in fact, that


provision excludes agency or instrumentality.


We think what the Court can draw from this is


that Congress was using foreign State in a very strict


sense of simply a foreign nation.


QUESTION:  Or -- but you're referring there back


to the intent of Congress.  I see that linguistic point,


but if we're referring back to the intent of Congress, I'm 

back to my question I asked before, what possible intent


of Congress could the interpretation that you advance


further?  I mean, what reason is there?  The same


questions I asked before.  I'm just --


MR. MINEAR:  We think --


QUESTION:  -- you've got me back to that because


of your response, which referred to the intent of


Congress.


MR. MINEAR:  We think there are two very clear


reasons.  First of all, Congress was drawing a bright


45

line.  We think that Congress wanted to avoid litigation


over where to litigate.  Nothing's more wasteful than


that -- and by doing so it spoke to ownership of majority


of shares in the traditional legal sense, which provides a


very bright line rule.


We also think that this -- this reading must


be -- must take into account that we're not speaking


solely of the interest of foreign nations, but also of the


interest of American litigants.  Congress was trying to


strike a balance between the two, and the balance that we


suggest here is one that recognizes that American


litigants have an interest in a clear delineation of who


is entitled to foreign sovereign status and who is not. 


We think our interpretation reflects both of those


concerns.


QUESTION:  But the statute does refer to other


ownership interests.


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, it --


QUESTION:  Other forms of ownership.  What does


that cover, then?


MR. MINEAR:  Again, Your Honor, we think that it


ought to be -- that this term ought to be interpreted in


terms of a -- a test that provides a bright line rule.  We


think other ownership interest refers to something that is


an alternative to shares, such as, as Justice Kennedy has

described in ownership in -- in a joint venture.


We don't think that Congress intended to


complicate the inquiry by making inquiries into whether


something that is sometimes described as control should be


treated as a different type of ownership interest.  We


think that here, that what Congress was seeking was


clarity, and the interpretation that we're providing is


designed to provide that clarity for foreign nations and


for American litigants as well.


Now, we think it's important to remember that


Congress drew this line with the understanding that


foreign instrumentalities is a narrow term, particularly


as used by foreign nations.  Foreign nations by and large


would not provide immunity to corporations.  We believe


that Congress took the step of extending it to a 

first-tier corporation, but concluded that that is where


the line should be drawn, it should go no further, and we


think a narrow construction of this term is also


appropriate in -- in the face of the fact that Congress is


granting a special privilege, a comity-based privileged,


that not ought to be extended beyond what other foreign


nations recognize in applying their immunity laws to the


United States.


This is particularly so when the construction


that we urge is very unlikely to lead to foreign friction

with other nations.  Because, as -- because foreign


nations do not recognize the immunity that's being sought


here in their own courts, it's very unlikely that they


will object to our recognition of nonimmunity on the same


basis in our courts.


Now, even if this Court concluded that the FSIA


granted agency or instrumentality status to subsidiaries,


the Dead Sea companies would still not qualify because, as


noted before, they did -- did not have that status at the


time that this suit was brought.  We think that the


diversity statute model provides the appropriate test


here.


Diversity jurisdiction is predicated on whether


or not the parties are diverse at the time the suit is


brought. 


It's based on the status of the parties. 

Likewise, jurisdiction that is based on the status of a


foreign entity ought to be determined at the foreign


ownership's --

easily construct a serious problem, or you may have looked


into it in telling me it just isn't a problem, and I'd


like to hear you say that, if that's so, because it would


help.


MR. MINEAR: 


We think it's unlikely to be a 

problem.  I cannot say that we -- we can -- can certify


that this problem would never arise, but typically, these


types of suits are brought against another State that now


stands in the shoes of the former State, and there might


be interesting questions of law with regard to the


liability of that suit, but they may never be reached


because in that case, the suit is being brought --


QUESTION:  Okay, so you're telling me, and


you've looked into it, this isn't really a problem, it's


theoretical, not real?

 MR. MINEAR:  We think it is primarily a


theoretical problem.


We think that Congress had no compelling reasons


to provide immunity for past agencies and


instrumentalities that are no longer associated with the


foreign -- foreign State.  As Justice Scalia pointed out,


there's other mechanisms, such as the Act of State


Doctrine, that provide protection of the foreign sovereign


interests in those cases and, in any event, a foreign


corporation, even after it has become privatized, still


has access to Federal court jurisdiction under the


alienage diversity statute, provided that it satisfies


the -- the requirements that Congress has set forth.


Finally, I'd like to note that because two


questions are presented here, the Court does have 

discretion to reach both of those questions, and we think


that there would be an advantage in clarity in the law if


the Court did address both the so-called tiering question


and the timing question, since they both have led to


disputes among litigants in the lower courts.  They --


both issues have been fully briefed and, as I say, the


Court does have that power to make that determination if


it so chooses.


QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, I don't understand how


the Act of State Doctrine would apply to sales of Israel

First, with respect to the phrase, ownership


interest, Mr. Massey suggested that the issues here, and


I believe Mr. Minear as well, are related to the issues in


the recently decided Meyer case, with which I confess I'm


not familiar, but I think also the Bestfoods kind of case.


We think those cases are very different.  Those


cases relate to liability-creating statutes and, in the

context of a statute that creates liability, whether


Congress intended for traditional rules of corporate


veil-piercing to be eased somewhat in assigning liability


in the case of the Superfund law to the -- to the owner of


the contaminated facility.


This is not a statute that gives rise to


liability.  It defines a category of entities that are


within the scope of the -- of the group that Congress


intended to -- to vest with a certain limited protection


when they will be sued in -- in the United States, namely,


a broad right to a Federal forum, and so forth.


QUESTION:  We -- we have always construed


jurisdictional statutes quite narrowly, going all the way


back to Strawbridge against Curtis, that said you have to


have complete diversity under the diversity statute, and 

it seems to me you're asking for something different than


that here.


MR. PADEN:  I think, Your Honor, that the -- in


the first place, of course, the statute has to be


construed to the best one can on the words of the statute


and the congressional intent.  I think there is some


interesting language.  I -- I believe it's the Delta case


of the Sixth Circuit, or maybe the Texas Eastern case in


the Third Circuit -- talking about why, in the context of


this law, there actually should be a broad interpretation

of diversity.  Really, that's just another way of saying


because Congress intended to bring within it a certain


defined category of -- of entities.


I think it's very hard to -- to articulate a


reason why Congress would have wanted to bring commercial


operations of foreign States within the scope of the


statute and say -- let me back up a moment.


There was a time when Dead Sea Works was the


immediate parent of Dead Sea Bromine, and Dead Sea Works


was owned by the State of Israel.  Dead Sea Works' job is


to extract manganese and potassium from the Dead Sea. 


Dead Sea Bromine's job is to extract Dead -- bromine from


the Dead Sea.  It's impossible to come up with a rationale


why Congress wanted Dead Sea Works to be within the


purpose -- the purview of this statute and Dead Sea 

Bromine not to be.


QUESTION:  Well, they listed two.  They said,


first of all it's easier for the court not to have to go


through the morass of paper and try to figure out who owns


what where, and the second one is that, because it's less


surprising, at least the customers and others will know,


likely, who owns the company, and know it's the State. 


Those were their two responses.


MR. PADEN:  Correct.  I -- in terms of ownership


interest, I think it's -- it's a well-known and widely

used phrase in our law as well as others to be a generic


broadbased term.  We did a little research on some


publicly available information just to try to find


companies that I think we can say are well-known to be --


have certain relationships, and I think it's fair to say,


based on news articles and so forth, that General Electric


Company is widely understood to own NBC, the broadcasting


network.


It turns out that General Electric Company is


the 100 percent shareholder of a company called NBC


Holdings, Inc., which is the 100 percent shareholder of


NBC, Inc., the broadcasting company.  I think the chairman


of the board of GE would be astonished to hear the United


States and the respondents explain that GE does not have


an ownership interest in NBC.  It's --


QUESTION:  I think that was conceded, that for


purposes of newspapers reports, and -- yeah, we understand


that you would have five tiers down, if only one person


owns it, you say, well, that person owns it, even if it's


the fifth tier down, but the question is, in this context


of a jurisdictional statute -- and I wanted to ask you


particularly, you've just heard Mr. Minear's argument, do


we, as a Court, owe any special respect to what the


executive tells us a statute that deals in the foreign


affairs realm means?

 MR. PADEN:  Your Honor, I think in this case


that -- that we think that the respect that is owed to the


Justice and State Departments in this case is -- is


measured by the persuasiveness of the opinions that


they're offering.  Essentially, they're offering a legal


interpretation of the meaning of the statute and


congressional intent.


I don't think they've said that the


interpretation that we're offering here will impair or


jeopardize the conduct of our foreign relations.  In fact,


the only comment in their brief about this is to note that


there have not been frictions in foreign relations as a


result of the extant state of the law, and the extant


state of the law is really in our favor on both points.


There are a number of cases where privatized 

entities have been held to be agencies or


instrumentalities, and certainly where tiered entities


have been, so we think it really is a matter of an


analysis of the legal opinions about statutory


construction and -- and whether --


QUESTION:  But the -- the Government says you


are the one who's saying, oh, a foreigner might be


offended by the jury trial, whatever.


MR. PADEN:  We're trying to honor the intent of


Congress, Your Honor.  Congress --

 QUESTION:  And -- and the Government answers no,


that we don't think this is going to be disturbing foreign


nations.  You're the one who says that it will.


MR. PADEN:  I think what's salient is what


Congress said, Your Honor, and Congress said that when


claims are brought, when we are going to allow claims


against foreign State entities for their commercial


activities or whatever in this country, we're going to


accord them the kinds of -- the Federal jurisdiction


breadth and lack of jury trial which we accord to


ourselves when we agree to be sued.


QUESTION:  May I ask you what the purpose of


filing this lodging was, this gigantic paper?  Are we


supposed to read this to figure out what the corporate


relationships were, or what was the purpose? 

MR. PADEN:  Your Honor, that contains a lot of


very detailed material in support of the information that


we thought pertinent describing the particular structure


of the Government companies law and the legal regimes --


QUESTION:  But is this typical of what a


district judge would have to look through to figure out


ownership under your theory?


MR. PADEN:  No, sir.  It doesn't --


[Laughter.]


MR. PADEN:  -- not at all.  That had nothing

really to do with ownership.  We -- we actually originally


put that material in the record in support of our argument


that the company was an organ of the State of Israel


within the kind of emerging case law there, and what that


material shows is the extensive, detailed


interrelationship between the Government companies


authority in Israel.


They made decisions about whether or not the


company was going to have to use company cars, about


whether or not they were -- they made -- they made -- they


had input in the operation of this company to a minute


degree of detail and to, of course, very profound


decisions such as budget decisions, who would be on the


board of directors.


This company, under the Government companies 

law, a Government subsidiary company is treated, for all


intents and purpose the same, whether it's indirectly


held, as a Government company which is directly owned, and


it -- and this detailed material is really in support of


several pages in our brief where we -- where we provide


a -- a long paragraph with a series of examples of the


extent of the interrelationship between the Government of


Israel, the ministers of finance, the Government companies


authority, and so forth.
