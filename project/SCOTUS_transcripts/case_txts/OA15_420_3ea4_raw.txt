CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  15­420,  United  States  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bryant. 

            

Ms.  Prelogar. 

 

         

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ELIZABETH  B.  PRELOGAR 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Congress  enacted  Section  117  in  response  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  epidemic  of  domestic  violence  in  Indian  Country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Ninth  Circuit  was  wrong  to  strike  down  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  applied  to  offenders  like  Respondent  who  have  abused 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  battered  their  intimate  partners  again  and  again, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  whose  tribal­court  misdemeanor  convictions  were 

 

 

 

 

 

uncounseled  and  resulted  in  a  sentence  of  imprisonment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Ninth  Circuit's  constitutional  analysis 

 

 

 

 

disconnects  the  validity  of  the  underlying  prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  from  the  permissibility  of  relying  on  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions  to  prove  the  defendant's  recidivist  status 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  he  commits  additional  criminal  conduct.  And  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

runs  counter  to  this  Court's  precedence. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  Nichols  v.  United  States,  this  Court  held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  conviction  that  was  uncounseled  but  was  valid  at

the  time  it  was  obtained  remains  valid  when  it's  used  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  subsequent  prosecution  to  classify  the  defendant  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recidivist.  As  I  understand  the  Court's  logic  in  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

opinion,  the  rationale  was  that  in  the  absence  of  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  Sixth  Amendment  violation  in  the  underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding,  there's  no  proceeding  in  which  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  but  was  denied  a  right  to  counsel. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

He  didn't  ­­ he  has  a  right  to  counsel  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  subsequent  Federal  prosecution,  and  here,  Respondent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  that  right  and  it  was  respected.  He  was  ­­ he  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represented  by  appointed  counsel  at  every  critical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage.  But  when  a  defendant  doesn't  have  a  right  to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

counsel  in  the  prior  proceedings  that  resulted  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction,  then  there's  no  defect,  no  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defect  in  those  underlying  convictions  that  can  possibly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  carried  over  or  exacerbated  through  reliance  on  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions  in  the  subsequent  proceeding. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

Now,  the  Ninth  Circuit  reasoned,  and 

 

 

 

Respondent's  arguing  here,  that  that  might  apply  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  conviction  is  ­­ is  valid  under  the  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale  in  Scott.  There,  of  course,  the  Court  held 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  no  right  to  appointed  counsel  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding  that  doesn't  result  in  imprisonment.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent  urges  the  Court  to  limit  Nichols  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation,  where  you  have  a  defendant  who  ­­ who  wasn't

imprisoned  in  the  prior  proceeding. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  don't  think  that  makes  sense  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  the  logic  under  this  Court's  decision  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nichols,  nor  do  I  think  it  makes  sense  as  a  matter  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical  reality. 

 

            

 

Here,  for  example,  Respondent  says  that  if 

 

 

 

 

 

only  his  Tribal  Court  had  sentenced  him  to  a  fine  rather 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  to  imprisonment,  there  would  be  no  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infirmity  with  relying  on  those  convictions  in  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  117  prosecution. 

 

 

            

But  I  can't  fathom  why  it  is  that  the  Tribal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  sentencing  determination  would  make  any 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  with  respect  to  the  validity  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions  or  the  permissibility  of  using  them  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify  the  defendant  as  among  those  class  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals  who  are  properly  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Suppose  you  had  a 

  

 

 

 

 

conviction  from  a  foreign  country.  Would  that  ­­ could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  be  used  for  this  purpose,  assuming  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  it? 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  I  don't  think  that  there 

    

 

 

 

 

would  be  any  Sixth  Amendment  problem  if  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chose  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Would  there  be  a  due 

   

  

 

 

 

process  problem?

MS.  PRELOGAR:  I  think  it  ­­ I  think  that  it 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

would  raise  a  more  serious  due  process  issue,  but  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  there  are  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Why  more  serious  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Because  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ in  England? 

  

 

 

 

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Well,  I  think  that  it  would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

be  incumbent  on  a  defendant  in  that  situation  to  try  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  forward  and  make  a  showing  that  that  foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  was  obtained  in  a  proceeding  that  wasn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

fundamentally  fair.  Tribal  courts,  I  think,  are 

   

  

 

 

 

fundamentally  different,  Justice  Kennedy. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Could  that  showing  be 

  

 

 

 

 

attempted  in  a  case  like  this? 

   

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  In  a  Section  117  prosecution? 

   

  

 

 

 

So  that  raises  the  question  whether  there  should  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  have  a  collateral  challenge  to  a  particular 

   

   

 

 

 

 

conviction. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  ­­ are  foreign 

    

 

 

 

judgments  ­­ are  foreign  convictions  ­­ I  thought  it  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  a  Federal,  State  or  a  tribal  court. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  assuming  the  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

was  amended. 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  That's  correct.  So  ­­ so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

just  to  clarify,  it's  true,  Justice  Ginsburg,  that

Section  117  doesn't  cover  foreign  convictions.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  Justice  Kennedy  to  be  asking  whether  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  a  constitutional  problem  if  it  did. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

To  the  extent  that  this  Court  would  perceive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  need  to  recognize  an  as­applied  due­process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  to  a  foreign  conviction,  I  think  tribal 

   

   

 

 

 

convictions  are  very  differently  situated. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  here's  why.  Tribal  convictions  aren't 

  

 

 

 

 

rendered  wholly  outside  the  auspices  of  our  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  or  Federal  review.  Congress  has  plenary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

authority  in  this  area,  and  it's  acted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  it's  certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

rendered  outside  the  Constitution. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  It's  true  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Constitution  doesn't  govern  tribal  court  proceedings, 

 

 

 

 

 

but  Congress  has  plenary  authority,  and  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings  are  governed  by  Federal  law  through  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indian  Civil  Rights  Act. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  this  case  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

come  out  differently  if  Congress  had  not  enacted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indian  Civil  Rights  Act? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  I  think  that  if  Congress 

    

 

 

 

 

hadn't  enacted  the  Indian  Civil  Rights  Act,  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible  that  it  wouldn't  have  made  tribal  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions  predicates  because  it  wouldn't  have  the  same

confidence  that  there's  a  baseline  level  of  procedural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

fairness. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  what  if 

  

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ what  if  they  had?  In  other  words,  convictions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  tribal  court  do  count  as  predicates,  and  there  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  Indian  Civil  Rights  Act. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  In  that  circumstance,  then  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  inquiry  would  focus  on  what  level  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  fairness  is  being  applied  in  tribal  courts  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  absence  of  that  kind  of  Federal  oversight.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  that  would  also  raise  the  question  whether, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  the  absence  of  Federal  court  review  or  ­­ or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  having  enacted  the  Indian  Civil  Rights  Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  there  should  be  a  collateral  challenge  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

permissible  in  that  context. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  it  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case­by­case  determination? 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Yes,  I  think  that  in  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

situation,  there  would  be  no  grounds  to  say  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  categorically  prohibits  Congress  from 

 

 

 

 

defining  the  elements  of  the  crime  in  that  way.  So  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  it  would  be  required  for  the  defendant  to  try 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  raise  some  kind  of  case­specific,  individualized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection  to  that  kind  of  conviction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  just  to  be  clear,  Respondent  is  not

attempting  to  make  that  kind  of  argument  here.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth  Circuit's  rule  is  a  categorical  rule  that  says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  all  tribal­court  convictions  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

uncounseled  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  We  already  do  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

don't  we,  in  the  career  armed  felony  statute  because  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit  reliance  on  foreign  convictions,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  I  ­­ I'm  not  sure  that  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

ACCA  permits  reliance  on  foreign  convictions.  I  do  know 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  are  a  number  of  Federal  statutes  that  do. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  drug  statutes,  for  example. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  that  we  already  put 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  play  the  issue  of  whether  an  individual  in  a  foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding  follows  due  process  or  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  That's  right.  I  think  this 

    

  

 

 

 

Court  has  recognized  and  ­­ and  certainly  some  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes  expressly  permit  the  kind  of  collateral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  that  I've  been  talking  about  with  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  this  due  process  is

convictions.  He  has  acknowledged  at  every  stage  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  convictions  were  obtained  in  compliance  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indian  Civil  Rights  Act. 

 

 

 

            

He  has  never  suggested  that  he  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  commit  those  repeated  acts  of  domestic  violence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  resulted  in  some  five  convictions  in  tribal  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  assaulting  his  intimate  partners.  And  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

understand  him  to  be  trying  to  raise  any  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral  challenge  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  don't  think  that  it's  properly 

   

 

 

 

 

presented  here,  and  I'd  urge  the  Court  to  reserve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  on  that  issue,  which  I  think  raises  a  number  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

complexities,  and  wait  for  a  case  in  which  there  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  full  briefing  on  them  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  he  hasn't  raised  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here,  are  you  suggesting  by  reserving  it  in  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  on  remand,  that  issue  could  be  aired? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  I  don't  think  that  it  would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  live  issue  on  remand,  because  Respondent  has  never 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sought  it  at  any  stage  of  the  proceedings  to  make  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  claim  that  there  was  any  unfairness  in  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal­court  proceedings  or  that  he  was  wrongfully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  in  tribal  court. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  should  emphasize,  too,  Justice 

   

 

 

 

Ginsburg,  that  if  he  had  that  kind  of  claim,  he  had

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Can  you  tell  me  just  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  practice,  if  you  know,  are  these  claims  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  unfairness  in  individual  tribes  made  often  or  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recent  years,  in  cases  like  this? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  just  don't  know. 

    

 

 

 

MS.  PRELOGAR:  I'm  not  aware  ­­ I'm  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

aware  of  any  case  in  which  someone  has  tried  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  kind  of  as­applied  due  process  challenge  that  we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  discussing.  And  so  I  don't  know  of  any  Section  117 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution  that  presents  that  issue.  Obviously,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

some  other  contexts  where  the  Court  has  recognized  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  right  for  collateral  review,  for  example,  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Mendoza­Lopez  decision,  I  think  that  those  claims 

   

 

 

 

 

 

are  more  commonly  made. 

 

 

 

            

But  ­­ but  here  I  think  that  it's  quite 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  Respondent  hasn't  preserved  that  argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He  doesn't  want  to  press  it.  He  doesn't  think  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  wrong  with  his  tribal­court  convictions. 

 

 

 

 

 

Rather,  what  he's  arguing  is  that  all  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions  should  be  categorically  treated  as  though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  don't  exist  when  you're  determining  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  is  a  recidivist  for  purposes  of  prosecution 

   

 

 

 

 

 

under  this  statute.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  thought  the 

    

 

 

 

National  Association  of  Criminal  Defense  Lawyers  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion  of  a  few  prosecutions  where  those  claims  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised. 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So  ­­ so  those  are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

habeas  cases,  though,  where  the  defendant,  following  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

channels  that  Congress  prescribed  to  catch  those  kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  errors,  sought  Federal  court  review  from  the  tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  judgments.  And  I  think  that  that  actually  shows 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  habeas  remedy  is  a  meaningful  safety  valve  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  context. 

 

            

Obviously,  I  ­­ I  think  that  the  presumption 

   

   

 

 

 

should  be  that  tribal  courts  are  applying  ­­ complying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  Indian  Civil  Rights  Act,  and  I  think  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

studies  that  have  comprehensively  looked  at  this  bear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  out  and  show  that  there  isn't  any  rampant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfairness  occurring  in  those  criminal  prosecutions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  to  the  extent  that  a  case  slips  through 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  cracks,  Congress  said  in  25  U.S.C.  Section  1303  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  defendant  in  that  circumstance  can  come  to  federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  and  get  his  conviction  overturned  if  he  has  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid  claim. 

 

            

When  a  defendant  doesn't  exercise  that 

   

 

 

 

channel  of  review  and  doesn't  seek  to  in  any  way  dispute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  validity  of  his  tribal  court  convictions  ­­

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  how  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  work  in  a  case  like  this?  I  mean,  let's  say  there 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  procedural  deficiencies  in  one  of  the  predicate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutions.  And,  you  know,  the  defendant  says,  okay, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  it  was  a  misdemeanor.  He  ­­ he  doesn't  seem  to  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terribly  troubled  by  convictions,  anyway,  but  ­­ so  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  I'm  not  going  to  seek  review  of  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  then  later  on,  the  117  prosecution  comes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along.  Is  he  just  sort  of  stuck  with  the  prior 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegedly  deficient  prosecution  because  he  didn't  bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  challenge  he  possibly  could  have  at  that  time? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Yes,  I  think  he  is  stuck  with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  decision  he  made.  And,  of  course,  the  same  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  been  made  in  the  Nichols  case.  The  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  there,  because  it  was  just  a  misdemeanor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  and  because  he  wasn't  incarcerated,  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  had  any  reason  to  challenge  that  conviction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  maybe  he 

  

 

 

 

 

didn't  have  any  ­­ maybe  he  didn't  have  any  reason  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  it.  I  mean,  my  hypothetical  assumes  a  ­­ a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

predicate  offense  conviction  that  the  defendant  may  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  challenged  for  whatever  reason.  And  yet  when  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

117  ­­ if  I've  got  the  numbers  right  ­­ action  comes  up, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  turns  out  it's  a  lot  more  serious,  which  often 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens  in  these  multiple  offenders.  You  know,  it's

three  ­­ three  strikes  and  you  get  it.  But  you  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  know  that  the  first  strike  was  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

big  a  deal.  It's  only  when  it's  accumulated  with  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

others  that  it  is. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Well,  that's  absolutely  the 

  

 

 

 

 

case.  But  I  think,  as  this  Court  has  recognized  in  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  decisions  in  Nichols  and  in  Daniels,  although 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  stakes  might  be  higher  when  the  defendant  commits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  criminal  misconduct,  and  although  that  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  that  he's  exposed  to  those  more  severe  penalties, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  nothing  unfair  in  that  process.  And  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  there's  nothing  to  suggest  that  those  more  severe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalties  are  being  imposed  for  the  prior  acts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Rather,  the  Court  has  reasoned  in  a  long 

   

 

 

 

 

 

line  of  precedents,  that  in  those  kind  of  recidivist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations,  the  penalty  is  a  hundred  percent  for  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  recent  act  of  violence  or  for  the  most  recent  act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  crime.  And  so  there's  ­­ there's  no  constitutional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  with  ­­ with  permitting  the  defendant  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classified  as  a  recidivist. 

   

 

            

And  the  Court  also  noted  in  Daniels  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  a  defendant  thinks  that  there  was  something 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfair  about  the  original  proceedings  but  lacked  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentives  to  challenge  it,  or  for  whatever  reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  seek  review  at  that  time,  he  knows  those

convictions  are  on  his  record.  And  it  ­­ it's  a  basic 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  in  our  criminal  justice  system  that  if  you  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  again,  you're  going  to  be  treated  more  harshly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  don't  ­­ I  ­­ I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

saw  that  argument  in  ­­ in  your  brief,  and  I'm  not  sure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  quite  ­­ well,  I'm  not  sure  I  agree  with  it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  the  ­­ the  idea  you're  saying  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  well,  if  there's  three  offenses  and  on  the  third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one,  you  get  this  much  enhanced  penalty,  that  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  for  the  third  one.  It  doesn't  ­­ it's  not  being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed  for  the  prior  two. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  I  understand  that,  that  you're 

   

 

 

 

already  been  convicted  and  sentenced  under  the  prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two,  but  it  seems  to  me  as  a  practical  matter  it's  fair 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  say  that  the  enhancement  is  based  on  those  prior  two. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  can't  just  ignore  the  prior  two  and  say,  no,  no, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  all  just  about  this  third  offense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  That  might  be  true  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical  matter,  but  I  think  this  Court  has  recognized 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  as  a  legal  matter  and  as  a  constitutional  matter, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  sentence  is  imposed  only  for  the  latest  offense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  Court  made  this  particularly  clear, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think,  in  Nichols  where  it  said  that,  although 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  the  defendant  was  exposed  to  additional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment  based  on  the  fact  that  he  had  the  prior

conviction,  still,  the  ­­ the  penalty  in  the  recidivist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution  was  wholly  attributable  to  the  instant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense  and  not  to  anything  that  came  before  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  I  think  the  contrary  ruling  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

call  into  question  some  of  the  Court's  double  jeopardy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  or  ex  post  facto  laws.  There's  a  long  line  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  precedents  that  recognize  that  principle, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  recidivist  prosecution  is  solely  for  the  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recent  act,  but  it's  an  aggravated  act  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  falls  within  that  category  of  offenders  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  done  it  before,  who  have  that  criminal  history,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should,  therefore,  be  treated  more  harshly  if  they  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

learn  from  their  prior  misconduct  and  their  prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Bryant  makes  ­­ makes  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  between  a  sentence  enhancement  on  the  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

hand  and  the  case  where  the  prior  conviction  counts  as

Would  you  address  what  that  argument  was? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So  I  understand  that 

   

  

  

 

 

Respondent's  making  the  claim  that  Nichols  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  to  the  sentencing  context  because  it  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  case,  and,  of  course,  that  case  happened  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve  a  sentencing  enhancement.  But  I  don't  think 

   

   

  

 

 

that  there's  any  logical  difference  between  the  use  of

the  conviction  when  it's  an  enhancement  in  that  way  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  use  of  the  conviction  when  it's  made  an  element  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime. 

            

In  either  instance,  the  substantive  purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

of  relying  on  that  prior  conviction  is  simply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish  that  the  defendant  has  that  criminal  history 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  he's,  therefore,  properly  classified  as  among 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  offenders  who  should  be  treated  as  recidivists  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  commit  additional  misconduct. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  don't  think  that  the  placement, 

   

 

 

 

 

whether  in  a  sentencing  enhancement  or  ­­ or  as  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  of  a  crime,  should  make  any  difference  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  purpose  to  which  that  conviction  is  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put. 

            

Now,  it's  certainly  the  case  the  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards  of  review  apply  and  that  the  conviction  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  enhancement  needs  to  be  proofed  only  by  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preponderance,  whereas  at  the  guilt  stage  it  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  proven  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  But  in  either 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances,  it's  the  fact  of  the  conviction  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matters. 

            

And  actually  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  the  proof  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

simply  submitting,  I  suppose,  a  certified  copy  of  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

judgment  of  conviction.

MS.  PRELOGAR:  That's  correct.  I  think 

    

  

 

 

what's  relevant,  whether  in  the  Nichols  situation  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ under  Section  117  is  ­­ is  that  the  defendant,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  was  previously  committed  of  that  domestic  violence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Should  there  be 

  

 

 

 

distinctions  between  prior,  A,  acts;  B,  convictions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  one  case  would  result  in  a  ­­ the  commission  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  crime,  and  in  another  case,  just  enhance  the  sentence? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Should  there  ever  be  a  distinction? 

   

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  I  can't  think  of  one  in  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  of  ­­ of  this  kind  of  recidivist  prosecution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  require  a  distinction.  Nichols  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Could  you  use  the 

  

 

 

 

 

existence  of  a  civil  judgment  for  domestic  assault  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhance  a  criminal  sentence? 

   

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  I  don't  think  there  would  be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

any  constitutional  problem  with  that.  And,  in  fact, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Okay.  And  then  you  could 

  

  

 

 

 

 

use  a  previous  criminal  ­­ a  previous  civil  adjudication 

   

   

 

 

 

 

for  domestic  assault  as  the  basis  for  a  Federal  crime. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Yes,  I  think  that's  right. 

   

  

 

 

 

And  I  don't  think  that  anything  in  the  Constitution 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  prohibit  that.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  a  very  extensive  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

that's  a  very  extensive  argument  you're  making. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Well,  there  are  ­­ I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  the  reason  why  that's  not  constitutionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problematic  is  because  those  civil  adjudications  are  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  valid.  They're  entitled  to  the  same  presumption  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regularity  and  validity  as  any  other  valid  adjudication 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  obtained. 

 

            

And  in  fact,  a  number  of  States  have  laws 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  function  somewhat  like  that  in  the  drunk  driving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  where  the  first  infraction,  the  first  drunk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driving  incident  is  prosecuted  as  a  civil  offense,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  a  second  drunk  driving  offense  is  treated  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime  that  requires  proof  of  that  civil  adjudication. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  courts  that  have  considered  the  constitutionality  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  schemes  have  reasoned  that  there's  nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherently  problematic  with  giving  effect  to  that  civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication. 

              

I  think  this  reflects  too  that  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  jurisdictions  have  broad  leeway  to  structure  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recidivist  statutes,  whether  they  make  them  elements, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  they  make  them  sentencing  factors.  Recidivism 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  ­­ a  large  problem,  and  the  Court  has  recognized  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  variety  of  contexts  that  States  have  a  lot  of  leeway 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  choosing  how  to  deal  with  that  problem.  But  I  don't

think  that  there's  any  inherent  problem  with  the  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  a  valid  conviction. 

   

 

 

 

            

 

And  again,  just  focusing  back  on  the  logic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  this  Court's  decision  in  Nichols,  what  the  Court  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  there  was  whether  there  had  been  an  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation,  because  if  you  don't  have  a  right­to­counsel 

   

 

 

 

 

 

defect  in  that  prior  adjudication,  whether  it's  civil, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  ­­ it's  criminal  and  uncounseled  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  misdemeanor  that  didn't  result  in  imprisonment, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  the  reason,  the  range  of  reasons  why  you  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  able  to  validly  adjudicate  guilt  without  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance  of  counsel,  there  is  simply  no  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infirmity  in  that  conviction  that  would  preclude  its  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  subsequent  proceeding. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Do  we  know  why  ­­ why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress,  in  the  Indian  Civil  Rights  Act,  made  the  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  counsel  narrower  than  the  right  in  the  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment? 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  I  think  that  Congress,  when 

    

 

 

 

 

it  enacted  the  Indian  Civil  Rights  Act,  after  years  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

studying  this  issue,  was  sensitive  to  balancing  autonomy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  tribes  and  tribal  sovereignty  against  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights.  And  I  think  that  Congress  must  have  made  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  that,  given  the  other  protections  in  the  Indian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Civil  Rights  Act,  tribal­court  defendants  could  be

fairly  and  reliably  adjudicated  guilty  without  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance  of  counsel. 

 

 

            

And  that's  actually  something  that's  echoed 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  Court's  precedents,  because  of  course  in  Scott 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  in  Argersinger,  this  Court  recognized  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance  of  counsel  under  the  Federal  Constitution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  required  in  order  to  validly  adjudicate  the  guilt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  misdemeanor  defendant. 

   

 

            

In  that  circumstance,  I  think  the  Court  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

what  underlies  that  decision  has  to  be  a  recognition 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  something  fundamentally  different  about 

 

 

 

 

 

misdemeanor  prosecutions,  and  that  the  assistance  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  isn't  essential  in  that  circumstance  to  validly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicate  a  ­­ a  defendant's  guilt. 

   

   

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­ so  they  knew 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

better  than  Madison? 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Madison  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

drafters  of  the  bill,  they  thought,  well,  maybe  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  counsel  was  necessary  here  but  Congress  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  that  necessary. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  But  as  I  was  just  saying, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

even  under  the  Sixth  Amendment,  even  where  it  applies  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  preclude  adjudicating  the  guilt  of  a  defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  State  or  Federal  court.  This  Court's  decision  in

Scott  recognizes  there's  ­­ there's  nothing  wrong  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

And  actually,  I  ­­ I  think  that  the 

   

   

 

 

 

on­the­ground  practical  realities  bear  out  that 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment,  because  even  those  defendants  who  aren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indigent  and  aren't  entitled  to  appointed  counsel, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally,  in  a  large  number  of  cases,  decline  to  hire 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  to  represent  them  in  misdemeanor  cases,  whereas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  look  at  felony  prosecutions,  almost  everybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hires  counsel  if  they're  not  entitled  to  appointed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel. 

            

So  I  think  that  the  nature  of  the  proceeding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  really  is  critical  in  helping  to  understand  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's  judgment  was  rational,  why  the  ­­ why  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indian  Civil  Rights  Act  represents  a  reasonable  baseline 

   

 

 

 

 

 

level  of  ­­ of  procedural  fairness  that's  guaranteed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal­court  defendants,  and  why  there's  nothing  wrong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then,  with  giving  effect  to  those  tribal­court  judgments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  defendant  fails  to  learn  from  his  past  behavior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  his  past  punishment. 

 

 

 

            

These  are  offenders  who  have  been  repeatedly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punished  by  their  tribal  courts.  It  requires  at  least 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  prior  convictions.  And  the  problem  is,  is  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  courts,  for  the  most  part,  are  limited  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misdemeanor  punishment,  and  that,  for  this  class  of

offenders,  has  proven  to  be  an  ineffective  remedy;  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't  deterred  the  additional  misconduct. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  tribal  ­­ there  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit  ­­ I  think  has  been  raised  ­­ there  is  a  limit  on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  punishment,  the  incarceration  that  a  tribal  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

could  order.  I  think  it  was  ­­ wasn't  it  originally  one 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year? 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Originally,  I  believe  it  was 

   

  

 

 

 

six  months,  and  then  it  was  lengthened  to  one  year.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  one  year  at  the  point  that  respondent  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  One  year,  and  now  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

three  years? 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  That's  correct,  yes. 

  

 

 

 

Actually,  I  think  this  is  notable  because  I  think  it 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

shows  that  Congress,  in  recent  years,  every  time  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked  at  how  tribal  courts  are  functioning  and  has  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  determination  about  the  rights  and  ­­ and  what  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  in  those  tribal­court  proceedings,  it's  acted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  recognize  expanded  authority  for  tribal  courts,  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  their  sentencing  authority,  with  respect  to  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

So  I  do  think  that  that  reflects  legislative 

   

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  that  tribal  courts  are  sufficiently  protective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  individual  rights,  and  that  there's  no  fundamental

unfairness  that's  occurring  in  those  proceedings  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  cause,  I  think,  this  Court  to  question  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliability  of  those  determinations. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  would  point  again  to  Respondent's 

   

 

 

 

 

concession  that  if  he  had  simply  been  fined  in  tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  and  had  not  received  a  sentence  of  imprisonment, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  there  would  be  no  problem  with  giving  effect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  tribal­court  convictions.  That  shows,  I  think, 

   

  

 

 

 

that  Respondent's  suggestion  that  there  might  be  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  a  reliability  concern  with  this  conviction  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  unmoored  from  the  constitutional  analysis  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  asking  the  Court  to  adopt  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions,  I'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserve  the  remainder  of  my  time.

afoul  what  ­­ what  this  Court  has  stated  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental  right  for  53  years. 

 

 

 

 

            

If  we  take  a  look  at  the  cases  that  deal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  Sixth  Amendment  analysis,  from  Johnson,  to

been  the  core  concern  of  every  single  one  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Do  you  do  ­­ disagree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  ­­ I  think  Ms.  Prelogar  said  that  you  ­­ you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledged  that  if  the  only  sentence  had  been  a  fine, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  jail  time,  that  these  ­­ these  two  prior  battery 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misdemeanors,  if  the  ­­ the  tribal  court  gave  only  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine  and  no  jail  time,  then  those  convictions  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  under  for  a  117  prosecution. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  Correct.  And  the  reason  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

we've  stated  that,  and  we  don't  believe  that  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  besides  strengthen  our  argument  in  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  reason  why  there  is  no  violation  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Amendment  is  simply  because  the  Sixth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  exist.  If  this  case  would  have  been  in  a  State 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  Federal  court,  the  only  court  in  the  United  States  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  it  would  not  run  afoul  of  the  Sixth  Amendment  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  court. 

 

            

Mr.  Bryant  is  not  only  a  tribal  member.  He

of  course  is  a  United  States  citizen.  But  in  taking  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  Nichols  case,  which  relied  upon  Scott,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Scott  specifically  stated  that  they  drew  a  bright  line 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  incarceration  in  dealing  with  the  adjudication  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilt,  Mr.  Bryant  was  incarcerated  for  his  underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal­court  convictions. 

 

            

The  defendant  in  Nichols,  the  uncounseled 

 

 

 

 

 

DUI  which  he  was  convicted  of,  and  the  exact  holding  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nichols  I  think  is  extremely  important  in  this  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  this  Court  stated  that  the  Sixth  and  Fourteenth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  are  not  violated  when  in  fact  there  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adherence  to  Scott;  in  other  words,  there's  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incarceration,  and  they  are  valid  to  enhance  punishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  subsequent  proceeding. 

   

 

            

So  if  we  take  a  look  at  the  individual  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nichols,  if  he  was  incarcerated  for  the  uncounseled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misdemeanor  conviction,  that  case  would  not  adhere  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Scott.  So  it  comes  to  reason,  Mr.  Bryant  himself  being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incarcerated,  that  violates  Scott. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  I  ­­ I  ­­

    

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  My  thought  is  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

quite  formalistic.  It  doesn't  have  anything  to  do  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherent  reliability  or  unreliability.  In  fact,  if  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  an  uncounseled  felony  conviction,  it  might  well 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  that  the  trial  judge  was  much  more  careful

than  he  would  be  in  a  misdemeanor  case.  It's  almost  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite. 

              

I  ­­ I  understand  your  ­­ the  efficacy  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  clear  line,  but  it's  more  formalistic  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functional,  it  does  seem  to  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  Well,  and  I  think  it's  the  way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  take  a  look  at  it  ­­ and  I  think  it's  important 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  we  take  a  look  at  what  Justice  Scalia  stated  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Crawford  case.  And  that,  of  course,  had  to  do  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Confrontation  Clause  issue,  but  it  specifically  dealt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  Sixth  Amendment  analysis  based  upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliability.  His  statement  was  it's  not  whether  or  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  reliable,  but  how  reliability  is  assessed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  tribal  court  convictions  in  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  not  subject  to  the  crucible  of  meaningful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adversarial  testing.  And  that  goes  right  back  to  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg  stated  in  Shelton  in  2002,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element.  And  it  is  an  element  of  the  offense.  It  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  used  to  establish  guilt. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  as  Justice  Ginsburg 

  

 

 

 

 

pointed  out,  you  could  make  the  same  argument  if  it  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  just  a  fine  and  no  Sixth  Amendment  violation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  Exactly,  but  what  we're  asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  I  don't  understand  why

one  is  reliable  and  the  other  is  not  reliable,  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  the  formalistic  argument  which  I  can  understand. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  And  we  are  certainly  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  an  uncounseled  misdemeanor  conviction  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliable,  and  neither  does  Nichols.  If  we  take  a  look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  Justice  Souder's  concurrence  in  Nichols, 

 

 

 

 

 

realistically  what's  being  stated  here  is  that  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  there  is  no  deprivation  of  liberty,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreliability  is  essentially  tolerated.  But  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

particular  case,  Mr.  Bryant  was  incarcerated. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  did  anybody  object  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  time  and  say  this  sentence  is  unconstitutional? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

counsel. 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  No.  Mr.  Bryant  ­­

MR.  BABCOCK:  ­­ did  not  have  a  right  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Fine.  But,  I  mean,  is 

   

  

  

 

 

anybody  here  now  claiming  that  the  sentence  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional  at  the  time?

brief  in  this  Court,  have  you  claimed  that  the  sentence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  proceeding  in  the  Indian  court  violated  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution? 

            

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  We  have  not. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  Well,  then,  I  take 

   

  

  

 

 

it  that  for  purposes  here,  you  concede  that.  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see  how  you  can  get  around  the  fact  you  haven't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complained. 

            

So  if  it's  a  valid  conviction,  why  can't  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  it?  I  mean,  you  could  ­­ you  could  sentence  people 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  more;  that's  what  Nichols  says.  You  could  sentence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  to  three  times  the  sentence  without  any  conviction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  would  just  introduce  some  evidence  that  he  hit  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wife  before  badly. 

 

 

            

 

 

 

You  could  ­­ you  could  raise  the  sentence  if 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  a  civil  ­­ if  it  was  a  civil  case.  And  ­­ and 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  judgment  in  favor  of  the  wife,  I  take  it. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  why  can't  you  raise  the  sentence  on  the  ground  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  valid  conviction,  period?  End  of  the  case. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Which  is,  I  think,  what  Nichols  said. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  Well,  Nichols  also  dealt  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

an  underlying  conviction  in  which  the  Sixth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  exist.  And  in  this  particular  case,  once  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah.  But  you  have  told  me 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  have  not  ­­ I  don't  see  how  you  could  send  a

where  there's  no  counsel.  If  the  Indian  tribes  can  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  then  I  don't  see  why  the  Federal  government  can't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later  use  it  if  that's  valid. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  Well,  I  think  the  reason  why 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  because  of  the  United  States  District  Court,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly,  in  this  Court,  the  Sixth  Amendment  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist.  And  the  only  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  then  we  should  hold 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ I  guess,  that  all  of  the  convictions  in  all  the

go  to  prison  for  more  than  six  months  or  at  all,  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day,  all  those  are  invalid. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  If  they're  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Then  the  law  of  Congress  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional.  Is  that  ­­ is  that  ­­ but  no  one's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked  us  to  hold  that,  so  I  don't  know  that  we  should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold  that  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  Well,  we're  certainly  not 

  

 

 

 

 

challenging  the  constitutionality  of  the  Indian  Civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights  Act,  but  we  are  certainly  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  that's  the 

  

 

 

 

question,  which  is:  Standing  alone,  was  that  earlier 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  violative  of  the  Constitution?

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Right.  And  so  you're 

  

  

 

 

 

not  challenging  that  the  Bill  of  Rights  do  not  apply  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we've  long  held  that  ­­ don't  apply  to  Indian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts,  correct? 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  They  don't  apply  to 

  

 

 

 

 

English  courts  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ and  other  foreign 

  

 

 

 

 

courts. 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  there  are  plenty  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  courts,  like  England  for  a  time  ­­ I  think  it's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

changing  it  now  ­­ where  they  would  convict  people  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  magisterial  inquisition  where  the  defendant  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  counsel.  You're  not  saying  that  process  violates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Constitution? 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  No,  I'm  not  saying  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

process  violates  the  Constitution. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You're  saying  simply 

  

 

 

 

because  we're  using  that  conviction,  we  now  violated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why? 

            

Nichols,  as  I  understand  it,  had  two

conviction,  one  that  doesn't  violate  the  Constitution, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  enhancing  a  sentence,  is  not  changing  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier  conviction.  It's  not  enhancing  a  sentence  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  earlier  conviction,  so  you  can  use  it,  because  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  setting  the  platform  for  the  current  punishment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  conduct  now. 

 

 

 

            

 

How  does  your  argument  ­­ why  does  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  change  that  rationale? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  I  think  a  big  reason  why  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

our  fundamental  difference  between  guilt  phase  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  phase.  And  certainly  if  we  take  a  look  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  offer  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  we  ­­ Nichols 

  

 

 

 

 

itself  said  enhancement  statutes,  whether  in  the  nature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  criminal  history  provisions,  such  as  those  contained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Sentencing  Guidelines,  or  recidivist  statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  commonplace  in  State  criminal  law,  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recidivist  statutes  make  prior  convictions  an  element, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  not  change  the  penalty  imposed  for  an  earlier 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction.  That's  what  Nichols  said.  So  the  Nichols 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

rationale  covered  both. 

 

 

            

MR  BABCOCK:  I  read  ­­

    

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Covered  sentencing

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Nichols  said  that's 

  

 

 

 

MR.  BABCOCK:  It's  not  technically,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

argue,  a  typical  recidivist  statute.  It's  not  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  it  says  it  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

relying  on  recidivist  statutes  that  are  commonplace  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  criminal  laws.

MR.  BABCOCK:  They  make  them  an  element  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  crime,  but  ­­ but  Chief  Justice  Rehnquist  also  went

phase.  Also,  what  ­­

that,  if  you're  taking  a  look  at  the  less  exacting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  of  course,  what  we  have  to  do  is  rely  upon  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preponderance  of  the  evidence  in  a  sentencing  scheme. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

If  we  take  a  look  at  the  determination  at  the  guilt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phase,  which  Justice  Ginsburg  brought  out  in  Shelton, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  big  difference  is  that  has  to  be  proven  beyond  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  doubt.  And  if  it  was  not  subjected  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaningful  adversarial  system  that  this  Court  holds  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental  right  since  Gideon,  the  entire  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  isn't  that  a  due 

   

  

 

 

 

process  argument? 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  I  believe  that  the  due  process 

    

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  Sixth  Amendment  argument  are  certainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intertwined  in  this  case.  And  if  there  is  a  procedural 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

due  process  error,  we  have  been  stating  the  entire  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  because  Mr.  Bryant  is  having  an  uncounseled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  being  used  as  an  essential  element  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequent  Federal  prosecution.

between  ­­ that  you  made  between  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt  and  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practically,  I  mean,  what's  involved  here  is  proof  of  a

present  the  certified  copy  of  the  judgment,  and  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  That  satisfies  proof  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  I  think  that  this  Court,  in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

taking  a  look  at  convictions  themselves,  if  you  want  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  a  look  at  cases  such  as  Tucker  and  as  Loper,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  enough.  The  actual  process  and  how  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions  were  obtained  and  whether  or  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  safeguards  of  the  Sixth  Amendment  right  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  was  adhered  to  was  of  the  utmost  importance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  we  take  a  look  at  the  case  in  Loper,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  being  used  for  impeachment  purposes.  In  impeachment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes,  the  Court  held  that  that  fell  into  that  ­­ a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  stage  under  the  determination  of  guilt.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  for  impeachment  purposes  ­­ and  I  do  understand 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  difference  is  that  has  to  deal  with  a  felony 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction.  This  is  a  misdemeanor  conviction.  But  even 

   

  

  

 

 

 

for  impeachment  purposes,  it  wasn't  enough  for  the  trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  to  be  able  to  just  take  a  look  at  the  conviction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  let  that  in.  This  Court  held  that  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impermissibly  went  afoul  with  the  Sixth  Amendment  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  counsel  and  went  to  the  ­­ to  the  determination  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilt. 

            

Clearly,  this  is  more  than  a  sentencing 

   

 

 

 

 

enhancement  situation.  The  offer  of  proof  itself  sets 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

forth  what  needs  to  occur.  And  one  of  the  elements  has

to  be  a  conviction,  at  least  two  or  more  convictions, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  tribal  court.  We  certainly  know  Petitioner  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceded  since  day  one  that  the  Indian  Civil  Rights  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  afford  native  Americans  the  right  to  counsel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  we  take  a  look  at  the  waivers  that  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  now  have  for  an  uncounseled  misdemeanor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction,  we  would  have  actually  waiving  your  right  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel.  Certainly  Mr.  Bryant  didn't  do  that.  He  can't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

waive  a  right  he  didn't  possess. 

   

 

 

 

            

Second,  he's  not  indigent.  Well,  there's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reason  to  do  a  financial  affidavit,  because  there's  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  counsel  so  we  don't  have  to  determine  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligibility. 

            

Third,  whether  or  not  he  was  incarcerated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  upon  an  adjudication  of  guilt  as  set  forth  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Scott. 

            

And,  now,  fourth,  we  would  have  one  final 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  to  an  uncounseled  misdemeanor  conviction,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  be  if  it  came  from  tribal  court.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  other  court  in  the  United  States, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misdemeanor­wise  or  not,  that  an  individual  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

afforded  a  fundamental  right  to  counsel.

statutes  that  allow  the  use  of  a  foreign  conviction  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

count  for  recidivism  purposes,  for  ­­ for  a  variety  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes.  And  many  of  our  partners  in  the  world  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  same  ­­ same  rights  as  ­­ that  are  in  our  Bill 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Rights,  and  yet  we  ­­ we  credit  those  convictions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BABCOCK:  We  do  credit  those  ­­ those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions,  but  we  do  take  a  look  at  whether  or  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  adhered  to  the  procedural  safeguards  that  we  deem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  fundamental  in  this  country. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  a  lot  of  countries,  of  course,  do  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

deem  the  right  to  counsel  as  fundamental  or  essential. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  certainly  do.  And  if  we  take  a  look  at  the  right  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  case  from  2006,  in  the  dissent,  Justice  Alito 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stated  that  the  complete  lack  of  counsel  is  the  epitome 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  unfairness.  That  would  be  triggered  essentially  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural  error. 

 

            

So  if  we  take  a  look  in  this  situation,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  reason  why  the  conviction  doesn't  run  afoul, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliability  can't  be  based  upon  nonexistence.  If  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  employee  in  a  company,  you  never  show  up  to  work, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  don't  deem  you  reliable.  And  that's  exactly  what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  in  this  situation.  The  only  reason  why  it  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  run  afoul  is  because  the  Sixth  Amendment  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist.

about  as  a  remedy  to  fix  this  situation,  which  should  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  habeas,  it  is  my  opinion  that  Federal  habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  ­­ provides  no  assistance  whatsoever  to  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  like  Mr.  Bryant. 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  you  have  to  attach  ­­ you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  challenge  the  legality  of  your  detention.  How  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  challenge  the  legality  of  his  detention  based  upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lack  of  counsel  when  he  possesses  no  such  right?  Also, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  has  to  be  detention  at  the  time,  or  there  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  filing  of  the  habeas  at  that  crime. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  know  that  the  prior  conviction,  the  last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one,  was  from  2007.  He  certainly  did  not  file  a  habeas 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition  back  then,  and  they're  extremely  uncommon,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  has  to  be  some  tie  to  detention.  That  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  moot  in  this  case.  He  has  no  way  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  this.  And  we  know  taking  a  look  at  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  case  in  Custis.  In  Custis,  which  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  just  two  weeks  before  Nichols,  and  that  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  with  an  armed  career  criminal  analysis,  and  they  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  lack  of  counsel  is  a  fundamental  right.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  ability  to  challenge  a  predicate  for  an  ACCA 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhancement  based  upon  the  lack  of  counsel.  That's  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  doing  here,  but  we  have  no  other  forum  whatsoever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  come  before  this  Court  and  challenge  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionality  of  using  those  as  a  predicate  offense

establishing  an  essential  element. 

 

 

 

              

I  do  also  believe  that  in  taking  a  look  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  difference  between  sentencing  and  the  guilt  phase, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  taken  on  a  different  trend  in  this  Court  when  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  a  look  at  the  Apprendi  line  of  cases.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  we  know  that  there  is  an  exception  based  upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  prior  conviction,  based  upon  Almendarez­Torres,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  premise  is  based  upon,  once  again,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  safeguards  that  we  hold  important  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country  are  adhered  to. 

 

 

 

            

In  those  particular  cases,  specifically  in 

 

 

 

 

 

Blakely,  the  reliance  that  a  judge  had  to  do  wasn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough.  They  essentially  turned  those  element  ­­ turned 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  situations  into  elements.  And  in  this  case,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  to  do  anything  such  as  that.  This  is  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element.  We  don't  have  to  say  that  this  is  increasing  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  minimum.  We  do  not  have  to  say  that  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putting  something  on  the  guidelines  more.  Essentially, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  we're  doing  is  we're  saying  we  have  an  uncounseled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  that  has  never  been  subjected  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental  right.  The  crucible  of  adversarial  testing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  country  mandates  we're  just  going  to  let  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

slide,  because  Congress  itself  passed  a  law  upon  native 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Americans  that  didn't  adopt  the  full  Sixth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protections.

Ms.  Prelogar,  eight  minutes. 

 

 

 

            

Honor. 

            

            

       

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ELIZABETH  B.  PRELOGAR 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'd  like  to  begin  by  responding  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's  point  that  there  is  a  less  exacting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

standard  that's  applied  at  sentencing.  Nichols  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

include  that  language,  but  as  I  read  the  Court's  opinion 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there,  Nichols  was  actually  drawing  a  contrast  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  relitigate  the  underlying  facts  that  led  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  prior  conviction  versus  relying  on  the  prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  itself.  And  Nichols  observed  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  is  in  some  respects  better  on  when  you  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  the  fact  of  the  prior  conviction  because  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  represents  an  adjudication  of  guilty  beyond  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  doubt. 

 

            

Well,  that's  the  same  representation  that 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prior  conviction  has  when  it's  used  at  the  guilt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage.  Thereto,  that  prior  misconduct  had  to  be  proven 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt. 

   

 

            

The  kind  of  distinction  that  Respondent 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  this  Court  draw  would  resurrect  essentially

lapse  into  unconstitutionality  and  become  invalid  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  tried  to  use  it  subsequently.  The  Court  obviously 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overruled  Baldasar  and  Nichols,  and  we'd  urge  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  to  return  to  that  kind  of  hyperconviction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  finally,  I  don't  understand  Respondent 

   

 

 

 

himself  to  actually  be  adhering  to  this  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

versus  elements  line,  because  again,  he's  conceded.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  tribal  court  had  fined  him,  it  would  be  perfectly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine  to  use  those  prior  tribal  court  convictions  as  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  of  the  Section  117  offense. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd  also  like  to  respond  to  Respondent's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion  that  all  uncounseled  misdemeanor  convictions 

 

 

 

 

 

are  unreliable.  I  think  that  that's  wholly  at  odds  with 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  line  this  Court  drew  in  Scott  and  Argersinger.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  cannot  be  the  case  that  this  Court  was  willing  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret  the  Sixth  Amendment  to  tolerate  wholly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreliable  convictions  in  that  context.  Rather,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  the  Scott­Argersinger  line  reflects  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance  of  counsel  is  not  essential  to  an  accurate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  reliable  determination  of  guilt  in  that  context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  to  the  extent  that  that  was  left  in  any

doubt,  I  think  Nichols  confirms  the  point.  Because  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Nichols,  the  argument  was  made  that  although  those  prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncounseled  convictions  might  have  been  sufficiently 

 

 

 

 

 

reliable  when  there  was  less  at  stake,  they  should  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  relied  upon  in  a  subsequent  proceeding  where  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

stakes  are  much  higher.  But  this  Court  wasn't  persuaded 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  that,  and  I  think  rightly  accepted  the  line  that  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  conviction  was  obtained  in  a  proceeding  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently  reliable  to  adjudicate  the  defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

guilt  in  the  first  instance,  then  there  is  no  way  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  proceeding  suddenly  becomes  fundamentally 

 

 

 

 

 

unfair  and  unreliable  when  you're  giving  effect  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid,  constitutional  prior  conviction  subsequently. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  the  final  thing  I  would  note  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  although  there's  been  a  lot  of  talk  about  fairness 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  I  think  it  is  important  to  recognize  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent  had  it  entirely  within  his  power  to  not  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  Federal  court  consider  these  prior  tribal  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions.  If  he  didn't  want  that  to  occur,  then  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  should  have  done  is  stop  abusing  his  domestic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partners.  But  because  he  didn't  learn  from  those  prior 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  convictions,  because  he  kept  battering  women  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indian  country  and  contributed  to  that  epidemic  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  violence,  I  don't  think  he  should  be  heard  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complain  that  he's  being  prosecuted  under  Section  117.
