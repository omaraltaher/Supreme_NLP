CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-749, the Raytheon Company v. Joel


Hernandez.


Mr. Phillips.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Petitioner, like thousands of other employers


throughout this country, has a policy that if an employee


is discharged for violating a workplace rule -- usually


that involves serious misconduct in the -- in the


workplace -- then he becomes permanently ineligible to be


rehired by that particular employer. 


The court of appeals in this case correctly held


at Fed.App. 12a, note 17, that there is no question that


petitioner applied this policy in rejecting respondent's


application.  And the court of appeals also held that


there's no question that this policy on its face is not


unlawful. 


Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit declared that


even in a case alleging only disparate treatment, the,


quote, policy violates the ADA as applied to former drug

addicts whose only work-related offense was testing


positive because of their addiction.


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, it -- the Ninth Circuit


in its opinion on about page 8a in the appendix said,


Hernandez raises a genuine issue of material fact as to


whether he was denied reemployment because of his past


record of drug addiction.  And I'm concerned that the


court may have said there is a genuine issue of fact here,


that it wasn't clear whether there was a no-hire policy


that was either adopted or if it was used in this case,


that there's something else at stake due to the different


responses of the man who wrote the letter versus the woman


who actually made the decision, and that there's some


issue of fact here. 


Now, if that's the case, maybe the rest of the


opinion is just dicta.  I don't know. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  It's pretty clear that the rest


of the opinion is not dicta, Justice O'Connor.  The --


that portion of the analysis is -- is directed solely at


the question of whether or not the plaintiff had made out


a prima facie case, and what the court said was, you know,


is there any evidence from which anyone could draw the


inference that there was discrimination because of a


disability.  And it recognized frankly that that was a


very close question, that if you read even the -- the

statement made to the EEOC, you can read that in different


ways.  Maybe you should look at Bockmiller.


But the truth is in making the prima facie


showing, all that you really needed to look at was the


policy statement -- or the -- the response to the EEOC,


and that would be enough, I think, to get you past the


prima facie showing. 


It -- it is at page 10a where the court then


turns its complete attention, and it says, you know, so in


sum we hold that -- that Hernandez's prima facie case of


discrimination has been made out, and now we turn to the


next stage in the process, which is to look and see


whether or not there is a -- a non-pretextual


justification.


QUESTION:  I might agree with you that a no-hire


policy, if that's what was used, is certainly not


unlawful.  But if there is a genuine issue of fact here,


what -- what do we do?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, if there were a genuine


issue of fact, you -- you would -- you know, you'd remand


to allow the case to go forward.  There's clearly not a


genuine issue of fact because if you -- once you get past


just looking at the EEOC statement that was made by the


employer and -- and you're in the district court and


you're looking at summary judgment and the question is

whether or not the action of the employer is pretextual,


we only have the burden to come forward and say we had a


-- a perfectly lawful reason for doing what we did.


QUESTION:  Well, aren't the two questions really


severable, whether the Ninth Circuit's treatment of the


no-rehire policy was correct under ADA law, and second,


whether the employer was entitled to summary judgment?  I


-- I think those are two different questions. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I -- yes, they are two


different questions, Mr. Chief Justice.  I think the


answer is that I think we probably would have been


entitled to summary judgment even on the prima facie


showing.


The only way the court of appeals got to its 

analysis -- the only way it could have gotten there under


Hazen Paper -- is to say that the pretextual basis -- the


pretextual argument that was put forward by the employer


-- we have to take that off the table because if that --


if that policy is in this case, there is not a shred of


evidence that that policy was not applied in this


particular case.  And that's exactly what the court of


appeals said in -- in the footnote in its opinion.  It


said that's unquestioned.


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, I'm having the same


problem that Justice O'Connor and the Chief expressed.

One thing is if we take this case, there's a no-hire rule.


Can an employer have such a rule and apply it with even


hand?  That's a question of law. 


But this case seems to be underneath messier. 


For example, this no-hire policy was unwritten.  This is a


company that had a lot of written rules.  That's an


important rule.  Why was it unwritten?  Why does Medina


testify we had a right, not that we'd apply it every case,


but we had a right not to rehire someone who was


discharged for cause? 


The -- the record is suspicious on, one, whether


there was a policy; two, whether it was applied with an


even hand.  That one can't tell.  So why should a judge


take this as given that there was indeed such a policy and 

that it -- it was applied with an even hand?  Don't those


questions remain in the case?  Even if you prevail on if


they had such a policy and if they applied it with an even


hand, they would not be offending --


MR. PHILLIPS:  I mean, there's no question that


respondent has asserted arguments that the -- that -- that


there's a question as to whether the policy exists.  The


Ninth Circuit expressly held that the policy exists and


was applied in this particular case --


QUESTION:  Well, they held it in a footnote, and


I'm --

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't take footnotes seriously


in all court's opinions, Your Honor. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, but I mean, it could not


have been more explicit in terms of dealing with this


particular issue.  Was the policy presented and was it --


was -- did the policy exist and was it applied in this


particular case?  There's no question about that.


And there's no testimony that raises any doubt. 


It may be that it's an unwritten policy, but the testimony


in the joint appendix at 22a, 57a, 59a, 71a, 72a, and 73a,


which is the affidavit and deposition testimony of


Bockmiller who was the decision maker in this case and


Medina who signed the -- the statement, is consistent, 

that -- that there is an absolute policy and practice that


this employer uniformly uses.


QUESTION:  We don't know from this record, for


example, whether someone who had sexually harassed a


fellow worker and for that reason was fired, whether such


a policy would apply -- has, in fact, been applied to such


a person, whether someone who assaulted a co-worker would


also be barred permanently from re-hire.  If there is the


firm policy, then it's unquestionably legal, but -- but


there isn't in this anything except two employees who gave


testimony, no other examples, other than this very case,

to show that this has been applied across the board.


MR. PHILLIPS:  But Justice Ginsburg, the


respondent had a full opportunity for discovery in this


case.  He was an employee for 25 years.  If he had known


of any instances in which this rule hadn't been applied,


he could presumably have brought that forward.  If he


could have discovered any instance in which this rule had


not been applied consistently --


QUESTION:  I thought he said that he didn't even


know the rule existed.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Actually he's not specific in --


in regard to that.  I mean, he's made that argument at


this stage in the proceedings, but there's nothing in the


record, certainly nothing during the deposition testimony, 

in which he says -- there's nothing in his affidavit.


But -- but, Justice O'Connor, it's worth reading


the joint appendix -- I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.  I


apologize. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. PHILLIPS:  But, Justice Ginsburg, it's worth


reading on joint appendix 70a.  You know, this -- his


application would have been rejected had he been fired for


stealing or fighting or anything like that.  It's


unequivocal, absolutely uncontradicted testimony in this


record.  There is no question --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, can I ask you a


question that makes the assumption that you want to make


for the whole case, that the policy was just applied in


this case?  Suppose a person, aware of the policy, right


-- and has the history of this person, and say you would


admit he's qualified.  I know there's some doubt about


that in this case.  A qualified applicant, who has a


history of drug or alcohol use and was fired for that


years ago, writes a letter to the company and says I'm


totally aware of your policy of not hiring -- rehiring


people who were previously discharged for cause, but I


want you to know I am a rehabilitated person and therefore


I'm handicapped and I come within the statute.  And I


think the -- the rule against discriminating against 

handicaps requires you to make a special accommodation for


me.  Please do so. 


Now, why could you turn him down?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, you could -- you could


continue to assert that the -- that our policy is our


policy and we're entitled to assert that policy. 


Now, you know, there are alternative theories


that could be brought forward.  One -- one could be that


the policy has a disparate impact, which wasn't litigated


in this case --


QUESTION:  And if --

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and also --


QUESTION:  -- a whole bunch of people.  He says


-- he admits he's the only person who fits.  So he can't


make a disparate impact argument.  He just says you have a


duty to accommodate under this statute and your failure to


accommodate is discrimination when you know that the


reason for the policy doesn't apply --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there are sort of three


answers to that in terms of the reasonable accommodation


rationale.  First of all, remember that this is not an


employee any longer who is in fact disabled.  This is one


who's merely regarded as or has a record of.  And the


statute specifically talks about accommodating the 

limitations of the employee.  So there -- there are no


limitations here.  So I think (b)(5) by its terms doesn't


apply. 


QUESTION:  Is it your view there's no duty to


accommodate for applicants?  I'm just trying to -- is it


your view that the statute does not require any


accommodation for applicants as opposed to actually


employed persons?


MR. PHILLIPS:  No, I don't -- I don't know that


that doesn't require any -- anything with respect to


applicants or any accommodation with respect to

applicants.  I don't -- I -- I think what it doesn't do is


allow you to look beyond whether there are limitations


that need to be accommodated.  And I don't think it -- and


I don't think it is a reasonable accommodation within the


meaning of (b)(5) to say that you're entitled to a second


bite of the apple.  If you have violated a misconduct rule


and been discharged for that reason, whether it's drug-


related or not, it seems to me clear under the statute --


certainly it's clear under -- under 114(c)(4) -- that that


is precisely the situation in which the employer is


allowed to discharge you and to impose on you a permanent


ban. 


QUESTION: 


Well, the discharge isn't in 

question.  The question is whether a person who is now


handicapped within the meaning of the statute and who was


previously discharged for a reason that clearly does not


justify rehiring now, other than the fact you want to have


a rule with no exceptions to it.  I don't really -- I'm a


little unclear as to if you don't say the duty to


accommodate has no application to applicants as opposed to


employees, I'm a little unclear as to why this isn't like


a rule in the gender discrimination cases, you can't lift


over 100 pounds or something like that.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, because I think the reason

is is that in order to allow this employee to come back


under these circumstances, you have to -- you have to


discriminate in his favor because if -- if this were a


person who --


QUESTION:  That's right, and that's always the


case of -- of accommodation. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 


QUESTION:  It's always a discrimination in favor


of the applicant.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but that's why you have to


look at 114(c)(4), which says specifically that you are


entitled to treat former drug addicts precisely the way


you would treat any other employee. 


So then the question 

I think is if this employee had been discharged originally


because he was a sex offender or a sexual harasser and --


and had a psychological reason for it, and he came back in


and he said, I'm -- I'm cured, I'm fixed, I want to come


back to work now, the answer there might be one thing.  I


don't know the -- you know, there may be a reasonable


accommodation issue there.


But with respect to 114(c)(4), which very


specifically says that you're allowed to impose


qualification standards that are the same where you're not


going to allow that other employee to come in -- that's

the way your policy operates -- applying that rule fairly


to this situation means that this employee is not entitled


to come in.


I don't think it's a flat rule against


applicants versus non-applicants.  I think it's a (c)(4)


-- 114(c)(4) rule that says that you are always entitled


to treat the rehabilitated drug addict exactly the same


way you would treat anyone else who engaged in misconduct.


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, I guess the Ninth


Circuit did not address at all the reasonable


accommodation question, did it?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't think it did address the


reasonable accommodation issue.


QUESTION:  No.  So I guess we'd have a hard time


in getting into it, but it --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Any more than it --


QUESTION:  -- may be a serious question. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it might be and -- and I


don't think it would be in this case.  As I say, I think


114(c)(4) is a complete answer to the reasonable


accommodation argument, and I think frankly 114(c)(4) is a


complete answer to the disparate impact argument, which


the court of appeals also not only didn't get into, but


found had been expressly waived.

 That's why I think, Justice O'Connor, at the end


of the day, what this case is about is Hazen Paper.  We


have a rule here that was unquestionably applied.  There


is not a shred of evidence that it wasn't applied.


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Phillips, one of the things


is -- doesn't quite fit is in the case of this very


employee.  He was given a test despite this firm no-hire


-- no-rehire rule.  They did give him a test in 1999, and


it turned out he flunked it badly.  But everyone


recognizes that flunking in 1999, when you're a little


rusty, doesn't mean you would have flunked in 1994, which


is the critical time here.  But why did the company, if it


has this firm -- firm, no-exception policy, no rehires, 

why did it give him the test to see if he was qualified?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, because any employers who's


in the middle of litigation would be irrational not to try


to find some kind of a non-litigated solution to the


problem.  And so we were looking for a non-litigated


solution to the problem.  Since he wasn't qualified in


1999, it wasn't available to us to bring him back or to


try to come up with some other kind of a settlement.  I


think it completely inappropriate to hold it against us to


try to come up with a solution to this case that wouldn't


have required us to take the time of the court at that

point. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, looking at 114(c)(4), I


think that speaks to the -- what the company may do to


employees, not -- it doesn't speak to former employees --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 


QUESTION:  -- or applicants for employment.


MR. PHILLIPS:  But -- but, of course, Mr.


Hernandez was an employee in 1991. 


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  And we discharged him and then we


imposed on him the same qualification standards that we


would impose to anyone that we discharged under those


exact same circumstances.  He is dismissed.


QUESTION:  I understand. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  And he is permanently barred on


-- on a going-forward  basis. 


QUESTION:  But I don't think (c) --


MR. PHILLIPS:  That language clearly covers


this.


QUESTION:  I don't think (c)(4) explains why you


didn't have a duty to accommodate him when he -- when he


sought re-employment.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think the answer to that


is (c)(4) would -- would trump the reasonable

accommodation argument, if -- if it had been properly


raised and it were before the court.  I think at the end


of the day, we'd win that, but Justice O'Connor -- I got


the name right there -- is clearly right that that issue


wasn't resolved by the Ninth Circuit, and therefore


remains open.  I mean, it is not an issue for this Court


at this point.


I just want to make it absolutely clear that the


rule was applied -- I don't think there is any way that


you can question that there is an issue of fact to be


resolved as to how this rule was applied in this


circumstance.  In order to discount the applicability of


the rule as the basis for Mr. Hernandez's rejection, you 

have to declare that Ms. Bockmiller flat-out lied, and she


didn't.  Everything in the record in this case is


consistent with the idea that she looked at the summary


separation, she concluded that there was no basis to go


forward with this case, and she acted accordingly.  An


employee -- obviously, employers are allowed to use their


own employee's testimony.  It cannot be that that's an


interested witness whose testimony is not entitled to


credit when it is absolutely uncontradicted. 


So we are not only entitled to have this rule


set aside, we're also entitled to judgment at the end of

Thank you, Your Honors.  I'd reserve the balance

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Phillips.


Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


A policy -- a mutual policy of refusing to


rehire individuals previously terminated for serious


misconduct does not constitute disparate treatment for 

purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act even as


applied to an individual previously discharged for drug-


related misconduct.  The policy does not single out people


who are addicted or those who test positive for drugs for


disfavorable treatment.  The policy treats all serious


misconduct, whether drug-related or not, the same.


As a result, an individual who is refused re-


employment pursuant to that policy is simply not subject


to disparate treatment because of their disability.


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, does the Government take


a position on whether there's an issue of fact hidden in

this case about whether there is a neutral no-hire policy?


MR. CLEMENT:  Justice O'Connor, in our brief we


suggested that it would be possible to grant summary


judgment for the employer here on this record.  I have to


confess, though, that that issue is of considerable less


importance to the Government than the broader validity of


this rule.  One thing I -- I'll address why we think


summary judgment might be appropriate, but I want to


emphasize, though, that even if the Court thinks that


summary judgment is not appropriate here, the proper


disposition would be to vacate and remand.


But it's very important to vacate the opinion


because the theory of the Ninth Circuit, if you can divine 

one here, is that, all right, there's a pretextual case


for discrimination and the employer comes in and says, we


didn't discriminate on the basis of disability.  We


applied a neutral, across-the-board rule.  And as I read


the Ninth Circuit opinion, what they say is that neutral


rule is not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for your


employment action.  And they -- they do that as a matter


of law, and that is a profoundly wrong decision as a


matter of law, especially in a disparate treatment case


because Justice Stevens suggested that maybe you could


have a reasonable accommodation theory but that's not in

this case.  It is possible that the language of 42 U.S.C.


12112(b)(6), which embodies the Americans with


Disabilities Act disparate impact principles, could be


used to challenge the neutral policy.  But whatever else


is true, when an employer applies a neutral policy, it has


not engaged in disparate treatment on the basis of


disability.


Now, if I can get back to the summary judgment


question.  I think there's two reasons why we thought


summary judgment was -- would be appropriate for the


employer. 


One is as suggested by Mr. Phillips.  In


footnote 17, after the court of appeals finishes with its 

pretext analysis, it seems to suggest that there's really


no dispute that both sides agree that this policy was


invoked.  And I think in -- in looking through the lower


court record, it doesn't seem like the gravamen of the


respondent's case was that the policy doesn't exist.  It


was more a -- a suggestion that whether or not you have a


policy, as to me in particular that's not the reason for


the discharge, and the best evidence of that, of course,


is the letter that George Medina sent to the EEOC.


QUESTION:  You mean the best evidence supporting


the plaintiff.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Yes, the best evidence that the


plaintiff has is that letter to the EEOC from Mr. Medina. 


And, of course, that letter suggests that it was more


complicated than simply application of a neutral policy,


and it's for that reason that the EEOC issued a -- a cause


to sue letter.


Unfortunately, though, Mr. -- Mr. Medina was not


the ultimate decision maker in this case.  That was Joanne


Bockmiller.  And the record is clear -- and this is at


joint appendix 51a and then 64a.  It's clear that Ms.


Bockmiller did not participate in the preparation of that


Medina letter.


QUESTION: 


Then why did the company --

QUESTION:  I don't know that -- I don't know


that that's enough, though, to defeat summary judgment.  A


jury is entitled to disbelieve any witness I believe, even


though perhaps the -- you don't show any bias on the part


of the witness. 


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that's


not the way I read this Court's decision in Anderson


against Liberty Lobby, which seems to suggest that simply


the possibility that the jury will not disbelieve


testimony even if there's no other evidence that draws


that testimony into question --

 QUESTION:  But there is. 


MR. CLEMENT:  -- it's not enough. 


QUESTION:  You mentioned Medina, Medina's


letter, which says, look, we -- we refused to hire this


person because he didn't show -- he didn't show that he


was no longer an addict.


MR. CLEMENT:  And I think that if the Medina --


certainly if Medina were the decision maker or even one of


the decision makers in this case --


QUESTION:  But didn't the company designate him


to put in the response to EEOC?


MR. CLEMENT:  They certainly did, but the -- the


facts of this case are that Bockmiller was the ultimate


decision maker.  And in Hazen Paper, this Court suggested


that in these kind of disparate treatment cases, what


you're looking for is if --


QUESTION:  What is the relative position in the


company?  I had the impression that Medina was a higher


level employee than Bockmiller.


MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's correct, Justice


Ginsburg, but at the end of the day, he just wasn't the


decision maker. 


I think, though, I -- I've made our position


clear, which is when you have a case where there's an

ultimate decision maker who suggests a neutral policy was


involved, our position would be a -- a straight statement


by somebody who was not involved in -- directly in the


decision making process shouldn't preclude summary


judgment. 


I do want to be clear, though, that that really


is the less important issue for the -- from the


Government's perspective because the Ninth Circuit's


decision in this case does embody the position that this


kind of neutral policy, assuming it exists for a moment,


is somehow per se unlawful as applied to drug addicts. 


And I think, again as Justice Stevens suggested, there may


be ways that a plaintiff could try to go after such a 

neutral policy.  They could suggest that it -- that under


a reasonable accommodation theory, a reasonable


accommodation must be given.  But if that were brought


forward, I think an employer would have an opportunity to


say, no, that reasonable accommodation imposes an undue


hardship. 


In similar fashion -- and I would say this.  I


think if you look at the statute as a whole, the provision


of the statute that most specifically speaks to a neutral


qualification criteria that is alleged to have a disparate


impact on individuals with a disability is -- is 42 U.S.C.

12112(b)(6).


QUESTION:  Well, there's no disparate impact


case here.  That was not raised, was it?


MR. CLEMENT:  No, that was not raised.


QUESTION:  I don't know what about the


reasonable accommodation theory.  The Ninth Circuit didn't


address that. 


MR. CLEMENT:  They --


QUESTION:  Was that a claim?


MR. CLEMENT:  No, that was never addressed in


the lower courts.


QUESTION:  No.  That's what I thought.  So we


don't have to get into that.


MR. CLEMENT:  You don't have to get in, and we


would suggest that you not definitively resolve the


reasonable accommodation issue or the disparate impact


theory.


But that doesn't mean that it's sort of harmless


error if the Ninth Circuit opinion stays on the book


because the Ninth Circuit assumes that the answer to the


question on reasonable accommodation is that you could


never justify such a policy.  You'd always have to grant a


reasonable accommodation.


The Ninth Circuit opinion assumes that there

would be a disparate impact even when there's not or even


if the employer could justify the policy as job-related


and consistent with business necessity. 


I wanted to be responsive to Justice Stevens'


question, though, even though I think this Court should


ultimately not reach it.  With respect to reasonable


accommodation, there's no question that reasonable


accommodation applies in the application process.  And so


if you have -- for example, if you're going -- an employer


wants to give a application test for the job, and puts it


in a facility that's not wheelchair accessible, that


reasonable accommodation would have to be given, and that


would be a reasonable accommodation in the hiring process.


I do think, though, that subsection (b)(6) 

addresses very directly a neutral qualification standard


that's alleged to screen out an individual with a


disability or to tend to screen out an individual with a


disability.  And with respect to that claim, that would


trigger the employer's burden to come forward and show


that the requirement was job-related and consistent with


business necessity.


One of the real sort of ironies, if you will, of


the Ninth Circuit's opinion is on the same page of the


opinion and in consecutive footnotes, after they -- they

clearly hold that the disparate impact theory is not in


this case, they also fault the employer for not justifying


the neutral rule as consistent with business necessity. 


But the business necessity defense, as its status as a


defense, suggests is not some sort of free-floating


obligation on the employer, especially in a disparate


treatment case where the employer has already pointed to a


neutral and legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for their


actions.  The business necessity defense comes into a case


when a plaintiff has properly preserved a claim under


subsection (b)(6) and triggers the obligation of the


employer to come through.


I would like to also point out, though, that we


largely agree with Mr. Phillips that there is -- there is 

much in 42 U.S.C. 12114(c)(4) that suggests that there may


be a basis for an employer to maintain this kind of


neutral policy, and I think an employer may be able to use


that section as a defense. 


I would agree with Justice Stevens that it


doesn't speak directly to this situation because all it


does is allow -- with respect to current drug users who


aren't entitled to any protection under the act, it


clarifies that an employer can apply a neutral


qualification standard, and it doesn't matter whether the

underlying misconduct has its roots in -- in drug use or


drug addiction.  And I think it doesn't directly say it,


but implicit in that provision is the idea that an


employer can use uniform and neutral sanctions for


violations of those uniform conduct rules. 


The difficult question becomes whether or not


there's something special about a bar on re-employment,


when you say that if you violate our conduct rules not


only are you terminated, but you need never darken our


door again.  And I think with respect to that kind of


policy, there are two -- the act, in a sense, points in


two different directions.  On the one hand, the act draws


a clear distinction between current drug users who are --


who are not protected by the act and draws a distinction 

between recovered addicts who are protected by the act. 


In --in any event, the Court can reconcile those competing


policies in a subsequent case.


QUESTION:  Thank you very much, Mr. Clement.


Mr. Montoya, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN G. MONTOYA


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. MONTOYA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the court made

it emphatically clear that there were two predicates for


its decision.  One was a traditional discriminatory impact


analysis, what Raytheon's intent was upon dismissal.  And


this is all very clear, reprinted at page 12a and 13a of


the appendix.  The court says that Mr. Hernandez has,


quote, presented sufficient evidence from which a jury can


conclude -- could conclude that he was qualified for the


position he sought in 1994 and that is application was


rejected because of his record of drug -- drug addiction. 


Period.  Additionally -- and then it goes to the question


of whether or not this alleged uniform practice is, in


fact, valid under the Americans with Disability Act.  So


there are two grounds for the decision. 


And moreover, because this could be a mixed 

motive case, even if this Court concludes that the alleged


oral practice is valid, the case would still have to be


remanded because you -- even if the employer had a valid


reason to terminate Mr. Hernandez, if it also had a mixed


motive and the other motive was invalid, it was -- he was


also terminated and based upon his history of drug and


alcohol addiction, the case has to be resolved by a jury. 


And the question --


QUESTION:  Mr. Montoya, I'd like to go back to


the opening statement you made because you -- you said

this was a legitimate disparate impact case, but looking


on that same page in the footnote, the Ninth Circuit is


agreeing with the district court that because Hernandez


failed to timely raise disparate impact, this has got to


be a disparate treatment case.


MR. MONTOYA:  Your Honor, I misspoke.  If I said


disparate impact, I meant to say discriminatory intent. 


The question of Raytheon's intent.  Did it apply this


alleged uniform practice or did it discriminatorily intend


to terminate Mr. Hernandez because he has this record of


drug and alcohol addiction?  They're distinct bases.


QUESTION:  You don't mean terminate.  You mean


refuse to hire.


MR. MONTOYA:  Refuse to hire, yes.  I -- I --


and -- and both --


QUESTION:  I mean, that makes good sense, but


how do you reconcile that with footnote -- footnote 17? 


It says, there is no question, the court says, that Hughes


applied its automatic policy, this policy, in rejecting


Hernandez's application.  I mean, I -- it boggles the


mind. 


MR. MONTOYA:  Your Honor, that is a -- I -- I


can't resolve that.

than footnotes.


MR. MONTOYA:  I do, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  That's not unreasonable.


MR. MONTOYA:  -- because that footnote is


directly contrary to the record.  In fact, in the


district --


QUESTION:  Maybe the law clerks wrote the


footnotes and the judges wrote the text. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. MONTOYA:  I won't speculate on that, Your


Honor. 


But I -- I will say that I disagree with my


learned friends representing Raytheon that we admitted


that this oral practice was applied to Mr. Hernandez in 

this case because we don't even think that the practice


exists.  The reason why we don't think the practice exists


is because in Raytheon's first official written statement


in this very case, Raytheon doesn't mention it.  It


doesn't mention a practice.  It doesn't mention a rule. 


It doesn't represent -- or it doesn't indicate that


there's a policy.  It just says there's a right, which is


very different. 


QUESTION:  But the Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit


again, Mr. Montoya, in footnote 17 simply says there's no

question that Hughes applied this policy in rejecting


Hernandez's application.


MR. MONTOYA:  I know it says that Justice --


Chief Justice Rehnquist.  I think what the Ninth Circuit


meant in that footnote is that there's no question that


Raytheon claims that it applied that.  And I think what


the Ninth Circuit was trying to get at was that even if


Raytheon's story is true, Raytheon still doesn't


necessarily win because Raytheon's alleged practice could


be violative of the ADA as applied to Mr. Hernandez in


this particular case.  But the question of discriminatory


intent remains. 


Moreover and just as importantly, the question


of whether or not this alleged practice exists remains. 

This is an oral -- this is a right that Raytheon alleged. 


There's no -- no evidence that this rule was ever applied


to anyone else.


QUESTION:  We -- we didn't take the case to --


to determine whether -- you know, to determine that.  I


mean, I -- the court of appeals proceeded on the


assumption that it did exist, and -- and the reason we


have the case is that it is a very important proposition


of law, which the Ninth Circuit adopted, that where you


have such a policy, it will not be applicable to someone

who's a rehabilitated drug addict.


MR. MONTOYA:  Yes, that's --


QUESTION:  That's the reason we took the case,


and you're telling us we can't get to it because --


because in fact the Ninth Circuit was just wrong that


there was the policy at all.


MR. MONTOYA:  That is correct, Your Honor, and I


believe that that is a question of disputed material fact.


QUESTION:  Did -- did you raise this in your --


in your brief in opposition to certiorari?


MR. MONTOYA:  Yes, we did, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  That particular question? 


MR. MONTOYA:  Yes, we did.  We believe that the


question presented in the petitioner's cert petition is 

hypothetical because it's contingent upon at least two


dispositive material factual disputes, the question of


discriminatory intent and the question of whether or not


this uniform practice actually exists.


QUESTION:  Well, but the Ninth Circuit, I take


it, was entitled to proceed on the assumption that the


factual determination might turn out as -- as Hughes says


it is, and it then went on and gave instructions as to how


the case ought to be resolved.  And we certainly can reach


that if we think it's in error.

 MR. MONTOYA:  Yes, you can.  However, I think


that in order to reach that, you have to make a factual


assumption that might be incorrect, and I think that it


would be premature for the Court to render that assumption


or to make that assumption at this juncture because it


could be that if this case were remanded to the trial


court, jury instructions would render that aspect of this


Court's opinion moot.  For example, a jury could answer


affirmatively whether or not --


QUESTION:  Did the court of appeals exceed its


authority under Article III in making the statements it --


it did with respect to the lawfulness of the termination


policy? 


MR. MONTOYA: 


Your Honor, I think that it -- it 

certainly reached the borders of Article III.  Maybe a


declaratory judgment action could have been filed --


QUESTION:  So you think that in some later case


the Ninth Circuit would -- would say that this is not


binding on other panels?


MR. MONTOYA:  Well, it would depend upon the


facts.  If the assumed facts were identical, then perhaps


it would be binding.  However, those facts are clearly


assumptions in this particular case.


QUESTION:  Well, if -- if facts might be proven

from the record, courts of appeals routinely give


directions to the trial courts as to how the law is to be


applied, don't they?


MR. MONTOYA:  That's true, Your Honor.  However,


that makes this case much less worthy of this Court's


consideration at this juncture because even though the


Ninth Circuit is perhaps closer to the district court and


has more judicial resources to resolve those types of


declaratory questions, those questions might, once again,


be rendered moot in this particular case if the jury


concludes that there was no oral practice and that in fact


it was made up, or if the jury concludes that


notwithstanding any oral practice --

Well, that's all right, but we would 

still have achieved what we set out to achieve, and that


is to determine whether the statement of law that the


Ninth Circuit opinion sets forth is correct or not --


MR. MONTOYA:  That -- that --


QUESTION:  -- that if there -- if there is a


firing solely by reason of policy, it is nonetheless


invalid as applied to a rehabilitated drug addict.  That's


an important proposition.  We would resolve that one way


or other, even though your case might continue on.  So


what?  We don't care whether your case continues on.

 MR. MONTOYA:  Well, in -- in that -- in that


event, Justice Scalia, the answer --


QUESTION:  I mean, you care a lot.  I know that,


but that's -- that's not what's important to us.


MR. MONTOYA:  I understand. 


And -- and the answer to Raytheon's petition in


that event would be a resounding yes.  The ADA does grant


preferential rehiring rights to an employee who was


terminated for misconduct if four conditions are met.  The


misconduct was related to a disability as defined by the


ADA.  The disabled individual in question is rehabilitated


from the disabling addiction that this case concerns.  And


Raytheon is unable to establish undue hardship as an


affirmative defense. 


Raytheon is unable to establish 

business necessity as an -- as a affirmative defense.


QUESTION:  Undue hardship being under the


accommodation requirement? 


MR. MONTOYA:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  But now, the -- the court of appeals


never got to that.


MR. MONTOYA:  Well, they -- they didn't get to


it using that terminology.  However, they did get to it in


saying that this uniform rule violated the ADA as applied


to Mr. Hernandez in this particular case.

 QUESTION:  Well, but surely, if they had meant


the -- the part of the -- the part of the act that


requires accommodation, they would have said so. 


MR. MONTOYA:  Well --


QUESTION:  I mean, you're really kind of


rewriting the court of appeals' opinion, it seems to me. 


MR. MONTOYA:  Well, Your Honor, I don't know


whether you'd call it a reasonable accommodation or a


relaxation of the qualification requirement because the --


the ADA, under 12112(b)(6), does apply to qualification


standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria


that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a


disability or a class of individuals.  And that's what the


Ninth Circuit, by any other words, was talking about in 

this case.  There's a -- an alleged, a highly disputed


qualification standard that screens out this particular


individual, Mr. Joel Hernandez.


QUESTION:  What disability would you be


accommodating?


MR. MONTOYA:  You would be accommodating the


disability of disabling addiction to drugs and alcohol.


QUESTION:  He doesn't have that disability.


MR. MONTOYA:  Well, but the ADA --


QUESTION:  He used to have it but he doesn't


have it --

 MR. MONTOYA:  But the ADA -- under the


definition of disability set forth by the ADA, Justice


Scalia, someone with a record of a disability is in fact


disabled under the statute.


QUESTION:  He is in fact disabled, but -- but


what -- what disability of his are you accommodating?


MR. MONTOYA:  His former -- you're relaxing a


qualification standard that would -- that would hinder the


entrance of a reformed alcoholic who was disabled under


the statute into the job market, which is the purpose of


the ADA, not to segregate disabled individuals who can


work from the job market.


QUESTION:  But when he comes back years later,


he's not disabled. 
 I mean, I just don't see how it fits. 

MR. MONTOYA:  Well, it -- it -- Justice


O'Connor --


QUESTION:  It doesn't fit.


MR. MONTOYA:  -- it doesn't fit in --


QUESTION:  No.


MR. MONTOYA:  -- to the traditional reasonable


accommodation analysis. 


QUESTION:  No. 


MR. MONTOYA:  However, it does fit into the


statute, to the language of the statute, 12(b)(6), those


qualification standards that screen out.  Under the ADA,

those have to be relaxed.  Whether you call the relaxation


of those standards reasonable accommodation or whether you


call it something else, substantively it's the same thing. 


It is an accommodation of a qualification standard or a


relaxation of a qualification standard based upon a


particularized inquiry regarding an individual applicant. 


That's what the ADA expressly demands in the language of


the statute itself, and that's what the Ninth Circuit was


talking about in this case when it said Raytheon's alleged


uniform practice violated the ADA. 


QUESTION:  And that's what the Solicitor General


says is not really presented in this case, though.


MR. MONTOYA:  Well, it's hard to say that it's


not presented in this case, Justice Stevens, because the 

Ninth Circuit addressed that very issue.


QUESTION:  Well, they didn't address section


112, though.


MR. MONTOYA:  Well, it didn't cite 112, but it


-- it --


QUESTION:  They didn't cite it, and they said


it's not a disparate impact case, too.


MR. MONTOYA:  And I -- I think what the Ninth


Circuit meant by that, Justice Stevens, is that we're not


talking about a class of individuals treated disparately.


We're talking about one individual who was treated

discriminatorily.  And the ADA also --


QUESTION:  He's only discriminatorily treated


because he's a member of a -- of a specially defined


class, namely, reformed alcoholics and -- and drug-


addicted persons.  That for that record makes him a


disabled person.  He's kind of in a unique class.


The -- the court of appeals really did not focus


on this part of the case.


MR. MONTOYA:  Well, Your Honor, even though


there's that language regarding disparate impact, it


nevertheless ruled the way it did and said that this --


and -- and in fact, the -- the Ninth Circuit --


QUESTION:  But the ruling that it adopted, as I


understand the statute, really deprived the employer of an 

opportunity to -- to set forth any of the affirmative


defenses that would be available, business necessity, and


so forth.


MR. MONTOYA:  Well, Your Honor, the employer had


the ability to assert those affirmative defenses in its


complaint in the district court, which is part of the


record in this case, and it did not.  Undue hardship,


business necessity, direct threat, all of those --


QUESTION:  They don't need to assert those


defenses if someone was claiming a failure to accommodate,


and if that was not what was before the house, they'd have

no incentive to do that.


MR. MONTOYA:  Well, clearly, Justice Scalia, Mr.


Hernandez was challenging this rule that screened him out,


and if in fact --


QUESTION:  But why do we even get to that?  This


is -- this case is so puzzling on -- for many reasons, but


one thing is Medina or Medina said he didn't come up with


one shred of proof that he's no longer an addict, and we


are permitted -- being an addict is not a disability


within the ADA, being an addict.  Being a reformed addict


is.  So said this employer, look, he sent a letter -- he


sent a letter from his church pastor.  He sent a letter


from Alcohol Anonymous.  Maybe that shows that he's no


longer an alcoholic, but there's not one thing here that 

says he's no longer addicted to cocaine.  And there -- and


I don't -- I didn't find anything either that said that.


MR. MONTOYA:  Well -- well, Your Honor, I think


that if you construe the facts and the inferences in Mr.


Hernandez's favor, as you must, Mr. John Lyman's letter,


who is the AA sponsor, says that he is in recovery from


addiction.  And if you construe the inferences in Mr.


Hernandez's favor on a motion for summary judgment, I


think that that would also include his addiction from


other substances as well.


QUESTION:  Even though this is -- this is solely

from someone who knows him from the alcohol program. 


Isn't the most logical assumption if he's got a letter


from an AA counselor, that what they're talking about is


alcohol addiction?


MR. MONTOYA:  Yes, Your Honor.  However, because


AA offers a rehabilitation program for any type of alcohol


or substance abuse, I don't think it would really matter


in this case if you construe the facts and the inferences


in favor of Mr. Hernandez, as you must, because he was the


non-moving party in the context of a motion for summary


judgment. 


QUESTION:  The inference you want us to construe


in his favor is that alcohol means things other than


alcohol.  Is that --


MR. MONTOYA:  Well -- well --


QUESTION:  Is that a favorable inference, or is


it a wild leap into the -- into the dark?


MR. MONTOYA:  I -- I don't think it's a wild


leap into the dark, and I think it's supported by the text


of Mr. John Lyman's letter.


QUESTION:  Where is that letter so we can


look --


MR. MONTOYA:  It is appendix 14a, Justice


Ginsburg, and it says, Joel attends AA regularly,


participates in discussion when appropriate, and is

maintaining his sobriety, and is in all a good and active


member.  Mr. Hernandez is maintaining his sobriety. 


QUESTION:  Sobriety.


MR. MONTOYA:  That is a general statement.  And


there are many --


QUESTION:  Really?  I -- I -- you -- you refer


to somebody who's a recovered drug addict as he's now


sober?


MR. MONTOYA:  Yes, clean and sober.


QUESTION:  Gee, I don't think so.  I think sober


is -- refers to drunkenness.


MR. MONTOYA:  I -- I think it can refer to


any --


QUESTION:  You say a drug addict is stoned.  You


don't say he's --


(Laughter.) 


MR. MONTOYA:  Well, I -- I think -- I think that


if someone is not on drugs, someone can be described as


clean and sober.  Sober means --


QUESTION:  But in the next paragraph, it says,


Alcohol Anonymous has been demonstrated the best recovery


tool for alcoholics.


MR. MONTOYA:  That is true, Justice Ginsburg. 


QUESTION:  And it says he's -- he's committed to


this program, demonstrates his willingness to accept

responsibility for his recovery.


MR. MONTOYA:  But this letter -- this letter is


unequivocal that he was in recovery.  This letter is


unequivocal that he was maintaining his sobriety, and I --


and I contend that it is reasonable to believe that


there's more than -- alcohol is just one form of drug, and


alcohol is a drug that impacts sobriety.  There are other


drugs that impact sobriety, and cocaine impacts sobriety. 


I think that the clear import of this letter is that he is


clean and sober in all respects and is taking


responsibility for his recovery in all respects.


And the point that Justice Ginsburg brings up is


not a point that the trial court gave any credence to. 


It's not a point that the court of appeals gave any 

credence to.  And that is really the type of argument that


I would contend should be presented to the jury.  And --


and that's especially true in this case because Raytheon


claims --


QUESTION:  Whether or not summary judgment


should be granted is a question of law, not -- not a


question of fact.  And so the same arguments can be made


in -- in every court that's considering it I think. 


MR. MONTOYA:  That is -- that is correct. 


However, depending upon the weight of the evidence,


some --

 QUESTION:  The weight of the evidence has


nothing to do with summary judgment. 


MR. MONTOYA:  Well -- well, if -- if there's a


factual dispute, Justice Rehnquist, then the summary


judgment is no longer -- then summary judgment is no


longer appropriate.


What I perhaps should have stated is that this


-- this letter renders summary judgment inappropriate in


reference to the question of whether or not Mr. Hernandez


is maintaining his recovery.


QUESTION:  I thought you were going to say that


the -- what the plaintiff claimed is a witness.  The


plaintiff says, I've had this whatever the -- the moment


was. 


I reached rock bottom or whatever you called it, and 

I woke up one day and said no more and ever since then


I've been clean.  So the -- so the -- the plaintiff did --


that was the only proof.  That might not be very


convincing, but it was a statement --


MR. MONTOYA:  That -- that is true.  That is


part of the record.  And moreover and more importantly,


that is unrebutted below.  At no time in this proceedings


did Raytheon ever question Mr. Hernandez's rehabilitation. 


On July 4th of 1992 in his affidavit, Mr. Hernandez said


that he embraced Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior and


foreswear drugs and alcohol.  That is in his affidavit.

That is unrefuted. 


And more important -- and just as importantly,


Raytheon didn't subject him to an IME.  Under rule 35,


hey, you say you're -- you're rehabilitated?  Prove it. 


Let's send you to a physician to let him ascertain that. 


The question of rehabilitation is in fact a question of


fact that was not contested in the proceedings below, and


in fact --


QUESTION:  Well, all that adds up to the fact


that he was not disabled when he reapplied.  He wasn't. 


MR. MONTOYA:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  And -- and nobody is arguing that he


was.  He wasn't disabled.  So he doesn't fit under the


statute --


MR. MONTOYA:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- as a disabled person.  He wasn't


regarded as because he wasn't asked to take a test or


anything.  I mean, he just doesn't fit under the


definition of disability in the statute.  So --


QUESTION:  But he had a record of disability,


which makes him disabled within the meaning of the


statute.


MR. MONTOYA:  Yes, that is true, Justice


Stevens.  And Justice O'Connor, in fact, in George


Medina's letter, he says that there's a complete lack of

evidence indicating successful drug rehabilitation,


indicating that Raytheon believed that he was still


addicted.  And not only does Raytheon say that once in a


footnote in its position statement, it also says it again. 


Mr. --


QUESTION:  Of course, if he's still addicted,


then he's not protected by the act.


MR. MONTOYA:  Well, they -- it's a false belief


that they believe he's addicted.  And -- and if he's


regarded as taking drugs and alcohol and is -- and is


disabled as a result of that addiction, then he is


regarded as disabled under the act, which is exactly what


Raytheon said in writing in its first official statement


regarding this case. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Montoya, in your -- you say now


that you question the existence of such a rule, and yet


you've had an opportunity for discovery in the district


court and you didn't try to pursue any kind of disparate


impact.  I -- I don't see that you ever asked any


questions about, well, let's look at this rule.  Do you


apply it to people who were let go for stealing or


whatever other reasons?  You never, never tested the rule.


MR. MONTOYA:  Your Honor, the rule was tested in


the context of the deposition examination of the only two


witnesses that Raytheon produced who testified about the


46

rule:  Bockmiller and Medina.


And, first of all, no one knew the genesis of


the rule where -- or -- or not -- they didn't even


describe it as a rule.  In the depositions, they described


it as a practice, and they didn't know the origin of the


practice.  They didn't know how often it had been applied. 


They didn't know why it hadn't been written down.


And moreover and -- and very importantly, this


oral practice contradicted Raytheon's written practices. 


For example, under Raytheon's written rules, a temporary


employee who tests positive for drugs and alcohol, quote,


will have their assignment terminated and will not be


eligible for assignment or for regular employment for the


succeeding 12 months. 


So Raytheon has a written rule that 

is actually contrary to its alleged oral practice, which


impeaches the testimony regarding the existence of the


written rule.  If a temporary employee tests positive for


drugs and alcohol, the temporary employee is terminated,


but can reapply even for permanent employment -- temporary


or permanent employment within 12 months.  That impeaches


the very existence of the alleged oral practice.  In


fact --


QUESTION:  I still don't understand why you


didn't follow up those two depositions with


interrogatories, saying what is the origin of this

practice.  How long have you had it?  To whom have you


applied it?  The company certainly would have records of


the people that they've discharged for cause, how many of


them had applied to be re-hired.


MR. MONTOYA:  That's true, Justice Ginsburg. 


However, that's a two-edged sword.  Raytheon also didn't


adduce any evidence of its application to any other


individual and that would actually be Raytheon's burden. 


If we, as the Ninth Circuit concluded, established a prima


facie case, then it's Raytheon's duty to rebut that prima


facie case with some form of evidence.  The only evidence


that Raytheon produced in reference to this oral practice


was the testimony of Bockmiller and Medina, and they


didn't adduce any applications of this rule either.  So if


you look at the totality of evidence, actually that


deficit in the record cuts against Raytheon and in favor


of Mr. Hernandez.


QUESTION:  Mr. Montoya, I -- I hope -- you don't


have much time left.  I hope you will -- just give me an


answer to the only question in this case that I care


about.  And I don't care about all these factual


controversies.  They can be sorted out later.

for misconduct.  Okay?  It has a right to do that, and --


and it is not a -- an instance of disparate treatment. 


What is your response? 


MR. MONTOYA:  Your --


QUESTION:  Is it anything other than the -- the


need for accommodating a disability?  Is -- is that the


only reason why it is unlawful?


MR. MONTOYA:  No, that's not the only reason. 


If -- if I understand your question, Justice Scalia, it's


not only a question of reasonable accommodation, it's also


a question of whether or not he's the most qualified. 


It's also a question of whether or not he constitutes a


direct threat or his rehiring would give rise to an undue


hardship or was justified by a business necessity. 

QUESTION:  But that's -- that's all -- those are


all categories under the need to accommodate.  Right?


MR. MONTOYA:  Yes, Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  Apart -- apart -- assuming that --


assuming that I don't think that issue was raised in the


case, is there any other reason why it would have been


unlawful, assuming that they were simply implementing a


policy? 


MR. MONTOYA:  Yes, Your Honor.  Based upon


12(b)(6), the screen out or tend to screen out, this


screened out this particular individual, and in that

respect, Justice Scalia, I believe that this case is very


analogous to the Court's opinion in PGA v. Martin where


you have a uniform rule that someone claims is not subject


to any exception.  I think that this rule violates the


ADA, as the Ninth Circuit concluded because this rule is


the antithesis of a particularized inquiry that the case


law demands a disabled applicant or a disabled employee


receive under the Americans with Disability Act.


If Your Honors have no further questions, I'll


thank you.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Montoya.


Mr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


It seems to me that there are two ways to look


at this case.  One is you can simply take the court of


appeals at its word, which is to say we think there's a


question for -- that -- that defeats summary judgment on a


prima facie case, but when we get to the question of what


the policy is of the -- of the employer in this case,


there's no dispute about that, the employer's policy was


applied, and then address the question of whether or not


that policy is valid under the ADA.


I have not heard Mr. Montoya yet attempt to

defend that -- that holding in the face of a disparate


treatment theory in this case.  He puts in disparate


impact under 12(b)(6).  He puts in reasonable


accommodation, 112(b)(6) and 112(b)(5).  Those are not


issues that were decided below.  They were not the theory


of the court of appeals. 


This is a decision that has extraordinary


implications because thousands of employers have precisely


this rule.  It is important for this Court to declare that


that rule is valid. 


On the secondary question -- and that is, can


the Court get to that question?  I think there's no doubt


that the Court ought to just follow the court of appeals'


logic on that.  But if the Court wanted to look at whether


or not there is a question of fact as to whether or not


this person was discriminated against because of his


disability, I submit to you that the record does not


permit a jury to make that finding under this Court's


decision in Reeves. 


Bockmiller was the decision maker.  She


testified, without contradiction, that she never looked


past the summary sheet that said he was discharged because


of conduct, and that was it.  And she didn't have to look


beyond that.


Medina testified, without contradiction, that

that is the policy that applies.  She applied it in the


right way.  We do it consistently.  It would have made no


difference whether he was a thief or whether he was


somebody who used drugs.  We applied it that way.


Mr. Montoya and his client had 2 years to


discover whether that policy existed, whether it had


exceptions, whether it was applied in any other particular


way, and there is not one shred of evidence -- he didn't


even ask those witnesses if there were flaws in the way


they applied it.  That is absolutely across the board.


The only -- and -- and then, you know, this is a


policy that exists.  Thousands of employers use precisely


this policy, which is why frankly it probably isn't


written down. 


And so at the end of the day, there is nothing


on the other side of this except the one statement that


was sufficient to justify getting beyond the prima facie


stage of this case, but that is not sufficient to justify


taking this to a conclusion or to raise an issue of fact


as to whether or not he was discriminated against because


of his disability.  He was acted against because he


violated the company policy.  That policy is valid under


the ADA, at least as it's been litigated at this point,


and for that reason the Court should reverse and enter


judgment in our favor.
