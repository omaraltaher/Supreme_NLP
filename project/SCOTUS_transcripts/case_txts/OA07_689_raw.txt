 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear argument 

first this morning in Case 07-689, Bartlett v. 
Strickland.

 Mr. Browning.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BROWNING:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 The Voting Rights Act should be interpreted in 
such a way as to encourage a transition to a society 
where race no longer matters.  In North Carolina, 
coalition districts have been crucial in moving towards 
Congress's ultimate goal.  Coalition districts bring 
races together by fostering political alliances across 
racial lines.  As a result they serve to diminish racial 
polarization over time.  Coalition districts help us in 
reaching the point where race will no longer matter in 
drawing district lines.  These districts bring us one 
step closer to fulfilling our Nation's moral and ethical 
obligation to create an integrated society.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How can you say that 
this brings us closer to a situation where race will not 
matter when it expands the number of situations in which

redistricting authorities have to consider race?

 MR. BROWNING:  Well, Your Honor, 

Mr. Chief Justice, it will require somewhat an increase 
in the number of districts that would be drawn, there is 
no question about that, but that increase is not 
substantial.  But it does cause race to be much less of 
a factor in the redistricting process.  Currently, if a 
General Assembly has a choice between drawing a 
coalition district or a majority-minority district, the 
50 percent rule that the North Carolina Supreme Court 
adopted encourages States to draw a majority-minority 
district, and when you do that it causes race to re-
dominate in the process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me to be 

a criticism of the majority-minority district approach 
in the first place.

 MR. BROWNING:  Well, Your Honor, it is a 

recognition of the fact that coalition districts allow 
us to move away from majority-minority districts and 
create districts where races are working together.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about influence 

districts?

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you move --
you've moved from majority-minority to crossover

districts.  Should you continue to move to so-called 
influence districts?

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, the decision in 

LULAC makes clear that influence districts are not 
protected under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But under your definition 

of coalition district, race is the key factor.

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you are telling us if 
we have a rule that makes race the key factor then race 
doesn't matter.

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, it is a matter of 
-- under the Voting Rights Act, Congress has made clear 
that districts should be drawn to protect minority 
voting rights.  When there are areas of the country 
where there is racial polarization, districts -- race 
has to be considered in drawing districts that will give 
minorities equal opportunity, just as majority --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought you were 

proposing a brave new world of coalition districts.
 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, and race --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Based on race.
 MR. BROWNING:  Justice Kennedy, you have to 

consider race in drawing these districts.  There's no 
question about that.  That's the very thing that section

2 of the Voting Rights Act requires us to do.  And you 
do that because there is racial polarization.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's the authority that 

says you must consider race in drawing the districts, 
assuming that you don't have an existing majority --
minority-majority district?  What's the -- what 
authority do you cite for the fact that you must 
consider race in drawing districts?  What do I read to 
find that?

 MR. BROWNING:  Well, Your Honor, that's 

certainly the decision in Thornburg v. Gingles.  Under 
--

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, that's -- that's a 

majority -- majority district.

 MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.  That was a 

majority district.  This Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay.  So then what other 

case do you have?

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, this Court, of 
course, has left open the issue of whether the Voting 
Rights Act would protect minority --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, then your statement 
that you must always consider race in drawing districts 
is not -- is not supported, or at least it's a new 
proposition that you are arguing for us here.

MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, my point is when 

you are drawing districts under section 2, of course 
race has to be considered, but it's considered because 
the process is not equally open to minorities. 
Unfortunately, North Carolina has a long history of 
discrimination, and that discrimination has resulted in 
current effects in the voting place.  There is racially 
polarized voting, as has been stipulated to in this 
case.  There has been --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I would have 
thought the possibility of coalition districts would be 
evidence that the Voting Rights Act has succeeded, 
rather than evidence that you need to apply it more 
broadly.

 MR. BROWNING:  Mr. Chief Justice, the 

coalition districts are certainly evidence that we have 
made progress towards Congress's ultimate goal under the 
Voting Rights Act, but we are not there yet.  In this 
district, the expert testimony is that only 15 to 30 
percent of whites will vote for a black candidate, and 
that is still very racially polarized.  But coalition 
districts help us to move away.  It -- they help to 
diminish the amount of racial polarization over time, so 
that eventually we won't need to be looking at race at 
all in drawing district lines, but where --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I mean, the 
obvious question when you say 15 to 30 percent is what 
number of crossover voters would you say demonstrates 
that you no longer need to consider race in shifting a 
coalition district?

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, in the Gingles 

case, this Court stated that it was a district-by-
district determination.  There's no bright-line rule as 
to where crossover voting is so great that it doesn't 
satisfy the third Gingles prong.  Here, however, the 
district was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course, it could 

be 70 percent that don't vote for a particular 
candidate.  At some point you have to conclude that it's 
based on the candidate rather than on race.

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, at some point 
that's true, that it would be issues beyond race, but 
here, the expert report and as stipulated to by 
Respondents, this voting is racially polarized.  There 
is some crossover voting, but not enough to say that the 
effects of past discrimination have been eliminated. 
That crossover voting is sufficient for this district to 
work.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You can't say where -- how 

much crossover voting would be so large as to make a

difference?  You can't say where the line is 
statistically?

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, this Court's, 
again, decision in Gingles makes clear that that is a 
district-by-district determination.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that -- that has been 
stipulated here, right, that you meet the third Gingles 
factor?  So it's not at issue in this case, but the 
point was made that, in one of the cases that you rely 
on, in Metts, that reliance on crossovers to prove the 
ability to elect the candidate of a racial minority's 
choosing undercuts the argument that the majority votes 
as a bloc against the minority preferred candidates.  So 
there's tension between the crossovers on the one hand 
and showing that the dominant race votes as a bloc.

 MR. BROWNING:  Justice Ginsburg, I 

completely agree that, at some point, the crossover 
voting becomes so great that you no longer have to take 
into account district lines.  Unfortunately --

JUSTICE ALITO:  If that's the case, then --
MR. BROWNING:  -- we're not there yet.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  If that's the case, then 
your test imposes a statistical standard just as your 
opponent's test does, doesn't it?  It's just a different 
one.

MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.  What we're 
proposing and what we think is required by the text of 
section 2 is you simply take the existing Gingles 
factors and you look at the amount of racially polarized 
voting, and from that you are able to readily calculate 
the size of the minority group that would be 
sufficiently large to elect a minority -- a minority 
candidate.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose there is 40 percent 
crossover voting, and that's a little bit -- that's not 
quite enough for the minority candidate to win.

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, again, whether 

the third Gingles prong is satisfied obviously is a 
district-by-district determination.  Here, however --
JUSTICE ALITO:  We can't even say that 40 

percent would be sufficient in every instance, that that 
might be -- you know, that might not be enough?

 MR. BROWNING:  I'm hesitant since this Court 

has not set a specific limit, and that's, again, an 
issue that has been stipulated to in this case.  The --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you don't suggest 

that if there were 40 percent white crossover voting, we 
would find white bloc voting within the Gingles 
condition, do you?  Do you think that is a serious 
possibility?

MR. BROWNING:  No, I think it would be very, 

very unrealistic that you'd have 40 percent --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but I mean you really 

do have an answer to Justice Alito's question.

 MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is the answer? 
What percentage of crossover voting would make this not 
actionable under section 2?

 MR. BROWNING:  Again, the third prong is not 

an aspect of this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you don't have an 

answer to Justice Alito's question?

 (Laughter.)
 MR. BROWNING:  If you are saying that 40 

percent is a very high amount of crossover voting, that, 
of course, is not our case, where the crossover voting 
that is necessary to make this coalition district work 
is 18 percent crossover voting.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have racially 

polarized voting when you have as high a crossover vote 
as 40 percent?  I mean, you say, we apply the normal 
Gingles factors, but it seems to me 40 percent crossover 
is fairly high.

 MR. BROWNING:  40 percent is a high number, 

and particularly --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you still think that we 

can confidently say this is racially polarized?

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, here, however, 

under this case, there's not 40 percent crossover --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you're opening 

yourself to this line of questioning about the third 
factor, which is conceded by both sides, so it's not in 
issue.  But you are opening it by having a test that 
looks to the second and third factor and leaves the 
first factor out of it.  I mean, whether you agree with 
it or not, the 50 percent line is bright if you know 
what's in and what's out.  You don't have any test for 
the first factor that's comparable, that would give 
district courts and attorneys some degree of security 
about how you determine the first factor.

 MR. BROWNING:  Well, Your Honor, as the 
language the Court used in the De Grandy decision is 
whether the minority group is sufficiently large to 
elect a minority-preferred candidate.  There are, of 
course, limiting factors on the side of the coalition 
district which could be drawn.  There are practical 
limiting factors and there are legal limitations.

 The practical limitation, of course, is in 

North Carolina, given what has happened in past 
elections, the North Carolina General Assembly

appropriately concluded that a minority group of less 
than 40 percent would simply not work, that it would not 
be effective to give rise to a minority -- a district in 
which minorities elect a minority-preferred candidate.
 There's also a legal limitation.  In the 
Court's decision in LULAC, the Court made clear that 
influence districts are not protected by section 2.  So 
as a result, the minority group will by necessity have 
to control its coalition partner; otherwise it would 
simply be an influence district.  And here at a minority 
group of 40 percent, the minority group in the area is 
substantially larger than the crossover voting that is 
needed to have an ability to elect.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under your theory, 
it would be possible to challenge a majority-minority 
district on the ground that you could draw a different 
coalition district, maybe more than one coalition 
district.  Let's put it that way.

 If you could draw a majority-minority 

district and you could draw two crossover districts, 
does the Voting Rights Act impose a limit on the choice?
 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, our position is 

that the -- assuming all of the factors under Gingles to 
be met, that if you have a minority group that was 
packed in to a -- one district, and in its place two

coalition districts could be effectively drawn, and 
those districts would actually work and you could meet 
all of the other standards under Gingles -- the district 
was geographically compact, there is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's an easy -- I 
suspect that's a common hypothetical.  You could draw a 
district with 80 percent minority voters or you could 
have, as you have here, two 40 percent districts.  And 
the Voting Rights Act requires what?

 MR. BROWNING:  In that situation, assuming 
you could meet all of the Gingles factors, that, yes, 
that 80 percent district should be drawn as two 40 
percent districts.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Aren't you adopting the 

principle of maximization?

 MR. BROWNING:  No, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let me ask you this, and 
correct me if I am wrong, because it has been a long 
time since Gingles came along and I may be forgetting 
things.  But I -- I thought when you are given the 
alternatives you were just giving, one 80 percent and 
two 40 percents, that because there is not a principle 
of maximization there simply is not an abstract or 
bright-line answer to the question; and that in order to 
get an answer to the question, you look at all of the

other things that districting authorities look to, and 
you see how they add up, whether we are talking about 
compactness, congruency with -- with -- with other 
political lines, and so on.  And unless you look to all 
the other things that reasonably can and should be take 
into consideration when districting is done, you simply 
cannot answer the question, should there be two 40's or 
one 80.

 Am I wrong?
 MR. BROWNING:  Well, Justice Souter, 

certainly the -- the criteria that you have referred to 
have to be part of the districting process.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But they weren't part of 

your answer to the Chief Justice.

 MR. BROWNING:  Well, my point is that when 

minorities are basically put in an enclave, in a 
separate district but yet it is possible to draw two 
districts, two coalition districts, and the other prongs 
of Gingles have not been met, so that there is not rough 
proportionality throughout the State, yes, the 
districting body needs to consider drawing two 
districts --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  It needs to consider it, 
but I thought your answer was it needs to do it.  Is 
that your answer?

MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor, it would 

be -- it is our answer that if a district -- if there is 
not rough proportionality in a State, there is a 
district that is a super-majority and there is no reason 
for that super-majority to be in place.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay if there is no reason 

for the super-majority.  My point is that you cannot 
answer the question in the abstract.  And when you start 
to answer it, as you are doing now, you are going beyond 
the abstract and you are getting into facts outside the 
mere choice between two 40's and one 80.  And that seems 
to me to be correct.  At least, if it's not correct, you 
and I are making the same mistake.

 MR. BROWNING:  No, Justice Souter, your 

point is well taken and I agree that with a hypothetical 
like that it's very difficult, unless you are actually 
considering the specific situation of the district.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we -- what you 

propose is going to inject courts into the drawing of 
districts much more frequently than they -- than they 
already are injected.  The reality is that one of the 
factors -- you mentioned contiguousness and county lines 
and so forth, but one of the factors that legislators 
always take into account is incumbent protection and the 
incumbent is always going to rather be in an 80 percent

district than in a so-called 40 percent coalition 
district.

 I think you are unrealistic to expect State 
legislatures to draw districts that way, where everybody 
will have a chance.  The whole object of it is that 
nobody will have a chance, just the incumbents.  That's 
what is going on.

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, I think what 
Congress has required courts to do is to look at the 
overall picture of the district.  The Congress, in 
connection with the section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 
used very broad language, phrases like "totality of 
circumstances" and "opportunity to participate and 
elect."  So clearly, Congress intended for a broad 
approach to be taken and a functional one.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's fine, but you 

just can't wave a magic wand.  It -- Congress also 
intended primarily to leave it up to the legislatures 
under guidelines, to be sure.  And when you have a 
choice of one 80 percent or two or even three 40 
percent, it's clear to me what the legislature is going 
to -- going to choose.

 MR. BROWNING:  Well, Your Honor, and that's 

the very point of the section 2 of the Voting Rights 
Act, is when minorities do not have equal opportunity to

elect their candidate of choice, where they are packed 
in to districts --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We will be injected into 
this very political game much more frequently than we 
now are.  I have always regarded the 50 percent Gingles 
thing as simply a self-protection prescription for the 
courts, where you can look, you can be clear and say, 
you know, close enough for government work.

 But if you want us to figure out whether 

there could be three districts, two districts instead of 
just one district, you are just, it seems to me, tossing 
the whole -- the whole project of drawing districts into 
the courts.  And that is -- that is not something that 
I, for one, favor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  In this case which way 

does the presumption favoring what the legislature did 
cut?  Here the court set aside what the legislature did; 
is that not right?

 MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor, the North 
Carolina Supreme Court determined that this district 
should not cut county lines.  Ironically, that county 
line was a county line that was originally created to 
segregate blacks in Wilmington, in the southern portion 
of the county, from whites in the northern portion of 
the county.

So that original discriminatory act is now 

being used to keep a district from -- from being a place 
that is a district that has a proven ability to elect a 
minority --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's something new.  I 

thought we took the case -- at least I have been 
thinking about the case -- on the assumption that there 
is a valid State law that is being superseded.  Now, if 
you are questioning the validity of the State law, 
that's something -- that hasn't been raised here, has 
it?

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, the government 

has asserted that there should be a near-50 percent test 
which includes as part of it a -- either the district is 
close to 50 percent or there is an element of 
discrimination.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm talking about, you're 
indicating to us that the county line standard that the 
State court invoked as a matter of State law is itself 
questionable because it was based on a prohibited racial 
animus.  And I -- I indicated that that's very new to 
me.  I thought we were taking the case on the 
proposition that the county line rule is a neutral, 
valid State law principle.

the -- by the requirement of section 2.  That's what we 
are arguing about.  But this is the first time I have 
heard that we have to somehow question the underlying 
State rule under the Fourteenth Amendment.

 I thought we took the case on the assumption 

that the State rule is valid.

 MR. BROWNING:  Justice Kennedy, the decision 

of the North Carolina Supreme Court is to adopt an 
inflexible 50 percent rule.  That -- that was the issue 
that was resolved on summary judgment by the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm talking about the 

county line rule.

 MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor, that the 
county line rule -- the North Carolina Supreme Court 
concluded that this district could not cut county lines 
because this should not be treated as a section 
2 district.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We are fighting 

over -- the district that you want to draw, the 
crossover district, would have 39 percent 
African-American voters.  The district that complied 
with State law of the county line would have 35 percent.

 Where the assumption is that you have a 

significant degree of crossover voting, is that really a 
difference worth changing the Voting Rights Act

jurisprudence for?

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, the plaintiffs 

have and the Respondent and the government have referred 
to an alternative district that would not cut those 
county lines and would have a black voting age 
population of 35 percent.  The problem with that is 
there is absolutely no testimony that that -- their 
alternative district would be in any way workable.  As a 
matter of fact, the undisputed testimony of the joint 
appendix at page 73-74 is to the contrary.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you mean by 

"workable"?

 MR. BROWNING:  That this -- that the 

district they propose was simply prepared by their 
attorney, looking at a map.  There is absolutely no 
testimony that this would be an effective minority 
district, that there would be an equal opportunity for 
minorities --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because it's 4 

percent less than the district you propose?

 MR. BROWNING:  Well, it is a matter of the 

percentage of voting age population, but more 
importantly, the district they drew would have put a 
black incumbent, a black Democrat incumbent, in the same 
district with a white Republican incumbent.  If they

were serious about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it gets back to 

the Justice Scalia's point --

MR. BROWNING:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that this is 

designed to protect incumbents.

 MR. BROWNING:  Well, Your Honor, incumbency 

certainly has to be considered in the context of what 
the Voting Rights Act requires us to do, which is to 
look at the total picture.  Is it a functional approach? 
It is a matter of looking -- undertaking a searching 
evaluation of the past and present political realities.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Browning, I thought 

there was something in the record that said never in 
North Carolina's history have you had African Americans 
able to choose the -- able to elect the candidate of 
their choice where the minority population was less than 
38.37 percent.

 MR. BROWNING:  Justice Ginsburg, there are 
districts such as Wake County, the seat of government, 
where a minority has been elected with less than 38 
percent.  But in areas of the State where there is 
highly racially polarized voting, 38 percent roughly is 
the effective floor that the General Assembly recognized 
as being workable for creating a district such as this.

I will also note that this issue was not presented to 
the North Carolina Supreme Court, the issue of whether 
there is an alternative district that would somehow be 
feasible and workable.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, does that mean a 

proposal if you succeed, we should remand on that 
question?

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, that would 

certainly be one possibility, but the North Carolina 
Supreme Court resolved this straight legal question as 
to whether the 50 percent rule is in place and is an --
is an inflexible rule, and not only did they -- they 
imposed this rule with respect to this district, they 
essentially had a mandatory injunction on the North 
Carolina General Assembly to never draw a district at 
less than 50 percent if it cuts too many county lines; 
and that is even inconsistent with the United States' 
view of section 2.  For that reason, alone the decision 
should be reversed.

 If there are no other questions I would like 

to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. 

Browning.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. THURMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court.

 The rule proposed by Petitioners in this 
case would effectively require maximization resulting 
in, as the Court has recognized, judicial involvement in 
many, many more situations.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't know why it would 
require maximization.  It would -- it would certainly 
open the door to -- to more districts required by 
section 2 than if we have a 50 percent rule.  But I -- I 
think your brother conceded that when -- when you draw a 
district, you are bound by our case law as well as 
tradition to look to something more than maximization, 
and maximization is in fact not the law.  So I don't see 
why it would be required.

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, in this situation, 

we take the position that the people of North Carolina 
and their ultimate authority, their State Constitution, 
have spoken and said that county lines should be kept 
whole to the extent practical.  And the State's position 
is the legislators disregarded that and, based on the 
cases, based on LULAC, at 25 percent --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What's that got to do with 

maximization?

MR. THURMAN:  Well, Your Honor, that would 
be the position they would take of every district that 
could be drawn regardless of the --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  There is no question that 
if they are -- if they win this case, I think there is 
no question there will be more claims requiring -- or 
potentially more claims requiring adjustment of lines 
based on avoiding section 2 violation.  I would almost 
think that was common ground.  But that is a different 
thing from saying that the result of those claims is 
going to be a required maximization.  And that's --
that's the only point that I -- that I meant to pick --
pick up on.

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, it seems that if 

there are going to be more potential claims, and as 
every legislative body, school board, city council, 
whatever it is, has to follow section 2, they will have 
to take this into account.  They will be facing 
potential claims and they will have to run the risk of 
do we look to try to maximize a district that might not 
otherwise be required, that might violate a neutral 
criteria --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  You are saying they will 

tend to maximization in order to avoid litigation.

absolutely true.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why in the -- why in 

the world would you stipulate to bloc voting in a 
situation where you have nearly 20 percent crossover 
voting?

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, the answer to that 

question is we were 20 months into the litigation, we 
had just received a partial ruling on cross motions for 
summary judgment, we were already at the midpoint of the 
decade.  If this Court should affirm the North Carolina 
Supreme Court, my client will have one election in which 
they have a district that complies with the North 
Carolina Constitution.  We quite simply wanted to move 
the case along.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it seems 

to me you have complicated situations on a rather 
critical point, what seems to me a basic conundrum, how 
can you have bloc voting and at the same time have 
significant crossover voting?  You take one of those off 
the table, it's kind of hard to address the basic issue 
in the case.

 MR. THURMAN:  I agree, Your Honor.  The 
other point that I would point out is, it is not a 
stipulation that there was sufficient bloc voting within

either of the districts that were drawn.  The 
stipulation was with reference to bloc voting within the 
two counties.  The district that could be drawn -- there 
is no stipulation that the alternative district does not 
comply and would -- and therefore would require the 
creation of the 39 percent district.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, since the district is 

drawn from the counties and there's a stipulation with 
respect to the counties, doesn't it follow in the 
absence of some surprising fact that there would be bloc 
voting or the stipulation would cover bloc voting in the 
district?

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, there are very 

different populations in these two counties, and that is 
referenced in the record with regards to the growth in 
population; and there is very different minority 
populations in the two counties because of the influx --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  But regardless, regardless 
of the -- the variations in mix, if you are stipulating 
that there's bloc voting in county A, bloc voting in 
county B, and you have got a district made up part of A, 
part of B, doesn't it follow in -- in the absence of 
some pretty specific evidence to the contrary, that in 
the district there is probably going to be bloc voting?

respectfully submit that it does not follow within a 
particular section of a district.  I think we all --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Do you have evidence in the 

record -- did you put evidence in the record that this 
particular district is carved from some peculiar section 
of county A and county B, so that the general bloc 
voting pattern does not apply in the district?

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, there is evidence 

in the record, and it is cited in the brief, that 
minority candidates, black candidates for judicial 
office and for State auditor received between 59 percent 
and 62 percent of the vote in the proposed district.  We 
would respectfully submit that that comprises evidence 
that there is not sufficient bloc voting.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you stipulated.  You 

didn't want to argue the third factor.  You wanted --
you just started out by saying you were tired of this 
litigation, we wanted to concentrate on one issue and 
one issue only, and that was the 50 percent rule.  And 
now you are suggesting that, well, no, the stipulation 
really didn't stipulate away the third factor.  I 
thought you were giving in on that issue so that you 
could get the first issue decided.

stipulation that there was evidence sufficient to 
support a finding and that we would stand by.  There was 
evidence they had an expert who was willing to so 
testify.  I was responding to Justice Souter's question 
of was there was evidence in the record to support the 
contention that there might not be bloc voting within 
the alternative district, and that was -- that meant 
that black candidates can receive in excess of 60 
percent of the vote in the 35 percent district.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But just help me on the 

facts, because I may have misunderstood the facts. 
You're saying you did not stipulate that there was bloc 
voting; you stipulated that there was sufficient 
evidence for a factfinder to find that there was bloc 
voting.  Is that your position?

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, on page 130a of 

the -- I believe this is their submission, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sorry, what -- what's 
the color of the brief -- of the cover on this?  Is it 
the brown one or the white one?

 MR. THURMAN:  I believe this is the white 

one, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.
 MR. THURMAN:  And it starts out that, in 

terms of the bloc voting, between the -- and the 
evidence presented by the defendant is sufficient to 
support a finding of fact that the racial difference in 
the presence of those results in the white majority 
voting is sufficient as a bloc to defeat the minority's 
preferred candidate.  And, again, that comes down to --
the court that it was Pender and New Hanover County that 
started the action on 29a, and that was the stipulation. 
And --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But what do you make of the 

-- the beginning of the next paragraph?  "Plaintiffs 
hereby advise the court that they do not wish to be 
heard further or to present evidence regarding the 
remaining issues."  Doesn't -- I'm not sure what that's 
getting at, but when I looked at it, I thought it meant 
that the stipulation can control, i.e., it may be found 
without objection that there is bloc voting or assumed 
without objection that there is bloc voting.

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  If you don't wish to 

present evidence.

that it was in evidence, that the court defined --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, I realize, but when 

you then say "And we don't wish to present any evidence 
on it," it sounds to me as though you are conceding the 
issue.

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, we do -- we let it 
stand on its own, we not wish to be heard further, we do 
not wish to take additional time on that, given the 
circumstances of the case.

 The other factor that I think is perhaps 

most important in considering this is touched on briefly 
earlier.  Section 2 clearly applies to all 
jurisdictions.  And without the guidance of the 50 
percent rule, the bodies that are drafting are left with 
an uncertain standard and a standard -- in this case, so 
far as we know, the State had retroactive -- this Court 
-- had been used previously, are every local government 
body requires paying such an expert to proceed simply to 
redistrict?  That, if you don't have a clear rule to 
follow, presents a problem for the many government 
bodies that have to redistrict on a regular basis.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was wrong with the 
clear rule that Justice Souter suggested in the LULAC 
case?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Justice Souter, in his 

opinion in the LULAC case --

MR. THURMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: --

he suggested what he 

called a hard-edged -- a clear, hard-edged rule which is 
not going to be an exclusive rule, but, anyway, if you 
met that standard, you're okay.

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, I certainly am not 

criticizing the rule proposed by Justice Souter, but --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  It's okay.
 (Laughter.)
 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, I think -- the 
perspective -- and I can't help -- that it is not as 
clear-edged as it seemed to the Court, at least to 
Justice Souter, that the 50 percent rule does provide a 
very clear, very limited sort of a rule that can be 
followed without getting involved in -- I do believe 
that -- race becomes very likely the predominant factor 
in the redistricting decision, because based on the 
cases that have come before you already, there have been 
claims that 26 percent, 25 percent --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see how those 

claims could possibly succeed, but I thought -- let's go 
back to sort of step 1.  My mind turns a little confused 
when I start thinking of these cases.  Are we talking

about a case of -- where the claim is normally vote 
dilution?  Is that yes or no?

 MR. THURMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Section 2 -- does vote 

dilution mean we who are a minority group, let's say a 
black group, could have elected a candidate of our 
choice more likely than the white group, but because you 
are engaged in vote dilution, that isn't going to happen 
anymore?  Is that the form of the claim?

 MR. THURMAN:  Yes, Your Honor, that is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the form of the 

claim.

 Then, it's our problem here that to see 
whether that's so, you have to see whether the black 
group did really vote as a group.  Did they used to have 
a good chance to elect the person they want, and does 
the white group tend to also vote as a group and swamp 
them?  Is that what we are trying to find out?

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, I'm not sure that 

is entirely what we are trying to find out, because 
certainly districts are created where there was no 
minority incumbent, and that can happen because of 
changes in demographics or a variety --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There are a lot of reasons 
that can happen.  But is the evil we are trying to get

at, the evil of a black group, when they stick together 
in polarized voting, having less of a chance of getting 
their candidate elected than when the white group does 
the same?

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, I believe the 
answer is, yes, we are trying to prevent that from 
happening.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what we are trying 

to prevent?  Okay.  If that's what we are trying to 
prevent, then haven't we learned that putting a 
threshold, because you can't even get in the door -- you 
can't even get in the door -- unless the black group 
accounted for 50 percent of something, the voters or the 
people who turn out, that that doesn't make much sense 
for the reason that Justice Scalia started with.  It 
doesn't make much sense because sometimes they account 
for 51 percent, but they can't elect anybody, because 
they all divide on four different people, or maybe they 
didn't turn out.  On the other hand, sometimes if they 
account for 43 percent, they could elect the candidate 
of their choice.  So it looks as if that 50 percent is 
pretty arbitrary and we're looking for a better 
criterion.  Is there anything wrong with what I've said 
so far?

believe there is, because you said you look to see if 
there is vote dilution.  Well, there needs to be 
something to measure that by.  Section 5 is about 
retrogression.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Here what we've -- could we 
look to see whether the three Gingles factors, whatever 
they are -- one was, is the black group numerous enough 
to elect the candidates of their choice?  Reasonably 
compact, politically cohesive?  And then you look to 
see, does the white group tend to vote as a bloc to stop 
them?

 MR. THURMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what we should do?
 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Then I'm back to my 

problem, that sometimes the 50 percent criteria just 
doesn't measure that first part.  And so you say, well, 
any other matter would be worse, but I bet we could 
invent some that were actually better.  Suppose you 
wouldn't have to go to 20 percent; suppose, for example, 
you started looking in the 40 percents, and you said, 
you know, if the black group is going to elect their 
candidate with 40 percent, or 45 percent even, they're 
going to need a lot of crossovers, because they may only 
vote -- you know, only 80 percent may turn out.  They

are going to need a lot of crossovers.  And the more 
crossovers you have to have, the harder it is to say 
that that white group is out there trying to beat them.

 So there's a kind of natural stopping place. 

When I worked out the numbers, it seemed that natural 
stopping place fell around 42-43 percent.  It sort of 
fell -- as you said, that the black group -- you insist 
that the black group had to be twice as many as the 
white group that crossed over.  A little arbitrary, but 
at least we were getting to the same -- to the right 
thing.  I mean -- respond as you wish.

 MR. THURMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.  It may 
take me a second to take it all in.  It seems to me that 
the reason the 50 percent rule does work is, at 50 
percent, there is a claim that there is the opportunity 
and there is voter registration, voter turnout, a lot of 
factors that can influence at that point, but that 
doesn't prevent there from being opportunity.  That's 
the choice of whatever group is involved.  You start 
dropping below 50 percent, and then they're not being 
denied an equal opportunity.  They have the same 
opportunity any other group does.  This would require 
trying to -- because what -- basically the Petitioner's 
position is -- the State in its -- position is, it takes 
a minority group, and then you find presumably another

majority group that shares political and partisan goals 
with them, and you combine those two together.  So you 
look not only to the race of one group -- that 
predominates first.  Then you go find like-minded 
members of the majority group to join with them.  And so 
that is what is being required.  At that point you are 
not talking about them being treated less equal than 
anyone else.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Thurman, can I ask you 

this question?  It seems to me that a rigid 51 percent 
rule assumes that the minority communities throughout 
the country are all alike, and that there is enough 
variety in every district and every part of the country 
where we have this problem.  There are variations. 
Maybe 51 percent would not be enough.  The minority 
group might, itself, be divided as is often the case.

 I -- I think the underlying premise -- the 
underlying -- the premise underlying your argument is 
that all minorities are exactly alike.  That's why we 
can have this mathematical figure, and that answers the 
question.

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, I categorically 
reject that as a human-rights basis for our argument. 
That is handled by the third Gingles prong and the 
second Gingles prong.  And when you look at what the

coalition is, what it is, and you look at how 
politically cohesive it is.  So it could be that 50 
percent is arguably not enough under the second Gingles 
provision.

 But that until you get to 50 percent, you 
are -- again, it is the way it has been described as a 
gate-keeping function for us to keep the Court out of 
it.  And it is going to -- if this happens, you start 
looking at combining a combination of race or other 
minority status and partisan politics and combining them 
together for the purpose of electing particular 
candidates.  And I do not believe it's ever been 
something that this Court has endorsed for the purpose 
of the Voting Rights Act.  And if that is the position 
it takes, it starts to run into the issue:  Is such 
supportable under the Solomon case, under equal 
protection?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 

What -- what 

Justice Breyer proposed a rule at the end of his 
question.  He said:  Suppose you make it, the threshold, 
instead of 50 percent, it would be twice as many in the 
African-American population as in the crossover group. 
That would be the threshold.

 MR. THURMAN:  But, Your Honor, first, I 

believe as he said, as Justice Breyer said, that's an

arbitrary number that he picked up on, the 50 percent. 
The reason we would submit that is not simply an 
arbitrary number is that it does deal with them.  At 
that point there is an opportunity, regardless of 
whether there is the -- what it certainly does not 
exist --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But -- but you are saying 

it's an opportunity, and what you mean is it is 
sufficient to provide an opportunity.  And 
Justice Breyer's question is:  Isn't the two-to-one 
ratio something that we should consider as also being 
sufficient to provide an opportunity?

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, I would say that 

that would not be appropriate, because at that point you 
are looking on -- at the basis of race to give one group 
a greater opportunity than another, and the Voting 
Rights Act is the one group being given less opportunity 
than another.  And so if you are hinting to draw a 
district that bases itself on race, that attempts to 
give one group --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it's -- it's a 

greater opportunity than -- than would be given to them 
in -- in the district or a pair of districts that splits 
the minority population in half.  But how is it in some 
abstract sense a greater opportunity?

MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  The opportunities are --

are measured on the ground, not in the abstract.

 MR. THURMAN:  Your Honor, my answer to that 

would be that the -- what would be proposed is it is 
required.  It is no longer left up to the legislature to 
decide whether that is appropriate.  And that since it 
is a requirement, that is not part of the political 
process; and it goes to whether that is -- they are no 
longer looking to what they have left, but whether they 
are, in fact, given more.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Petitioner has proposed expansion of section 

2's traditional coverage because of three serious 
problems.  The first is to provide State and local 
legislatures, as well as the courts, with a baseline 
against which to when a section 2 District must be drawn 
in the first place, when to engage in this race-

40

Alderson Reporting Company

conscious exercise in the first place.

 Second, it raises the serious Constitutional 

concerns identified in LULAC, especially because it 
combines not only racial gerrymandering but with 
political-party gerrymandering all at the same time.

 And third, it requires difficult predictive 
judgments about how people would react, how people would 
vote in a future proposed district, something that is 
not required under the traditional Gingles analysis.

 And these problems would exist nationwide 
because section 2 applies to every districting done in 
every jurisdiction and every -- nationwide, be it a 
county, city, or locality or down to the school-board or 
city-council level.

 Now, under the first of those points, under 
the traditional Gingles test, the scope of consideration 
of race and other things, as well as the majority limit 
of the districts -- and that provides an -- an easy 
focal point that anyone drawing a district knows.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought you were 

conceding that it isn't a rigid rule, and that the North 
Carolina Supreme Court should have to be -- I mean they 
could be 48 percent, I think you said.

 MR.  JOSEFFER:  We have identified two 

narrow exceptions, neither of which the Court really

needs to reach in this case.  The first is an inference 
of intentional discrimination.  And the important thing 
there is, first, that's academic.  Because if you can 
prove intentional discrimination, you can proceed with a 
constitutional claim under section 2 and not add 
anything anyway.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Intentional by those who 

draw the district?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes, exactly.  And there --

the point here is because it's not an actualization 
statute, one needs a baseline to determine if there is 
the denial of an equal opportunity to elect.  And if, in 
fact, what the people drawing the district were trying 
to do was to deprive the minority group of that 
opportunity, that is a perfectly good alternative 
baseline.

 Our other proposed narrow exception, which 

also is not even close to being implicated here, is 
basically an evidentiary one:  That there are those 
cases where, when you are trying to figure out whether 
the majority population is above 50 percent, you may not 
be sure because these are estimates.  They are very 
reliable, but we would impose about a two percent 
cushion there to adjust -- to account for the 
possibility that if there is that much evidentiary

uncertainty, it makes sense to have a -- for purposes of 
that test.  However --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't know if you 

litigate whether you are -- whether you are really 
talking about a -- a possible two percent variation.  So 
that I mean, I -- I think you have to concede under your 
-- under your test that there's going to be more 
litigation.  There is going to be more claims than there 
are under a 50 percent rule.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, because -- I say 

actually the opposite because -- well, I think that 
trying to determine 48percent raises no more difficulty 
than trying to determine 50 percent.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Except that you have a 

better chance so you are more likely to do it.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  There is -- there is a slight 

narrowing of the -- of the --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Two percent is pretty big 

in an election.

 MR.  JOSEFFER:  Well, in -- in practice -- I 

mean, remember, the majority-minority rule has been 
followed in almost every jurisdiction nationwide for 
more than two decades, and so far I have seen one 48 
percent case.  There may have been others, but there --
there don't seem to have been very many.

JUSTICE BREYER:  If you want an absolute, 
arbitrary rule, which is what you were heading toward 
which will just -- - the question is whether they get in 
the door.  If they are in the door, they have to prove 
the three factors.  And you want to keep certain people 
out.

 Okay.  Suppose you say, well, 42 percent. 
That gives you down to 40, with your two back, instead 
of 50.  But you are out anyway if the crossover vote 
from the white majority is more than half of what the 
whole vote is with the black and white together on that 
side.  So you have a two-to-one ratio.

 Now, the only virtue of that is that there 

was an effort to try to get an arbitrary rule, which you 
have with your 50 percent, even -- only a little bit 
more difficult than that to -- to administer, and is 
likely to get in more cases that are justified.  But 
they still have to prove their three factors.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, there -- there are a 

couple of things.  The first is that, textually 
speaking, what the statute refers to is an equal 
opportunity to elect the -- the representative of their 
choice.  And at least the most principal blind is the 
majority-minority rule.  Because if you have by 
yourselves the majority of the electorate, you have at

least in theory the opportunity to elect the 
representative of your choice.  When you go beyond that, 
there really is at that point --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It takes into account the 
realistic fact that in every group, including lots of 
African-American groups, there is -- it is not 
100 percent African American at all.  There are -- there 
are a few others who will come along, and -- and that's 
still the candidate of that community's choice.
 MR. JOSEFFER:  Right.  But that's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So we want -- a little 

flexibility here is all that I'm suggesting.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes.  The problem is once you 

go below what is at least in principle a 50 percent 
line, it's not clear where -- where one would ever stop. 
And under your approach, I think two exceptions:  One, 
you definitely open the door down to potentially below 
42, especially -- in this case, especially --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You can't get below 42. 

I'm not going to get below 40 no matter what, even with 
your thumb on the scale.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  I mean --
JUSTICE BREYER:  They are -- they are 

finished at 40, and they are not even in at 40, if they 
have to depend more than two-to-one on the crossovers.

MR. JOSEFFER:  One problem with what you are 

looking for is a principle rule that can be justified. 
I understand 50, and I understand the slight evidentiary 
cushion.  Forty-two really does -- from what you're 
trying to determine is now the equal opportunity to be 
coming out of nowhere.

 The other advantage the 50 percent rule has 
is the advantages of incumbency.  In effect, it has been 
a case that has been litigated for more than two 
decades.  And that has shown that, first, that it's 
workable; and second, that it does not appear to have 
left some gaping hole of section 2's coverage.  If it 
had, Congress likely would have -- statute over the past 
two decades.

 And the other thing -- I'm sorry.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I won -- I'd hoped that 

you could have a brief time to discuss your third 
rationale because it's going to require determination of 
how people would vote.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Under Gingles one typically 
looks at what actually happened in the past.  The third 
Gingles factor looks, for example, looks to whether 
white bloc voting in actual elections has generally been 
sufficient to prevent the election of minority group's 
candidate of choice in the past.  So, it's a

straightforward historic-based inquiry.

 Here, however, the state or local 

legislature at the outset looking to trade a new 
district based on the prediction that it will elect the 
minority group's candidate of choice.

 So, as a practical matter, you start with 

the racial makeup of some people and the political 
partisanship of others.  But you can't stop there, 
because you have to predict turnout by each group, 
crossover voting by each group.

 As a practical matter, those things will 

vary based on who the candidates are, whether there is 
an incumbent, whether the incumbent is the minority 
group's candidate of choice.  And especially in local 
elections, the -- may not even be available, which was a 
point that was made in the topside amicus brief filed by 
the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, the NAACP Legal 
Defense Fund and others.

 If I could turn to the Constitutional --

point.  In that perspective, this proposal is really the 
worst of all worlds, because the way you construct a 
district is to take some people based on race, others 
based on political party affiliation, and the race can't 
dominate and the majority of courts have also held 
purely partisan gerrymandering, at least -- aside is

also unconstitutional.

 But this is both.  What you have is 

nationwide in every jurisdiction, every districting a 
mandate that requires consideration for both race and 
partisanship that goes far beyond what has traditionally 
been required under section 2 and I suspected far beyond 
what normally happens at the local level.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have a view 
on how we should approach the stipulation adopted below?
 MR. JOSEFFER:  I think the easy way to cut 

through is that a state Supreme Court respond and remand 
all arguments other than the first Gingles factor.  So, 
the first Gingles factor, based on what happened in the 
state Supreme Court is the only thing that is before the 
Court.

 What would remain potentially unremand is if 

this Court were to would ban the traditional 
understanding of the first Gingles factor and impose a 
new understanding.  Then the adjudication of that might 
be open on remand.  But Respondents have remanded 
everything else in the state Supreme Court.

 Finally, I also can't help but mention that 

there is a great irony here in that Petitioners' 
essential position is that back when race relations were 
worse and back when there's much more racial bloc

voting, minority-majority districts worked okay.

 But now that race relations have improved 
and there is much more crossover voting, we should now 
require greater consideration of race as well as 
partisanship than had ever been done before under the 
same unamended statute.

 And if I could turn -- Justice's -- at the 

outset, a state or local legislature as well as the 
court really doesn't know where to start.  State and 
local legislatures are the ones who are supposed to be 
drawing these lines.  That means they need to be clear 
administrable rules to follow.  And the simpler they 
are, the better the chance we will have to do it, and if 
they can figure it out at the outset, the less 
consideration of race and partisanship becomes 
necessary.

 And the 50 percent rule, as a practical 
matter, has worked for a couple of decades in this 
respect.  And if one goes beyond that, there is also no 
principle stopping point.  Here's 39 percent, which 
doesn't seem close to me or under Justice Breyer's 
rationale --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  You mention how well it 

worked.  Did you see the graphs -- one of Amicus briefs

one gerrymander and how the lesser percentage worked 
out -- remember which were much more -- not using the 50 
percent rule produced much more compact districts?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  There are two things about 

the graphs.  The first is that less compact maps --
those were the districts that would determine the 
unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But they were designed to 
produce 50 percent, and that's why they got so -- so --
so grotesque.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Right.  Another thing there 

seems to be a common misconception that our view of 
section 2 prohibits the drafting of crossover districts, 
which is not case of all.

 The question here is what if it is required. 

If a district -- if a jurisdiction wants to draw a 
crossover district, then at least in principle nothing 
is stopping it from doing so.  However, if what you were 
to do was require the drawing these crossover districts, 
that could create some funny maps of its own, because if 
you have to reach out to grab jurisdiction wide, look at 
every significant pocket of minority voters, look at 
whatever you could put together that would vote alike, 
which as a practical matter is the same political party, 
then you are going to be requiring the same dynamics

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BROWNING:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
 Let me start first of all with 

Justice Breyer's question about the arbitrary nature of 
the 50 percent rule.  The 50 percent rule, let there be 
no doubt, is extremely arbitrary, even under the 
government's 2 percent cushion.

 What would happen is you have a district 

that is 40 percent -- 46 percent African American, that 
district could be freely carved off into two districts 
of 23 percent each, neither of which would provide an 
equal opportunity to elect.  Even when you are in a 
situation like this case, where the district is actually 
functioning and has a proven ability to elect a minority 
preferred candidate.  Moreover --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Wouldn't Justice Breyer's 40 

percent rule be just as arbitrary?

important to recognize that there are significant 
districts that are out there that would not be protected 
under the 50 percent rule.  And I understand the Court's 
desire to have some sort of limitation on the size of 
the district.  We believe it is already in there, in 
place as a result of the LULAC decision.

 It's in place because in North Carolina, as 
a practical matter, you can't go much below 40 percent 
and have a district that will actually work.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this -- but yours is 

below?  Just slightly below.

 MR. BROWNING:  The voting age population is 

39.36 percent based upon the census data.  The 
government wants to use a 2 percent cushion as their 
threshold.  But there is some significant problems with 
that, because when you look at the overcount of white 
voters, the Census Bureau recognizes the lower count is 
basically 2 percent there in and of itself, then there 
are some undercounted black voters is a 1 percent 
undercount.  So even a 48 percent doesn't even get 
anywhere close.

 Moreover, you have districts where there are 

a number of eligible -- number of people that are 
counted in the census that are not truly eligible to 
vote.  That is reflected in the brief by the States at

there are many districts where we have military bases, 
we have colleges that cause this to be an extremely 
arbitrary rule.

 And in North Carolina there are districts 
where once you remove the military base where most of 
the population will not be voting in that district, 
there is a shift of even 12 percent in the minority 
voting age population increasing by 12 percent once you 
just remove the military bases from the equation.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The rule I suggested, 

though there are arbitrary aspects is a better targeted, 
more administrable -- or equally administrable or not 
much worse administrable arbitrary rule.

 MR. BROWNING:  Justice Breyer, in our view 
the rule that should be applied is consistent with the 
rule of LULAC, that the minority group is substantially 
larger than its coalition partner.

 Here the minority group is 39.36 percent 

African American.  It only requires an additional 
roughly 11 percent white crossover voting.  So the white 
crossover voting that is needed is only a third of the 
size of the minority group.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There must be somebody 

there to get you over 50 percent.

MR. BROWNING:  I'm sorry?
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Thirty-three plus 11 is 44. 

So where does the rest come from?

 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, this district is 

39.36 percent African American.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's 40, and then -- oh, 

I see, 39 plus 11.

 MR. BROWNING:  And you need 11 percent 

crossover voting, 11 percent of the electorate --

JUSTICE BREYER:  If they vote cohesively.
 MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.  Here the 
minority group, the expert's testimony is that they do 
vote cohesively.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's a necessary 
predicate to his very question that the majority group, 
the white group does not vote cohesively.  Under your 
hypothetical at least 11 percent have to swing over.

 MR. BROWNING:  The -- the white vote does 
not vote 100 percent cohesively.  But it is still at 
such high levels, there is only a limited amount of 
crossover voting.  It is still very racially polarized. 
And if district lines are not taken into account, the --
the votes of black voters in the district will be 
drowned out by the white voters that are voting against 
that minority candidate simply because that candidate is

a minority.

 There is some crossover voting, but not 

enough to make the -- for us to lose on the third 
Gingles prong.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the
