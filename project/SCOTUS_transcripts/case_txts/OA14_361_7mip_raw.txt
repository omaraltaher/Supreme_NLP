(10:05  a.m.) 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­361,  Ocasio  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States. 

 

            

Mr.  Davis. 

 

            

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ETHAN  P.  DAVIS 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  Hobbs  Act  requires  that  a  defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

obtain  property  from  another.  In  this  case,  Mr.  Ocasio 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  charged  with  conspiring  with  the  owners  of  a  repair 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shop  not  to  obtain  property  from  another,  but  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owners  themselves. 

 

            

The  plain  language  of  the  Hobbs  Act  resolves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case.  When  two  people  agree  that  one  will  pay  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  a  bribe,  they  have  merely  agreed  to  exchange 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  between  themselves,  not  to  obtain  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another.  The  historical  background,  the  statutory 

  

 

 

 

 

structure,  and  basic  criminal  ­­ principles  of  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  all  point  in  the  same  direction.  There  are  no  old 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

English  or  State  cases  involving  conspiracies  to  extort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  from  a  co­conspirator. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Does  that  mean  that  you

would  have  to  ­­ in  order  to  get  at  this  ­­ this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venture,  you  would  have  to  bring  two  separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutions,  one  against  your  client  for  the  extortion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  a  separate  crime  ­­ a  separate  prosecution  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

State  court  against  the  body  shop  owners? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Yes,  Justice  Ginsburg,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

that  is  correct.  Maryland  has  a  bribery  statute  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

might  apply  in  a  situation  like  this.  And  Congress  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed  a  bribery  statute  targeted  to  bribery  of  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  local  officials,  18  U.S.C.  666,  that  may  or  may  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  to  the  repair  shop  owners.  But  we  don't  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  could  be  convicted  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Is  it  ­­ is  it  well 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

established,  or  even  not  well  established,  that  you  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtaining  property  under  color  of  law  when  you  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  a  bribe? 

   

            

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  seems  to  me  ­­ what  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  to  me  under  color  of  law  is  you  ­­ you  pretend  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  legal  right  to  it,  which  in  fact  you  don't  have. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Justice  Scalia,  until  1992,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  was  an  open  question,  but  this  Court  decided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Evans  v.  United  States  in  '92  that  Hobbs  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extortion  encompasses  the  paying  of  ­­ of  bribes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  dissented,  I  assume.

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  You  did.  But,  Your  Honor,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  that  ­­ the  decision  in  Evans  was  really  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

high­water  mark  of  this  Court's  Hobbs  Act  jurisprudence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  since  then  the  Court  has  been  careful  not  to  expand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Hobbs  Act  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  we  have  stated  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  person  may  be  liable  for  conspiracy  even  though  he  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incapable  of  committing  the  substantive  offense.  Does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  carry  the  day  for  the  government's  argument  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  is  that  distinguishable  at  principle? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  I  think  that's  distinguishable 

    

 

 

 

in  principle,  Justice  Kennedy. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  why? 

  

 

 

MR.  DAVIS:  Well,  certainly  not  every 

  

 

 

 

 

conspirator  must  personally  commit  every  element  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  offense. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  he  might  not  even  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

capable  of  it,  must  not  even  be  capable  of  it,  as  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  what  we've  said. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

Must  ­­ need  not  even  be  capable  of  committing  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  of  the  substantive  offense,  but  each  conspirator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must  specifically  intend  that  someone  commit  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  of  the  substantive  offense.  And  ­­

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  why  isn't  that  test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied  here,  because  the  shop  owners  agreed  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Ocasio  would  commit  every  element  of  the  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense? 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  The  shop  owners,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

agree  that  Mr.  Ocasio  would  obtain  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another,  not  from  themselves.  So  I  think  that  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  the  ­­ the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Ocasio  is  committing  every  element  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  offense.  He  is  obtaining  property  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

another;  that  is,  he's  obtaining  property  from  the  body 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shop  owners.  And  the  body  shop  owners  agreed  that  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  do  so. 

 

 

            

So  it  seems  to  me  that  in  the  normal  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  conspiracy  law  works,  there  is  a  conspiracy  here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Justice  Kagan,  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

that's  quite  right.  I  think  that  there  must  be  a  unity 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  purpose  in  conspiracy  law.  And  the  ­­ Mr.  Ocasio  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  agreed  to  obtain  property  from  another,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

body  shop  owners  agreed  to  obtain  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves;  so  there's  no  unity  of  purpose. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  They  only  need  to  agree  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  should  obtain  property  from  another,  and  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  what  they  agreed  to. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Justice  Kagan,  I  think  the  best

way  to  approach  your  question  is  through  imagining  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  would  happen  in  ordinary  English.  The  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  a  John  and  Susan  ­­ has  its  response  to  our  John  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Susan  hypothetical  in  its  brief.  It  says,  John  would  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Susan  and  say,  let  us  agree  that  I  will  obtain 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  from  another,  namely,  you.  And  you  notice  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  work  the  words  "namely  you"  are  doing  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  hypothetical.  They're  redefining  the  word 

  

 

 

 

 

"another"  to  mean  the  opposite  of  its  ordinary  meaning, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Is  that  any  stranger  than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Mann  Act  situation,  where  the  woman  who  is  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transported  across  State  lines  for  immoral  purposes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspires  with  the  person  who  is  transporting  her  across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  lines?  That's  permissible,  isn't  it? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Justice  Alito,  I  think  yes,  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is.  And  two  distinctions  from  the  Mann  Act  cases:  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  is  that  the  Mann  Act  used  the  phrase  "any  woman," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  "another  woman."  I  think  that  case  would  have  been 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  if  it  had  used  the  phrase  "another  woman." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  "any  woman"  is  broader 

  

 

 

 

 

 

than  "another  woman."  "Any  woman"  means  any  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.5  billion­plus  women  in  the  world,  and  that  subsumes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"another  woman,"  doesn't  it? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  I  don't  think  so,  Your  Honor.  I

mean,  I  think  that  if  a  woman  agreed  to  transport  any 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

woman,  it  makes  sense  to  think  that  she  could  transport 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

herself  across  State  lines,  but  if  the  statute  had  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"another  woman,"  it  doesn't  make  sense  to  say  that  she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  transported  another  woman  when  she  was  merely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transporting  herself. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  they're  two  different 

  

 

 

 

 

words,  but  the  syntactical  problem  seems  to  me  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical,  which  is  that  it's  just  not  natural  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  transported  woman  is  herself  transporting  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

woman,  right?  I  mean,  the  transported  woman  is  not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

transporting  any  woman. 

 

 

            

But  the  reason  the  Court  said  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  was  possible  there  was  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transported  woman  could  agree  with  another  person,  let's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  the  man,  that  the  man  would  transport  any  woman, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

namely,  herself.  It's  ­­ it's  an  almost  identical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

syntactical  issue. 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  I  don't  think  so,  Your  Honor.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  transporting  another  woman  would  create  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  bigger  textual  issue  than  transporting  any  woman. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  woman  goes  to  the  man  who  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transporting  her  and  says,  I'd  like  to  help  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transport  another  woman,  he  would  think  that  she  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  someone  else,  not  about  herself.  It's

much  more  natural  in  the  context  of  "any  woman." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

The  other  reason  those  cases  are 

 

 

 

distinguishable,  Your  Honor,  is  because  they  use  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verb  "transport"  instead  of  "obtain."  It's  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceivable  to  transport  yourself;  it's  not  really  ­­ it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  really  make  sense  to  obtain  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yourself. 

            

So  I  think  those  are  distinguishable  on 

   

 

 

 

 

those  grounds. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  difference  did  it 

  

 

 

 

 

make  in  this  ­­ you're  ­­ you're  not  contesting  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extortion  convictions,  right?  You  ­­ it's  only  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor,  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

an  asterisk,  and  that  is  if  we  were  to  prevail  here,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  go  back  to  the  Fourth  Circuit  and  ask  to  vacate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  substantive  convictions  also  on  the  basis  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spillover  prejudice. 

 

            

But  for  purposes  of  this  appeal,  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  did  the  addition  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  conspiracy  conviction  affect  the  sentence? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Would  it  have  been  different  if  there  had

concurrently.  The  difference  it  made  was  $600  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution  payments  that  were  attributable  to  two  acts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  extortion  that  were  not  charged  as  substantive  counts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  indictment. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  have  a  small  question, 

    

   

 

 

but  not  unimportant,  which  is:  Who  paid  the  bribe, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Majestic  or  the  brothers? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  The  brothers  paid  the  bribes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  out  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Out  of  their  own 

  

 

 

 

 

pockets,  or  did  they  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Out  of  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ Majestic,  issue  a 

  

 

 

 

 

check? 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Out  of  the  Majestic  bank 

  

 

 

 

 

 

account,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  why  isn't  Majestic 

  

 

 

 

 

the  other  person  here? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Your  Honor,  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

forfeited  any  argument  that  Majestic  is  the  "another"  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  raising  it  at  any  ­­ at  any  stage  in  this  Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ either  in  its  cert  stage  briefing  or  in  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Was  Majestic  a  separate 

   

  

 

 

corporation  or  was  it  just  the  proprietorship­owned? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  The  record  is  a  little  unclear

on  that  point.  The  testimony,  to  the  extent  it  shows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything,  shows  that  Majestic  was  an  LLC  and  then  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

became  a  corporation  at  some  point  later.  It's  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

clear  when. 

 

            

But  I  think  the  government  didn't  raise  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

argument  for  a  good  reason,  and  that's  because  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  also  showed  that  Moreno  and  Mejia  were  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sole  owners  of  Majestic,  and  that  there  was  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  them  in  practical  effect. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  ­­ in  practice,  the  money  really  came 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  ­­ from  Moreno  and  Mejia,  not  from  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  Moreno  and  Mejia  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

two  ­­ are  two  people;  they're  not  the  same  person, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  So  I  assume  even  if  it  was  ­­ let's  say  it  was  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partnership,  they  each  would  be  entitled  to  half  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money,  right? 

 

            

correct. 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  I  think  that's  ­­ that's 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  Moreno  could  conspire 

  

 

 

 

 

with  Ocasio  to  obtain  money  from  Mejia  and  Mejia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  conspire  with  Ocasio  to  obtain  money  from  Moreno. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Your  Honor,  I  don't  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  theory  works  in  this  case  because  the  bribes  came 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  them  jointly.  The  payments  came  from  them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

together.  They  ­­ they  were  both  aware  of  what  each

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Did  this  government  argue 

  

 

 

 

 

this  proposition  as  its  theory  of  the  case  in  the  trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  or  here? 

 

 

            

Your  Honor. 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  No,  not  that  theory  of  the  case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You  ­­ you  acknowledge  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ that  the  police  officer  is  ­­ is  guilty  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  the  Hobbs  Act,  never  mind  the  conspiracy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  just  the  Hobbs  Act  violation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  We're  not  directly  challenging 

  

 

 

 

 

that  here,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  if  you  don't  ­­ if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  don't  challenge  that  here,  I  ­­ as  I  recall,  your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs  say  that  to  disagree  with  you  in  this  case  is  to

to  have  a  national  law  against  bribery,  it  seems  to  me. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  just  get  one  of  the  two,  I  don't  think  you  have  to

MR.  DAVIS:  Well,  Your  Honor,  if  ­­ if  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  were  to  extend  Evans  in  this  case  to  cover  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  the  public  official  side  of  the  transaction  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  the  private  citizen  side  of  the  transaction,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  a  dramatic  expansion  of  the  law  of  bribery.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  Evans  may  or  may  not  have  been  ­­ have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct,  but  I  think  it  was  the  high­water  mark,  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  been  careful  not  to  ­­ not  to  extend  it  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  in  the  years  since. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  about  ­­ what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

do  you  do  with  the  government's  argument  that  Ocasio  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiring  with  other  police  officers  to  get  the  money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  another?  In  other  words,  that  conspiracy  got  money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  another,  the  ­­ the  two  individuals. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Two  responses  to  that,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  The  first  is  that  under  the  jury  instructions, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  could  have  convicted  Ocasio  based  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  solely  between  him  and  the  repair  shop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owners,  and  under  this  Court's  decision  in  Skilling,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ if  the  jury  could  have  returned  a  legally­invalid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict,  the  conviction  has  to  be  reversed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  that's  a  sufficient  answer  to

the  question,  but  my  second  answer  is  that  we  disagree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  government  that  there  was  sufficient  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  record  linking  Ocasio  with  other  police  officers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  evidence  showed  only  that  these  police  officers  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally  aware  of  what  each  other  were  doing.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  show  that  they  formed  an  agreement  to  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together.  And  under  this  Court's  decision  in  Kotteakos, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  a  hub­and­spokes  conspiracy  without  the  rim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

enclosing  the  spokes. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  think  if  I'm 

    

 

 

 

 

remembering  the  government's  response  to  your  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  is  that  it  certainly  would  have  been  harmless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Your  Honor,  I  find  that  response 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a  little  difficult  to  understand.  The  ­­ the  trial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overwhelmingly  focused  on  linking  Ocasio  with  Moreno  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mejia,  not  with  other  police  officers.  The  vast 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority  of  the  testimony  was  about  Moreno  and  Mejia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forming  an  agreement  with  Ocasio. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  government's  whole  case  went  through 

 

 

 

 

 

Moreno  and  Mejia.  And  the  government  would  have  had  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  more  difficult  case  if  it  had  to  prove  an  agreement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  police  officers  to  obtain  property  from  Moreno 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Mejia.  There  just  wasn't  that  much  evidence  of  such 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  agreement.

Everything,  again,  went  through  that,  hub  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Moreno  and  Mejia.  So  it's  hard  for  me  to  imagine  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  have  been  harmless  error,  let  alone  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  would  even  have  convicted  if  it  had  been  instructed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  had  to  find  an  agreement  between  multiple  police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Is  there  any  difference 

  

 

 

 

 

to  your  argument  based  on  the  government's  position  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  client  was  charged  under  the  general  conspiracy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  and  not  the  Hobbs  Act  statute? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Justice  Sotomayor,  no,  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

think  it  makes  a  difference.  The  general  conspiracy 

   

  

 

 

 

 

statute  just  leads  ­­ just  leads  the  government  straight 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  the  Hobbs  Act.  It  punishes  each  person  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspires  to  commit  an  offense  against  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States.  The  offense  gets  against  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  here  is  Hobbs  Act  extortion.  One  of  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements  is  obtaining  the  property  from  another,  so  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  general  conspiracy  statute  it  leads  right  back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Hobbs  Act  in  just  maybe  an  extra  step. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  my  problem,  which 

  

 

 

 

 

is  it's  not  an  extra  step.  You  can  conspire,  if  not

statute  do  the  work? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Well,  under  the  general 

  

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  statute,  just  like  under  the  Hobbs  Act,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  every  conspirator  has  to  specifically  intend  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  commit  every  element  of  the  crime.  I  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  been  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  is  that  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

begs  Justice  Kagan's  question,  which  is  they  wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ocasio  ­­ they  wanted  the  police  officer  to  act  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

color  of  right  and  to  take  the  bribe. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  And  I  think  the  key  problem  with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that,  Your  Honor,  is  that  the  repair  shop  owners  did  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intend  to  help  Ocasio  obtain  property  from  another. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  intended  to  help  Ocasio  obtain  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves.  And  I  think  that's  why  there's  not  a  unity 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  purpose  here. 

 

 

              

I  mean,  all  ­­ everyone  may  have  agreed  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  course  of  conduct,  like  the  government  says. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  the  only  way  the  government  can  make  its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  sound  plausible  is  by  obscuring  the  words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"from  another." 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  I  don't  think  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

right.  The  "from  another"  is  clearly  an  element  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  offense.  But  you're  saying  it  should  also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  freestanding  limit  on  the  conspiracy  offense,  and

there's  no  reason  for  that  to  be  true.  It  is,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  right  that  somebody  has  to  obtain  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another,  but  the  conspiracy  offense  is  made  out  if  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  agree  that  somebody  should  obtain  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another.  And  that's  exactly  the  situation  here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Your  Honor,  I  think  that,  again, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  repair  shop  owners  did  not  intend  to  obtain  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  another.  And  ­­ and  I  think  the  way  that  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  They  intended  and  they 

  

 

 

 

 

agreed  that  Mr.  Ocasio  should  obtain  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another.  And  that's  all  they  have  to  do. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Your  Honor,  I  think  going  back 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  how  that  kind  of  conversation  would  happen  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary  English  is  a  way  to  see  why  it's  not  plausible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  read  the  statute  like  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  repair  shop  owners  go  to  Ocasio  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  I  want  to  help  you  obtain  property  from  another, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ocasio  would  think  that  they're  talking  about  someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else.  I  think  the  government's  interpretation  is  much 

    

 

 

 

 

 

more  formalistic. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It's  a  statute,  and  the 

   

  

 

 

 

statute  just  says  the  other  has  to  be  somebody  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  Ocasio  himself.  So  in  this  particular  case,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  other  is  the  people  who  are  in  the  agreement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  another  case,  the  somebody  other  might  be  somebody

who  is  outside  the  agreement.  The  statute  just  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  substantive  law  says  it  has  to  be  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another. 

            

The  conspiracy  ­­ and  this  is  just  ­­ it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  Salinas,  it's  consistent  with  Holt,  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  everything  we've  ever  said  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  law  ­­ is  that  it  just  has  to  be  an  agreement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  somebody  to  do  that  substantive  offense  even  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  agree  and  can't  do  it  themselves. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  it's  true,  the  people  agreeing  can't  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  themselves.  They  can't  obtain  property  from  another. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  Mr.  Ocasio  can,  and  they're  agreeing  that  he  should. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Your  Honor,  even  if  that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plausible  interpretation  of  the  statute,  which  we  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  is,  it's  definitely  not  the  most  natural  way  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  it.  If  you  talk  to  any  ­­ any  nonlawyer  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  they  would  ­­ they  would  say  that  if  you  agree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  form  ­­ if  you  agree  to  obtain  property  from  another, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'd  be  talking  about  someone  outside  the  conspiracy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  you  know,  the  government's 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  also  requires  you  to  figure  out  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  can  conspire  to  obtain  their  own  consent.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  shifting  perspectives  as  you  navigate  your  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  statute.  And  I  think  that  our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

interpretation  is  ­­ is  much  more  consistent  with  the

I  mean,  in  some  form  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  about  aiding  and

MR.  DAVIS:  Justice  Ginsburg  ­­

MR.  DAVIS:  Justice  Ginsburg,  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

that  they  could.  I  think  the  same  textual  problem  would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist  for  aiding  and  abetting  liability.  18  U.S.C.  2  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  general  aiding  and  abetting  statute,  and  it  leads 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  straight  back  to  the  Hobbs  Act  in  the  same  way  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  general  conspiracy  statute  does.  So  I  don't  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  so. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  it  ­­ is  it  extortion  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempted  extortion?  If  two  brothers,  as  here,  try  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  money  from  a  third  party  and  the  third  party  really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  give  them  the  money  ­­ say,  for  example,  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  give  them  the  money  because  he's  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illustrate  how  awful  the  police  are  in  that  town.  Or  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  them  the  money  because  he  thinks  it's  funny.  Or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  gives  them  the  money  ­­ is  that  extortion? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Because  I'm  having  trouble  distinguishing 

 

 

 

 

between  why  it  should  be  extortion  but  not  conspiracy

for  extortion,  because  that's  what  you're  aiming  at. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're  prepared  to  say,  okay,  it's  extortion.  Well,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  extortion,  you've  heard  all  the  arguments  and  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  these  other  people  commit  it  and  you're  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

helping  them.  But  is  it  extortion? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Your  Honor,  this  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defined  extortion  in  Evans  to  mean  ­­ to  basically  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  a  public  official  takes  a  bribe,  and,  you  know,  we 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  that  holding  as  a  given. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  He  takes  a  bribe,  all 

   

  

 

 

 

right?  Is  it  ­­ is  it  a  bribe  when  the  person  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

showers  him  with  money,  hoping  for  nothing  illegal? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  No. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  He  might  think  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

bribe,  but  ­­ but  is  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Well,  Your  Honor,  there  has  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  He  voluntarily  gives  him 

  

 

 

 

 

the  money  expecting  joy  and  happiness.  I  mean,  you  see, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  where  it  seems  to  me  the  odd  part  of  the  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lies. 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  think  if  he 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

just  gave  him  ­­ showered  him  with  gifts  not  expecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything,  it  would  not  be  extortion  because  there  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  quid  pro  quo.  The  money  has  to  be  paid  in  return 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  specific  official  acts.  So  that  would  not  be  an  act

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  So  if  bribe, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

then  we're  back  ­­ if  bribery  is  extortion,  then  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  conspiracy  to  commit  bribery  conspiracy  to  commit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extortion?  We're  back  where  we  began.  The  odd  thing  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  calling  bribery  extortion.  Once  you  cross  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bridge  ­­ that's  where  we  started.  But  we're  back  ­­ in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  mind,  it  sort  of  got  back  where  we  started.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  trying  to  drive  a  wedge  there,  and  all  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  seem  to  be  me,  really,  to  be  aimed  at  why  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  calling  bribery  extortion? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DAVIS:  I  don't  ­­

    

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Because  they  are  showering 

  

 

 

 

 

with  money.  They  love  it. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Your  Honor,  we're  not  taking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

direct  aim  at  Evans.  And  I  don't  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  know  that,  but,  I  mean, 

    

   

 

 

 

how  you're  asking  me  to  make  that  distinction,  how  do  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  it? 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  think  Evans 

   

  

 

 

 

 

dealt  with  a  substantive  offense,  and  this  case  deals 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  conspiracy.  And  when  you  overlay  a  conspiratorial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

agreement  on  top  of  a  substantive  offense,  it  just  stops 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  sense  grammatically  to  talk  about  the  offense  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  the  government  does.

Again,  when  two  people  reach  an  agreement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  one  will  pay  the  other  one  a  bribe,  it  just  ­­ it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  make  sense  of  ordinary  English  to  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  agreeing  to  obtain  property  from  someone  else, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  another. 

 

              

I  also  think  ­­ you  know,  I  don't  want  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase  "with  his  consent"  to  get  lost  here  also.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hobbs  Act  punishes  the  obtaining  of  property  with  his  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  another  with  his  consent.  And  as  Judge  Sutton 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained  in  ­­ in  the  Brock  decision,  how  can  someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspire  ­­ how  would  or  why  ­­ how  could  or  why  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  conspire  to  obtain  their  own  consent?  So  even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  don't  agree  with  us  on  the  ­­ on  the  "from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another"  language,  I  think  the  "with  his  consent" 

   

 

 

 

 

 

language  does  it  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  then  the  other  textual  point  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  before  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  the  government  says,  of  course,  is  there's  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  consent  and  there's  consent,  and  they  suggest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  a  difference  between  consent  and 

   

 

 

 

 

conspiracy.  Right? 

  

            

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  what's  your 

  

 

 

 

 

answer  to  that? 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Well,  we  agree  with  that,

Your  Honor.  We  think  that  there  are  plenty  of  instances 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  consent  under  the  Hobbs  Act  that  would  not  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiratorial  agreement.  But  it's  hard  to  see  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment  of  a  bribe  would  not  be  a  conspiratorial 

   

   

 

 

 

 

agreement  under  the  government's  theory.  Maybe  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

some  narrow  category  of  cases  where  the  bribe  pair  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  acquiescing  to  an  official  demand  as  it  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  what  payment  of  a  bribe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  not  extortion? 

 

 

            

think  ­­

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  I  ­­ I  agree,  Your  Honor.  I 

    

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  So  the  only 

  

  

 

 

 

 

ground,  then,  we  could  say  is  say,  well,  they  went  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  to  the  limit  of  the  logic  in  the  other  case,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  just  not  going  to  be  logical  to  extend  it  further.

the  government  didn't  have  the  same  textual  problem  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  has  in  this  case.  The  government  didn't  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grapple  with  the  "from  another"  language.  And  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  "from  another"  most  naturally  means  someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  the  ­­ the  conspiracy. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

The  other  point  ­­ textual  point  I'd  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Davis,  if  you  could  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  what  you  just  said  about  the  consent.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look,  I  mean,  Evans  makes  perfectly  clear  that  bribes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  kickbacks  are  included  in  this  statute.  And  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  difference  between  ­­ there  ­­ there  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  in  which  somebody  participates  in  a  kickback 

   

 

 

 

 

 

scheme  and  does  not  consent. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  suppose  some  public  official  comes 

 

 

 

 

 

in  and  says,  in  order  for  me  to  give  you  a  license  to  do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something,  to  be,  you  know,  a  member  of  some  profession, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  say  a  cosmetologist,  you  need  to  pay  me  $20  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kickback.  And  the  person,  you  know,  pays  him  $20 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you've  got  to  get  your  license.  But  there's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  in  the  world  in  which  that  would  count  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiratorial  agreement.  It  would  count  as  consent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  Hobbs  Act. 

 

 

 

            

So  there's  a  big  gap  between  consent  and  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiratorial  agreement,  even  in  the  context  of  bribes.

with  you,  but  with  an  asterisk.  I  think  there  is  a  gray 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area  there  where  someone  just  acquiesces  to  an  official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand  like  you're  saying.  Those  may  not  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiratorial  agreements.  But  I  think  still,  there  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a  large  category  of  bribery  cases  that  would  ­­ would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  be  conspiratorial  agreements  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  theory,  anytime  someone,  like  in  Salinas, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pays  a  bribe  in  exchange  for  official  action  and  wasn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  to  do  so. 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  still  the  government's  theory 

   

 

 

 

 

would  render  some  of  the  language  in  666  unnecessary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  know,  18  U.S.C.  666  has  specific  monetary  thresholds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  on  when  a  bribe  is  a  Federal  crime.  And  the  ­­ and 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

none  of  ­­ the  bribe  has  to  be  over  $5,000.  The  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

official  has  to  work  for  an  agency  that  receives  $10,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  more  in  Federal  funds.  And  I  think  in  a  lot  of  those 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  the  government  could  just  avoid  those  limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  charging  the  case  as  a  conspiracy  to  commit  extortion 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  Hobbs  Act. 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  even  though  there  may  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category  of  cases  that  would  not  be  a  conspiratorial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement,  but  that  would  be  consent  under  the  Hobbs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act. 

            

On  one  more  textual  point,  Your  Honors,  the

statute  also  punishes  whoever  conspires  to  obtain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  from  another,  which,  I  think,  reinforces  our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reading  that  the  "whoever"  who  obtains  the  property  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  a  different  person  from  the  "another"  from  whom 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  is  obtained. 

 

 

            

And  I  think  the  general  conspiracy  statute 

   

 

 

 

 

gets  to  the  same  place  by  just  a  slightly  more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuitous  route.  It  punishes  each  person  who  conspires 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  commit  any  offense  against  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Is  it  fair  to  say  that  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  advancing  an  argument  that  is  limited  to  the  precise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  of  the  Hobbs  Act?  You  ­­ you  are  not  taking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  with  the  proposition  that  a  person  can  conspire  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commit  offense  that  the  person  could  not  personally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commit.  And  you  distinguish  the  Hobbs  Act  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mann  Act  because  one  refers  to  "any"  and  another  refers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  "another." 

 

            

So  is  it  fair  to  say  that  what  you  want  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  conspiracy  rule  that  applies  only  in  cases  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hobbs  Act  conspiracies? 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  No,  Your  Honor.  I  think  that 

    

  

 

 

 

 

what  we're  asking  for  is  just  to  apply  the  language  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  general  conspiracy  statute  in  light  of  the  words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  another  in  the  Hobbs  Act.  And  when  you  put  the  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together  ­­

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  if  another  substantive 

  

 

 

 

 

offense  doesn't  have  the  word  "obtain  property  from"  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  phrase  "obtain  property  from  another,"  then  your  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  rule  doesn't  apply? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  I  think  that's  generally  right, 

    

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  Our  textual  arguments  would  not  apply.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  there  would  still  be  an  issue  of,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  ­­ there's  a  principle  that  when  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

substantive  offense  requires  the  ­­ necessarily  requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement,  you're  not  supposed  to  add  a  conspiracy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

charge  on  that,  but  that's  just  a  presumption.  I  think 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

you're  right  that  our  ­­ our  textual  argument  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  ­­ would  not  apply  in  the  absence  of  the  words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"another,"  "with  his  consent,"  and  "whoever." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd  like  ­­ if  there  are  no  further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions,  I'd  like  to  reserve  my  time  for  rebuttal.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ALLON  KEDEM 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

              

A  conspiracy  is  an  agreement  to  commit  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense  against  the  United  States,  that  is,  a  joint 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

commitment  to  a  plan  that,  if  completed,  would  satisfy

all  elements  of  the  substantive  offense.  And  while  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspirators  must  agree  on  that  goal,  no  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member  of  the  conspiracy  must  agree  that  he,  himself, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  commit  all  or  even  any  of  the  substantive  elements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  offense. 

 

 

            

 

 

And  so  you  don't  ask  whether  all 

 

 

 

 

conspirators  or  the  conspiracy  as  a  whole  agreed  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain  property  from  another  any  more  than  you  would  ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  conspiracy  as  a  whole  acted  under  color  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

official  right. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Do  ­­ do  you  agree  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  your  approach,  every  private  individual  who  seeks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  bribe  a  State  official  is  liable  for  conspiracy  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commit  Hobbs  Act  extortion? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  We  don't.  And  that's  because  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

active  participation. 

 

            

Let  me  explain  where  that  comes  from  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  how  it  applies  to  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Holte  and  Gebardi  concerned  the  Mann  Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  prohibited  the  transportation  of  a  woman  across 

   

 

 

 

 

 

State  lines  for  immoral  purposes.  And  the  question  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  a  woman  who  was  transported  could  conspire  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violate  the  Act. 

 

 

            

In  answering  that  question,  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

focused  on  two  things.  First  of  all,  although  the  Act

contemplates  the  involvement  of  the  woman,  it  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose  substantive  criminal  liability  on  her.  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

second,  some  minimal  form  of  agreement  is  an  inherent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

feature  of  most  instances  of  the  offense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Based  on  those  two  factors,  the  Court  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  that's  all  there  is,  if  the  only  thing  that  the  woman 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agrees  to  is  to  the  transportation  itself,  that  is,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bare  outlines  of  the  crime,  that  by  itself  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insufficient  to  make  her  a  conspirator.  But  if  she  were 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  agree  to  do  more  ­­ if,  for  instance,  she  were  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchase  the  tickets  or  to  arrange  the  transportation  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  other  way  ­­ then  she  could  be  a  conspirator. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  in  this  case,  with  respect  to  a  bribe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pair,  if  all  the  bribe  pair  agrees  to  do  is  turn  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  in  return  for  official  acts,  that  by  itself  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  insufficient  to  make  the  bribe  pair  a  conspirator. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  suppose  he  arranges 

  

 

 

 

 

to  meet  on  the  park  bench  at  2:00  o'clock,  and  has  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow­up  call  to  the  official  to  please  be  there.  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ does  that  suffice? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  that  would  be  incidental 

    

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  one  thing  that  they're  really  agreeing  to  do, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  to  turn  over  the  money. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  contrast  that  with  what  happened  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  Because  Moreno  and  Mejia  didn't  just  hand  over  an

envelope  with  $100  bills  in  it.  They  worked  closely  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conjunction  with  police  officers,  including  Petitioner. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For  instance,  when  Petitioner  went  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scene  of  an  accident,  he  would  call  Moreno,  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  talk  about  what  cars  were  involved:  The  make, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

model,  the  year,  what  extent  of  damage  was  involved. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  then  Moreno  would  consult  with  Petitioner  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  cars  would  be  most  lucrative  to  have  in  the  shop. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  it  wasn't  simply  a  case  of  agreeing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  bare  outlines  of  the  crime.  He  agreed  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilitate  it  in  additional  ways. 

 

 

 

 

            

to  a  jury?

two  things. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  do  you  charge  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  KEDEM:  Pardon? 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  do  you  charge  it  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  you  would  tell  the  jury 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

First,  in  order  for  a  bribe  pair  to  be  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspirator,  they  have  to  agree  to  actively  participate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  plan. 

 

 

            

            

And  second  ­­

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  I  mean,  I'm  a 

   

  

 

 

 

juror  and  I  say,  I  ­­ police  officer  came  to  me,  asked

active  participation.  That's  what  I'm  thinking. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  The  second  one  is  that  you  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  tell  the  jury  that  if  all  you've  agreed  to  do  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  turn  over  money  in  return  for  official  acts,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  by  itself  is  insufficient. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Okay.  That's  lovely.  And 

  

  

  

 

 

that  ­­ you  know,  that  prevents  this  law  from  ­­ Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  from  hitting  anybody  who  pays  a  bribe,  which  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  a  desirable  result. 

   

 

            

But  I  don't  see  how  it  comports  with  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory  of  the  case.  I  mean,  there  is  just  as  much  of  an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  between  the  two  people  to  obtain  money  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another,  whether  that  other  actively  participates  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not. 

            

Where  ­­ where  do  you  get  this  active 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participation  requirement  from? 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Except  to  make  it  up  to

MR.  KEDEM:  Active  participation  comes  from 

  

 

 

 

 

Holte  and  Gebardi,  and  it's  also  notable  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  didn't  make  up  the  requirement  for  purposes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  this  case.  The  First,  Second,  Fourth,  and  Fifth

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  Holte  and  Gebardi  see  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  gloss  on  the  type  of  agreement  that's  necessary  to

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  that's  not  what 

  

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  law  says.  It's  any  agreement.  If  ­­ if  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree,  you're  ­­ you're  liable  to  conspiracy.  Where  ­­

in  Abuelhawa,  which  is  cited  at  footnote  8  in  our  brief, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  also  relied  on  Gebardi  to  raise  the  level  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilitation  that  would  be  required  for  a  drug  purchaser

instructions  because  Petitioner  never  requested  it,

despite  the  fact  that  active  participation  was  already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  law  in  the  Fourth  Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

 

I  would  also  point  out  that  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  argument  that  it  simply  doesn't  matter  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actively  a  bribe  pair  facilitates  the  extortion. 

   

 

 

 

 

Moreover,  there  was  no  dispute  in  this  case  that  Moreno 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Mejia  made  an  active  role.  In  fact,  it  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  contention  at  trial  that  they  were,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  the  masterminds  of  this  scheme. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice  Scalia,  if  you  don't  like  active 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participation,  then  you  would  simply  revert  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law  standard  in  which  agreeing  to  the  outlines  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  crime  would  be  sufficient,  even  if  you  were  a  bribe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pair. 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  if  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  makes  sense  to  me. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  ­­ if  I  could  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

understand  what  you're  saying,  you  think  active 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participation  is  more  than  an  agreement  along  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

typical  conspiracy  lines. 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  normally  agreeing  to  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

bare  outlines  of  the  crime  would  be  sufficient  for  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspirators.  I  think  ­­

    

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Would  ­­ would? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  KEDEM:  Would,  that's  correct.

But  I  think  active  participation  is  a  way  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

raise  the  threshold  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Right.  But  ­­

  

  

 

 

MR.  KEDEM:  ­­ certain  types  of  crimes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ this  does  sound  more  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  aiding  and  abetting  standard  than  it  does  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  standard,  because  typically  in  conspiracy  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  it  doesn't  really  matter  if  you  actively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participate,  as  long  as  you  reach  an  agreement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  ­­

    

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Now  that  agreement  is  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

than  acquiescence,  right?  It's  more  than  I  reluctantly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

give  you  the  bribe  that  you're  demanding  of  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  ­­ but  I  guess  I'm  with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia  that  I  don't  really  quite  understand  how 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  from  the  typical  real  agreement  that  we  require 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  conspiracy  cases  to  some  higher  standard  with  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  this  crime  of  active  participation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  it's  a  gloss  on  what  you 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  agree  to  do  in  order  to  be  considered  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspirator.  So  it's  true  that  the  agreement  itself  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  criminal  when  it  comes  to  a  conspiracy,  whereas 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  aiding  and  abetting,  it's  acts.  And  I  think  it's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar  inquiry.  With  aiding  and  abetting,  you  act  ­­

you  ask:  Did  you  actively  participate  in  the  crime? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  with  conspiracy,  you  ask:  Did  you  agree  to  actively 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participate  in  the  crime? 

 

 

 

            

If  I  could  attack  ­­ if  I  could  refer  to  my 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend's  argument  about  unity  of  purpose,  he's  correct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  does  need  to  be  a  unity  of  purpose,  but  he's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorrect  as  to  what  that  purpose  needs  to  be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under  Salinas,  all  members  of  the  conspiracy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must  agree  on  a  plan  that  is  an  offense  against  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States;  that  is,  an  offense,  a  plan  that,  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completed,  would  satisfy  all  elements  of  the  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense. 

            

And  Petitioner  says  Evans  was  the  high­water 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mark  in  interpreting  the  Hobbs  Act.  But  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  ­­ the  answer,  as  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  this  now,  the  purpose  of  this  active 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participation  doctrine  is  let's  look  at  the  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense.  And  all  of  a  sudden  we're  saying  every 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

policeman,  every  State  official,  everyone  in  the  country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  goes  to  any  person  and  says,  give  me  some  money  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  position,  they're  already  guilty.  That  already  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extortion  on  this  case  that  we've  been  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before,  right? 

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  right.

MR.  KEDEM:  But  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  now  what  you're  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

do  is  you're  going  to  make  not  only  them  guilty  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  crime,  you're  going  to  make  anybody  who  pays 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  guilty  of  the  Federal  crime.  That's  the  purpose  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case. 

 

            

Now  you  say  don't  worry  about  it,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  situation  A  and  situation  B. 

   

 

 

 

            

In  situation  A,  the  policeman  is  the  heavy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  all  the  victim's  done  is  stop  at  the  traffic  light. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He  says,  give  me  the  money,  and  that's  a  bribe,  all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  He's  a  bad  guy,  the  policeman;  the  victim  is  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  bad. 

 

            

But  in  the  other  case,  the  victim  says,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

love  it,  like  these  people,  because  we're  really  getting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  from  the  public.  That's  what  they're  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  ­­ who  are  the  real  victims  here,  but  they're  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  charged  that  way. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  what  the  active  participation 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  is  designed  to  do,  separate  the  ­­ the  sort  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocent  victims  who  aren't  policemen  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cooperating  victims  who  love  the  policemen  to  take  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  because  they  want  the  result;  is  that  right?

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  I've  got  it  right  so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  argument  on  his  side  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

far. 

            

            

don't  make  a  bad  situation  worse. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  We  already  are  federalizing 

  

 

 

 

 

vast  numbers  of  State  crimes,  which  really  are  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States'  business.  And  now  you're  not  necessarily 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doubling  the  number,  but  you're  increasing  it  by  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

80  percent.  Now  that  ­­ that's  what  I've  got  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical  argument  that  he's  making.  And  ­­ and  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  to  that  is,  don't  worry  it's  not  your  business. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  just  follow  the  logic. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  under  active 

    

 

 

 

participation,  you  wouldn't  be  doing  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  understand. 

    

 

MR.  KEDEM:  I  would  also  point  ­­

if  I  understand  it  correctly. 

   

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  you  do,  Your  Honor. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  also  point  out  that  the  argument  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  with  regard  to  "from  another"  has  nothing  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  to  do  with  the  Hobbs  Act.  It  would  apply  any

another."  And  let  me  give  you  an  example. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  before  you  do, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  still  stuck  on  the  jury  instructions.  You  cite  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  brief  language  on  Joint  Appendix  page  195  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  says  ­­ I  think  these  are  the  instructions.  Maybe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  wrong,  but  you  cite  them,  where  the  judge  says  mere 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledge  or  acquiescence  without  participation  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful  plan  is  not  sufficient. 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  that  ­­ that's  the  language,  I  take  it, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  talking  about  with  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ "the  jury  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instructed." 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That  was  given  ­­ given  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury,  but  I  think  that's  the  standard  conspiracy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

instruction. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  on  page  194, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  says,  "The  extent  of  a  defendant's  participation  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  bearing  on  the  issue  of  his  guilt."  And  I  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wondered  whether  your  ­­ it's  active  participation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  suggests  to  me  something  that  goes  to  the  extent  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant's  participation. 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  right.  A  different 

    

  

 

 

instruction  would  be  given,  but  it's  important  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphasize  that  Petitioner  did  not  appeal  the  failure  to

give  a  specific  jury  instruction.  He  didn't  request 

   

  

 

 

 

 

one,  and  that  was  not  the  basis  for  appeal.  He  had  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiency  of  the  evidence  challenge  on  appeal,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what's  before  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

            

Moreover,  there  is  overwhelming  evidence 

 

 

 

 

that  Moreno  and  Mejia  did,  in  fact,  actively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participate.  In  fact,  that  was  Petitioner's  very  theory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  trial. 

 

            

But  let  me  give  you  an  example  of  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  argument  with  regard  to  "from  another"  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  necessarily  only  focus  on  the  Hobbs  Act.  Imagine 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  for  instance,  there  was  a  statute  that  said  if  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

steal  from  a  bank  while  pointing  a  gun  at  another,  it's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  bank  robbery.  And  imagine  a  robber  says  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

his  friend,  you  go  into  the  bank  ahead  of  me.  I'll  run 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in,  point  a  gun  at  your  head,  and  say,  cashier  give  me 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  your  money. 

 

 

 

            

According  to  Petitioner,  that  would  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy,  because  judged  ­­ from  the  perspective  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  conspiracy  as  a  whole,  no  gun  was  pointed  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another.  And  at  base,  Petitioner's  argument  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  element  of  the  substantive  offense  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judged  in  a  conspiracy  from  the  perspective  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  as  a  single,  undifferentiated  whole. 

   

 

 

 

              

A  couple  responses  to  that.  First  of  all,

it's  not  even  clear  what  that  means;  for  instance,  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  could  be  that  a  conspiracy  as  a  whole  obtains 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

property  under  color  of  official  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second  of  all,  it  contradicts  the  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise  behind  conspiracy  liability,  which  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  members  of  the  conspiracy  agree  to  play 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  roles,  and  it's  only  when  you  add  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various  roles  together  that  you  get  the  completed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense.

you  would  say,  give  me  the  money  or  I'll  kill  my  friend. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  the  friend  would  pretend  to  be  a  customer  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank. 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Sure.  But  ­­ well  ­­

would  have  formed  the  plan  in  order  to  accomplish  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  robbery. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  I  would  not  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that's  a  conspiracy  to  point  a  gun  at  another. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Well,  Justice  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It's  a  conspiracy  to  point 

   

  

 

 

 

a  gun  between  themselves. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Justice  Scalia,  I  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

only  is  true  if  you  judge  each  element  of  the  offense  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

conspiracy. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  No,  I  understand  ­­

   

  

 

 

MR.  KEDEM:  ­­ with  regard  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ but  you  were  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

present  a  clear  example. 

   

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  it  doesn't  seem  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  clear  at  all. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Justice  Scalia,  we  cite  about  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

half  dozen  other  Federal  statutes  that  also  similarly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  phrases  like  "from  another"  and  "to  another"  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  similarly  affected  by  Petitioner's  argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  also  like  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  the  other  reason  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  doesn't  work  too  well  is  we  know  that  he's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  going  to  pull  the  gun  because  he's  his  friend,  but

in  this  case  the  money  is  going  to  be  given.  So  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  work. 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Well,  Justice  Kennedy,  I  would 

   

  

 

 

 

point  you  then  to  the  statute  that  we  cite  that  talks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  someone  who  is  a  government  official  who  receives 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

coded,  secret  information  from  another  and  provides  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  another.  Petitioner's  only  response  is  there  may  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  other  statute  that  you  could  prosecute  under  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  in  which  the  "from  another"  and  "to  another"  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  officials  of  other  governments.  But  what  if  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not?  What  if  they're  officials  ­­ what  if  they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  of  a  terrorist  organization,  for  instance? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  also  address  my  friend's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  with  respect  to  the  word  "whoever"  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  A.  I  don't  think  it  works  for  a  couple 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

reasons. 

            

First  of  all,  the  word  "whoever"  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  A  ­­ and  this  is  best  addressed  if  looking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  at  the  words  of  the  statute  at  page  2a  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix  to  our  brief.  "Whoever,"  in  Subsection  (a),  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  subject  of  the  phrase  "obtaining  of  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  another"  in  Subsection  (b)(2).  If  it  were,  then  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  citizen  could  ever  be  member  of  a  conspiracy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  no  private  citizen  can  obtain  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  under  color  of  official  right.

Instead,  the  word  "whoever"  is  the  subject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  phrase  "obstructs,  delays,  or  affects  commerce" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  extortion  or  agrees  or  conspires  so  to  do.  And  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  you  an  example  of  how  that  can  be  affected,  even  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  yourself  are  not  the  person  who  commits  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extortion,  imagine  a  case  of  robbery  in  which  there  is  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

central  organizer  who  brings  together  robbers  who  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various  skills  and  gives  them  a  plan  but  doesn't  himself 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intend  to  participate  in  the  robbery.  In  that  case,  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  conspired  to  obstruct,  delay,  or  affect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce  by  robbery,  even  though  he  himself  would  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committing  robbery. 

 

            

And  the  same  is  true  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extortion.  Moreno  and  Mejia  were  part  of  a  plan  which 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  actively  facilitated  that  obstructed,  delayed,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected  commerce  by  extortion. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  is  it  ­­ if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ I'm  still  ­­ a  crime  requires  that  the  victim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  consent.  Now,  what  kind  of  ­­ it  could  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtaining  consent  to  do  something.  Smith  obtains 

  

 

 

 

 

 

consent  to  do  something.  The  victim  agrees  with  Smith 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  participate  in  that  crime.  But  in  agreeing  to  do  it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  is  giving  consent.  So  from  that  point  on,  there  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  further  consent  to  be  given.  So  it's  like  robbing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  pocket  of  a  stone  idol  or  some  ­­ what  used  to  be

called  in  law  school  ­­ once  the  consent  is  given. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  maybe  he  is  agreeing  to  participate  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  to  attempt  to  get  the  consent.  But  he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreeing  to  the  ­­ he  gives  the  consent  at  the  moment  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agrees. 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Justice  Breyer  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  how  can  you  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

conspiring  to  ­­ to  do  something  to  get  a  consent  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  already  given? 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Justice  Breyer  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  could  conspire  to 

  

 

 

 

 

attempt  to  get  it,  but  not  to  get  it,  if  you're  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  picky  on  these  words. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  The  issue  of  consent  is  really  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

red  herring  in  this  case,  because  as  my  friend  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stated,  consent  from  the  common  law  for  extortion  falls 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well  below  the  meeting  of  the  minds  that  you  would  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  conspiratorial  agreement.  And  that  much  is  made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  by  the  fact  that  even  in  cases  of  coercive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extortion,  that  is  extortion  induced  by  wrongful  use  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  or  threatened  force,  violence,  or  fear,  you  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  need  consent. 

 

 

            

And  so  the  type  of  agreement  that  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about,  with  or  without  the  active  participation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  is  well  above  the  threshold  for  consent

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  haven't  talked 

  

 

 

 

 

about  Majestic  yet,  and  your  friend  said  that's  maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  had  never  raised  that  below.  Is  that  ­­ is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  true?  In  other  words,  the  Majestic  is  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  which  the  funds  are  going  to  be  obtained? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  not  accurate.  It  was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

raised  in  the  trial  court.  The  trial  court  made  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruling  that  Majestic  was  also  another,  and  the  court  of

that  in  your  brief  in  opposition  to  certiorari? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  We  talked  about  the  fact  that  in

MR.  KEDEM:  It  wasn't  indicted,  but  it  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  indictment  stated  that  money  came  from  Majestic. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  do  say  in  your  brief 

  

 

 

 

 

that  if  we  adopt  the  Petitioner's  argument,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically  you  would  never  have  any  cases.  But  I'm  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  that's  right.  For  example,  the  most  common 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  is  the  New  York  City  permitting  official. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Generally,  they  agree  with  developers  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contractors  pay  them  a  bribe  to  expedite  their  work. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

That,  you  could  prosecute  because  two  people  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreeing  to  get  money  from  another,  the  contractors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those  situations  are  not  so  unusual. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  don't  ­­

    

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  think,  as  one  of  my 

    

 

 

 

 

 

colleagues  said,  there  was  a  conspiracy  here  to  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  from  the  victims. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  don't  think,  Justice 

    

 

 

 

Sotomayor,  that  our  argument  is  you  would  never  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances  in  which  the  conspiracy  provision  would  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  what  we're  saying  is,  this  is  precisely  the  type 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  scenario  in  which  conspiracy  liability  should  attach. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  there  may  be  a  sense  by  some  that  clever 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutors,  maybe  in  some  cases,  are  pushing  the  bounds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  conspiracy  law  beyond  where  they're  ­­ traditionally

warranted. 

            

Whatever  the  merits  of  that  criticism  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  matter,  this  is  not  that  case.  The  criminal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  in  this  case  was  a  durable,  multifaceted, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  enterprise  that  had  a  division  of  labor  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

succeeded  over  the  course  of  several  years  in  committing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  only  numerous  acts  of  extortion,  but  other  forms  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegality  as  well. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You  had  no  other  substantive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

crime  to  charge  against  the  brothers? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  The  brothers  also  pled  guilty  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

aiding  and  abetting  extortion  which,  under  Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory,  would  not  have  been  possible. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  didn't  you  just  charge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

them  with  getting  money  from  the  customers?  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  who  ­­ they're  conspiring  ­­ after  all,  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving  $150  to  the  policeman.  They  aren't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

philanthropists.  They  think  they're  going  to  get  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  back  from  the  people  whose  cars  are  wrecked. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

also  ­­

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  correct.  They  could 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  those  are  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

people.  I  mean,  this  is  really  a  conspiracy  on  behalf 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  policeman  and  the  ­­ and  the  owner  of  the  repair

MR.  KEDEM:  That  is  true,  Justice  Breyer, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

but  they  didn't  necessarily  commit  a  crime  against  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

customer  if  all  they  did  is  repair  the  customer's  car. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now,  they  did  also  commit  various  forms  of  insurance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud,  but  put  that  to  the  side. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

In  this  scheme,  if  all  they  did  was  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  from  a  customer  and  fix  the  car  as  promised,  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  would  not  have  committed  a  crime  necessarily 

   

 

 

 

 

 

against  the  customer. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And,  indeed,  isn't  it  right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  what  Justice  Breyer  is  saying  was  the  very  theory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behind  Evans,  why  this  was  extortion,  is  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  crime  was  to  the  public  at  large,  not  to  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  customer.  But  yes,  there  was  a  crime  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  general  public. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  correct.  The  victim  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

cases  of  extortion  is  not  necessarily  the  person  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pays  the  bribe,  who  might  do  so  willingly  and  might  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  in  order  to  get  something  from  the  public  official. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

government's  interest  in  this  case,  right,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  is  ­­ is,  what? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Well,  Justice  Scalia  ­­

instruments  of  interstate  commerce? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Justice  Scalia,  I  think  Evans 

   

  

 

 

 

settled  that  the  mere  receipt  of  a  bribe  in  return  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performing  officials  acts  is,  in  fact,  extortion.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  that's  at  issue  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Oh,  oh,  it  doesn't  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  any  ­­ any  Federal  constitutional  authority,  just  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  There  does  have  the  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  authority. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  what  is  it?  I  mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

here,  it  is  ­­ I  assume  that  it's  automobiles. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  ­­ well,  Justice  Scalia, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  affecting  commerce  and  there  was  evidence  at  trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  for  instance,  insurance  payments  came  from  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State.  And  that  was  specifically  used  to  ­­ to  show  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affecting  commerce  element. 

 

 

              

I  would  also  point  out  that  if  you  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  to  charge  Petitioner  with  three  isolated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances  of  extortion,  of  the  substantive  act  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extortion,  it  would  not  reflect  the  full  range  of  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct  because,  again,  he  didn't  simply  receive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  and  then  refer  cars  for  it.  He  worked  closely  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conjunction  with  Moreno  and  Mejia. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  ­­ you  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  your  friend's  point,  though,  that  charging  the

conspiracy  gives  the  prosecutor  considerably  broader 

 

 

 

 

 

range  in  the  evidence  that  he  wants  to  admit  at  trial? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  that  that  does  sometimes 

    

 

 

 

 

 

happen,  but  that's  a  general  principle  that  has  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  relation  to  the  argument  that  Petitioner  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  is  the  relationship 

  

 

 

 

 

between  that  argument  and  the  question  of  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  conspiracy  between  Ocasio  and  Moreno  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Mejia?  It  might  apply  to  the  conspiracy  between  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged  conspiracy  between  Ocasio  and  the  other  police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers  because  it  ­­ although  it  could  allow  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  it  easier  to  admit  evidence  of  what  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police  officers  did. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  what  ­­ it  has  no  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  there  was  a  conspiracy  between  Ocasio  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Moreno  and  Mejia  doesn't  seem  to  me  to  have  anything  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  to  do  with  what  evidence  would  be  admissible  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial. 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  right,  Justice  Alito. 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  thought  you 

   

  

 

 

 

told  me  that  was  wrong.  I  thought  you  told  me  you

MR.  KEDEM:  It  does  ­­ it  does, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  but  that  would  still  have  been  true 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  Moreno  and  Mejia  were  not  charged  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co­conspirators  because  there  was  voluminous  evidence  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we  cited  in  the  last  portion  of  our  brief  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  conspired  with  other  police  officers  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For  instance,  he  was  recruited  into  the  scheme  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  police  officer,  probably  Officer  Rodriguez,  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  indicted  along  with  him. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Do  you  ­­ do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree  that  the  most  that  that  gets  you  is  a  remand  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  the  Skilling  question? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  We  don't.  We  don't.  Skilling 

  

  

  

 

 

 

was  an  issue  about  jury  instructions.  And,  again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  challenge  in  the  court  of  appeals  as  it  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  as  it  comes  to  this  Court  is  not  about  the  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions. 

              

I  would  point  you  instead  to  Griffin  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States,  502  U.S.  46,  which  talks  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiency  challenges,  which  is  what  this  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  you  look  at  that  evidence,  not  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  Petitioner  recruited  by  other  officers,  he  himself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tried  to  recruit  other  officers  into  this  scene.  For 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance,  trying  to  set  up  his  own  referral  network.

Moreover,  there  was  evidence  that  he  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Officer  Rodriguez  worked  together  on  at  least  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasion  to  bring  a  car  into  Majestic. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  ­­ and  is  it  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiency  ­­ I  would  have  thought  it's  a  statutory 

   

   

 

 

 

 

interpretation  challenge  and  not  simply  a  sufficiency  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  evidence  challenge. 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Well,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  there  was  a  specific  instruction  to  the  jury  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  or  another  about  whether  they  either  could  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  find  it  just  based  on  Moreno  and  Mejia.  And  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  result,  because  there  was  a  general  verdict,  you  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  specifically  whether  the  jury  relied  on  Moreno  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mejia  alone  or  whether  they  also  relied  on  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers. 

            

And  under  that  circumstance,  I  think  Griffin 

   

 

 

 

 

says  it's  a  ­­ just  a  general  sufficiency  challenge. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  on  that  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guess  your  ­­ your  friend  says  that  the  whole  thrust  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  you  presented  was  based  on  the  conspiracy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  the  two  brothers  and  the  officer  rather  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spokes,  I  guess  is  the  jargon,  involving  the  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers  with  Ocasio.  Is  that  true? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  We  don't  think  that's  true.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  refer  you  to  all  of  the  evidence  we  cite  in  the

last  section  of  our  brief.  This  was  the  way  it  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicted.  The  indictment  itself  said  that  Petitioner 

  

 

 

 

 

 

conspired  with  other  officers. 

 

 

 

            

It  was  also  specifically  cited  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closing  argument  to  the  jury,  that  they  were  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  that  he  had  conspired  with  other  officers.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  great  deal  of  evidence  that  he  did  so. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't  that  just  harmless 

  

 

 

 

 

error,  assuming  we  agree  with  your  ­­ your  ­­ with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  and  say  the  other  has  to  be  somebody  else? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  We  don't  think  that  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

harmless  error,  but  I  do  take  your  point  that  it's  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  grounds  for  holding  for  the  government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  you  think  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

sufficiency? 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  do.  I  think  that's  what 

    

    

 

 

 

Griffin  v.  United  States  says.

government  did  not  raise  any  sort  of  argument  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  just  a  sufficiency  case  there,  so  I  think  that  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

water  under  the  bridge.  But  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  did  you  challenge  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  in  the  district  court  as  well? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  We  challenged  the  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

instructions  in  the  district  court,  yes,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  was  an  objection  raised  to  the  government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposed  instructions  there. 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  turn  to  the  active  participant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  We  agree  with  Justice  Scalia  that  the  active 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participant  standard  doesn't  come  from  anything  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  or  anything  in  basic  principles  of  conspiracy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  Conspiracy  just  requires  an  agreement  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  an  overt  act,  and  this  active  participant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  doesn't  map  on  well  to  that  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  government  ­­ the  cases  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  cites  that  supposedly  apply,  Holte  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gebardi  to  ­­ to  Hobbs  Act  prosecutions  really  dealt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  aiding  and  abetting,  not  with  conspiracy.  And  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  easier  to  see  how  the  active  participant  standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  in  the  context  of  aiding  and  abetting,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  acts  beyond  mere  agreement. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  in  the  context  of  conspiracy,  the  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  really  to  have  applied  the  active  participant

was  the  Fourth  Circuit  in  the  Spitler  decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Will  you,  in  your  answer, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

get  to  what  I  think  is  the  main  point;  the  main  point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being,  look,  two  policemen  and  a  shop  owner.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

policemen  say,  give  us  money  and  we'll  help  you  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later.  That's  extortion.  All  right. 

  

  

 

 

            

If  that's  extortion,  then  why  isn't  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  when,  three  weeks  before  they  meet  and  bit  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bit  say,  we  will  do  that  very  thing  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extortion  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  DAVIS:  I  think  ­­

    

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ the  shopkeeper  is 

  

 

 

 

 

helping  the  policemen  do  what  is  the  thing  that  counts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  extortion  and,  therefore,  he's  conspired  with  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  their  very  simple  argument.  A  simple  answer  is? 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  The  simple  answer  is  that's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  how  ­­ with  ordinary  English,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  When  two  people  ­­ when  the  repair  shop  owners

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes.  The  "other"  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

"another"  means  another  other  than  the  two  policemen.

Another.  Joe  and  Bill  are  the  policemen;  Sam  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shopkeeper.  In  the  substantive  crime,  the  other, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

another,  means  not  the  two  policemen;  it  means  Sam.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sam,  two  weeks  earlier,  helped  and  conspired  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  policemen  to  get  money  from  another;  namely,  Sam. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  DAVIS:  And  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Odd,  but  English. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  DAVIS:  Justice  Breyer,  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

words  "namely  Sam"  are  doing  all  the  work  there.  If  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cut  out  the  words  "namely  Sam,"  all  of  a  sudden  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  make  sense  anymore.  If  he  goes  to  the  police 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers  and  says,  let  me  help  you  obtain  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another,  you  need  to  add  words  to  the  statute  in  order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  that  to  make  sense. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Davis,  I  don't  think  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

need  to  add  words.  What  you  need  is  to  shift 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perspective.  There  is  a  difference  here,  but  that's  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

difference,  that  the  government  is  insisting  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  it  from  the  perspective  of  the  person  who,  in

this  case,  is  doing  the  acts  of  obtaining  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another.  And  you  are  insisting  that  it  be  looked  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  perspective  of  the  person  who  has  agreed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

help  him  do  that. 

 

 

 

            

But  there's  no  reason  under  standard 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  law  that  we  would  use  the  perspective  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreer  rather  than  the  perspective  of  the  perpetrator. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Justice  Kagan,  with  respect,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  agree  with  that.  I  think  that  under  standard 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  law,  you  look  at  the  perspective  of  both. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  have  to  have  a  unity  of  purpose  with  each 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspirator  to  do  the  same  thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  There  absolutely  is  a  unity 

   

  

 

 

 

of  purpose,  that  one  person  should  do  the  crime. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  DAVIS:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Go  ahead. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  DAVIS:  With  the  unity  of  ­­ there

statute.  There  may  be  a  unity  of  purpose  that  they  all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  something,  but  it  begs  the  question  about  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  they're  doing  violates  every  element  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  offense. 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.
