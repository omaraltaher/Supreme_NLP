CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  14­1373,  Utah  v.  Strieff. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Green. 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  TYLER  R.  GREEN 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Courts  typically  apply  the  exclusionary  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

to  suppress  unlawfully­seized  evidence.  The  question 

  

 

 

 

 

here  is  whether  to  suppress  evidence  lawfully  seized  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  search  incident  to  a  warrant  arrest  because  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

arresting  officer  found  the  warrant  in  a  stop  later 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judged  to  be  unlawful. 

 

 

 

            

Under  this  Court's  attenuation  analysis, 

 

 

 

 

such  evidence  is  admissible  when,  as  here,  the  predicate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stop  was  not  flagrant  but  resulted  from  an  objectively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  miscalculation. 

 

            

            

Extending  the  exclusionary  rule  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Tell  me  what  was 

  

 

 

 

 

objectively  reasonable  about  it. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  mean,  the  police 

    

 

 

 

officer  admits  that  the  person  he  saw  coming  out  of  the

house  in  question  wasn't  doing  anything.  He  didn't  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  lived  there,  he  didn't  know  what  he  had  done,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything.  He  didn't  even  really  know  that  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  dealing  going  on  in  the  house.  He  was  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure  that  out.  So  what  was  objectively  reasonable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  stopping  this  man? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Justice  Sotomayor,  we've 

  

 

 

 

admitted  that  this  was  a  miscalculation,  but  it  was  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close  call.  If  the  officer  here  had  stopped  the  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  coming  out  of  the  house  after  receiving  the  tip, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  have  been  objectively  unreasonable  under  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  case  and  decision  in  Alabama  v.  White. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  this  person  wasn't  the  first  person  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saw  come  out  of  the  house.  He  had  received  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anonymous  tip  and  then  had  proceeded  to  corroborate  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  three  hours  of  surveillance  and  observation  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  course  of  the  ensuing  week.  And  all  of  the  traffic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  saw  during  those  three  hours  was  the  same  short­stay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traffic  that  was  reported  in  the  tip. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Based  on  his  training  and  experience,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  was  consistent  with  drug  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  would  be  interesting 

  

 

 

 

 

if  he  waited  to  see  whether  this  was  also  a  short­stay 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visitor.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  don't  see  how  this  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

any  different  than  stopping  the  first  person  you  see. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  I  think,  Your  Honor,  as  ­­ as 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  admitted,  I  think  if  he  had  seen  it  and  it  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

short  stay,  I  think  we  may  well  beat  the  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspicion,  and  I  think  that's  why  the  prosecutor  here 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceded  that  it  wasn't. 

 

 

 

            

But  it  was  a  close  call  based  on  everything 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  had  seen  to  that  point.  And  in  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances,  we  think  that's  why  ­­ where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate  conduct  was  a  result  of  ­­ of  misconduct  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What's  going  to  stop 

  

 

 

 

 

police  officers  ­­ if  we  announce  your  rule,  and  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  seems  to  be,  once  we  have  your  name,  if  there's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  out  on  you,  that's  an  attenuating  circumstance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  every  circumstance.  What  stops  us  from  becoming  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police  state  and  just  having  the  police  stand  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corner  down  here  and  stop  every  person,  ask  them  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identification,  put  it  through,  and  if  a  warrant  comes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

up,  searching  them? 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  I  think  ­­ Justice  Sotomayor,  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

think  there  are  two  answers  to  that  question.  First,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  our  rule  ­­ an  officer  can  never  count,  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  rule,  on  finding  a  warrant.  So  there  is  no

incentive  for  him  to  make  that  stop.  If  there's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  and  the  stop  is  lawful  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  if  you  have  a  town 

   

  

 

 

 

 

like  Ferguson,  where  80  percent  of  the  residents  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor  traffic  warrants  out,  there  may  be  a  very  good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive  for  just  standing  on  the  street  corner  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ferguson  and  asking  every  citizen,  give  me  your  ID;  let 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  see  your  name.  And  let  me  hope,  because  I  have  an  80 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  chance  that  you're  going  to  have  a  warrant. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  I  understand,  Your  Honor.  And 

    

  

 

 

 

that's  the  second  part  of  my  answer,  is  that  officers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  count  ­­ under  our  rule,  a  warrant  by  itself  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  sufficient.  There  still  must  be  a  separate  inquiry 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

into  whether  the  predicate  stop  was  flagrant,  and  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer  can't  count  in  any  particular  stop  on  a  judge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later  concluding  that  the  stop  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  I  assume,  Mr.  Green, 

   

  

 

 

 

that  there  are  a  variety  of  circumstances  in  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

police  officers  would  really  like  to  talk  to  somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  really  like  to  search  them  but  don't  have  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspicion.  And  I  think  that  the  question  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor  is  asking  is  if  you're  policing  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

community  where  there  is  some  significant  percentage  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  have  arrest  warrants  out  on  them,  it  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  increase  your  incentive  to  ­­ to  make  that  stop  on

the  chance  that  there  will  be  a  warrant  that  will  allow 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  to  search  and  admit  whatever  evidence  you  gained  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  search. 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  What  ­­ Justice  Kagan,  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  so.  I  think,  again,  if  the  ­­ if  the  inquiry 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turns,  as  it  does,  on  not  only  on  finding  a  warrant,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  a  determination  of  whether  the  stop  was  flagrant, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  officer  has  no  guarantee  before  he  makes  the  stop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  judge  will  later  conclude  the  stop  was  not. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  but  this  is  an  officer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  ­­ you  say  this  is  a  close  call.  So  let's  say  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  close  calls.  But  you  don't  think  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  suspicion,  or  you  think  you  maybe  do  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  a  good  judge  out  there,  but  ­­ but  you  ­­ there  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  reason  why  you  want  to  talk.  So  this  is  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flagrant  violation.  This  is  not  a  dragnet  search  or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

something  like  that.  But  you  ­­ if  ­­ if  ­­ I  mean,  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  change  your  incentives  quite  dramatically,  it  seems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me,  if  you're  policing  a  community  where  there  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  significant  percentage  of  people  who  have  arrest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants. 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Justice  Kagan,  I  think,  with 

   

  

 

 

 

respect,  it  doesn't.  Officers  know  that  the  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

surefire  way  ­­ the  incentive  is  always  to  comply  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fourth  Amendment.  That's  the  only  way  they  can  be

sure  that  the  evidence  they  are  gathering  is  later  used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  prosecution. 

   

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That's  the  only  way  they  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  absolutely  sure.  But  ­­ but  here,  there's  ­­ there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  chance  that  they're  going  to  find  the  arrest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  and  then  they're  going  to  be  able  to  admit  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  they're  going  to  get,  whereas  before, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  none.  And  that  some  chance  is  not  like  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once­in­a­blue­moon  kind  of  chance.  In  these  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

heavily­policed  areas,  it's  ­­ I  mean,  I  was  staggered 

   

   

 

 

 

 

by  the  number  of  arrest  warrants  that  are  out  on  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  it's,  you  know,  a  significant  possibility  that  you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  find  an  arrest  warrant  and  be  able  to  admit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  drugs  or  guns  or  whatever  it  is  you  find. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  I  think,  Your  Honor,  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

those  circumstances,  that's  where  the  flagrancy  inquiry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  does  the  work  of  deterrence.  Because  as  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  explained,  to  be  appropriate,  suppression  must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yield  appreciable  deterrence.  There  may  be  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

additional  marginal  deterrence  that  suppressing 

 

 

 

 

everything  following  an  event  like  this  would  yield,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  never  been  enough  under  this  Court's  precedence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Don't  you  think  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

enough  of  a  deterrence  to  say  to  a  police  officer  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  situation,  you  should  have  reasonable  suspicion?

You  know  the  Fourth  Amendment  requires  it.  So  before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  do  an  intrusive  act  demanding  identification,  you  do

public  and  the  police?  Wouldn't  that  be  the  appropriate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encouragement  we  would  give,  if  we  don't  let  police  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  things  in  questionable  situations? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  think  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

what  the  ­­ the  existing  rule  on  the  exclusionary  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  does.  It  encourages  officers  to  comport  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth  Amendment.  This  applies  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  We're  begrudging  them 

  

 

 

 

now  from  doing  that.  We're  saying  if  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questionable  probable  cause,  go  ahead  and  do  it  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  not  going  to  make  you  take  that  extra  step  of  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merely  stopping  someone  and  saying,  will  you  talk  to  me, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

please. 

            

MR.  GREEN:  No.  I  don't  think  so,  Your 

    

  

 

 

 

 

Honor.  I  think,  again,  because  there  are  two  predicate 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

steps  that  must  be  ­­ that  must  happen  before  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  would  apply.  And  the  officer,  before  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

stop,  can't  count  on  either  one.  That's  why  when  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  we  are  talking  about  conduct  here  that  is  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  admittedly  a  violation  of  the  Fourth  Amendment,  but

identified  in  its  ­­ in  its  holding  in  Johnson  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Louisiana.  This  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Green,  you  make  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

point  that  a  person's  name  is  not  suppressible,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  derived  from  just  knowing  the  name  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppressible.  If  you're  right  about  that,  then  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

police  could  stop  anyone  and  say,  whether  I  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  suspicion  or  not,  I  want  to  know  your  name  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that's  not  suppressible  ­­ then  does  the  warrant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

check,  which  you  say  is  intervening  circumstance.  So  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  that  your  argument  is  ­­ is  arming  the  police  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  every  person  what  is  your  name  and  doing  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  check. 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  Your  Honor,  it  is,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  that's  one  of  the  purposes  of  a  Terry  stop,  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  investigatory  stop,  is  to  try  to  find  a  person's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

name. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  thought  you  needed 

    

 

 

 

reasonable  suspicion.

MR.  GREEN:  That's  correct.  That's  right. 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  This  is  a  case  where 

   

  

 

 

 

            

            

you're  telling  us  reasonable  suspicion  or  not,  the  name, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  person's  name,  is  not  suppressible. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  That's  right,  Your  Honor.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

it  is  admittedly  the  but­for  link  between  the  initial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate  unlawful  stop,  and  the  later  discovery  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant,  and  the  arrest  on  the  warrant,  which  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervening  circumstance.  That's  why,  Your  Honor,  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  this  is  ­­ this  falls  comfortably  within  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  prior  attenuation  jurisprudence.  Just  like 

  

 

 

 

 

the  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  what  is  an  intervening 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance,  in  your  view?  What  is  your  test  for  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is? 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Your  Honor,  I  ­­ we  think  under 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  ­­ it's  ­­ it  flows  naturally  from  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teaching  in  Wong  Sun.  That  is,  it's  any  means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently  distinguishable  from  a  predicate  unlawful 

   

 

 

 

act,  such  that  suppressing  evidence  seized  after  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  yield  appreciable  deterrence. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  this  Court's  cases  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  And  your  view  is  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

we  should  look  at  the  question  of  whether  something  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  intervening  circumstance  through  the  deterrence  lens.

That  makes  a  lot  of  sense.  We  look  at  everything 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  a  deterrence  lens  with  respect  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

exclusionary  rule.  And  that,  you  know,  what  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  say  is  this  ­­ does  this  appreciably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increase  deterrence  or  not;  is  that  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  That's  the  inquiry,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

yes. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  I  ­­ so  I  guess,  then, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

I'm  back  to  my  question.  In  a  world  in  which  finding 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  with  an  outstanding  arrest  warrant  was  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extremely  low  probability,  you  would  be  right.  In  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world  in  which  it  was  an  extremely  high  probability,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  wrong. 

 

 

            

 

 

Then  it  seems  like,  where  is  this  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spectrum?  What  do  we  know  about  that?  It  sure  seems  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  again,  I  will  come  back  to  this.  I  was 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

surprised  beyond  measure  by  how  many  people  have  arrest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants  outstanding,  and  particularly  in  the  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

areas  in  which  these  stops  typically  tend  to  take  place. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  that,  it  seems  to  me,  you  know,  is  a  pretty  strong 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  for  why  this  will  increase  deterrence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Your  Honor  ­­ again,  I  think, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan,  the  answer  to  that  is  the  inquiry  here  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attenuation  is  not  just  is  there  an  intervening 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance.  Under  this  Court's  prior  cases,  there

still  must  be  something  else.  And  we  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  else,  following  from  this  Court's  teaching  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brown,  is  a  flagrancy  inquiry:  What  level  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

culpability  does  this  conduct  display? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  Mr.  Green  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Do  you  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

something  else  includes  a  subjective  component,  whether 

   

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  purpose  to  see  if  there  was  a  warrant? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  We  don't,  Your  Honor.  We  think 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  inquiry  is  inconsistent  with  the  way  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  Fourth  Amendment  jurisprudence  has  evolved. 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  isn't  flagrancy  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  it  that  ­­ it's  true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  would  be  a  step  maybe  beyond  our  ­­ our  ­­ our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases. 

            

On  the  ­­ on  the  other  hand,  if  the  inquiry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  one  of  flagrancy,  then  maybe  that's  necessary.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  may  be  particularly  necessary  here  because  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  of  questioning  that  Justice  Kagan  just  concluded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  you,  it  would  seem  odd  for  this  Court  to  say  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

higher  crime  ­­ the  more  it's  a  high­crime  area,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  basis  you  have  to  stop.  That's  very  odd. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  I  think,  Your  Honor  ­­

subjective­purpose  component  might  serve  an  important 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  here,  so  that  a  police  officer  can't  just  say, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  going  to  see  if  there's  a  warrant  for  this  fellow. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  ­­ that's  the  reason  I'm  going  to  stop.  That  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me  quite  ­­ quite  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  Justice  Kennedy,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

the  answer  to  that  question  is  ­­ is  that  in  the  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  which  Respondent  relies,  citing  the  ­­ the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subjective­purpose  requirement,  those  have  all  been 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  involving  arrests  without  probable  cause.  And  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  circumstances,  the  ­­ the  factors  and  the  facts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  think  this  Court  discussed  in  those  cases  go  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  the  objective  unreasonableness  of  those  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions. 

            

We  think  it's  different  in  the  context  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Terry  stop,  where  this  Court  has  repeatedly  said  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  make  the  stop  in  order  to  investigate,  in  order  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confirm  or  dispel  suspicion.  And  that's  particularly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

so,  Your  Honor,  where  ­­ with  relation  to  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two­part  test  that  we  think  this  ­­ that  we  think  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  here,  where  the  intervening  circumstance  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  preexisting  warrant  based  on  probable  cause,  arising 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  facts  completely  unrelated  to  the  stop.  That  type 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  intervening  circumstance  matches  up  precisely  with

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  This  is  a  non  sequitur. 

   

  

 

 

 

When  you  talk  about  an  intervening  circumstances  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  looked  at  it  in  the  case  law  ­­ it's  always  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  different  than  the  actual  stop.  Another 

  

 

 

 

 

 

police  officer  comes  by  and  says,  oh,  I've  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

searching  for  that  guy.  I  know  he  has  ­­ I  ­­ I  have 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ an  arrest  warrant  for  him.  A  witness  walks  by  on 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  crime  and  says,  he  just  robbed  me  down  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

block. 

            

Those  are  intervening  circumstances  because 

 

 

 

 

they  are  something  outside  of  the  stop.  This  location 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  evidence  was  a  direct  product  of  the  stop. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  would  never  have 

  

 

 

 

 

happened  except  for  the  stop. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Your  Honor,  we  agree  that  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  but­for  cause  here.  But  with  respect,  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  something  else  that  happened  here.  That  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  prior  finding  of  probable  cause  by  a  neutral  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detached  magistrate  on  a  crime  completely  unrelated  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  facts  at  issue  in  this  particular  stop.  So  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense,  it  does  resemble  ­­

don't  let  that  cocaine  come  into  evidence  merely  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  a  ground  for  the  arrest.  We  look  at  how  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  was  secured  before  deciding  whether  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppressible  or  not. 

 

 

            

And  I  don't  see  how  this  is  any  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  not  letting  someone  be  arrested  ­­ or  suppressing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DNA  evidence,  fingerprint  evidence  that  leads  to  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes.  We've  suppressed  those  things  because  they've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been  the  product  of  an  illegal  stop. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Justice  Sotomayor,  we  agree  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  that  if  the  bag  of  cocaine  ­­ if  an  officer  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  a  bag  of  cocaine  during  an  unlawful  stop,  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  precise  situation  where  the  exclusionary  rule  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually  apply. 

 

            

What's  different  here  is  that  the  search  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  ­­ in  which  the  drugs  and  the  other  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  found  occurred  while  the  suspect  was  in  lawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

custody. 

            

Respondent  has  admitted  that  the  arrest 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  was  lawful.  And  the  arrest  was  therefore 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawful.  And  under  this  Court's  decision  in  Robinson, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

once  the  arrest  is  lawful,  the  search  incident  to  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawful,  and  all  the  evidence  gathered  in  any  that  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  search  is  lawfully  seized.

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Green,  you  made  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statement  in  reply  brief  that  says,  "The  Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  does  not  require  officers  to  have  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspicion  before  they  check  for  warrants." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  mean  that,  then  any  officer  can  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  your  name,  I'll  check  you  for  a  warrant. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  An  officer  could  do  that,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  That's  certainly  right.  But  what  happened  here 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  the  ­­ the  ­­ of  course  that  request  came  during 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  course  of  a  stop  that  we've  conceded  was  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supported  by  reasonable  suspicion.  And  so  the  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  what  happens  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  you  say  they  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

need  reasons  for  suspicion.  I  mean,  as  I  read  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

sentence,  it  says  the  officer  doesn't  have  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  suspicion.  It  can  grab  you,  what's  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

name,  and  check  for  warrants,  and  that  doesn't  violate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fourth  Amendment. 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  Justice  Ginsburg,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

don't  have  to  have  reasonable  suspicion  to  check  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants,  but  that's  different  from  making  the  initial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stop  where,  of  course,  they  do  need  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspicion. 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions,  I'd  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  reserve  the  remainder  of  my  time.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Bash. 

 

              

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JOHN  F.  BASH 

 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

                

SUPPORTING  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  start  with  the  concern  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor  and  Justice  Kagan  have  both  raised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  these  communities  where  there  are  a  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

outstanding  warrants. 

 

            

As  a  preface,  there  is  a  lot  of  communities 

   

   

 

 

 

 

where  there  is  not  a  lot  of  outstanding  warrants,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rule  that  Respondent  wants  you  to  establish  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclude  evidence  of  serious  guilt  and  serious  offenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide. 

            

But  focusing  on  communities  like  Ferguson 

 

 

 

 

 

with  a  lot  of  outstanding  warrants  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  I  don't 

    

  

 

 

understand  why.  If  there's  an  arrest  warrant  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone,  for  whatever  reason,  you  can  arrest  them.  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  do  is  stop  them  illegally  to  effect  an  arrest. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  it's  not  as  if  they're  going  to  get  away  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  the  underlying  crime  was.  There's  an  arrest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant,  they're  going  to  go  back  and  serve  their  time

on  whatever  circumstance  existed  warranting  that  arrest, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  are  they  getting  away  with  anything? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Well,  what's  being  excluded  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  the  crime  that  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Of  another  crime  that 

  

 

 

 

 

the  police  would  never  have  found.  But  we  do  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Well  ­­ well,  they  might  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  it  during  a  separate  valid  execution  of  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  execution  of  the  warrant  without  a  preceding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Terry  stop,  but  the  evidence  found  on  a  person,  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  a  firearm,  can  be  very  serious  crimes  that  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  of  significant  danger  to  these  communities. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  that's  true  of  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  we  suppress.  Now  you're  attacking  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

suppression  jurisprudence. 

 

            

We  understand  there's  a  cost  to  suppressing 

   

 

 

 

 

evidence.  But  we  believe,  as  we've  been  taught  by  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedents,  that  there  is  value  in  ensuring  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth  Amendment  is  respected. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Of  course.  And  the  overarching 

  

  

 

 

 

 

inquiry  always  is  weighing  those  very  serious  costs  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excluding  evidence  of  guilt  against  the  deterrent  value 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  would  get  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what's  our  rule  now? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Now  you  don't  need  reasonable  suspicion  to  stop  someone.

You  only  need  questionable  reasonable  suspicion  to  stop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone. 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  BASH:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  now  ­­ so  we've  now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lessened  the  standard  ­­ the  Terry  stop  standard,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  fairly  intrusive  to  stop  someone. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  ­­ I  suspect,  and  I  don't  know  whose  brief 

   

   

 

 

 

 

it  was,  yours  or  your  ­­ or  Petitioner's,  but  someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  the  public  will  stop  this  if  they  don't  like  police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stopping  you  with  no  cause.  I  think  the  public  may  end 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  stopping  things  but  in  a  way  the  police  are  not  going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  like. 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Well,  Justice  Sotomayor,  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

not  talking  about  all  Terry  cases.  We're  talking  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  class  of  carry  ­­ Terry  cases  where  an  intervening 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

event  of  huge  legal  significance  occurs. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  turns  out  that  a  neutral  magistrate  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

already  found  probable  cause  to  arrest  this  person.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  certainly  not  talking  about  lowering  the  Terry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  in  all  cases  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No.  But  ­­ but  we're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

not  saying  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You're  not  talking  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statistics,  Mr.  Bash.  Could  you  do  that?

And  then  does  the  United  States  know  the 

 

 

 

 

percentage  of  residents  of  the  United  States  who  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outstanding  warrants? 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  We  don't  know  globally.  In  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

reply  brief  of  the  Petitioner  in  this  case,  he  cited  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

study  submitted  to  the  Department  of  Justice  in  2004 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  looked  at  two  counties.  I  don't  pretend  they're 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

representative,  but  it's  a  county  in  Minnesota  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland,  and  it  was  an  extremely  low  number  of  warrants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

per  person. 

 

            

And  of  course,  using  that  number  would  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  assumption  that  every  warrant  is  for  a  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

person,  which  is  probably  not  true.  And  it  would  assume 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  population  reflects  the  total  number  of  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  could  be  subject  to  warrants,  but  of  course,  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pass  through,  people  come  in  and  out.  So  it's  probably 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extremely  low. 

 

              

I  ­­ I  do  take  Justice  Kagan's  point, 

   

 

 

 

 

though,  that  there  are  some  communities  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants  are  high.  I  want  to  focus  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yeah.  And  what  ­­ what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

should  we  be  concerned  about  there?  What  ­­ what  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent  the  problem  in  ­­ in  communities  like  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Well,  it's  ­­ it's  important  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  that  Respondent's  rule  does  nothing  to  solve  the

problem  that  the  ­­ the  Department  of  Justice  in  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

March  report  ­­ March  2015  report  on  Ferguson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified. 

            

What  was  going  on  in  Ferguson  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipal  court,  in  conjunction  with  the  police,  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  arrest  warrants  as  a  revenue­raising  measure. 

   

 

 

 

 

They  were  issuing  warrants  for  very  minor  offenses  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure  to  appear,  and  then  police  officers  on  the  scene 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  the  incentive  to  arrest  people  to  bring  them  in  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay  the  fine.  Respondent's  rule  does  nothing  to  solve 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  because  everybody  agrees  the  arrest  is  lawful. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Department  of  Justice  did  not  find,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  community  with  as  significant  number  of  arrest 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants  as  Ferguson,  that  officers  had  an  incentive  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search,  and  that  they  were  acting  on  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive­to­search­people  incident.  The  incentive  was 

  

 

 

 

to  arrest  and  pay  the  fine. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  I  guess  ­­ I  ­­ I  take 

   

   

   

  

 

 

the  point,  Mr.  Bash,  but  I  guess  I  just  don't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

understand.  Of  course,  this  is  a  nationwide  rule  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

we  would  be  setting.  But  most  Terry  stops  do  not  happen 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  most  neighborhoods.  Most  Terry  stops  happen  in  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

high­crime  neighborhoods  ­­ appropriately,  but  where 

 

 

 

 

 

people  have  lots  of  arrest  warrants.

And  ­­ and  you  might  be  right  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  Ferguson  case,  but  I  still  have  my  question, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  why  doesn't  that  dramatically  change  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentives  for  police  officers  in  deciding  whether  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search  somebody?  If  you  know  that  there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  possibility  that  somebody  you  stop  is  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  an  arrest  warrant,  that's  another  reason  to  stop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them. 

            

MR.  BASH:  Justice  Kagan,  I  don't  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

empirics  show  that  the  numbers  are  so  great  that  even  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

high­crime  neighborhoods,  at  least  outside  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ferguson  circumstance  where  you  have  this  odd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revenue­raising  scheme,  that  the  ­­ the  chance  of  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding  a  warrant  and  then  finding  contraband  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

search  ensuing  to  arrest  is  so  high  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentivizing  officers  to  conduct  illegal  stops  solely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  purpose  of  finding  a  warrant. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  that  was  my  point  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  importance  or  the  likely  importance  of  purpose  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  analysis. 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  And  ­­ and  I  was  actually  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  turn  to  that,  Justice  Kennedy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  when  this  Court  has  mentioned 

 

 

 

 

 

flagrancy  in  cases,  not  only  those  cases  listing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brown  factors,  but  also  cases  like  Leon  and  Herring,

what  it  has  been  concerned  about  in  part  is  the  notion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  once  you  establish  an  attenuation  principle,  what  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say  is  a  common­sense  principle  here  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

generally  an  arrest  warrant  should  be  a  superseding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

cause  of  the  discovery  of  the  evidence,  you  might  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  officer  exploiting  that  rule  precisely  in  order  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  evidence  in  searches  incident  to  arrests. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  the  way  you  could  think  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

flagrancy  is:  Did  this  officer  have  the  purpose  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  could  either  be  a  purpose  objectively  understood  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  the  facts  or  it  could  be  a  subjective  purpose  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  exploit  this  attenuation  exception  precisely  in  order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  search  incident  to  arrest. 

 

 

 

 

              

 

 

I  don't  think  the  facts  here  remotely  get 

 

 

 

 

there.  I  ­­ I  don't  really  think  even  Respondent  has 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

argued  that.  This  was  a  legitimate  investigation.  The 

   

  

  

 

 

 

officer  may  have  made  a  mistake  about  the  quantum  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspicion  necessary,  but  if  you  had  a  case  where  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer  truly,  either  objectively  or  subjectively,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  out,  just  pulling  random  people  over  because  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  knows  about  this  attenuation  rule  established  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  I  think  that's  the  sort  of  flagrancy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration  in  cases  like  Leon  and  Herring  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  left  as  a  safety  valve. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  does  that  mean  that

we're  going  to  have  to,  in  every  single  case,  explore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  officer's  subjective  motivations?  Because  that 

  

 

 

 

 

sounds  like  the  kind  of  inquiry  that  we've  tried  to  stay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away  from  in  the  past. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Justice  Kagan,  Justice  Kennedy 

  

 

 

 

 

suggested  subjective  motivations.  And  I  think  that  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

some  support  in  the  earlier  attenuation  cases,  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brown  and  Dunaway  and  Taylor,  where  it  really  did  seem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  that  the  Court  was  inquiring  about  purpose.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  also  has  some  support  in  doctrines  like  inevitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery,  which  does  ask,  you  know,  what  were  you  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do,  in  effect? 

 

 

 

            

In  more  recent  cases,  the  Court  has  moved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

towards  an  objective  test.  So  I  think  the  way  the  Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  formulate  the  flagrancy  safety  valve  in  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  say  does  this  stop  appear  objectively  designed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exploit  the  ability  to  search,  incident  to  arrest  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant. 

            

And  it  could  look  at  all  the  circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  could  look  at  the  fact  that  this  wasn't  incident  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  legitimate  investigation.  It  could  look  to  the  fact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  officer  pulled  over  several  people  and  searched 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  for  warrants  in  the  same  incident.  I  think  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  that  safety  valve,  which  would  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  of  preserving  cases  like  this  one,  where  an

MR.  BASH:  Justice  Sotomayor,  respectfully, 

  

 

 

 

I  think  this  ­­ I  think  this  was  a  close  case  and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll  ­­ I'll  just  lay  out  why.  Maybe  you'll  disagree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  that. 

 

            

This  is  an  officer  with  18  years  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience  and  several  years,  or  a  couple  years,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  ­­ drug  crimes.  Got  an  anonymous  tip  that  this  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  drug  house.  Observed  it  intermittently  for  three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hours  and  saw  short­term  traffic  that  was  consistent  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  experience  and  expertise  with  drug  activity.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  someone  walked  out  of  the  house.

people.  He  could  have  been  a  short­term  visitor,  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  case,  I  think  most  people  would  agree,  that  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  cause  to  stop.  Or  it  could  be  a  long­term 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resident  of  that  house.  And  there's  not  too  many  houses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  involved  in  a  long,  ongoing  drug  trafficking  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  sales  that  the  ­­ a  long­term  resident  of  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house  wouldn't  know  about.  I  mean,  this  wasn't  a  pizza

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Yes.  But  it's  ­­ it's  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  given  that  there  was  no  reasonable  suspicion. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  you  could  argue  whether  it  was.  But  for  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes.  There  was  no  reasonable  suspicion. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  As  the  case  comes  to  the  Court, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  correct,  Justice  Ginsburg.  My  only  point  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  isn't  the  example,  in  my  mind,  of  the  safety  valve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flagrancy  situation  that  I  was  discussing  with 

   

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan  and  Justice  Kennedy. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Is  that  ­­ would  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  that  this  case  comes  to  us  is  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Utah  Supreme  Court  says,  no,  this  is  three  kings  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flagrant;  this  is  all  very  confusing.  And  courts  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coming  out  all  over  the  lot,  so  we  want  to  come  up  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  simpler  test. 

 

 

            

Do  you  have  ­­ are  you  saying  Utah  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong?  That  the  three­prong  test  that  we  have  now  is

these  attenuations? 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Well,  I  don't  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

three­prong  way  is  a  bad  way  to  look  at  it.  The  cases 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  actually  used  the  three  prongs  to  determine  whether

MR.  BASH:  We  think  it's  a  fine  way  to  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  this  case,  in  the  sense  of  the  Court  could  hold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

superseding  legal  authority  by  a  neutral  magistrate  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

an  intervening  event  of  significance  for  the  attenuation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis,  and  suppression  would  be  appropriate  only  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  stop  was  flagrant,  either  objectively  or

police  officer  ­­ officers  to  detain  citizens  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern  for  the  Fourth  Amendment,  knowing  that  finding  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  would  wipe  the  slate  clean  and  render  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  violation  irrelevant.  It  would  cut  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

heart  out  of  Terry.  It  would  create  a  new  form  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation.  Officers  would  be  stopping  citizens  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hunting  for  warrants. 

 

 

            

It's  already  the  practice  in  many 

 

 

 

 

 

communities,  and  if  Utah's  rule  is  adopted,  it  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

become  the  norm. 

 

 

            

It's  unnecessary  for  this  Court  to  take  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  sweeping  view  as  ­­ as  Utah  has. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  would  that  be  true  if, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  say,  one­half  of  1  percent  of  the  residents  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

South  Salt  Lake  or  Salt  Lake  City  have  outstanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants? 

            

MS.  WATT:  The  statistics  are  important  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

our  argument,  but  not  necessary.  Because  even  without 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statistics,  we  know  that  officers  make  stops 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely  for  that  reason:  To  find  the  warrant.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  they're  making  the  stop.  They  can  target 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

communities.  And  so  even  if  there's  just  a  ­­ a  very 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

minor  amount  of  ­­ of  warrants,  they  can  still  target 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communities  that  may  have  a  greater  incidence  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

warrants.  And  if  this  were  the  rule,  there  would  be  no

downside.  Officers  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  that's  true,  there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

downside.  If  the  officer  makes  an  illegal  stop,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer  exposes  himself  or  herself  to  all  sorts  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences. 

            

 

 

But  you're  saying  that,  let's  ­­ if  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  statistic  that  I  gave  you,  if  there's  a  1  in  200 

     

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance  that  there's  going  to  be  an  outstanding  warrant, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  the  officer  says  well,  you  know,  I  don't  have  ­­ I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  no  reason  to  stop  this  person,  but  if  I  stop  200 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  today  illegally,  then  I'm  going  to  find  one  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  an  outstanding  warrant,  you  would  say  that  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  gives  the  officer  the  incentive  to  make  those  199 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal  stops. 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  Well,  it's  still  precisely  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  officer  would  be  doing  it.  He's  writing  the  warrant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

check  in  this  ­­ in  this  facts  situation.  We're  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  ­­ about  a  very  narrow  set  of  facts  where  we  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  officer  that  detained  someone,  and  as  part  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention,  there  is  a  warrants  check.  These  ­­ these 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

were  not  separate  things.  It  was  inherent  in  this  stop. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so,  yes,  if  an  officer  is  detaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  under  those  circumstances  and  runs  a  warrants 

   

 

 

 

 

 

check,  he's  doing  it  precisely.

yes.

case,  the  State,  as  I  understand  it  ­­ please  correct  me

isn't  ­­ isn't  that  correct? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  Well,  that's  right.  That's

that  the  State  has  taken  is  ­­

MS.  WATT:  The  ­­ so  the  test  under  Brown 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  flagrancy  really  has  two  elements.  One  is  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  done  deliberately  or  purposefully.  And  we  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  Dunaway  and  Taylor,  and  Brown  itself  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful  conduct  that  is  undertaken  with  the  purpose  or

need  some  overarching  flagrancy,  that  that's  enough. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  the  purpose  is  important.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

viewed  from  an  objective  standpoint.  Here,  we  have  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer  that  told  us  his  purpose.  But  objectively,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  look  at  purpose.  We  look  at  justification.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  we  know  the  limits  of  a  Terry  stop. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

number?  What  percentage  of  people  have  to  have  warrants

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  suppose 

   

  

 

 

that's  related.  I  mean,  your  brief  had  a  lot  of  numbers 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  it.  And  if  only  one  out  of  a  hundred  people  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrest  warrants,  then  I  think  you  really  couldn't  imply 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  was  the  purpose  of  the  stop.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  is  that?  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

mean  every  time  a  police  officer  pulls  somebody  over  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

runs  a  warrant  check,  it's  because  he  thinks  it's  likely 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  warrant?  Might  it  ­­ might  it  be  to  protect 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him  when  he  walks  up  to  the  car?  He'd  like  to  know  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  is  wanted  for  murder,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  So  running  the  warrants  check 

  

 

 

 

 

 

tells  him  that.  That's  ­­ when  you  run  the  warrants 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

check,  you're  looking  for  a  warrant.  In  this  case, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  that  Officer  Fackrell  was  doing.  He  wanted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  try  to  find  out  something  about  Mr.  Strieff,  and  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  ran  the  warrants  check.

made,  that  the  warrants  check  is  inherent  in  that  stop.

wouldn't  it?  Now,  look  at  our  case,  Rodriguez  case.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumed  that  the  check  there  was  to  ensure  the  safety  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  officer. 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right. 

  

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  the  stop  here  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

purely  investigatory,  isn't  that  different?  Can  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  an  investigatory  stop  based  on  no  suspicion?

And  when  the  officer  is  making  the  arrest,  it's

Taylor  v.  Alabama.

the  ­­ the  arrest  and  the  search  incident  to  arrest  are

any  evidence  that's  found  in  the  dragnet  is  a  fruit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  so  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I'm  just  pointing  it  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  that's  a  curiosity,  isn't  it,  to  have  a  law  ­­ to

unprecedented  result. 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  Well,  our  position  is  these  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong  circumstances  because  part  of  deterrence  ­­ the

for  weapons?  Is  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  Well,  our  position  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything  that's  found  is  the  fruit  of  that,  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal  detention,  not  of  the  arrest,  because  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  arrest  and  ­­ and  ultimate  ­­ and  subsequent  search 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  ­­ are  a  fruit,  but  ­­ but  they're  not  suppressible. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're  not  something  that  we  have  fought  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because,  again,  we  have  the  warrant  and  authorization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  if  the  individual  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  arrested  and  put  in  jail,  isn't  it  standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  and  lawful  procedure  for  the  authorities  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search  that  person  thoroughly?  They  couldn't  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  bring  drugs  into  ­­ into  the  jail  or  things  that

search. 

            

MS.  WATT:  What  we're  asking  for  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppression  based  on  the  unlawful  detention  that  began 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  encounter.  So  ­­ so  this  encounter  begins  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stop.  The  stop  itself  is  ­­ is  unlawful.  The  State  has 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceded  that  throughout. 

 

 

            

So  what's  ­­ what's  the  problem  with  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stop?  This  is  a  stop  ­­ the  kind  of  stop  that  lawyer  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or,  I'm  sorry  ­­ that  officers  are  faced  with  every  day. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  a  basic  kind  of  stop.  It  ­­ what  ­­ what  do  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  about  Terry  stops?  The  officers  have  to  ­­ have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  reasonable  articulable  suspicion. 

   

 

 

            

Courts  have  ­­ tells  us  that  it's  really  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two­step  assessment.  They  have  to,  No.  1,  look  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

totality  of  the  circumstances,  and  No.  2,  they  then  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  look  at  whether  there  is  an  individualized  suspicion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  this  tie  in  with  this  defendant? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  this  case,  what  does  the  officer  know? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All  he  knows  is  that  there's  some  short  ­­ not  terribly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frequent,  short­stay  traffic  at  the  house.  He  sees  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client  emerge  from  the  house,  knows  nothing  else.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  under  the  totality,  a  reasonably  well­trained 

   

 

 

 

 

officer  should  have  known  this  stop  was  not  ­­ was  bad.

something  that  the  State's  conceded,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  Well,  I  think  it's  important 

   

  

 

 

 

because  the  State  has  taken  the  position  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  was  just  a  fact  or  two  shy  of  ­­ of  what  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed.  And  being  a  fact  or  two  shy  of  Terry  leaves  us 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  nothing.  Terry  is  already  a  fairly­low  standard, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

but  it's  a  ­­

   

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  you  still  have  to  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  flagrant. 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  Well,  my  position  is  ­­ is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

twofold;  one,  that  ­­ that  flagrancy  has  two  aspects. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One  aspect  is  just  the  deliberate  aspect.  And  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  this  type  of  a  stop  where  ­­ where  it's  made 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  purpose  of  ­­ of  running  a  warrants  check,  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  warrants  check  is  inherent  in  the  stop,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  enough;  but  secondly,  if  we  were  going  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  include  a  different  definition,  it  would  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  was  blatantly  unconstitutional. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  that's  why  I'm  moving  into  the  stop, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  talk  about  what  was  the  problem  with  this  stop,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  we  expect  of  our  police  officers,  what  do  we  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  our  police  officers? 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  ­­ you  said  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ that  the  stop  was  made  for  the  purpose  of  running

areas  there  are  a  high  number  of  arrest  warrants.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  areas  there  aren't. 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  how  ­­ is  it  entirely  empirical?  Do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  to  accept  and  generalize  from  your  empirical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  which  ­­ that  the  purpose  must  be  to  execute  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  check  for  arrest  warrants? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  No,  because  what  ­­ we  know  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  precisely  what  ­­ what  was  done  in  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  done  in  some  other  cases.  In  this  case,  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  an  officer  that  makes  a  stop  and  immediately 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

runs  that  warrants  check.  How  does  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  he  immediately 

  

 

 

 

 

runs  the  arrest  ­­ warrants  check  when  he  makes  the  stop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  he  wants  to  know  who  he's  dealing  with.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  ­­ it  would  be,  I  think,  bad  police  work  to  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

run  the  warrant  check  until  after  you've  had  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interaction  with  the  person  when  the  danger  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  found  out  about  might  have  been  when  it's  too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

late  to  ­­ to  act  on  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  The  way  he  finds  out  who  he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing  with  is  if  there's  a  warrant.  The  point  is,  he 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  have  a  reasonable  suspicion  to  stop  my  client. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  In  order  to  run  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You're  implying  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

I'm  still  trying  to  get  at  how  you  decide  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  was.  In  your  brief  you  say  several  times,  oh, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  purpose  is  to  ­­ to  run  the  warrants  check.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  want  to  know  why  that's  ­­ why  that's  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  Because  it  was  immediate;  it  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherent  in  what  he  did;  because  he  stated  that  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  in  ­­ in  stopping  my  client  was  to  find  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  my  ­­ find  out  about  the  house;  and  that  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normal  for  him  to  run  a  warrants  check  and  normal  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him  to  know  ­­ want  to  know  who  he's  dealing  with  so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You're  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Let's  say  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  check  is  something  he  does  when  he  arrests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  I  don't  doubt  that,  but  it  doesn't  prove  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  his  purpose  in  ­­ in  the  stop. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  So  the  intended  consequence  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

running  a  warrants  check  is  to  find  a  warrant,  No.  1. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  No.  2,  our  statistics  show  that  ­­ that  in  ­­ in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sizable  number  ­­ it's  ­­ officers  are  likely  to  find

MS.  WATT:  When  an  officer  detains  someone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

as  part  of  a  fishing  expedition  in  the  hope  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  will  turn  up,  that  is  ­­ that  is  the  purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  a  problem. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  There  was  no  suspicion 

  

 

 

 

 

here.  He  was  ­­ your  client  wasn't  frisked. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  I'm  sorry.  Wasn't  frisked? 

  

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No.  There  was  no 

  

  

 

 

 

activity  that  the  officer  is  alleged  to  have  seen  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  put  the  officer  in  fear  of  any  ­­ that  this

understand  what  you're  trying  to  say  is,  he  is  now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

routinely  checking  every  single  person  that  he  stops, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  with  or  without  reasonable  suspicion.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can't  be  any  other  reason  other  than  he  wants  to  find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  warrant  or  not. 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  WATT:  But  that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  part  of  the  stop  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  to  investigate,  but  the  other  part  of  the  stop  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  doing  this  routinely,  with  no  reasonable  suspicion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  no  articulable  fear  of  his  ­­ for  his  own  safety. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He's  demanding  peoples'  names,  and  he's  running  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  to  do  what?  You're  saying  to  find  the  warrant. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  Find  the  warrant. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  How  often  are  ­­ are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cars  ­­ people  stopped  driving,  an  officer  walks  up  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  car  and  they're  shot?  Has  that  happened  a  fair 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount  of  times? 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  It  does  happen. 

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It  does  happen.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

is  there  no  other  reason  for  checking  to  see  if  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  warrants  out  for  that  person  before  you  walk  up  to

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It  seems  to  me  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanting  to  get  shot's  a  pretty  good  reason. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  But  this  presents  a  completely 

   

  

 

 

 

different  scenario.  This  officer  approached 

  

 

 

 

Mr.  Strieff.  He  knew  very  little  about  him.  You  know, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  matter  of  deterrence,  a  reasonably  well­trained 

   

   

 

 

 

officer  would  have  known,  should  have  known  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  enough  there.  Because  he  didn't  know  anything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  my  client,  there  was  no  individualized  suspicion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  we  really  don't  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

very  much  about  exactly  what  happened  here,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfortunate.  But  what  the  officer  testified  was  that  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  just  grab  this  guy  and  say  give  me  an  ID  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  ­­ and  then  run  a  warrants  check.  He  did  say  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  ­­ he  approached  him  and  he  said  ­­ identified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

himself.  He  said  he  thought  there  might  be  drug 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  going  on  in  the  house,  and  he  asked  him  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  ­­ he  said,  "I  asked  him  to  tell  me  what  he  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  there." 

 

            

Now,  we  don't  even  know  what  he  ­­ unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  ­­ it's  someplace  else  in  this  record,  we  don't  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  what  your  client  said.  But  he  could  have  said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  am  I  doing  there,  yeah,  I  live  there,  or,  my  mother 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lives  there,  or,  my  best  friend  lives  there.

But  whatever  ­­ we  don't  know  what  he  said. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  then  at  some  later  point  he  ran  a  warrants  check. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  how  can  we  infer  from  that,  that  the  whole  point  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  stop  was  to  run  the  warrants  check? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  So  ­­ so  a  really  important  part 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  officer's  testimony  was  that  he  didn't  remember 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  that  answer  was.  So  if  my  client  had  said,  I  went 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  there  because  there's  someone  who's  ill  and  I've  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visiting  for,  you  know,  20  minutes,  or  ­­ or,  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  my  friend  lives;  that's  why  I  was  there,  end  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry,  and  ­­ and  the  warrants  check  shouldn't  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  run.  A  reasonably  well­trained  officer  should 

    

 

 

 

 

know. 

            

The  ­­ the  important  part  of  this  case  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  we're  only  looking  at  ­­ we're  not  just  looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  deterring  Officer  Fackrell,  we're  looking  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterring  future  conduct  by  officers.  And  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Terry  limitation  is  something  we  want  our  officers  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know.  It's  fairly  straightforward.  This  is  a  fairly 

   

  

  

 

 

 

straightforward  case  that  is  going  on  every  day  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country  where  officers  are  looking  at  houses,  watching 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

houses  that  maybe,  might  have  drug  trafficking  going  on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're  trying  to  establish  probable  cause.  Case  law  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relatively  clear  about  what  you  need  to  get  probable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  on  a  house.

It's  also  relatively  clear  about  what  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  to  get  individualized  suspicion.  We  know  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cortez  we  need  those  two  elements.  We  ­­ we  also  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  Ybarra  that  just  being  in  proximity  to  other  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  enough.  Being  around  ­­ even  when  the  officers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  probable  cause  to  search  or  probable  cause  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrest  someone  if  you're  standing  right  there,  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough. 

            

So  it  should  be  clear  to  an  officer  that  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client  leaving  a  house  that  he  doesn't  even  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable  cause  on,  that  he's  trying  to  find  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  about  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  all  he  did  was  go

around,  that  are  stopped,  that  a  warrants  check  is  run 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  nothing  comes  up  and  then  they're  sent  on  their  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  no  oversight. 

 

 

            

The  ­­ the  officer  is  encouraged  to  engage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  a  catch­and­release  type  of  approach  with  our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenry.  And  Utah's  rule  would  be  something  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  create  that  incentive. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  In  ­­ in  your  brief  you

only  if  it  is  unforeseeable. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  Well,  our  position  is  that  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervening  circumstance  needs  to  be  independent,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ it  needs  to  be  a  break  in  the  ­­ the  causal  chain. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  when  ­­ when  a  warrant  is  run  ­­ and  it  needs 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  something  that  is  not  directly  related  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer's  conduct. 

 

            

 

And  so  because  the  warrants  check  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherent  part  of  ­­ of  the  detention,  it's  not  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervening  circumstance.  And  that's  something  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Utah  Supreme  Court  unanimously  agreed  with  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  dissent  in  the  Utah  court  of  appeals  as  well,  agreed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  ­­ it's  a  natural  and  foreseeable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence.  It  is  the  intended  result.  It  ­­ it  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  something  that  ­­ that  is  independent,  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  as  a  surprise. 

   

 

            

And  that  ­­ that's  really  consistent  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  case  law  in  dealing  with  intervening 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances.  Spontaneous  confessions  are  something 

  

 

 

 

that  are  independent;  they  ­­ they  break  the  chain.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  free  will,  and  that's  independent  and  breaks  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chain.  Witness  testimony.  But  here  there  was  no  break. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  was  a  direct  result  of  the  officer's  conduct. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ the  rule  that  we  are  really  asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  to  ­­ to  adopt  follows  settled  exclusionary

rule  case  law,  and  that  is  that  ­­ that  if  there  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad  stop,  it's  suppressed  unless  there  is  attenuation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  of  course,  if  there  hadn't  been  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant,  if  ­­ if  the  officer  had  just  stopped  my  client 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  searched  him,  I  don't  think  anyone's  contesting  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  just  simply  be  suppressed  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attenuation. 

            

And  in  this  case  there  was  ­­ there  was  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attenuation  as  well  because  all  three  of  the  factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  Court  has  looked  at  work  in  favor  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppression.  The  temporal  proximity  works  with  us, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

obviously.  It  was  ­­ it  was  contemporaneous.  It  was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediate.  It  was  inherent. 

  

 

 

            

It's  not  an  intervening  circumstance  because 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  independent  and  it's  not  a  break  in  the  causal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chain.  And  it  was  deliberate  conduct  on  this  officer's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  that  was  blatantly  unconstitutional.

MS.  WATT:  I  guess  I  don't,  no. 

    

   

 

 

So  ­­ so  our  position  is  that  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

falls  squarely  within  the  ­­ the  Court's  settled  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  We're  asking  that  the  Utah  Supreme  Court  be  upheld 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  agree  that  attenuation 

  

 

 

 

 

is  based  on  ­­ on  deterrence;  that  the  attenuation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  is  based  on  a  calculation  of  the  deterrent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  of  the  ruling. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  I  do.  I  do.  I  ­­ I  agree  that 

    

    

    

   

 

 

the  focus  is  on  deterrence.  And  I  think  that  in  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance,  there's  powerful  deterrence  to  ­­ to  adopt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  position  and  to  not  follow  Utah's  position. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  ­­ if  Utah's  position  is  ­­ part  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterrence  is  looking  at  the  incentive  to  violate  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  Constitution,  and  looking  forward  to  see  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see  what  would  happen  with  the  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  under  Utah's  rule,  we  ­­ there  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  to  stop  police  officers  from  ­­ from  stopping 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  on  the  street,  articulating  something.  Terry 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  take  much.  Most  ­­ most  officers  can  articulate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  sort  of  justification,  looking  for  the  warrant,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  sending  people  on  their  way.  So  ­­ so  we  believe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  deterrence  would  be  very  well  served  by  adopting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  rule.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  ­­ and  your  deterrence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument  doesn't  depend  at  all  on  statistics? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  With  ­­ even  without  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statistics,  our  deterrence  argument  works  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  a  reasonably  well­trained  officer  would  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

should  know  what  the  parameters  of  Terry  are.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer  did  not. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  if  one  in  a  thousand 

   

  

 

 

 

 

people  has  an  outstanding  warrant,  that's  enough? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  So  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  That  statistic  would  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statistic  wouldn't  upset  your  argument? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  It  wouldn't  upset  my  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  ­­ we  run  ­­ officers  run  warrants  checks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they're  likely  to  find  them  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  One  ­­ one  in  10,000,  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  upset  your  argument? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  I  ­­ I  suppose  ­­

going  to  see  much  less  of  this  behavior,  you  know,  much

for  even  more  minor  infractions.  This  was  a  traffic

certain  amount  of  days,  they're  issued  virtually

MS.  WATT:  Right.  And  that's  exactly  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

this  one  was. 

 

 

            

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  it  doesn't  create 

  

 

 

 

 

an  incentive  of  the  kind  you  were  arguing,  you  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worried  about  before. 

 

 

            

MS.  WATT:  I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  warrants  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

warrants  are  automatic.  You  were  suggesting  that,  oh, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  thing  that  will  happen  is  they'll  be  issuing  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  warrants  if  they  know  they  can  get  evidence  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal  stops.  And  because  the  warrants  are  automatic, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  not  going  to  be  issuing  all  these  warrants,  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they? 

            

MS.  WATT:  They're  automatic  in  certain 

  

 

 

 

 

circumstances,  and  those  circumstances  would  increase. 

 

 

 

 

 

So  they're  automatic  right  now  for  no  insurance  or  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speeding.  They  would  increase.  And  ­­ and  they'd  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

automatic  for  infractions.  They'd  ­­ and  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspect  is  the  databases  and  the  incentive  to  keep  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

databases  accurate  and  up­to­date. 

 

 

 

            

It's  our  position  that  this  absolutely  plays

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  TYLER  R.  GREEN 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  I  could  just  make  three  brief  points  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

response. 

            

First,  to  the  suggestion  that  officers  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

random  stops  in  order  to  find  a  warrant  to  conduct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

searches  of  this  type.  There's  actually  no  evidence  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ in  this  record  that  that's  what  happened  here,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  happens  more  broadly.  In  fact,  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite  is  true. 

 

 

            

If  you  look  at  page  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's  routine  practice 

  

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  run  warrant  checks.  Every  stop,  legal  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal,  he  says  it's  ­­ he  runs  warrants,  on  the  street 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  in  a  car.  Meaning,  that's  what  the  police  officer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

testified  to. 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  He  ­­ he  runs  them,  Justice

Sotomayor,  for  the  purposes  I  think  that  have  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussed  today,  for  safety  rationales  and  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  But  there's  no  actual  evidence  that  he  runs  ­­

officers,  run  warrants  on  any  name  you  get  because  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  do  is  wave  the  flag  of  safety. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  No,  Your  Honor.  That's  not  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're  saying.  We're  saying  that  there  is  a  safety 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

rationale  for  the  warrant  check.  But  beyond  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  also  the  important  flagrancy  safety  valve  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  talked  about  here. 

 

 

 

            

And  with  respect  to  this  particular  warrant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

check  on  page  101  of  the  Appendix  to  our  petition,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  actually  a  finding  from  the  district  court  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  that  this  officer  stopped  this  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  was  on  suspicion  of  drug  possession  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribution.  It  wasn't  for  something  else.  So  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

finding  is  here. 

 

 

            

And  more  broadly,  this  rule,  as  we've  noted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  papers,  is,  in  fact,  the  majority  rule  among  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  that  have  addressed  this  issue  throughout  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country.

In  the  United  States,  and  ­­ excuse  me,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Seventh  Circuit,  the  case  of  United  States  v.  Green 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  decided  in  1997,  almost  20  years  ago.  And  that,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  involves  States  with  a  large  number  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

metropolitan  areas,  Chicago  and  Milwaukee  and 

 

 

 

 

 

Indianapolis.  And  there's  no  evidence  in  this  record  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  this  Court  that  these  sort  of  random  stops  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  to  check  for  warrants  is  happening  in  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions.  So  I  think  the  actual  practice  and  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

way  it  bears  out,  and  has  borne  out  in  ­­ in  areas  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  has  been  adopted  undermines  that  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument. 

            

Second,  Your  Honor,  with  respect  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  whether  a  subjective  purpose  should  come  in, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

responding  to  Justice  Kennedy's  question  to  this  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  inquiry.  I  think  if  this  Court  were  to  do  that,  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  become  an  outlier  of  sorts  in  the  case  ­­ in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  Fourth  Amendment  jurisprudence.  And  I  think, 

   

  

 

 

 

with  respect,  if  ­­ if  it  remains  an  objective  inquiry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  consistent  with  the  rest  of  this  Court's  cases,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objective  inquiry  will  capture  the  flagrant  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We've  cited  four  cases  from  four  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  courts  in  our  reply  brief,  in  footnote  1  of  our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reply  brief.  That's  Illinois,  Missouri,  New  Jersey. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And  Oregon,  where  the  courts  that  have  applied  this  rule

have  undertaken  the  flagrancy  inquiry  and  have,  in  fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppressed  evidence  because  the  initial  stop  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flagrant. 

            

Finally,  a  third  point,  the  ­­ as  we've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

noted  in  our  briefs,  Your  Honor,  the  ­­ the  Respondent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  has  abandoned  the  Utah  Supreme  Court's  rule  that  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervening  circumstance  must,  in  fact,  be  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributable  to  the  defendant's  own  free  will.  We  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  appropriate  based  on  that  concession  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ that  this  Court  should  ­­ should  reverse  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  of  the  Utah  Supreme  Court,  and  leaves  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  of  course,  of  what  rule  to  adopt  instead. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  think,  Your  Honor,  this  ­­ this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervening  circumstance  here,  this  arrest  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preexisting  warrant  that  arises  from  probable  cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  facts  completely  unrelated  to  the  circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  facts  of  this  stop,  is  exactly  like  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  in  Johnson  v.  Louisiana,  which  is  the  case  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  pointed  to  in  Brown  v.  Illinois.  Where  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it  adopted  and  said  the  intervening  circumstance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  critical  to  the  attenuation  inquiry.  It's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

straightforward  application  of  that  particular  test. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Case  is  submitted.
