CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 027-22, American Insurance Association


versus John Garamendi.


Mr. Geller.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. GELLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may


it please the Court:


58 years ago almost to the day the United States


and its allies defeated Nazi Germany and World War II came


to an end in Europe.  Ever since that time, the United


States Government has been actively engaged in a series of


initiatives to obtain just compensation for victims of the 

war.  These efforts continue to the present day.


Beginning in the mid-1990s, the Federal


Government has been engaged in extensive negotiations with


other Governments concerning claims of Holocaust victims. 


The President himself has stated repeatedly that it's in


the foreign policy interests of the United States to have


these claims resolved exclusively in an international


forum and through nonadversarial means, rather than


through costly, time-consuming and contentious litigation.


To achieve these goals in the context of unpaid

insurance claims, the President has taken three actions. 


First, the United States has facilitated and encouraged


the establishment of the International Commission on


Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, or ICHEIC.


Second, the United States, with the personal


intervention of the President himself, has negotiated


agreements with Germany and Austria under which those


countries and their insurance companies agreed to provide


hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation for unpaid


insurance claims and to follow procedures worked out with


ICHEIC to process insurance claims in a nonadversarial


manner and under relaxed standards of proof, and --


QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, I -- let me mention a


couple of things that I find troubling about the case, and


one is that when Congress passed a law in this area it 

didn't include any language preempting State laws such as


California has, and when the President put out his


executive order or agreement it doesn't expressly do so,


either.  How does that affect our analysis, do you think?


MR. GELLER:  Well, the statute that Congress


passed was the Holocaust Assets --


QUESTION:  Yes, right.


MR. GELLER:  -- Commission Act, which clearly


gave authority to the President to take control of this


issue, and didn't provide any role for the States

whatsoever.


QUESTION:  But it didn't preclude a role.


MR. GELLER:  But in the area of foreign affairs,


under this Court's decision in Zschernig, and in the area


of foreign commerce under many of this Court's


decisions --


QUESTION:  Well, Zschernig has never been cited


since it was written.  It's kind of a troublesome thing to


hang your whole --


MR. GELLER:  Our whole case does not depend on


Zschernig --


QUESTION:  -- case on, and we have in the


meantime decided, for instance, Barclay's Bank, which has


some language in it that speaks against recognizing the


kind of --


MR. GELLER:  I don't --


QUESTION:  -- authority you talk about, and we


have the Breard case, that criminal case, Breard versus


Greene.  Now, how do we deal with those?


MR. GELLER:  Well, to begin with I think


Barclay's is completely distinguishable, Justice O'Connor,


on at least three grounds.  First, Barclay's concerns


solely the Foreign Commerce Clause, and the Court said in


Barclay's that Congress has primacy under the Foreign


Commerce Clause, and it read the record in that case to


5

conclude that Congress had acquiesced in or approved what


California was trying to do in the area of taxation, so


there was no suggestion that what California was trying to


do in that case prevented the Federal Government from


speaking with one voice in the area of foreign commerce. 


There's nothing, to begin with, comparable in this case to


suggest that Congress has done anything to authorize


California to engage in regulation of foreign insurance


policies involving foreign companies and foreign


beneficiaries.


Secondly --


QUESTION:  But the United States must have been


aware that this California legislation existed.


MR. GELLER:  I --


QUESTION: 


And the -- part of the story is that 

this State legislation was on the books before the


executive agreement with Germany and Austria that you've


just applauded, so when California acted there wasn't any


such accord.


MR. GELLER:  Well, several things, Justice


Ginsburg, and then I want to get back to answer Justice


O'Connor's question.  First, the Holocaust Act, the


Federal Holocaust Act was passed before the HVIRA, so it


could not in any way be read as acquiescing in or


approving anything that California was doing in this area.

25

 Secondly, and Mr. Kneedler will, I think, speak


to this, the executive agreement did not expressly preempt


any claims, because these were claims largely by foreign


nationals against foreign companies, and the President did


not believe it would be appropriate to extinguish all of


those claims, but we're not dealing in this case with


claims by individuals.  We're dealing with actions by a


State which interfere with what the President himself has


said are his goals in an area, a very sensitive area of


foreign affairs.


And this case is not like -- this case is much


stronger than Zschernig, because in Zschernig, the Federal


Government had done nothing in the area.  Nonetheless,


this Court said that the States cannot enter into an area


where it has the potential for embarrassment, or to 

interfere with the --


QUESTION:  Zschernig involved criticism of a


foreign government.


MR. GELLER:  So does this statute.  This statute


criticizes --


QUESTION:  Is that really a sound basis for a


decision like Zschernig, to say Oregon probate judges were


inquiring about the policies of Eastern European


countries?  I mean, I -- I don't regard that as a very


strongly reasoned opinion.

 MR. GELLER:  But this case, Chief Justice, is


much stronger than Zschernig because this is not a case,


unlike Zschernig, where the President has done nothing in


the area.  Here, the President has aggressively entered


the area and tried to impose a solution which he has


concluded is in the best interests of the foreign policy


of the United States, so it's not a question of field


preemption.


Zschernig could be looked at as a case of field


preemption.  What the Court essentially said, I think, in


Zschernig is that there is a field of foreign affairs


where, even if the United States Government has done


nothing, the States cannot enter.  This is a case that I


think gets much more clearly analogous to conflict


preemption. 


Here, the President, with the acquiescence of 

Congress, has aggressively moved to try to solve a very


serious international problem, and --


QUESTION:  But Mr. Geller, said in that very


agreement there is to be no preemption.  The President


said that when California law was already on the books.


MR. GELLER:  I don't think it specifically says


there's to be no preemption.  We're not dealing here, to


begin with, Justice Ginsburg, with claims by individuals.


We're dealing here with State legislation, and in the


executive agreement the President -- the President

promised to use his best efforts to prevent the States


from interfering with the executive agreement.  He has


concluded on many occasions that what California has tried


to do here is a direct interference, a direct interference


with the foreign policy position of the United States,


which is to funnel all of these claims through an


international commission.


QUESTION:  Well, if we can look just at the


agreement, isn't this what is usually called an executory


agreement, rather than a -- than a fully executed


agreement?  In other words, it says the United States,


recognizing the importance of the objectives of this


agreement, shall in a timely manner use its best efforts


in a manner it considers appropriate to achieve those


objectives. 


That's -- that's something yet to be done. 

That's not --


MR. GELLER:  No, I think, Justice --


QUESTION:  It sounds to me like executory,


rather than fully --


MR. GELLER:  I think what the agree -- Just --


Mr. Kneedler is probably better equipped to address the


meaning of the executive agreement, but it seems to me


what -- what the President has chosen to do there is to


promise to use his best efforts to look to see whether any


States or localities are taking actions which interfere

with the promises that the President has made to foreign


countries and foreign insurance companies to try to


achieve legal peace in the United States, and in those


instances where the States have taken action which


interferes directly with that -- with that promise, the


President has promised to use his best efforts, such as to


file briefs in this Court and others, arguing that


these -- these State statutes are preemptive, so it's --


there's no -- I think in the lingo of a statute there is


no express preemption here, but there's clearly implied


preemption under the Supremacy Clause.


QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, I may have misheard you, 


but didn't you describe the agreement a little more


broadly than its terms?  The President's agreement, as I


understood it, was to funnel all the claims through the --

the -- this -- this new body, and I don't understand that


producing the information that's sought in this case would


preclude that from being done.


MR. GELLER:  Well, the -- the international


commission not only set up a claims resolution process, it


also has procedures for the disclosure of information


which take into account European privacy laws, Justice


Stevens.  It was a very --


QUESTION:  But that's a different argument.  I


mean, that's not based on the text of the executive

agreement.


MR. GELLER:  Well, the executive agreement chose


the -- the President chose through the executive agreement


and through his negotiations with foreign countries to use


the ICHEIC system, rather than any parallel system, in


part because of the concern about violating European


privacy laws.  The California statute would be a blatant


violation of European --


QUESTION:  Well, but as I understand it, the


California -- one of the purposes of the California


statute is to -- to uncover claims that might not be known


about.  It produces the information that would then allow


the claimant to go to the -- the --


MR. GELLER:  But the international commission


has a separate -- separate policy for divulging 

information that -- and right now the, it's in the process


of finalizing that.  Under the international commission,


all of the insurance companies are producing their data


bases in private --


QUESTION:  But all, Mr. Geller, would you


clarify all, because I had the impression from the briefs


that there were only five companies, and that they cover


something like a little over 35 percent --


MR. GELLER:  No, that's -- that's --


QUESTION:  -- of the universe of -- of claims?

 MR. GELLER:  -- false, Justice Ginsburg.  It's


based on outdated information.  In light of the agreements


that the United States has reached with Germany and


Austria, all the insurance companies in those countries


have agreed to follow the ICHEIC procedures so that with


the inclusion of all the German insurance companies, all


the Austrian insurance companies, all the Dutch insurance


companies, and many of the Swiss insurance companies, I


would say that the ICHEIC system now covers at least


double the percentage that the --


QUESTION:  It's still a wholly voluntary --


QUESTION:  How -- how specifically does the --


does the California statute interfere with the operations


of the commission?


MR. GELLER: 


It interferes in a number of 

different ways, Justice Kennedy.  It interferes, to begin


with, because it presents the possibility that these


companies will have to pay twice, and it was a specific


promise on the part of the United States that they would


not have to pay twice.


QUESTION:  Well, that's assuming there's a suit


brought later, but --


MR. GELLER:  That's assuming, that's -- this is


all a part of the California system.  The only purpose --


QUESTION:  And that doesn't meet Justice

Stevens' point that this is just a disclosure --


MR. GELLER:  Well, that's -- I want to get to


that as the second reason, but I want to make sure the


Court appreciates the first reason.  It was very important


that these companies not be made to pay twice, and the


President --


QUESTION:  I -- I don't understand.  Why would


that be?  Why is there a risk? 


MR. GELLER:  It would be because under the


international commission these companies have already made


a substantial payment, over $100 million, to settle their


claims, but if the California process is allowed to


continue, it's possible that people will be able to bring


suit in California and recover separate --

This case is about a disclosure 

statute --


MR. GELLER:  It's --


QUESTION:  -- there's other legislation that is


not before us.


MR. GELLER:  I under --


QUESTION:  We are talking about a statute that


doesn't authorize anybody to bring suit.  It simply


requires disclosure.


MR. GELLER:  But the only purpose of the


statute, and this is as clear as can be from the face of

the statute, is to provide information so that


Californians can bring suit in California, but the second


way in which the California statute, Justice Kennedy,


interferes with the ICHEIC process is that all of these


companies agreed to the ICHEIC process on the assumption


that European privacy laws would be respected.  That's --


that is one of the principal reasons why the United States


has negotiated this alternative system.  Under the --


QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, one -- would you explain


one thing that is troubling?  The privacy interest that is


being asserted, one can understand an insured doesn't want


the insurance company to divulge the insured's records,


but we are dealing with a unique situation here in that


many of these insureds, the insureds that were concerned,


were killed in the Holocaust, and it seems to me to raise 

a privacy interest with respect to those people and their


beneficiaries is -- is kind of ironic.


MR. GELLER:  But Justice Ginsburg, this is very


important.  Under -- we're dealing with tens of millions


of insurance policies here.  Only a small percentage of


those policies has to do, have to -- relate to Holocaust


victims.  California would require, and this is a critical


point for the Court, California would require disclosure


of the intimate details of all 10 million of those


policies, 99.9 percent of which have nothing at all to do

with California, and nothing to do with any victims of the


Holocaust.  Under the ICHEIC system, under the ICHEIC


system, the only policies that will be publicly disclosed


on a data base are policies held by -- by possible victims


of the Holocaust.


QUESTION:  How does one know that?


MR. GELLER:  It -- it know -- under I -- under


the ICHEIC system, all of the policies written during this


era that are on electric data base are to be -- are to be


put into a system, and independently ICHEIC has done a


census of all of the possible Holocaust victims in Germany


during the pre-war period through various records and come


up with several hundred thousand names which will be


matched against the list of policyholders, and when there


is a match, that list will be put out on a public data 

base.  The German --


QUESTION:  There was a list --


MR. GELLER:  The German --


QUESTION:  There was a list that was due out in


April.  Has --


MR. GELLER:  That will -- I'm told that list


will be out by the end of this month, and the German


insurance authorities have concluded that publication of


that list would not violate any privacy laws because it


would be for the benefit of the people who are trying to

California, by contrast --


QUESTION:  I take it you could make that


argument even absent the claims commission.


MR. GELLER:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  What


California has tried to do here would violate the foreign


affairs power as well as the Commerce Clause, even absent


the -- the personal intervention of the President himself


to seek an alternative solution to this vexing


international problem, that's right.


For California, which has absolutely no


relationship to any of these policies, to insist that they


all be made public is, we think, a clear violation of the


Commerce Clause.


QUESTION: 


How -- how does it relate to the --

suppose we want to link the harm that this does under the


privacy laws to the operation of the commission.  How do


we do that?  Just, the -- the burden and the cost to the


companies that might better be expended on the claim --


MR. GELLER:  It's simply that California has no


relationship to any of these policies.  These policies


were all policies written in Europe by European companies,


and California's --


QUESTION:  But that's a separate argument from


the operation of the commission.

you had said, oh, that really isn't our case, we don't


need that, and that's what Zschernig --


MR. GELLER:  No, I -- that's not true, I was --


I was trying to distinguish the Barclay's case -- the


Barclay's case.


QUESTION:  All right.  Well, what do you --


MR. GELLER:  In addition --


QUESTION: 


What do you say is the principal 

flaw?


MR. GELLER:  There are -- there are three


arguments that we have made to attack this California


statute.  One is, is that it is, under many decisions of


this Court, including the recent decision in Crosby, in


clear conflict with United States foreign policy.  The


President has set out a particular policy to try to


resolve the last remaining issue from World War II.  It


involves channeling all of these foreign claims into an


international commission in a way that respects European

privacy laws.  California has set up a --


QUESTION:  And what case -- what case


establishes that principle, clear conflict?


MR. GELLER:  I would submit, United States


versus Pink, United States versus Belmont are two cases in


which the President issued executive agreements and the


Court found that they preempted State law.  I would --


QUESTION:  Yes, but here you -- that's the big


difference between those.  They preempted State law. 


There's no pretense by -- the executive says I'm going to


use my best efforts.


MR. GELLER:  Those case -- those executive


agreements, I do not believe, had any express preemption


provisions in them.  The Court simply concluded --


QUESTION: 


But when you take what the President 

undertook, which was just to use best efforts, that


doesn't sound like --


MR. GELLER:  Under the Supremacy --


QUESTION:  -- this Court would have much to --


MR. GELLER:  Justice Ginsburg, I think it's the


operation of the Supremacy Clause.  Here, the President


has set out a policy for the United States, and has issued


an executive agreement with foreign countries to try to


implement that policy, and I think it is clear under the


Supremacy Clause that the States cannot do anything that

would frustrate or interfere with the operation --


QUESTION:  With full knowledge, when the


President did that, that there were these laws in


California.


MR. GELLER:  And at the time that the -- that


these laws were in the process of being passed, the


President's personal representative, Stuart Eizenstat,


wrote a letter to the Governor of California saying,


please do not pass this law because it will interfere with


what the United States is trying to do in the area of


foreign policy, and I think it would be a shame if this


law went into effect because of the disastrous impact it


would have on the ICHEIC system, which the President of


the United States -- which two successive Presidents of


the United States have concluded is in the best foreign 

policy interests of the United States, and the best


interest of Holocaust victims in order to get money into


their hands quickly.


But secondly, Justice O'Connor, in addition to


the foreign affairs power, we think this is a blatant


violation of the -- of the Foreign Commerce Clause, which


once again is not within the power of the States to


interfere with.  Here we have foreign insurance policies


that have absolutely no nexus to the State of California. 


They are regulated by foreign --

 QUESTION:  Why do you say they have no nexus to


California?  Is it not true that there are 4- or 5,000


residents of California who may or may not be


beneficiaries of policies that they don't know about?


MR. GELLER:  Yes, but this -- first of all, this


Court has held that the fact that someone --


QUESTION:  Am I right on that assumption?


MR. GELLER:  You're right on that assumption,


but to begin with, Justice Stevens, we're talking about


10 million policies that you're trying to regulate, and at


the maximum they say they may --


QUESTION:  Well, you have to go through a big


data base to find the 5,000.


MR. GELLER:  Well, I don't -- I don't think that


there, that under this Court's decisions that the fact 

that there may be a few thousand people in the State


gives --


QUESTION:  But if they do nothing more than


identify policies people don't know about, how will that


interfere with the basic program?  Couldn't they then


require those claims be prosecuted in the tribunal that


they're setting up?


MR. GELLER:  Because ICHEIC has set up an


alternative disclosure system and the -- which respects


European privacy laws and secondly because the -- the

State of California simply has no power to exert its


influence, even in the form of a disclosure obligation, on


contracts that have no -- absolutely no nexus to the


State.


QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, as I understand it, this


ICHEIC system is wholly voluntary.  There's no law that


enforces it.  And update me on something else that you did


earlier.  You said many more insurance companies that were


in it than 35, 40 percent.  As I understand it, 80 percent


of the claims that were made to ICHEIC were turned down


because the claimants were not able to identify


sufficiently their heirs themselves --


MR. GELLER:  I think most of the information in


the record, Justice Ginsburg, and the information that the


State relies on relates to several years ago, not to the 

current ICHEIC process before the German foundation and


the Austrian foundation and a number of the Dutch


companies had decided to participate fully in that


process.


QUESTION:  Is this in the record?


MR. GELLER:  These are all events that --


they're in the public record.  They're not in the record


of this case, Justice Souter, but there are public


documents from ICHEIC and from the President describing


all of this.

QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Geller.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The California statute at issue here is not a


statute of general application that happens to have an


incidental impact on foreign Nations, foreign countries,


or foreign transactions.  It is a statute that is written


exclusively and specifically with respect to a category of


foreign insurance transactions occurring in foreign 

countries between foreign companies and foreign nationals


more than 50 years ago, and it concerns a subject matter,


the settlement of claims arising out of international


conflict, that has -- has always been understood by this


Court to be the responsibility of the national Government,


as reflected most recently in Dames & Moore.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, I thought that the only


requirement is put on a company licensed to do business in


the United States.  The -- California isn't reaching out


to grab a foreign insurance company that isn't doing

business in the United States.  It is asking questions of


a company licensed to do business in the State of


California.


MR. KNEEDLER:  But disclosure is a form of


regulation.  This is true, this is obvious from our


securities laws, it is -- it is evident from this Court's


decision in the BMW case of several years back, where the


Court -- which had to do with disclosure, and the Court


said that one State may not try to enforce its policies


with respect to the disclosure of information in other


States, and we think that --


QUESTION:  Did we do that?  Does the United


States do that, or States under blue sky laws in the


securities area?  Do we require disclosures of, say,


affiliates that are set up in --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Under blue sky laws, under the, I


believe it's the Hall decision, the Court said that a


State could require disclosures -- with respect to


in-State transactions it could require disclosures about


issuance of securities out of State that are related to


in-State transactions.  We have no in-State transaction


here.


California has claimed two possible connections


to the State to justify this statute.  The first is that


the companies, the insurance companies, certain insurance

companies do business in California.  Those are not the


ones that issued these policies, but they do business in


California.  Under this Court's decisions, I think most


notably the Connecticut General case that is cited in the


petitioner's brief, is a case where the Court said the


fact that insurance companies do business in the State is


not a sufficient basis for a State in that case to tax


transactions, insurance policies that are entered into


outside of that State, so it's clear that the fact that


certain insurance companies do business in the State does


not give California a right to regulate through disclosure


transactions and policies that happened outside the State


and, a fortiori, that's true with respect to foreign


transactions.


The other interest that California has been --

has asserted, which I think Justice Stevens referred to,


is the fact that some number, a very small percentage of


Holocaust survivors are in California, and with respect to


that, this Court's decision in Shutts make, and other


decisions make clear that moving to the forum State an


adjudicatory jurisdiction is not a sufficient nexus, or --


or legislative jurisdiction is not a sufficient nexus for


a State.


What we have here, again, is one State of the


Union trying to establish its own foreign policy, in the

words of the Zschernig suit --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, suppose there were no


Federal efforts in this area, which there weren't for


sometime, and as I said, the executive agreements we're


talking about post-dated this California disclosure law,


suppose there was nothing, would you still say that


because of the potential for interference there could be


no State disclosure legislation of this character?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  This, in our view, is -- is


a violation of the Constitution.  We think that the --


that the longstanding efforts by the National Government


to work out cooperative agreements with Germany and -- and


other countries in Europe arising out of the Holocaust


underscores vividly why this is a matter of national


concern, but we would be making the same argument 

irrespective of that.


The -- the structure of our Constitution assigns


to the National Government the resolution of foreign


policy issues, and this is a -- this is a very major and


longstanding foreign policy issue about how foreign


countries should resolve claims about their own nationals. 


These policies were issued to European nationals.  It may


be that there are beneficiaries or policyholders in


California now, but this is -- this is exclusively a


matter for the National Government --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, could I ask you to


comment on one aspect?  As I understand it, one of the big


insurance companies is an Italian company here that had --


wrote policies throughout Europe.  Does this -- does the


executive agreement with Germany and Austria have any


bearing on that -- on that?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Not, not directly, but -- but we


do think that the executive agreement manifests the


executive branch's policy with respect to the resolution


of Holocaust era claims, and there are, I think, two


principal conflicts with respect to the United States


policy.  One is the one, and I want to underscore this,


the one that was mentioned with respect to the -- to the


lists.


ICHEIC is establishing essentially a registry, 

the very thing that California wants to do, but in a much


narrower sense that has been negotiated specifically to


avoid conflict between German privacy laws and -- and


United States law, and what -- what -- through this


matching exercise and through use of various lists of --


of Holocaust survivor organizations, Jewish organizations,


and census lists in Germany will be putting together a


pretty comprehensive list of Holocaust survivors and


insurance policies issued in Germany to disclose in a way


that German authorities believe that list will not violate

German privacy laws.  The California statute, Germany


takes the firm position would violate German -- German


privacy laws.


The other conflict is the whole thrust of the


United States policy has been voluntary and cooperative,


not mandatory and regulatory.


QUESTION:  That's -- that's part of the problem


I have with the executive agreement argument.  It seems


executory.  It seems like something further is to be done,


the United States will use its best efforts.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, but the best efforts was,


it will use its best efforts with State and local


governments, in other words in direct communications,


and -- and Assistant Secretary -- Secretary Eizenstat and


others communicated --


QUESTION:  Well, it could sign a supplemental


agreement saying that we now agree that these laws should


be superseded, just like we did in Pink.


MR. KNEEDLER:  But this -- this agreement says


that -- says two things, that it would be in the interest


of the -- this is on page 155a of the -- of the petition


appendix, that it would be in the interest of the two


countries for the foundation to be the exclusive remedy


for the forum of the resolution of claims, and on


page 156a the agreement provides for the resolution of

claims through ICHEIC and supplemental procedures to be


developed through ICHEIC, which includes the development


of this -- of this list.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, how does that relate to


the litigation that was ongoing in the Eastern District of


New York that I think involved a slave labor question? 


Did the United States take a position that that


litigation, which involved people who moved here, or their


survivors moved here after, that that was improper


litigation?


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  Those -- that did not


involve State regulation, that involved private lawsuits,


and there was a settlement which the United States


encouraged.  Again, this was part of the overall approach


of the United States Government.


QUESTION:  But you were -- one branch of this


was that the -- the United States people who moved here


after, there was no connection with them.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right, and if -- if --


QUESTION:  Well, those plaintiffs were all


people who were certainly not in the United States when


this happened.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right, and if -- if there are


sufficient adjudicatory connections to the United States,


that would be fine.

if a suitable class action --


QUESTION:  Was that so of the companies that


were defendants in that case?


MR. KNEEDLER:  It wasn't -- it wasn't entirely,


but there was a settlement there.  Some of these issues


were not definitively resolved.


QUESTION:  My only question was, did the United


States take the position --


MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't --


QUESTION:  -- to stop that litigation --


MR. KNEEDLER: 


I -- I don't believe so. 

QUESTION:  -- because it was interfering with


the executive --


MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't -- I don't believe so


specifically, but that was early in the -- in the -- in


this settlement effort.


I want to make two important points about the


United States, the -- the Constitution's assignment of


responsibility.  The Constitution assigns responsibility


to the National Government for foreign relations and


foreign commerce because any retaliation or any adverse

impact will be felt by the Nation as a whole, not by the


State that -- that triggers it, and this is a point that


the Court has made in Japan Lines and numerous cases over


the years, and this case illustrates that, because what is


going on here is complicating.  It is an impediment with


our relations with European countries at a very sensitive


time, and you have one State who -- that is not


participating in all of those other efforts and doesn't


have to balance the -- the insult that might arise from a


statute like this against all of the other issues that are


on the United States' plate in dealing with foreign


Governments at a particular time.


This is the very reason, that the States don't


have enough information and the full responsibility and


the National Government has to look out for the interests 

of the Nation as a whole, why one State may not thrust


itself into foreign policy like this.  The due process and


foreign commerce arguments are very complementary of that


because they impose independent limitations on a State


thrusting its regulatory power outside of not only its own


borders but in this case outside the Nation's borders to,


again, regulate through disclosure information about


insurance policies in other countries.  The very fact that


Germany and California insurance regulations generally


maintain privacy of insurance information shows that

questions of privacy and disclosure are matters of

QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, would your argument be


different if California, instead of providing this


registry in public disclosure said, we want this


information in order to decide whether we will allow these


companies to do business in California?


MR. KNEEDLER:  May I -- may I answer?


Yes, that would present a different question. 


We don't think that California could require this blanket


disclosure.  I think under international comity analysis,


under this Court's decision in Aerospaciale, there may be


some ability for the State to request certain relevant


information --


QUESTION: 


Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  -- to investigate the


suitability.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kaplan, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK KAPLAN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. KAPLAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


California's reporting statute addresses a


despicable practice by insurance companies.  That practice


is the deception of elderly Holocaust survivors in the

refusal to provide them with basic policy information. 


That stonewalling has occurred for decades, and it


continues today, and it continues in California.


California responded to this insurance --


QUESTION:  Was the United States unaware of this


problem when it negotiated an executive agreement?


MR. KAPLAN:  Absolutely not, Justice Kennedy. 


The United States was well aware of California's efforts


in this regard.  The 1998 statute that was referred to


earlier that was passed by Congress occurred about


4 months after there was substantial testimony at a


congressional hearing in which several State insurance


commissioners --


QUESTION:  No, my -- my question was, was


United -- the United States unaware of -- of the 

wrongdoing that you're describing to us, or the -- or the


inappropriate corporate response, and the answer is, I


assume that they were, and they did nothing about it in


the executive agreement, other than to have this very


specific claims procedure.


MR. KAPLAN:  That -- that's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  It's not as if California has


uncovered something the United States didn't know about.


MR. KAPLAN:  That's right.  There were -- there


were numerous hearings held by the National Association of

Insurance Commissioners that are matters of public record


in 1997 and 1998.  There was a congressional hearing in


1998, again in the year 2000, 2001, 2002, all of which


described in extensive detail the stonewalling that had


been committed by survivor -- against survivors.


QUESTION:  I -- I don't think -- the problem, at


least for me, doesn't concern the desirability of the


insurance company practice.  I'll concede, absolutely it's


totally undesirable.


The problem, I think, for your side in my mind


is letters, for example, from the Deputy Under Secretary


of State Eizenstat to California, the insurance


commissioner and the Governor, about this very statute,


where he's speaking in an official capacity to say that


the statute has the unfortunate effect of damaging the one 

effective means now at hand to process quickly and


completely unpaid insurance claims from the Holocaust


period, that this law has already potentially damaged and


could derail the settlement, et cetera, so the record is


full of the Deputy Under Secretary of State who negotiated


the settlement, Eizenstat, Ambassadors, the President,


lists of -- in treaties, or executive agreements anyway,


and you the -- and you know what I'm referring to.  All


right.


Why doesn't all of that, taken together,

constitute what Justice Harlan in dissent in Zschernig


called a Federal policy in the foreign affairs area, so


that if we take the dissent in Zschernig it would seem,


hypothetically, for -- I'm trying to get your answer --


that that long list of things shows a Federal policy such


that Harlan and Stewart and the others, Harlan being at


the extreme there, would have to say that California's


statute is contrary to the Federal policy in this area,


has an impact on foreign affairs of a negative nature


through the conflict with the privacy statutes of


Switzerland and Germany, and therefore is contrary to the


foreign affairs power given to the executive branch by


Article 2 of the Constitution.


All right, that's a long question, but those are


the things that I'd like you very much to focus on from my 

point of view.


MR. KAPLAN:  I will, Justice Breyer.  Thank you.


We're dealing here with a State commercial


regulation, and -- and, in fact, we're dealing with a --


an area of State regulation that is a quasi-public


business, insurance.  It's long been regulated by the


States.  Congress delegated that authority to the States


60 years ago, and the States have been in that business


ever since.  We believe that it's Congress, not the


executive, that deals with matters of foreign commerce.

 QUESTION:  Do you think that the -- the


President cannot effectively preempt on foreign policy


grounds by his action an agreement?  Do you take that


position?


MR. KAPLAN:  I -- I take the position, Your


Honor, that in limited circumstances such as this Court


dealt within the Pink and Belmont case, where you -- you


had the recognition of a foreign Government, or in the


Dames & Moore situation where you had a foreign policy


crisis and you --


QUESTION:  I think you could answer yes or no.


MR. KAPLAN:  I apologize, Your Honor.  Would you


repeat the question?  I apologize.


QUESTION:  Well, do you take the position that


there can never be a preemption on foreign policy grounds 

by action of the President alone?


MR. KAPLAN:  No.  I think it's possible that the


President could do that in some limited circumstances that


I've indicated, but those circumstances do not exist here. 


You have an expressly nonpreemptive executive agreement


entered into after our law was passed.  The -- the


agreement was entered into after --


QUESTION:  Well, of course -- of course, if


there were a preemptive -- I'm trying to bring you back to

a kind of treaty, we would be dealing with the Supremacy


Clause.  We wouldn't be dealing with the foreign affairs


power of the President.


But the argument here is not the Supremacy


Clause.  Nobody claims that there is preemption.  What


they are claiming is, is that there is interference with,


in Harlan's words, a Federal policy in the foreign affairs


area, so if you're taking the position it has to be


preemptive under the Supremacy Clause, then you're saying


that all this material is totally irrelevant.


Now, that's a possible position, but I want to 

know what your view is.


MR. KAPLAN:  Our view is that where the


executive simply expresses an aspiration where -- which is


the situation here, where he's indicated he'll use his


best efforts, it's no different than --


QUESTION:  Oh, no, it's -- what I've read to you


is not an aspiration.  What I read to you were statements


by the Deputy Secretary of State --


MR. KAPLAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- that said the California statute

is totally contrary to the efforts that they were trying


to make.  I would -- of course, it's not legally saying


California is illegal, and that's why I'm -- that's what I


want you to explore.


MR. KAPLAN:  The response, Justice Breyer, is


this.  Under the Barclay's decision, Congress is the


primary authority when -- when dealing with --


QUESTION:  I thought Barclay's had to do with


the Commerce Clause.


MR. KAPLAN:  It dealt with both the Commerce


Clause and the foreign affairs power.  The Zschernig case


was taken for review by the Court.  The Court did not


dispose of that, and we believe that the foreign affairs


issue is subsumed within the Barclay's decision when


you're dealing with matters of State commercial 

regulation.


QUESTION:  The -- Barclay's dealt with the


Foreign Commerce Clause, and it made the point that the


one voice in that area was Congress, not the President. 


It wasn't dealing -- that case did not deal with executive


agreements, as I recall it, and I think I have a pretty


good memory of that case.


MR. KAPLAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And that being so, you see, the --


this is not the same for that reason, and also what we're

talking about here is, the Governments of Switzerland and


the Governments of Germany, not private people, saying


that if California enforces this statute, 98 percent of


which has nothing to do with Holocaust victims, that is,


the insurance policies don't, that is, what we're worried


about under our privacy statutes is Gwendolyn finds out


that Uncle Harry in England left all the money to Cecily


instead of Gwendolyn and, of course, Cecily doesn't want


that to occur.  That's her private affair.  That's why


Germany and Switzerland have laws that say these matters


are quiet, silent, private, and those Governments are


telling us that your statute violates their privacy law


because of its overbreadth.


MR. KAPLAN:  Foreign Governments were


extraordinarily upset about the -- the tax that was the 

subject of the Barclay's case.  In fact, the British


Government passed retaliatory legislation, and this --


this Court found that that was not sufficient when there


was no specific indication by Congress of an intent to bar


the State law.


Here, you've had testimony by Deputy Secretary


Eizenstat before Congress --


QUESTION:  Yes, but -- but that's -- the


Congress has principal concern with revenue and fiscal


policy.  It doesn't have principal concern with foreign

policy.  It's very different.


QUESTION:  And that was the reason that Barclay


said you -- yes, you're right that the executive branch


was in there saying look, all these foreign countries are


upset, and we think that they have a good case.  That was


the executive position, and this Court said, but you're


dealing in an area where Congress has the lead, holds the


lead rein and not the President.  That's the only point


that -- we -- when we were talking about the Foreign


Commerce Clause authority, that's a different question


than the executive authority.


MR. KAPLAN:  I -- I believe, Justice Ginsburg,


the issue here is whether the President, by engaging in


some negotiation, or expressing an aspiration as to what


the President thinks the foreign policy ought to be, can 

trump a State regulation, and I think the consequence of


that being so would be dramatic for matters of State


regulation, because State regulation often has some sort


of foreign implication to it, since we're dealing with a


global economy and there are often foreign affiliates that


are called upon to report on information, and if -- if


that law was overturned because a foreign Government or


the executive branch complained about that conduct, State


regulatory law would effectively be thwarted.


QUESTION:  Well, we can -- we can distinguish

those cases.  As -- as pointed out by -- by your


adversary, the difference in this law is that it is only


directed at foreign Nations.


MR. KAPLAN:  No -- no, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  The -- the only -- the only


disclosure required is -- is by affiliates abroad, isn't


it?


MR. KAPLAN:  Justice Scalia, that's not correct. 


The disclosures are required by California licensees,


including companies that wrote insurance who were


California licensees.


QUESTION:  What disclosures are required by


those licensees?


MR. KAPLAN:  Disclosure of the name of the


policyholder, where the policyholder lived, and the name 

of the beneficiary --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. KAPLAN:  -- and the status of the policy as


to whether it's paid --


QUESTION:  Of policies written by them?


MR. KAPLAN:  Yes, or their affiliates.  Or their


affiliates.  You have a situation, for example, where


Generali has been licensed to do business in California


since 1935 --

MR. KAPLAN:  Written in Europe.


QUESTION:  Ah.  In other words, it's only


directed at the regulation of foreign matters.


MR. KAPLAN:  It's -- it's direct --


QUESTION:  We can -- we can easily distinguish


those -- those California's laws that -- that are general


laws which have some indirect effect upon foreign affairs. 


This -- this thing is directed at foreign operations.


MR. KAPLAN:  It's directed at a concern that


California has by reason of the migration of -- of a large


number of Holocaust survivors to the State and, in fact,


the numbers that we've indicated in our submissions, Your


Honor, are that there are at least 20,000 Jewish Holocaust


survivors, and we don't know how many non-Jewish Holocaust 

survivors there are in the State.


QUESTION:  And to that -- and for that reason


California candidly made specifically reference to


Nazi-controlled Germany, to present-day Germany, and to


Europe, and to the Holocaust, none of which are of


California's concern when it conflicts with the


President's power to deal with those matters.


MR. KAPLAN:  Justice Kennedy, I -- I guess I


disagree.  I think California has a substantial concern. 


It has a concern about people in the State who don't have

basic policy information that they're seeking.


QUESTION:  Why don't they, because you see,


as -- as it's been argued to us anyway, there are two ways


of achieving this result.  Way number 1 would have


privately people whom you select, or trust, to go through


the 10 million policies that were sold, pick out all those


that might have to do with Holocaust victims, and make


them public.  I take it that's the route that Secretary


Eizenstat negotiated.


The other way is California's way, which is, you


make the whole 10 million public, so Gwendolyn and


everybody else finds out everybody else's information,


which happens to be a way that would violate the privacy


laws of Switzerland and Germany.


Now, what interest does California have in doing 

it the second way, rather than the first way?


MR. KAPLAN:  California has an interest in


obtaining information that companies doing business in the


State have so far exhibited they're unwilling to provide. 


By requiring the information that the law asks for, we


will be sure that there's no further stonewalling


occurring in the State, and that companies that want to do


business in the State will not engage in that conduct in


the future.  It will also assure that people --


QUESTION:  Well, it looks like the way this

scheme is written is, the -- the companies doing business


in California have to provide the information even if


they're unable to do so, even if when they go to an


affiliated, or company related somewhere down the line,


let's say in Germany or Austria, and ask for the


information, and German or Austrian law prohibits that


from being disclosed, then the California company will


have its license yanked.  Now, what kind of law is that?


MR. KAPLAN:  It's the same kind of law, Your


Honor, that the Europeans practice, too.  We've cited


something in the record.  It's the European directive that


appears at 2 E.R. 2747 to 2748.  European regulators, just


like State regulators, deal with situations all the time


where there may be a conflict with a foreign law or the


law of another State, and if States are -- are able to 

effectively regulate the business that -- that is going on


in the State and the companies doing business here, they


have to have the right to be able to apply their law.


Otherwise, there could be a law established


in -- in the Cayman Islands that established a privacy


right for companies doing business in the State, and a --


a company could assert that the law of a foreign country


precluded that company from -- from complying with a State


regulatory law, and we don't think that's how the law


works.

 QUESTION:  Well, are -- are you saying that


there is no way that the United States could act that


would, in fact, have that effect?


MR. KAPLAN:  I'm sorry --


QUESTION:  I mean, if -- if Congress passed a


statute in effect condemning what California had done, not


repealing McCarran-Ferguson but simply condemning it,


or -- or authorizing the President specifically to make


what the -- the agreements that the President has made on


an executive basis now, are you saying that neither of


those acts in effect would preclude California from doing


what it is doing under this statute?


MR. KAPLAN:  No, Justice Souter.  I think you'd


have a serious preemption problem there under the --


QUESTION: 


Okay, so it -- it boils down, then, 

to an argument about the executive power alone, is that


correct?


MR. KAPLAN:  Yes, it does.  It boils down to a


separation of --


QUESTION:  Well, is -- is your argument -- and


I -- I will be quiet after this question and let you say


whatever you wanted, but what I want you to focus on is --


MR. KAPLAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- do you take the position that


whenever the executive, let's say, agreement by

executive -- action by executive agreement is, in the


opinion of a State regulator, inadequate to address the


regulatory problem as the regulator sees it, that the


regulator is free, in effect, to disregard the policy in


the executive agreement?  Do you take that position?


MR. KAPLAN:  I do unless the executive agreement


is preemptive and unless there's something else about the


executive agreement that would give it preemptive quality. 


Clearly, the executive agreement --


QUESTION:  Well, are we talking about form of


words?  If the President and executive agreements had in


effect said, and no State can do anything which is


inconsistent with this policy, would your position be


different?


MR. KAPLAN: 


It might be, because I think you'd 

be dealing with a situation there where arguably it would


be a preemptive executive agreement which might carry the


same status as a -- a statute by Congress.


QUESTION:  Why does he have to --


QUESTION:  What if Congress had -- had ratified


what the President did so that it's no longer just an act


of the President but an act of the President approved by


Congress?  Would your position be any different?


MR. KAPLAN:  Your Honor, then you might have a


situation like Dames & Moore, where there was a pattern of

congressional acquiescence in the kind of executive


agreements that occurred there. 


QUESTION:  Well, but this isn't -- this isn't


just acquiescence in a -- in an executive agreement.  This


is Congress saying, we approve and ratify it.


MR. KAPLAN:  Then -- then you might have the


kind of specific disapproval of State action that this


Court talked about in the Barclay's case.  You don't --


QUESTION:  Well, why would it be any more


specific than this is?  If the executive agreement is not


expressly preemptive, and Congress passes a statute


saying, we agree with it; we think the executive agreement


is right on the money, it wouldn't, in fact, be any more


restrictive or less restrictive than it is now.


MR. KAPLAN: 


I -- I think the difference, Your 

Honor, is then you have Congress acting, you have Congress


speaking, which is what this Court in Barclay's thought


was the appropriate actor to speak in matters of foreign


commerce.


QUESTION:  Congress makes laws.  The President


doesn't make laws.  I'm not sure that the President can


make an executive agreement preemptive which is not


preemptive in its nature.  I mean, all -- all he can say


is, is there any -- any State action which is inconsistent


with our foreign policy expressed in this agreement is

invalid, but that's not -- not something that occurs by


reason of his pronouncement.  It occurs, if it occurs at


all, by reason of the Constitution, automatically, so it


really doesn't matter whether he says that or not.  His


saying it cannot make it happen, and his not saying it, I


think, cannot not make it happen.


MR. KAPLAN:  I agree.


QUESTION:  You shouldn't agree.


(Laughter.)


MR. KAPLAN:  Then I won't.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  May I ask you whether you think


that --


QUESTION:  I mean, if you agree -- the problem


is, if you agree with that, that you're then going to say 

on the tough kinds of things that you raised, how do we


know if this is a Cayman Island situation fake, or how do


we know if it's a really genuine important policy of a


foreign Government, say, the privacy policy?


There are one of two people who can decide that,


the Secretary of State or, say, the Governor or Insurance


Commissioner of California and the problem for you, I


think, is that the Constitution seems to give the


authority to decide that to the Secretary of State and not


the Insurance Commissioner of California because it's a

foreign affairs matter.


MR. KAPLAN:  I -- I think actually the -- the


Constitution gives that authority to Congress, and if the


executive branch --


QUESTION:  You mean, Congress is supposed to run


foreign affairs on every -- all of these matters?


MR. KAPLAN:  Congress is supposed to run


foreign -- matters of foreign commerce, including


objections by foreign Governments about the way States are


behaving.  If they -- if they think they're behaving


badly, then the executive can go to Congress, lodge a


complaint, and if Congress is so inclined, Congress can do


something about it.


Clearly, here, Congress has done nothing about


it. 


In fact, Congress has -- has encouraged the State 

statute.  There was testimony before Congress.  Congress


didn't say stop doing that.  Congress said, we bless what


you've done, we think you're doing a good job, keep doing


it.


QUESTION:  In what way did Congress say this?


MR. KAPLAN:  Congress said that in --


QUESTION:  I mean, was it a committee report, or


an act of Congress?


MR. KAPLAN:  There were statements made by -- by


Members of Congress in response to testimony that was

given, including the 2002 hearing --


QUESTION:  Well, you're -- you're saying that is


the voice of Congress?


MR. KAPLAN:  No, I'm not.  I'm saying the


McCarran-Ferguson Act is the voice of Congress, the --


QUESTION:  Well, but you just said a moment ago


that Congress had -- had approved this.


MR. KAPLAN:  Yes.  Congress has approved


it either implicitly or directly through the


McCarran-Ferguson Act, which gives the States authority to


act in matters of insurance.  In the Holocaust Commission


Act Congress, in effect, endorsed State action to deal


with Holocaust insurance matters.


QUESTION:  Is it not true that the -- what the


Congress endorsed there was presidential leadership, not 

State action?


MR. KAPLAN:  But in -- but in that statute


Congress recognized that States were acting in this area. 


The statute said that the commission there should


coordinate its activities with the States, and it asked


the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to


pass -- to prepare a report, rather, on the activities of


foreign and domestic insurance companies doing business in


this country, and the Ninth Circuit found, and we believe


it was reasonable for it to find that Congress

anticipated, understood, and -- and knew that -- that the


States would be acting pursuant to State law and might


have to seek information from entities located outside the


borders of this country.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kaplan, there -- there was a


reason, I think, why the Federal Constitution gave the


power to conduct foreign affairs not to the Congress but


to the executive, and the reason was that Congress is not


a very good instrument for that purpose, that there are


all sorts of matters that come up where -- this being one


of them, where it is very difficult for a Member of


Congress to cast a vote against Holocaust victims.  That's


what we're talking about.


Why -- why should the situation exist that,


although the President has the responsibility without 

Congress for conducting foreign affairs, his conduct of


foreign affairs can be frustrated by the States unless


Congress comes to his assistance?  Why -- why should that


follow?


It would seem to me it should follow that he can


protect this foreign affairs field on his own, and does


not have to call for the assistance of Congress.


MR. KAPLAN:  We believe that that would lead


to -- to a situation where, any time the executive decides


that there's a matter of -- of foreign policy concern to

him, legitimate State regulation would have to take a back


seat to that, so you have, in essence, presidential


lawmaking without any --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. KAPLAN:  -- any sort of accountability that


you normally have --


QUESTION:  It just shifts -- it just shifts the


inertia, really.  Congress is the 900-pound gorilla.  If


it doesn't like what the President is doing in the field


of foreign affairs, it can stop him as quickly as it


likes.  All it has to do is pass a resolution cutting off


any funds for that purpose, cutting off any funds for


this -- for further negotiations about this institution. 


Congress always has the trump card.


But why should we -- should we require Congress 

to protect the President from the States?  Why shouldn't


he have an automatic protection from it?


MR. KAPLAN:  Because except in limited areas


such as Zschernig, in Belmont, in Pink, and in Dames &


Moore, where you have a foreign policy crisis or a


recognition, ordinarily I don't believe that this Court


wants the executive to go off and announce foreign


policy issues that will have effect on State regulation. 


It affects issues of federalism and separation of powers.


Here, in fact, it was the State regulators that

formed ICHEIC.  This was a creature of the State


regulators, and after 4 years of not having done anything,


the State regulators decided that enough's enough, these


people are not getting the information.  There were 77,000


claims submitted.  Only 700 offers were made, less than


1 percent.  These people are in a line to nowhere, because


without this information they can't make a claim to


ICHEIC.  They can't even call the insurance company,


because they don't even know which insurance company --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kaplan, we've been told that


that -- that's past history --


MR. KAPLAN:  It's not.


QUESTION:  -- as a result of these recent


efforts, that there's much more disclosure coming out of


ICHEIC.


MR. KAPLAN:  There's not, Your Honor.  There --


there's been -- there's expected to be some disclosure


from German companies.  We don't know what that's going to


be.


The -- insurance was written all over Europe. 


The German market was only a small part of this European


market.  Generali wrote insurance all over Eastern Europe,


and all the countries in Eastern Europe.  They have a list


now sitting in Trieste, Italy, with 340,000 names on it. 


They could turn that list over tomorrow.  They've refused.

written by Generali or some other country -- company


because they simply don't have the information that


enables them to even think about making their claim.


This is not a claims-paying statute.  We're not


asking these companies to pay twice.  Survivors would be


grateful if they paid once.  There's nothing whatsoever in


this statute that -- that deals with the legitimacy of


these claims, whether they're rightful or not.  It simply


gives these people information that allows them to make a


decision as to whether they want to pursue a claim.  They


don't have that ability now.


If there are no further questions I would --


QUESTION:  Yes, I have one question, if I might.


MR. KAPLAN:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  I would draw a distinction in my


question between Eizenstat's letter, which in effect says,


please don't enforce these subpoenas because that will


louse up our negotiations and so forth.  Put that to one


side, and -- and I ask you if you would agree or disagree


with the suggestion that if you do enforce the subpoenas

you will violate a -- a provision of one of the two


executive agreements?


MR. KAPLAN:  I don't think there's any violation


of the executive agreements.  Those agreements simply


provide, with respect to State regulatory action, that the


United States will use its best efforts.  To me, that's a


recognition and an understanding that the Federal


Government knew that insurance is a State matter, a State


regulation.  That's all that the Federal Government was


doing.  It said, we'll try our best to get the States to


back off, we're making no promises to you because we don't


think we have the authority.  We believe in matters of


insurance it's the States that have that authority.


QUESTION:  Or it could be an acknowledgement by


the President that this is a matter that ultimately 

depends upon whether his foreign affairs power is -- is --


trumps the State action in this field, and -- and it could


be a commitment by him to come to this Court to ask us to


make that declaration, which is not a declaration that he


can authoritatively make.


MR. KAPLAN:  On -- on page 17 of the Solicitor


General's brief in this matter the Solicitor General takes


the position that even as to the executive agreements it


only would have some preemptive effect, if it has any at


all, as to the companies and the countries where the

agreements were made, so I believe the Solicitor General


acknowledges it wouldn't have any preemptive effect


whatsoever for the Italian companies, the Swiss companies,


or companies anywhere else in Europe.


QUESTION:  What about the letter?  I -- I --


that's why I asked the question at the beginning. 


Eizenstat's letter -- it's on 99a of the appendix.  I -- I


didn't know whether that's limited to the subpoena part or


whether it had to do with the disclosure, or whether it's


referring to the statute as a whole.  When I read it,


honestly, I thought it was the, probably the statute as a


whole, but I don't know.  Do you have any light to shed on


that?


MR. KAPLAN:  I -- I do not, Your Honor.  I don't


recall the --


QUESTION:  You think it could be the statute as


a whole he's talking about?


MR. KAPLAN:  It could well have been.


QUESTION:  Yes, all right.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Kaplan.


MR. KAPLAN:  Thank you very much.
