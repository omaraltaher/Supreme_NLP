CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 01-419, City of Columbus v. Ours Garage and


Wrecker Service, Inc.


Mr. Sutton.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. SUTTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  May


it please the Court:


The question presented in this case is whether


Congress in 1994 divested the States of their traditional


authority to delegate police powers over local safety


matters to their political subdivisions.  It would be no


small matter for Congress to impose such a restriction on


the States, and we submit they did no such thing in this


instance. 


In making that point, it may be helpful to look


at the text of the statute, which is reprinted in full in


the appendix to our brief, the blue brief.  And page A-2


of that appendix specifically repeats the language of


(c)(2)(A), the operative provision at issue here. 


And our first point, as a matter of the language


of the statute, is that Congress specifically said that


the preemption provision, quote, "shall not restrict the


3

safety regulatory authority of a State."


Now, prior to 1994, Ohio, the State of Ohio, had


exercised regulatory authority in this area by delegating


its power specifically over tow truck regulations to local


political subdivisions.  It's very difficult for us to


understand how the court of appeals interpretation does


not in fact, quote, "restrict the safety regulatory


authority of a State."  That's --


QUESTION:  Well, I think the argument on the


other side, Mr. Sutton, is that the first section (a)(1)


does say, no State or political subdivision thereof and no


interstate agency.  It talks about a political subdivision


so that when you come down to the section you've just


quoted, and it only says State, there's perhaps a fair


inference that only a State and not a political


subdivision is included. 


MR. SUTTON:  Yes, Your Honor.  And the normal


Russello argument is that a litigant like myself is trying


to read into another provision a term that is specifically


mentioned elsewhere in the statute.  Here the suggestion


is that we're trying to read the term, political


subdivision, into (c)(2)(A).  That's not what we're trying


to do. 


What we're saying is the traditional safety


regulatory authority of a State was preserved by (c)(2)(A)

and traditionally States, including Ohio, had specifically


exercised that authority by delegating it in some


instances to State executive branch agencies and in other


instances, specifically here, to political subdivisions.


QUESTION:  Would your argument be the same if


the State had not made a specific delegation?  Did it make


a specific delegation with respect to tow trucks?


MR. SUTTON:  Actually it did, although it's --


it's backwards, in the sense that they generally regulate


all motor carriers at the State level, but they exempted


tow trucks, therefore allowing political subdivisions like


Columbus to enact their own tow truck ordinances.  So, in


fact, in this case it would be specific, although I


wouldn't say our argument rests on that point.  Many


States like Ohio are home rule States, which in their


constitutions give general grants to political


subdivisions to have powers of local self-government.  So,


in this case, I -- I would say it's a little easier


because there was something specific as to tow trucks, but


I wouldn't say that our argument rests on that point.


QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, would -- would you look a


little further down in, in the provision set forth in the


appendix to your brief?  Look on page A-3.  You were


reading from (c)(2)(A) --


MR. SUTTON:  Yes, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  -- in which it says, shall not


restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State.  And


you say that includes, you know, political subdivisions of


a State.


MR. SUTTON:  No.  That it includes the right to


delegate political subdivisions.


QUESTION:  All right.  Okay.  Just read two --


two lines later, (2)(C) where it says, does not apply.


MR. SUTTON:  Right. 


QUESTION:  Again, it uses the same -- shall not


restrict, does not apply to the authority of a State, or a


political subdivision of a State, to enact or enforce a


law, regulation, or other provision.  Why in that


provision does it say does not apply to a State or a


political subdivision?  Because you're telling us, when


you say State, it includes whatever authority the State


has to delegate to a political subdivision.


MR. SUTTON:  We're not saying --


QUESTION:  You wouldn't have --


MR. SUTTON:  We're not --


QUESTION:  -- you wouldn't have needed that


language there.


MR. SUTTON:  We're not saying States are


political subdivisions.  We're simply saying the


preservation of a State, deregulatory authority of a State

includes the power to delegate. 


But as to (c)(2)(C), keep in mind that was a


1995 amendment.  That was not part of the original


legislation.  So, the suggestion would be that


Congress's --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. SUTTON:  -- style in 1995 modified the 1994


act.  And no one is arguing --


QUESTION:  I think we always look at an act in


toto and -- and don't try to piece it apart as to what was


enacted when.  It seems to me we have to make sense of


this statute as a whole.


MR. SUTTON:  That's -- that's true, Your Honor. 


But I -- in O'Gilve, the Court said specifically that a


later act cannot modify the terms of an earlier act.


But let me -- I think there's another answer


that --


QUESTION:  It doesn't modify it, but it -- it


can give clear indication of what -- of what it meant. 


I 

mean, you're assuming that it modifies it.


MR. SUTTON:  Right.  Well, Your Honor, the --


the thing that I think may be helpful in thinking about


(c)(2)(C) and the other mentions of political subdivision


throughout 14501 is they're all in the context of --


context of the enact or enforce language, which is exactly

how (c)(1) reads.  (c)(1) says these political bodies may


not enact or enforce these particular laws.  That, of


course, is not the way (c)(2)(A) or, for that matter,


(a)(2) -- (a)(2) does exactly the same thing.  It


preserves the safety regulatory authority of the State


over these various other provisions elsewhere identified


in title 49.


When it comes to (c)(2)(C), it's dealing with a


topic specifically mentioned in (c)(1), prices.  And it


follows the exact same structure of(c)(1), not


surprisingly, because it's dealing with a topic that is


covered in (c)(1).


(c)(2)(A) --


QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, are you making the


distinction there between the safety regulations which


would be covered under (c)(2) and the economic regulation


which would be the main prohibition?


MR. SUTTON:  Exactly, Your Honor.  And there was


a division of authority, going back to 1966, where the old


ICC had regulated all of the economic issues over motor


carriers, and the Department of Transportation had


regulated all the safety issues.  And what happens in 1994


is they're simply deregulating.  The ICC is deregulating


this area.  They wanted to make sure, as this Court said


in Morales, that States wouldn't undo that particular

deregulatory effort.  But at the same time, as (c)(2)(A)


and (a)(2) makes clear, they wanted to preserve the


provisions of a separate part of title 49 dealing with


safety issues, something that DOT, a separate agency, had


always regulated.  And I hope, Justice Scalia, this will


help in getting to your -- your point.


QUESTION:  There's a --


MR. SUTTON:  Oh, I'm sorry. 


QUESTION:  There's a question I think that still


would be left open even if you prevail; that is, whether


these regulations are appropriately characterized as


economic or safety.  You say they're all safety. 


MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely. 


QUESTION:  But that hasn't been adjudicated yet.


MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely.  And -- and if -- if


the court of appeals decision would reverse, it would


certainly be within the rights of respondents to go back


to the Sixth Circuit and say, as to some of these


provisions of the Columbus code, they are not in fact


safety ordinances or safety provisions, and therefore they


could be regulated as a price, route, or service. 


But there's another, I think, important point


that responds to this issue of the mention of political


subdivisions elsewhere in 14501.  I think there is general


agreement in the case that as to (c)(2)(A), all of the

other words, every single other word in (c)(2)(A)


including, for example, the definition of the term safety,


is defined not from 1994 on by looking at the difference


of -- between safety and price, routes, or services


mentioned in (c)(1) -- in other words, you would not


define safety after 1994 based on its contextual


comparison to prices --


QUESTION:  Where -- where exactly is (c)(2)(A)?


MR. SUTTON:  Excuse me, Your Honor.  It's on


A-2 of our appendix, and it's -- it's labeled motor


carriers of property.  Excuse me.  I should have made that


more clear.


The point I was trying to make is that these


other terms in (c)(2)(A) I think all would agree would be


defined by other provisions in title 49.  For example, the


word safety would be defined by the provisions in chapter


311 of title 49, which is a large -- a large section of


the code dealing with safety provisions.  It would not be


within the States' rights after 1994 to suddenly start


reinventing new definitions of safety, new definitions of


hazardous materials routing restrictions or size and


weight routing restrictions.  We would be stuck with all


of those definitions, including notably those preemption


provisions.  We think it would be a rather odd


interpretation of (c)(2)(A) to say that, yes, you

determine the meaning of all of these preserved matters by


reference to other parts of title 49, but you do not do so


when it comes to what the meaning of safety regulatory


authority of a State is.


And when you look at those other provisions of


title 49, it's quite clear that Congress contemplated in


all of them -- routing restrictions, safety -- that States


could delegate their power to local subdivisions.  That's


not only in some of the statutory provisions, but it's in


the regulations. 


QUESTION:  Well, but it's not defined.  It


doesn't -- there's not a definition that says, State


includes political subdivision of a State.


MR. SUTTON:  That's not our argument, Your


Honor.  We're not saying a State --


QUESTION:  I understand it's not your argument. 


MR. SUTTON:  We're not saying --


QUESTION:  It would be a stronger argument if


that were your argument.  That -- that's my point. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. SUTTON:  I -- I disagree, Your Honor.  We're


not saying that -- Congress -- let me put it this way. 


Congress has no right to empower a city.  Congress can't


create a city.  They can't give it a power.  That's a


power the States have.  It made perfect sense in (c)(2)(A)

to preserve the safety regulatory authority of a State


because it's the State legislature's job to determine what


other political bodies, if any, regulate in that area.


QUESTION:  Well, in that connection, I was going


to ask could this -- suppose that you do not prevail in


this case and we accept the respondents' interpretation. 


Could the State then every year have a cleanup statute in


which it says the State hereby adopts -- or authorizes


cities that are no less than X number of persons, no


greater than Y number of persons, obviously referring to


the City of Columbus, that -- that the State then allows


specifically Columbus to regulate, that it have an


ordinance and it just tracks the whole ordinance?


MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  And that


we think --


QUESTION:  So, then we're not arguing about very


much in your view. 


MR. SUTTON:  Well, Your Honor, that would strike


me as an extraordinary hoop for Congress to ask the States


to step through.  We're not aware of a single statute that


this Court has ever construed to mean that State


legislatures alone, but not their political subdivisions,


can regulate a particular area.  I'm not aware of a single


statute where that's ever happened. 


QUESTION:  There's a -- there's a problem with

cities when you get to safety regulation for trucks.  Can


you give me an example of a safety regulation that a city


might want to have that wouldn't have a negative impact or


some impact on routes? 


MR. SUTTON:  Right.  Excuse me?  The last word?


QUESTION:  On routes. 


MR. SUTTON:  Right.  The -- and I think the


respondents' point is or suggestion is that it would be


quite natural for Congress to say, as to routing


restrictions, we want uniform laws.  We want them to be


the same throughout the State, and we don't want to bother


with municipalities establishing different regulations for


a routing restriction.  Well, the -- the whole point of a


routing restriction is to account for differences within


the topography or geography of the States.


QUESTION:  Yes, but I mean, there's a long


history in the ICC of trying to create, say, dynamite


truck routes.  Well, you can imagine what something like


that does once you start talking about it within the city. 


And -- and every neighborhood in sight says, send it


somewhere else.  So, it's not illogical that people who


are worried about creating uniformity of routes would say,


keep the cities out of this.  It's -- it's a nightmare.


And -- and -- but I have no reason to know


whether this is so or not.  And so I ask you, is there any

kind of safety regulation that doesn't get into that kind


of routing nightmare when you talk about cities?


MR. SUTTON:  Well, hazardous -- I -- I don't


think the general rule has been that either the Federal


Government or the States have been concerned about heavily


populated regions deciding, for example, to route


hazardous materials around their beltway as opposed to


through the middle.  Everyone thinks that's a good idea,


and the cities generally, including Columbus, have been


left in control of that kind of decision, which is


something obviously one doesn't need to worry about --


QUESTION:  But I'm looking for specifically --


MR. SUTTON:  In a size and weight situation, of


course, you're going to situations where bridges or


particular roads in, you know, densely populated areas


require different rules than in rural regions of a State


where, for example, the roads are bigger and even if


they're not bigger, they're not as near to either


businesses or heavily populated areas.


QUESTION:  How about a restriction that on a


particular residential street that's, nonetheless, an


arterial highway, no trucks over 10 tons?


MR. SUTTON:  Could -- could a -- a -- the


question, first of all, would be whether that relates to


interstate commerce, and if it relates to interstate

commerce -- that is, commerce between States -- then the


Department of Transportation is -- is going to very


heavily regulate that particular route restriction and --


and has authority to preempt it, even as a matter of


regulation.  If it's purely intrastate, traditionally


that's been something that Congress or the agencies hardly


regulated at all, and to the extent they regulated them,


it was only when there was Federal funding.  But for the


most part, the regime has been that a locality makes that


decision through a delegation of power from their State


legislature. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, can I ask you, do you


regard -- just assume the -- assume the other side is


right on their interpretation.  Would that mean that a


city could not fix speed limits in neighborhoods?  Speed


limit is a safety regulation, isn't it? 


MR. SUTTON:  It is, Your Honor, but title 49 --


I think it's 31147 -- specifically says that traffic laws


-- I think a speeding limit would fall under that --


QUESTION:  It would be a traffic law?


MR. SUTTON:  -- is something that the Department


of Transportation does not regulate and neither does


Congress, which to me is one more indicator that you


don't, after 1994, start having free-form debates about


what safety means.

 QUESTION:  But even if the -- if it's not


federally regulated, would there, nevertheless, not be


preemption under their interpretation of this provision of


speed limit rules?


MR. SUTTON:  On what ground?  I mean, it would


have to be a price, route, or service for there to be


preemption.


QUESTION:  No.  I mean, if -- if you read the


(c)(2)(A) --


MR. SUTTON:  As -- I see what you're saying.


QUESTION:  -- as -- as saying only States are --


can -- are -- preserve the right to -- to regulate


safety --


MR. SUTTON:  Right. 


QUESTION:  -- it seems to me that would preempt


a local government's right to fix a 15-mile limit in a


school zone. 


MR. SUTTON:  I understand what you're saying. 


I 

think the position they would take -- and maybe they could


clarify this -- is that if it's not a price, route, or


service, you ignore (c)(2)(A), and you simply go to the


rest of title 49.  But I'm not -- I don't know the answer


to that. 


If I could make one more point, Justice Scalia,


and I hope this responds somewhat to the point you raised

earlier.  State laws, even if you think of them as State


legislative acts, are being preempted in this case.  Let's


ignore the State of Ohio.  New York.  The State of New


York says as to populations with more than 1 million


people, the cities in -- those populations can enact tow


truck ordinances.  This interpretation that the court of


appeals embraced preempts that State law.  There's no --


strictly speaking, there's no such thing as a city law


divorced from a State law.  The city power comes from the


States and there's just no such thing.  And we think, as


the lack of parallelism between (c)(1) and (c)(2)


indicates, all they were doing was preserving that


traditional safety regulatory authority of a State. 


If I could save the rest of my time for


rebuttal, I'd appreciate it.  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Sutton. 


Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The phrase, safety regulatory authority of a


State, in section 14501(c)(2)(A) is most naturally read to


encompass the State's traditional authority to delegate

its powers to political subdivisions.  That view is


supported by the larger statutory context in which the


phrase appears and by the purposes of the 1994 act. 


As Mr. Sutton has explained and as this Court


has frequently recognized, one integral component of the


State's ability to regulate within its borders is to


delegate as much or as little power as it wishes to


subordinate political units. 


QUESTION:  We understand all that, of course. 


And -- and in isolation, that phrase most naturally would


-- would mean safety regulatory authority of a State,


including, of course, its ability to delegate it to


municipalities. 


But what is sticking in our craw is the fact


that elsewhere in the statute, the language is very


careful to distinguish between the authority of a State,


on the one hand, and the -- and the separate authority of


political subdivisions of the State.  Now, what -- what is


your explanation for those other separations?


MR. STEWART:  I guess there are about three


responses we would make. 


The first is, as Mr. Sutton points out, this is


not a case in which the other provisions are identical but


for the inclusion of the word political subdivision.  For


instance, in subsection (c)(2)(C), which is at the -- the

top of A-3 of the --


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. STEWART:  -- petitioners' brief, it refers


to the authority of a State or a political subdivision of


a State to enact or enforce a law.  Now, even though


delegating power to municipalities is an integral feature


of the State's regulatory authority, it would certainly be


less than clear that when a municipality enacted or


enforced a law, pursuant to such delegation, it could not


necessarily be said that the State had enacted or enforced


that law. 


And so, if the provision left out political


subdivisions and simply said that the preemption rule does


not apply to the authority of a State to enact or enforce


a law, there would be ambiguity, and Congress -- whether


it was necessary or not, Congress might rationally choose


to eliminate that potential ambiguity through an express


reference to political subdivision. 


But the phrase that appears in subsection (2)(A)


is simply safety regulatory authority of a State, and


that, as you say, would most naturally be construed to


encompass the authority to delegate power to


municipalities. 


The second point is that based on the country's


traditions, it would certainly be an unusual thing for

Congress to interfere with the States' decisions as to the


amount of power that should be delegated to subordinate


political units.


QUESTION:  Has there been any -- what's the


closest case respondents could cite to show a contrary


practice? 


MR. STEWART:  I believe the respondents have


cited a couple of court of appeals cases which have


held --


QUESTION:  From this Court?


MR. STEWART:  None from this Court.  The -- the


respondents have not cited any case in which this Court


has held that any Federal statute had the effect of


divesting a State of its authority to delegate power to


political subdivisions. 


QUESTION:  Well, there are many Federal statutes


that -- that make grants to municipalities for various


functions and don't make it to the State.  This is a --


certainly the Federal Government interfering in the


relationship between the State and its municipalities. 


And the State has no -- no ability to veto whether the


municipality is going to accept those funds or not.  And


there's -- there's been a lot of controversy within the


States between the municipalities and the State government


as to -- as to what money should be accepted and so forth.

It seems to me that has exactly the same effect as what


you're talking about here.  The Federal Government has,


indeed, indeed, intervened in the relationship between the


State and its -- and its political subdivisions.


MR. STEWART:  We cited the Lee Deadwood case in


our brief as support for the proposition that Congress


would constitutionally be authorized to preempt municipal


law without preempting State law if it chose.  Our only


point is it would be sufficiently unusual that we would


expect Congress to address the matter fairly directly.


QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart, would you be able to


give us any examples of municipal safety regulations that


are preempted by this section as it's been interpreted


below?


MR. STEWART:  We -- I think that as it's been


interpreted --


QUESTION:  As a practical matter?


MR. STEWART:  As it's been interpreted below, I


believe the types of regulations that have been held


preempted are -- are fairly similar to the City of


Columbus's regulation, namely, a licensing scheme in which


the vehicle is inspected, the driver is tested to ensure


proficiency in the operation of the vehicle.  And those


have been held to be preempted on the ground that they


relate to routes --

 QUESTION:  So, we're really talking about


licensing schemes. 


Is this anything that the State couldn't


undertake to do itself with its State driver's license and


so forth?


MR. STEWART:  I -- I think that the licensing


scheme, while we would respect Ohio's decision to delegate


that to municipalities, it -- in truth I think this is


something that could fairly realistically be accomplished


at the State level. 


Now, with respect to some of the other matters


that are specified in (c)(2)(A), for instance, route


controls based on size and weight or hazardous nature of


the cargo, because the determination at issue is whether a


particular vehicle or a particular cargo is suitable for a


particular stretch of road, those are the sorts of things


that can't realistically be expected to be done in their


entirety at the State level.  And therefore, it would be a


particular disruption of the State's processes --


QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart, before your time goes


out, will you give us your third point too?  You gave us


the first two. 


MR. STEWART:  The third point is that to the


extent that the provision at issue here is ambiguous and


the Court wants to interpret it by reference to other


22

relevant statutory provisions, it is important to examine


the larger statutory context.  That is, (c)(2)(A) is not


limited to safety.  It specifies these other matters, and


as Mr. Sutton was pointing out, the other matters are


covered in detail in different provisions of title 49.  In


general, those other provisions of title 49 contain their


own preemption provisions.  They explain at -- at great


length what States can and can't do.  At least in the area


of safety, State law is specifically defined to include


the law of the local governmental unit, and so the -- the


safety regime in the other parts of title 49 specifically


contemplates municipal safety regulation.  And it would be


odd to think that Congress, in this oblique way, has


superseded that carefully developed statutory framework.


And to put this in larger historical context, to


follow up on Mr. Sutton's point, from 1966 to 1995, at the


Federal level there was division of regulatory authority


between the ICC which did economic regulation and the


Department of Transportation which did safety regulation.


And it's no coincidence that State law as to economic


matters was preempted at about the same time that the ICC


saw its powers diminished and the ICC was eventually


eliminated altogether.  This was part of a larger program


of deregulating the economics of commercial trucking. 


But --

 QUESTION:  Who -- who administers this statute? 


Is there a Federal agency that -- that can be said to be


administering this -- this statute?


MR. STEWART:  There -- there is no Federal


agency entrusted with the administration of this


particular statute.  The Department of Transportation


administers the related provisions of title 49 that are


specifically addressed to these matters, and their


implementation of their responsibilities under those


provisions would be affected by this Court's decision in


this case because if there is no municipal safety


regulation at all, that would obviously have an impact on


their administration of the scheme for determining when


municipal regulation is and is not permitted.  But they


are not specifically entrusted with authority over this


scheme.


So -- so to return to the point about the


division of responsibilities, Congress eliminated the ICC,


eliminated Federal economic regulation of commercial


trucking, and at the same time it preempted State law in


order to ensure that the States didn't undo the Federal


deregulatory efforts.  But there's been no Federal


deregulation in matters of trucking safety.  The prior


provisions of title 49 remain on the books.


There's no expression of congressional

discontent with the manner in which power in those areas


has been divided between the Federal, State, and local


governments.  To the contrary, the conference report


accompanying the 1994 act refers specifically to those


preexisting provisions and expresses the intent that their


administration continue unchanged.


QUESTION:  May I ask this question on the


division of responsibility?  Is it your view -- your


understanding that the cities would not be able in their


licensing scheme to regulate the rates that the truckers


charge? 


MR. STEWART:  That's correct. 


If there are no further questions, I have


nothing further. 


QUESTION:  To what extent, Mr. Stewart, does the


Department of Transportation -- you said there's no


administrator of the statute, but they do have authority


under the motor safety -- motor carrier safety assistance


program that seems to be relevant. 


MR. STEWART:  The motor carrier safety


assistance program, and they also have authority under


other provisions of title 49 to review and declare to be


preempted State and local laws -- State and local safety


laws that apply to transportation in interstate commerce. 


Again, those are not provisions of this particular

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


QUESTION:  Mr. Cordray, I hope you'll tell us


the practical effects of the decision below.


MR. CORDRAY:  The practical effect of the


decision below, as you uncovered it in your questioning


earlier, is that Federal law preempts municipalities and


other local governments from imposing their own individual


licensing schemes upon motor carriers of property and that


is --


QUESTION:  Well, it also speaks to routes or


weight limitations.  Are there situations where the city


or town is particularly aware of traffic problems within


the city or a weak bridge or something and that its


limitations are needed? 


MR. CORDRAY:  Size and weight limitations, as


the other matters addressed in (c)(2)(A), would be


regulated at the State level, not at the local level under


the proper reading of this statute.  And the reason is


that Congress did not want to open up the trucking

industry, where it was attempting to do something new,


which is deregulate it nationwide and create an unfettered


free market for trucking and transportation services. 


QUESTION:  So that if a city says no trucks


through the park with the public playground between


certain hours, that has to be the -- the State?  That's


the only one that could do that? 


MR. CORDRAY:  That could be done at the State


level and it could be done either by going to the State


legislature, as you suggested, or it could be done by


setting up a very simple administrative scheme at the


State level where you would go to the State department --


QUESTION:  Well, why would --


QUESTION:  Well, most cities I've been in had --


QUESTION:  -- why would Congress choose to -- to


regulate in that way, say we want the State to do it but


not the locality? 


MR. CORDRAY:  Specifically because they were


trying to deregulate this market nationwide.  To leave in


place every municipality with the option to license


different motor carriers of property is not only --


QUESTION:  No.  I'm not talking about licensing. 


I'm talking about the -- the example of, say, that no


trucks over 10 tons on this particular road. 


MR. CORDRAY:  Again, I think that petitioners

agree and all the courts have agreed that every subsection


of (c)(2)(A) has to be read together, and to the extent


municipal authority is being preempted in one respect,


it's being preempted in all.  And the reason is that


Congress was recognizing that schemes directed


specifically to motor carriers of property at the local


level simply incorporated too much regulation that would


interfere with and impede a free market for transportation


services and motor carriers --


QUESTION:  May I ask a similar question? 


Supposing that there's a heavy rain storm in a city or


something and it becomes unsafe to use a certain street if


the truck is over a certain size.  Could -- the police


would not be permitted to divert the traffic around that


particular flooded area, I suppose. 


MR. CORDRAY:  Certainly they could.  This goes


to your question you asked earlier which is whether


traffic laws, ordinary, general traffic laws, would be


preempted under our --


QUESTION:  No.  This is for safety reasons.


MR. CORDRAY:  -- statute --


QUESTION:  They figure it's -- it's dangerous


because the thing is too deep and the trucks have to over-


set -- overturn or something like that. 


MR. CORDRAY:  They -- they would be -- they

would be diverting --


QUESTION:  It would be preempted, I guess. 


MR. CORDRAY:  They would be -- no.  They would


be diverting presumably all traffic that's heavy enough to


create a safety problem. 


QUESTION:  Supposing -- truck size traffic, yes.


MR. CORDRAY:  Yes, but -- but it's not directed


simply to motor carriers of property.  It's directed to


all trucks, all oversize vehicles.  It could be private


vehicles, RVs that people use to take vacations, whatever


it might be.  That would be permissible. 


And traffic laws, I want to stress, are not


preempted by this statute.  This statute is not limitless. 


As this Court has --


QUESTION:  Well, then what about the -- the


answer that you gave earlier to the question that the


Chief Justice and I had?  No -- no trucks through the


playground or -- or through a residential neighborhood at


a certain time.  I thought you said that would be


preempted, but now you're saying it applies only if


they're motor carriers of property?


MR. CORDRAY:  Let me step back.  If the


ordinance related to all oversize vehicles -- that would


be a general traffic regulation -- that would be


permissible.  And I'll -- and I'll get to that in a

moment, why traffic laws are not preempted by the statute. 


They -- they are not related to price, route, or service


of motor carriers of property.


If it was directed specifically to a type of


motor carrier of property, as this licensing scheme is --


it applies directly, specifically, and only to tow trucks


-- that would be a different matter.  Municipalities are


not permitted to do that, and Congress specifically wanted


to do that because although there was a tradition of lots


of regulation at the State and local level, Congress was


making a policy decision, as it's free to do, to say that


all of that is impeding a free market for transportation


services and motor carriers that's affecting broad


segments of the American economy.  We want to bring down


costs, rid us of these inefficiencies --


QUESTION:  I understand that, but I'm at the


same question that I think everyone has asked.  In my mind


-- and I might be misremembering -- there are lots of


streets -- there used to be in San Francisco and you'd see


a sign, and it would say, no trucks over 3-and-a-half


tons.  And it seems to me in Boston I can think of seeing


signs.  I thought maybe they said, no trucks over such and


such.  Maybe they just say no vehicle over such and such. 


And my impression is that in many cities there are many


such streets, and which streets there are is a matter for

the municipality to decide.  And it's a shifting pattern,


and typically it's in residential areas.  And there's lots


of local regulation of that kind.  That's my impression.


And I want to know, on your reading of this


statute, does this change when I'm thinking of those signs


on one street after another?  Does that all change because


they're preempted, and now each neighborhood has to go to


Sacramento, if they're in California, and convince the --


the legislature?  I'd be very surprised if that is so,


that Congress changed so well established a municipal


pattern of behavior without saying anything about it.  And


therefore, I think everyone is driving at the same


question.  I understand about all the licensing stuff, but


I want to know the answer to that question. 


MR. CORDRAY:  All right.  Again, it's not what's


specifically at issue in this case, but I understand the


Court wants the answer to the hypothetical.  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  It has nothing to do with this case. 


I'm saying when your -- accept the fact that if I accept


your position in this case --


MR. CORDRAY:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- at the moment I'm thinking all


this traditional regulation of what street you can use if


you're a truck is being wiped out.  I mean, that's


relevant.

 MR. CORDRAY:  It could be dealt with either of


two ways, Your Honor.  Either it could be regarded as a


general traffic law, like a one-way street, like a speed


limit, and the like, in which case we believe that it


would not come within the preemption clause ex ante


because it has to have a connection with or reference to


motor carriers of property to come within the terms of


this preemption clause --


QUESTION:  Motor carriers of property or just


motor carriers? 


MR. CORDRAY:  Motor carriers of property which


is what --


QUESTION:  In other words, if they -- if they


don't say on the street motor carriers of property cannot


use this, then it's not preempted. 


MR. CORDRAY:  Then it is a general traffic


regulation no different from where the speed limit says 55


miles per hour and trucks have to obey it, just as cars


do.  And motor carriers --


QUESTION:  Well, does the term, motor carriers


of property -- does that mean motor carriers of property


for hire or any motor carrier that is carrying property?


MR. CORDRAY:  Well, it would be those who come


within the terms of this specific preemption clause.


QUESTION:  Yes, that's what I want to know.

Which does it mean? 


MR. CORDRAY:  Yes.  I -- I believe that this


statute is referring to for hire carriers of -- motor


carriers of property.


QUESTION:  So -- so, if a State were to say all


prices of all trucks in this State have to be $50 -- all


trucks -- and they don't say motor carriers of property,


that's not preempted. 


MR. CORDRAY:  No, that is not correct because


it's specifically referenced --


QUESTION:  Of course, it's not correct.  And


similarly, if they say on a street, no truck can use this


street --


MR. CORDRAY:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- and they don't say motor carriers


of property, it's the same. 


MR. CORDRAY:  The reason is -- no.  The reason


is that specifically references price.  There are lots of


laws that in -- tangentially will affect routes.  All


right?  A one-way street law, for example, has to be


obeyed by trucks, just as it is by cars.  That's not


within this preemption clause.  So, that's one way to


address it.  All right.  And -- and that would be true of


all general traffic laws, just as it's true of all general


tort laws, general tax laws.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Cordray, on this point, look at


on page A-2, (c)(1), the general rule.  It has at the very


end of it the phrase, with respect to the transportation


of property.


MR. CORDRAY:  Right. 


QUESTION:  Where are you reading from?


QUESTION:  I'm reading on page A-2, (c)(1), the


general rule from which (c)(2) is -- is an exception.  And


the general rule is, except as provided, blah, blah, blah,


blah, no State, political subdivision shall enact any


provision having the force and effect of law related to a


price, route, or service of any motor carrier.  And then


there's a lot of other language.  And then at the very


end, with respect to the transportation of property.  Does


that phrase at the end go all the way back to related to a


price, route, or service with respect to the


transportation of property?


MR. CORDRAY:  I believe it does, Your Honor, and


it's just -- it's just --


QUESTION:  Well, that would make it a very


narrow provision then, wouldn't it, that -- that we're


excluding the -- the municipalities from?


MR. CORDRAY:  I believe it is.


QUESTION:  They just couldn't say you're not


allowed to use this street to carry -- to carry moving

MR. CORDRAY:  This is a key point. 


QUESTION:  But you're -- you're asking -- you're


asking us to -- to have a very careful grammatically


correct reading of the act, and in your answer that --


that you've just given to Justice Scalia, transportation


of property is preceded by an or.  It seems to me the


first clause is quite independent, related to a price,


route, or service of any motor carrier.  That's it.


MR. CORDRAY:  With --


QUESTION:  So, I'm not sure the qualification


you urge on us, in order to mitigate the effects of this


holding works.


QUESTION:  Well, I don't know what it would go


to if it didn't go to that.  It can't go to the stuff


after the or.  Or any motor -- motor private carrier,


broker or freight forwarder with respect to the


transportation of -- what is a -- what is a motor private


carrier with respect to the transportation of -- of


property?  It has no meaning unless you read it all the


way back up to price, route, or service with respect to


the transportation --


MR. CORDRAY:  And the title of the provision is


motor carriers of property.  That's specifically what


they're dealing with, as distinguished from motor carriers

of passengers, which are addressed earlier in the same


section of the statute, 14501(a).


QUESTION:  It's not the best statute, is it?


MR. CORDRAY:  I beg your pardon? 


QUESTION:  It's not the best statute. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. CORDRAY:  It's -- it's clear enough with


respect to the things we care about here, which is that --


QUESTION:  Well, but I don't think it is.


MR. CORDRAY:  -- Congress very carefully


attempted to distinguish between a State and a political


subdivision of a State.  And it did so repeatedly in the


statute for the specific purpose of drawing a distinction


between them.  And the only way --


QUESTION:  There's not a word of legislative


history I take it --


QUESTION:  If you read (c)(1) as narrowly as


you're suggesting, you don't even need the exemption


because it only relates to law, regulation, or other


provision related to price, route, or service.  So -- and


it doesn't even reach safety. 


MR. CORDRAY:  No, that's not true, Your Honor. 


And this case is a good example of it.  They are


attempting to impose a licensing scheme with respect to


tow trucks and could do it with respect to any motor

carrier of property, parcel delivery service, or the like. 


And their -- their rationale for doing so apparently is


safety.  But in fact, that is exactly what is preempted by


this statute and by this clause. 


QUESTION:  But, Mr. Cordray, that's open.  Mr.


Sutton said that that question whether these regulations


are genuine safety regulations or, on the other hand,


economic is not determined by this case.  Here the


question is whatever is safety, may the State delegate


that authority to the municipalities.


I did want to get your response to a question


Justice Kennedy asked Mr. -- and it was answered for you


by Mr. Sutton.  Suppose the State says, okay, we do


business by dealing with municipalities.  So, we will


simply take the municipal regulation of Toledo and the


municipal regulation of Columbus, and we'll put it all


together in one package.  It will say, State regulation of


safety, and -- and we'll preserve everything.  Would that


be permissible under your reading of this Federal statute?


MR. CORDRAY:  Yes, it would, Your Honor.  It


would.  If the State is doing the regulating or enacting


the law, under this statute, the way it reads and the --


the way it was designed, that would be permissible, even


if it's nonuniform.  If we wanted to make it uniform, we'd


have to go to the legislature and try to get that package

amended or go perhaps to the State department of


transportation which also could do this through an


administrative scheme. 


QUESTION:  So, it's strictly a question of form


that we're dealing with, that States, you can delegate to


your cities, as you always have, just say, cities, what do


you want and we'll give it to you by enacting a State law.


MR. CORDRAY:  No.  It's not simply a matter of


form because Congress made a judgment that if there were


50 different States imposing their own schemes, that would


be less impediments and -- and tangle of restrictions


impeding a free market than if 39,000 municipalities and


local governments around the country were free on their


own to do what they wished, and that that -- that was in


fact very much undercutting the desire to get to a free


market in transportation services. 


But I also want to go back to your comment and


your question earlier.  This statute does not itself


distinguish between economic regulation that's preempted


on the one hand and safety regulation that's not on the


other.  The phrasing of the statute is much broader.  It


is related to price, route, and services of a motor


carrier of property.  That may not only be economic


regulation.  And so the notion that that's the divide and


we can simply remand, the lower court can sort it out, I

believe is not correct. 


Now, as we've seen here, the fact that the --


the statute is broad does not mean it's all encompassing. 


I mean, I could see an argument that truck -- trucking


companies no longer now have to pay corporate tax because


that affects their price.  But that's a general provision. 


As this Court has said in construing ERISA and needs to be


imported here in the Dillingham case and the like, there


has to be a connection with or reference to the specific


item at issue.  Here motor carriers of property.  And


that's what we have with this licensing scheme here which


is directed specifically at tow trucks and will have a


very direct relation and -- and effect on their prices and


services. 


I also want to mention the problem of surplusage


because it's not been mentioned on the other side, and


it's very important here.  What possible reason would


Congress have had for including in the statute what


obviously is a key phrase?  It shows up seven times in the


course of the single statute.  Political subdivision of a


State.  Why would that be included at all if the authority


of a State is to be read, as petitioners would have it, to


always include within it the authority of a political


subdivision.


QUESTION:  Their -- their answer is that -- that

when you speak of the regulatory authority of a State,


that naturally connotes the authority to -- to delegate


that to -- to municipalities.  But when you speak of the


authority of a State to enact or enforce a law, that --


that much less naturally includes the authority of a


municipality to enact or enforce a law so that -- and all


of those other references are in connection with that


phrase, to enact or enforce a law.  Are they not?


MR. CORDRAY:  Two reasons why that does not


work, Your Honor.  They agreed that the subsections of


(c)(2)(A) have to be read in parallel and the second one


with respect to size and weight and the like.  It doesn't


say anything about regulatory authority.  It just says


authority of a State. 


Second, in the preemption clause itself --


QUESTION:  Wait, wait.  I --I missed that. 


MR. CORDRAY:  Well, regulatory authority is the


phrase used in the first subclause --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. CORDRAY:  -- of (c)(2)(A) related to safety.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. CORDRAY:  But they're not talking about


authority to regulate.  They're just talking about


authority of a State with respect to the size and weight,


hazardous cargo, and then with respect to insurance.  And

insurance is an excellent example I'll get to in a moment.


But also in the preemption clause itself,


(c)(1), it refers to the authority of a State to enact or


enforce a law or regulation.  That is regulatory


authority, and it distinguishes it full stop from the


authority of a political subdivision of a State to do the


same thing.  What?  Enact or enforce a regulation.  So,


the regulatory authority is being discussed specifically


in the preemption clause itself.


That's the fallacy of starting the analysis here


by jumping all the way to (c)(2)(A) and wrenching that


text out of context and divorcing it from the preemption


clause that it's meant to be a savings subordinate to. 


But the preemption clause itself --


QUESTION:  No, but (c)(1) uses may enact or


enforce just as -- as (c)(2)(C) does, whereas (c)(2)(A)


does not.  The to enact or enforce language applies in


every subsection except the one that we're arguing about.


MR. CORDRAY:  That's correct, which is a telling


point.  In every subsection, Congress went out of its way


to add political subdivision of a State.  I've still not


heard a single sensible explanation for why they would


bother to do that. 


QUESTION:  Well, if -- but if you didn't add the


political subdivision in those States and if you had a

home rule State, then a local government could -- would


not be affected by it. 


MR. CORDRAY:  No, not correct because their


notion is that State includes delegating to its local


government as a delegated power from the State.  They want


to read the two as being encompassed within one another.


QUESTION:  When you described the regulatory --


regulatory authority in gross as you do in (2)(A), then it


would apply to the authority to delegate.  But when you're


talking about authority to enact or enforce, then you have


to identify the entities that do the enacting and the


enforcing.  It seems to me that's a perfectly logical


distinction. 


MR. CORDRAY:  Well, I don't believe it is, Your


Honor.  And again, there's nothing about regulatory


authority that is unique in this statute because (c)(2)(A)


does refer to regulatory authority with respect to safety,


but it doesn't refer to regulatory authority with


respect --


QUESTION:  Well, don't you agree that if you


didn't have all the other subdivisions in here, that would


be the normal reading of regulatory authority, which would


include the authority to delegate?


MR. CORDRAY:  I would agree that if (c)(2)(A)


alone were the statute --

 QUESTION:  Correct. 


MR. CORDRAY:  -- that would be a sensible


reading.  But if you -- that -- that's taking it out of a


context where Congress specifically is dealing with a


State and a political subdivision regularly in the statute


and then in one instance a special kind --


QUESTION:  Yes, but in one -- but in one


provision, they say regulatory authority, which has a


plain meaning that you'd be -- brings a result you


disagree with.  In the other they consistently use


authority of a State or a political subdivision to enact


or enforce. 


MR. CORDRAY:  But it doesn't --


QUESTION:  If you don't refer to political


subdivision, it just wouldn't include it. 


MR. CORDRAY:  It doesn't have a plain meaning. 


It doesn't really have any meaning because in the


preemption clause itself, they're referring to the


authority of a State to regulate, and they're separately


referring to the authority of --


QUESTION:  No.  It says a State or a political


subdivision may not enact or enforce.  That's the language


of the preemption clause.


MR. CORDRAY:  Correct.  That's right.  Enact or


enforce what?  A regulation, which is the same thing as to

QUESTION:  (c)(2)(A) at the bottom of page A-2


in the same sentence uses this shall not restrict the


safety regulatory a State -- authority of a State with


respect -- or the authority of a State.  They don't use


the adjective regulatory even in the second clause.


MR. CORDRAY:  That was my point.  I was trying


to make it earlier.  I -- I didn't make it as clearly as


you just did.  But that's exactly --


QUESTION:  Well, obviously, I -- I missed it, so


say it again. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. CORDRAY:  Well, that's exactly right. 


Trying to give some special meaning --


QUESTION:  Where?  What -- what section are you


talking about?


MR. CORDRAY:  We're talking about (c)(2)(A).


QUESTION:  At the bottom of page A-2. 


MR. CORDRAY:  This is a point I tried to make


earlier and I did not make it as clearly as the Chief


Justice just did. 


QUESTION:  I didn't get it. 


MR. CORDRAY:  But they're attempting to give


some special meaning to the phrase safety regulatory


authority, but by their own argument, that can't follow

because they want to -- they have to read all these


provisions the same way.  And the second subclause there


refers --


QUESTION:  The authority of a State.


MR. CORDRAY:  -- to the authority of a State,


nothing about safety, nothing about regulatory, and has to


be read in the same fashion. 


I would also point out that the third subclause


there, which relates to insurance requirements, they would


be saying that municipalities are free to impose their own


insurance requirements upon motor carriers of property. 


So, FedEx, UPS in different municipalities would have to


meet different insurance requirements.  They'd have to do


different kinds of filings and have very different kinds


of --


QUESTION:  You're too fast for me.  Where is the


insurance requirement? 


QUESTION:  At the very end of that provision.


MR. CORDRAY:  It's the third subclause in


(2)(A).


QUESTION:  (2)(A).


QUESTION:  Oh, in -- in (2)(A), okay.


MR. CORDRAY:  And that is completely at odds


with the statute because in 14504, which this Court is


going to take up in a case called Yellow Freight next

term, it says specifically there -- Congress said even 50


registrations by motor carriers of property in different


States for insurance purposes is too many for our taste. 


We think there should only be one, and they said the


single State --


QUESTION:  Well, what about the middle one? 


What about the middle one?  It says, the authority of a


State to impose highway limitations.


MR. CORDRAY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Now, I can't figure out, for the life


of me, how -- why Congress would have wanted to say the


State can impose limitations on the use of highways, but


the city cannot impose limitations on the use of streets.


But your reading would lead to that.


MR. CORDRAY:  That would be one respect, Your


Honor, in which either -- if it was a general traffic


regulation, then it would not be preempted at all.  Or if


it were preempted, it would have to be done at the State


level and it could be done by the --


QUESTION:  I thought part of your argument was


also that streets are not highways, and I'm surprised you


didn't make that point when we were talking about the --


you know, no trucks on a school street or something like


that.  Isn't the term highways arguably different from --


from local residential neighborhood streets?

 MR. CORDRAY:  Arguably it could be, but I


believe for purposes of title 49, it's a defined term to


include streets.  But our point there was that it's


perfectly sensible for Congress to say that the States


shall deal with these issues, but not the municipality.

right?  There is not a word in the history of this --


although there was some human being who wrote these words,


there is not a word in any document, hearing, report,

traffic regulations --


QUESTION:  Is that right? 


MR. CORDRAY:  -- generally are not within the


preemption clause.

confused and somewhat unilluminating. 


QUESTION:  I guess we'll have to use the


statute. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Mr. Cordray, is there -- is there an


example -- any other example of a Federal statute -- I


mean, it is unusual to say, States, you can no longer


decide how your authority is going to be exercised.  An


ordinary mode of a State exercising its authority is to


delegate it to localities.  Apart from this statute, is


there any other Federal statute that says, State, you may


do it but you may not delegate it to a regional or local


or municipal unit?


MR. CORDRAY:  There are two responses to that


question.  The first is the example that was already given


which is when the Federal Government puts a grant to a


municipality full stop and doesn't allow the State to


control the use of that grant, that's an example like


this.


But the other point I would make is throughout


its history, Congress has --


QUESTION:  Well, that's a State -- that's --


that's --


MR. CORDRAY:  May I --

municipality.  I asked an instance in which Congress says,


State, you may do it but you, State, may not delegate.


MR. CORDRAY:  I know of none, but this is a new


departure for Congress.  They have always taken free


markets and sought to regulate them.  Here they're taking


a market they had regulated and the States and localities


had regulated and they're now trying to deregulate it.


That's a new development and it calls for new measures. 


And the measure here was to try to clear away all this


underbrush of -- of State and local restriction --


QUESTION:  Since it was -- since you say it's


singular and this is new, wouldn't you expect Congress to


make a clear statement that the State may not delegate


this authority because --


MR. CORDRAY:  Congress did make a clear


statement by including the term, political subdivision,


whenever it wanted political subdivisions to either have


authority or be restricted in that authority, and then


specifically speaking only to States here.  There could


not be a clearer statement of that.  Why else ever use the


term, political subdivision?  That is unexplained.


QUESTION:  And the State may not delegate this


authority to a political subdivision.  Just as simple as


that, to negate what has been the assumption all along.


MR. CORDRAY:  They could have used the term

term, political subdivision, here.  Those are the same


meaning and they're the same purpose. 


And again, canons of construction have been


denigrated in this case, but they have to do with the


natural and ordinary reading of statutes.  The baseline


that Congress uses to draft laws in some confidence that


the executive branch and the courts will interpret them as


Congress meant them, and that's exactly what's --


QUESTION:  The executive branch.  Now, you -- I


know you have said, and I quite agree, that the Department


of Transportation has no supervisory authority, it has no


Chevron deference.  But doesn't it deserve some respect


from the courts simply because it has familiarity with the


area of motor carrier regulation that the courts don't? 


MR. CORDRAY:  That's a -- that's a statement I


couldn't disagree with more strongly.  The Solicitor


General here has conceded they have no authority to


administer this statute.  The notion that you have a --


QUESTION:  They've not conceded the Department


of Transportation -- you -- deserves no respect. 


MR. CORDRAY:  The -- the notion that a


deregulatory statute that took governmental entities out

of an area to create a free market would now be subject to


umpiring by the Federal agency, in terms of the scope of


preemption, which is an issue this Court has always said


is for the courts to determine --


QUESTION:  I didn't say umpiring.  I said its


views on the proper construction of this statute.  What


weight, if any, should this Court give to the Department


of Transportation's view, this is what the statute means? 


Not as an umpire, not as a referee.


MR. CORDRAY:  Their construction is to leave


them as an umpire.  But I would say certainly not Chevron


deference.  At most some sort of Skidmore respect, but


that's only entitled where there's some sort of reason to


think that before they got to their litigation position


here, which has migrated in the course of this case -- it


started off as an argument about repeal by implication. 


It's now turned into argument about sort of reading


statutes together to import them into this statute -- is


entitled to really, I think, no respect here because it is


not persuasive.  They have not analyzed the statute in


detail --


QUESTION:  Well, if -- if you lose, you know --


MR. CORDRAY:  -- in any of their prior --


QUESTION:  If you're changing your argument --


you know, if you lost in the lower court, you'd probably

be well advised to change your argument. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. CORDRAY:  I wouldn't disagree with that,


Your Honor.  But again --


QUESTION:  Mr. Cordray, what -- what about the


point made that if -- if you accept your interpretation,


municipalities not only would not be able to enact


regulations themselves, they would not be able to enforce


regulations adopted by the -- by the State, which would be


a great inconvenience, that the only enforcement can be by


the State police and not by local -- local police.


MR. CORDRAY:  We agree, but that's not what this


preemption clause is about or any preemption clause is


ever about.  When they say enact or enforce here, they


don't use it in the terms of making law and executing the


law.  They use it in the -- in the sense of enacting new


law or applying -- or enforcing and applying preexisting


law.


And the point of this preemption clause is to


say that municipalities do not have the authority to act


in this realm by imposing their own public policies.  It's


a matter of either new law or preexisting law.  That's the


structure of many of these preemption statutes the Court


has dealt with.


QUESTION:  If we think this statute is -- that

there are arguments either way for interpreting it,


shouldn't we pay heed to the petitioners' point that it's


a very serious matter for the Congress of the United


States to tell States how they should govern themselves?


MR. CORDRAY:  We think the language of the


statute is clear here, Your Honor.  They explicitly


extinguished the power of the municipality --


QUESTION:  Let's -- let's say we -- we disagree


with that.  Is -- is that not -- let's say we find the


statute in -- in equipoise, or the arguments.  Should we


not give force to the argument petitioner makes that the


States should be presumed to have the authority to


determine how best to govern themselves?


MR. CORDRAY:  No.  There's no substantive Tenth


Amendment issue here.  There's no commandeering of States


or local governments to enact some sort of program.  This


is the same as the Court in Wolens where they said this


statute must be read to say the State cannot legislate in


this area, but they can enforce contracts through their


courts.  There's no Tenth Amendment problem with that. 


That's Congress exercising its power under the Supremacy


Clause, anything in the laws or constitution of the States


notwithstanding.


And as the Solicitor General said in the brief


in the Mortier case, the notion that when Congress decided

that there could be State regulation but they had to


preempt local regulation, that they would somehow have to


be forced to preempt State regulation as well, simply


turns the Tenth Amendment on its head.  So, we don't think


that there's any -- any serious constitutional issue here.


QUESTION:  It seems to me your argument boils


down to the point that there are 10 provisions in the


statute.  Nine of them are perfectly clear.  The tenth


says the same thing, but we're not going to read it the


way it seems to read because it's not as clear as the


other nine. 


MR. CORDRAY:  No, that's not what it boils down.


QUESTION:  That's about all it amounts to.


MR. CORDRAY:  It boils down to the fact that


Congress deliberately inserted a phrase here, political


subdivision of a State, so that it can preempt --


QUESTION:  In the -- in the nine, right.


MR. CORDRAY:  And -- and it --


QUESTION:  If you just read the one all by


itself, it's perfectly clear too. 


MR. CORDRAY:  Well, it's -- it is clear, I


believe, because it's clear because they said a State


cannot -- a political subdivision cannot --


QUESTION:  But the only reason --


MR. CORDRAY:  -- and they state the authority of

a State to do certain things.


QUESTION:  The only support you have is they're


not as detailed and specific in the one in question as


they are in the other nine.


MR. CORDRAY:  No.  I think it is equally


detailed and specific.  And -- and there's no rationale


for Congress legislating in this way or drafting this


language or enacting it unless they intended to make a


difference.  That's -- that's the whole purpose of


including that language. 


QUESTION:  Your support is the context of the


statute, which --


MR. CORDRAY:  No.  Text and context.  Text and


context.  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Cordray. 


Mr. Sutton, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. SUTTON:  I'd like to respond to a few of the


points --


QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, could you ask one --


answer one factual question for me?  Your -- your  brother


made the argument that in -- in reading (c)(2)(A), he went


to the last clause and said on your theory every political


subdivision could enact its own financial responsibility

and insurance laws and so on.


MR. SUTTON:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And that would be a crazy scheme.  My


-- my question is, is there in fact any history of


municipalities enacting these kinds of statutes so that


it's something that might have been in Congress's mind?


MR. SUTTON:  No, Your Honor, not in -- in the


insurance area.  But there's a -- I think a better answer


to that concern, and the better answer is, our point is


that (c)(2)(A) incorporates all of these preexisting


preemption provisions.  They are preemption provisions in


other parts of title 49, whether it's insurance, safety,


size and weight routing, or hazardous material routing.


So, the problem with Justice O'Connor's point of


practical consequences -- in reversing the Sixth Circuit,


there is no gap here.  Why?  Because for 60 years,


Congress and the Department of Transportation have been


regulating these very areas, both with respect to State


laws and city laws, to the extent they've been enacted. 


So, the multiplicity of insurance regulations is a false


concern.  I mean, the -- Congress has already indicated in


31138 and 39 what the rules are there.  The Department of


Transportation has implemented regulations that do get


Chevron deference, and they lay out what the rules are.


QUESTION:  The same problem, you didn't, is --

to me anyway, is -- is (3)(A).  Do you see what I'm


thinking?  I mean, the same human being at the same time


wrote the words in -- in (c)(2)(A) and he used the word


State, and at precisely the same time, he wrote the second


exception, which is (3)(A) --


MR. SUTTON:  Right. 


QUESTION:  -- and he put in political


subdivision.  And what I cannot get over is I don't see


how a single human being on the same day at the same time


could write two exceptions, use the word "State" in one


and use the word "political subdivision" in the other,


without meaning a difference. 


MR. SUTTON:  Right.  Your Honor, look -- compare


(3)(A) to (c)(1).  They follow the exact same enact or


enforce language.  (c)(2)(A) does not use the enact or


enforce language. 


QUESTION:  That's the answer. 


MR. SUTTON:  That's the answer, number one.


Number two, remember, (c)(3) is for the benefit


of motor carriers.  They want to make sure they could have


these rules, whether city or State, apply to them on a


city-by-city not State-by-State basis. 


Now, the -- the regulatory purpose, Your Honor


-- the landmark legislation in this area was the 1980 law


that deregulated interstate commerce.  Everyone agrees

that did not divest cities of authority. 


The 1994 law at issue here was about intrastate


commerce, primarily to put FedEx and UPS on a level


playing field, and suddenly respondents are saying that


deregulated -- regulatory purpose required the divestment


of local authority? 


QUESTION:  Well, what's -- what's Congress's


authority to regulate intrastate commerce?


MR. SUTTON:  It's at its outer edges, and that


to me is what is so odd about this particular


interpretation.  They're saying in the intrastate area,


you could divest States of their authority to delegate,


but they've not done it in the interstate area?  I mean,


how absurd is that?  It's -- it's got it exactly


backwards.


Now, the practical consequences -- I want to go


back to again -- of their interpretation.  (c)(2)(A),


they've agreed, has to be construed the same way


throughout, and there are countless -- as we indicated in


our opening brief, every State in the country has


delegations to cities that have size and weight controls,


size and weight rules that would be eliminated by this


particular construction. 


Thank you. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Sutton.
