CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-1809, J. Elliott Hibbs v. Kathleen Winn.


Very well, General Goddard.  You may proceed.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL GODDARD


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GODDARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:


The fundamental -- the fundamental question in


this case is whether the meaning of the term assessment,


as used in the Tax Injunction Act, includes Arizona's


school tax credit. 


As this Court has written on several occasions, 

the Tax Injunction Act has a very broad reach.  It


drastically limits the access to Federal district courts. 


The act is relatively simple and -- and straightforward. 


It's just 35 words, as I count it, and it specifically


says the Federal district courts shall not enjoin,


restrain, or suspend the assessment, levy, or collection


of a tax under State law where there is a plain, speedy,


and efficient remedy in the courts of that State.


QUESTION:  Where is the assessment here that --


that supposedly is being enjoined?


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, the assessment is the

calculation of a tax by the -- for the taxpayer.  In other


words, it's the bottom line.  It's the plain meaning of


assessment and the dictionary meaning.  It is what happens


after you've done all the additions and subtractions and


you get to line 40 on the Arizona tax return form which


is --


QUESTION:  It's -- it's a self-assessment?  So


you -- it's a self-assessment that's being enjoined?


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, I'm not talking about


a self-assessment.  I believe a self-assessment is a


colloquialism that talks about what all of us go through


as taxpayers.  The assessment I'm talking about is what


the defendant in this case, Elliott Hibbs, the Director of


the Department of Revenue in Arizona, does both for 

individual taxpayers and for all the taxpayers


collectively to determine what the State's revenues are


going to be from the taxpayers.  And the only way you get


to the revenue is that bottom line on the tax form --


QUESTION:  Mr. Goddard --


MR. GODDARD:  -- after you've done all the


credits.


QUESTION:  Mr. Goddard, I thought that in a


self-assessment system, such as the one we have, the


Federal Government, Arizona, that assessment is associated


with assertion of a deficiency.  In Arizona, is every

taxpayer assessed by the government?  That would be quite


a different system, wouldn't it?


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, every taxpayer in


Arizona has their form calculated by the government.  We


check the math.


QUESTION:  You -- you audit everyone in the


State?


MR. GODDARD:  No, Your Honor.  I'm not trying to


say we audit everyone, but technically the assessment, and


as it is used also in the Internal Revenue Code to my


understanding, is the assessment -- and I'm quoting from


the Internal Revenue Code -- shall be made by recording


the liability of the taxpayer in the Office of the


Secretary. 


QUESTION:  Which the Government does when it


wants to assert a deficiency.  And we were told that the


assessment just a week ago is nothing more than a


bookkeeping entry, and what it does is it triggers certain


administrative remedies.  But my understanding was that an


assessment is made when the Government wants to assert a


deficiency.  Otherwise, there isn't this entry, this


bookkeeping entry someplace, that every taxpayer isn't


assessed. 


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, it is -- it is our


position that the State of Arizona under our State tax

system assesses all taxes in the State and that --


QUESTION:  When -- when does that happen?  When


the return is received in the office or?


MR. GODDARD:  It -- it returns during -- excuse


me.  Your Honor, the -- the activity perhaps is -- is


somewhat fictional in terms of the -- of the director. 


He's not going to sit down, as in the old days, with a


green eyeshade and write down a number for each taxpayer. 


But he does, in fact, and his office does, in fact,


calculate the gross revenues in the State, what credits


are going to be applied against those gross revenues,


various adjustments, and comes up with a bottom line.  And


that bottom line is our dictionary -- Black's Dictionary


definition of what an assessment is.


QUESTION:  But that's not the assessment that


you -- I mean, you used the Internal Revenue Code


provision.  That is an entry.  We were told it's a


bookkeeping entry.  And it's made as a prerequisite to


levying liens, to extending the statute of limitations. 


But it certainly isn't true that that kind of assessment,


which is what your brief suggested you were talking about,


is made in the case of every taxpayer.


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, I'm not saying that


every taxpayer has a -- a specific entry next to their


name.  That would -- that would certainly be more than we

could do.  But our statutes, our tax system in Arizona


does, in fact, call for an assessment of the liability of


each taxpayer.  And that assessment, the entire plan,


scheme fixed upon for charging and taxing, the Webster's


definition of assessment, is the bottom line.  And I guess


that's the plain meaning that I'm trying to get to.


QUESTION:  Because I -- I assume that assessment


is -- is -- the assessment that we're concerned with is --


is within the meaning of Federal law.


But let me just ask you this question.  Do you


have a statute in Arizona that in effect says what the


department does with respect to each taxpayer is to assess


that taxpayer?  Does -- does that word occur as a


statement for some technical function that you go through 

with respect to every taxpayer within the meaning of


Arizona law?


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, I -- I can't say that


we have that specific word in our statute.  We


certainly --


QUESTION:  Well, then -- then isn't your problem


this, that -- that there -- that that specific word is


used in the Federal statutes, quite apart from the Tax


Injunction Act?  And -- and my understanding is the same


as Justice Ginsburg's.  It is used in -- in a way that --


that involves a -- a predicate to the -- the assertion of

a lien or -- or steps to collect a deficiency.  And -- and


that doesn't seem to be what is involved here.  Isn't --


isn't that a problem for you in your position?


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, I don't believe so


because the -- the first step -- and -- and the three


words in the statute I think are -- are certainly helpful: 


assessment, levy, collection.  What essentially the


Congress --


QUESTION:  Well, there's no issue of a levy


going on here, and they're not trying to stop you from


collecting anything.  I mean, their -- their argument is


you ought to be collecting more, but they're certainly not


interfering in a way that's going to leave Arizona without


money while it litigates. 


What they're saying is we want 

to litigate so that you'll get more money, and -- and so


that I suppose that's why the Ninth Circuit said why --


that the closest thing to a word involved here that --


that might let the statute apply is assessment. 


MR. GODDARD:  Yes, Your Honor, we believe


that --


QUESTION:  And it didn't think it did.  But, I


mean, it seems to me that that's a basic textual problem


in -- in your case, and I don't understand how you get


around it. 


QUESTION:  The technical assessment that's made

tied to a deficiency you don't fit.  So you're talking


about some other kind of assessment than the one that, for


example, the Government was telling us about last Monday


in the Galletti case, not that technical -- some -- if


we're talking about property, say, a property tax, then


maybe an assessor comes on the land, looks at the house,


attributes a value to it.  That wouldn't be a self-


assessing system from the taxpayer's point of view.  But


-- but the income tax is quite different.  You assess


yourself.  Sometimes you get audited; sometimes you don't.


And I don't see that anybody here is trying to


stop the government from making the assessment that would


be a trigger to asserting a deficiency.  No one is trying


to stop Arizona from asserting a deficiency against any 

taxpayer.


MR. GODDARD:  No, Your Honor, but -- but what


we're asking for is that the -- the director, Mr. Hibbs,


be able to -- as the statute says, to implement the -- the


tax system under State law.


QUESTION:  Well, is it the case, though, that


other courts of appeal at the Federal level have concluded


that the Tax Injunction Act does not bar suits that would


increase State revenues rather than reduce them, that the


purpose of the Tax Injunction Act was to prevent reduction


of State tax revenues, specifically by corporations coming

in and getting injunctions and preventing the State from


receiving revenues, but that it doesn't apply where the


effect of the -- the suit would be to increase the State's


coffers?


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, if I could deal with


-- there -- there are two questions, one, the legislative


history and -- and the -- as this Court has noted --


QUESTION:  First of all, with the courts of


appeal, the majority have so held, I guess, who have


addressed it.


MR. GODDARD:  No, Your Honor.  I -- I would


submit that -- that that's not the case.


QUESTION:  Only the Fifth Circuit has gone the


other way.


MR. GODDARD:  The Fifth Circuit in ACLU


Foundation v. Bridges has -- has very convincingly --


QUESTION:  Yes, but the others went the other


way on it.


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, I could --


QUESTION:  The Seventh, the Eighth, and the


Ninth.  Right?


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, there is -- is


language in the Seventh Circuit opinion which speaks about


this, but it is in a very limited sense in -- in Dunn v.


Kerry.  I don't think it's applicable here.  I'd be happy

to discuss that.


I would refer the course also -- the Court also,


as our brief does, to First Circuit U.S. Brewers v. Perez


interpreting the Butler Act which is identical in language


to the Tax Injunction Act; to Kraebel v. New York Housing


Department in the Second Circuit which talks about a tax


benefit.


That's what we have on -- at -- at stake here is


we try -- the -- the respondents are trying to draw a


division between all State tax systems to say anything


that involves raising revenue is challengeable only in


State court, but if there's a benefit involved, if there's


anything else that accrues to the benefit of the taxpayer,


that has to go Federal court.  I believe that's --


QUESTION:  I don't know about that, but a -- a


challenge to a tax credit I think is what we're talking


about.  Right?


MR. GODDARD:  Well, Your Honor, I don't believe


there's any logical distinction between a deduction, an


exclusion, an exemption, and a credit.  They all --


QUESTION:  Well, I suppose you could -- I


suppose you could make the argument that it -- it's wrong


to say the State is only interested in increasing revenue. 


The State may be interested in fairness for its taxpayers,


giving its taxpayers the -- the benefit of the lower rate.

That's certainly a -- a sound State policy. 


MR. GODDARD:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I -- I


think that's one of the policies, if not the principal


policy, behind the Tax Injunction Act is respect for State


procedures and also --


QUESTION:  General Goddard, the -- what we've


been talking about is this section of 1341 that talks


about assessment, levy, or collection of any debt.  Those


three words fit perfectly into a property tax scheme. 


They really don't fit nearly as well into an income tax


scheme.  Are there cases from courts of appeals that say


that the -- the act does apply to income tax as well as


property tax?


MR. GODDARD: 


Yes, Your Honor, and that 

distinction -- the cases I'm referring to involve both. 


And -- and you're absolutely correct.  Many of them are


property tax oriented.  That's true of In re Gillis. 


That's true of several others.  Colonial Pipeline is


another that I would cite showing a tax benefit not a tax


deduction to the State.


But the most precisely on point is ACLU


Foundation v. Bridges from the Fifth Circuit,


interestingly after a couple of other cases which might


have -- which have been cited by the respondents for their


proposition that -- that somehow the revenue -- I mean,

the State revenue -- things that give revenues to the


State are significantly different from items that benefit


the taxpayer.  I would submit that under this scheme and


under the scheme that this Court has discussed in the six


cases that -- where it has discussed the Tax Injunction


Act in detail speak about a much broader application.


QUESTION:  You were going to go to the history


or something else.  I -- I don't want you to forget that,


and the reason I don't want you to forget is I'm thinking


yours is a plausible interpretation --


MR. GODDARD:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  -- that could be -- well, I mean, it


could.  I'm about to say maybe it isn't plausible enough.


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  The -- the -- but what I'm -- what


I'm driving at is that the -- the Congress might have said


that although Federal courts are in the business quite


often, along with State courts, of deciding whether a


State law is unconstitutional or violates some other


Federal law, and although millions of State laws are very


important, we're separating out a set of cases here where


they can't do it. 


Now, one reason for doing that would be we don't


want to interfere with States getting money that they need


for their business.  And that would limit these words to

interferences with collection of revenue.


MR. GODDARD:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Now, you were about to explain to me


why --


MR. GODDARD:  I -- I would --


QUESTION:  -- there's evidence that Congress


wanted to do more than that.


MR. GODDARD:  I would greatly appreciate --


QUESTION:  It wanted to do more than that.  It


wanted, in fact, to say you just can't stop them from --


you cannot, Federal courts, go and have our tax division


here interfered with, even though it doesn't affect


collection of revenue.  We -- we don't want you to


interfere with their rules, with their administration, 

with anything.  You can do it for the police department,


but not the tax.


All right.  Now -- now, what's the evidence


that's what -- what Congress wanted?


MR. GODDARD:  Well, the first evidence is the


words of the statute.  They didn't just say collections.


QUESTION:  All right.  The words -- I think


they're pretty ambiguous. 


MR. GODDARD:  They -- well, they don't just say


collections, though, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  No, I know.

 MR. GODDARD:  They say assessment and levy. 


Those words are not modified. 


QUESTION:  Let's go beyond these words.


MR. GODDARD:  Thank you. 


Also, the history of the Tax Injunction Act --


it comes from a period when the -- the Congress was


reacting to this Court's decision in Ex parte Young, and


they felt that extensive equitable relief against State


officials was inappropriate, and they passed several laws,


the Johnson Act and the Tax Injunction Act in the '30's


being the most important, which spoke very broadly about


keeping in State courts State proceedings.  They did not


say anything about just collections, although --


QUESTION: 


Mr. Goddard, in that -- in that 

regard, wasn't what Congress had in mind -- it was


taxpayer suits.  They didn't want taxpayers to avoid going


through the whole process.  I mean, most of the cases that


come up under the Tax Injunction Act are taxpayers who say


please enjoin the tax or don't assess me or don't levy. 


But this is not that kind of case. 


There's no one here who's trying to stop the


State from collecting revenue.  It's an attack by a non-


taxpayer, and that at the time of the Tax Injunction Act,


I don't think that kind of action was even on the scene. 


Do you have any claims where a non-taxpayer was seeking to

enjoin the collection of a tax? 


What they -- what -- what Congress was aiming at


is that, taxpayer, you've got a prompt, speedy, efficient


remedy in your State, you use that, don't rush to the


Federal court.


MR. GODDARD:  Your -- Your Honor, the -- the


Congress had several reasons, and -- and you're absolutely


correct that one of the primary ones was not allowing


taxpayers, especially out of State, to come in and


interrupt the flow of taxes.  I'm not denying that that


was a -- a very important reason. 


But as this Court has said in Rosewell v.


LaSalle National Bank, if that was the only reason that


they were concerned about the collection of taxes, they 

could have said so.  They could have said only diversity


jurisdiction cases will be barred from Federal court. 


They did not.  They used -- they said essentially district


courts shall not consider cases to restrain, enjoin, or


suspend actions for the assessment, levy, and collection


of taxes. 


They also --


QUESTION:  That was a taxpayer's case too,


wasn't it? 


MR. GODDARD:  Excuse me?


QUESTION:  Wasn't the case you just cited --

we don't have a taxpayer who's not trying to stop any


assessment of his tax, any -- anything else about --

the Ninth Circuit and ACLU Foundation v. Bridges --

MR. GODDARD:  -- which involves a challenge to a


specific tax benefit given to religious organizations in


Louisiana.  So I believe that's as close as I can come.


Your Honor, if I could reserve the balance of my


time, I would like to do so.


QUESTION:  Very well, General Goddard.


Mr. Hungar, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. HUNGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The position of the United States is that


respondents' suit is barred by the plain language of the

Tax Injunction Act because it seeks to enjoin and restrain


the assessment of a tax under State law. 


And to turn directly to the --


QUESTION:  May I ask you if you think the


language is so plain that we should not even look at the


legislative history?


MR. HUNGAR:  We think it's -- yes.  We think


that the -- the language is sufficiently plain that


there's no need to look at the legislative history, but


that if you do, the legislative history also supports the


interpretation we advance.


QUESTION:  And Judge Easterbrook was just dead


wrong in looking at the legislative history and he also


interpreted it dead wrong. 


MR. HUNGAR:  Judge -- the case before Judge


Easterbrook, Justice Stevens, was quite different from


this case.  That involved not an -- a -- a suit against


tax -- the tax collector to affect the manner in which the


tax collector administered the tax code, but rather a suit


against private plaintiffs who had brought a State court


action.  It was a Federal court suit to enjoin a State


court action.  And so the considerations applicable in


that case were obviously quite different from those what


we have -- where we have presented here. 


The point of the Tax Injunction Act is to -- to

protect the tax collector against Federal court suits to


enjoin or restrain the tax collector's assessment,


collection, and levy of tax.


QUESTION:  Does -- does that -- were you


finished your answer?


MR. HUNGAR:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  The -- the -- if you use the word


enjoin to mean command, which it can mean, can you say


that they are commanding the collection of a tax, contrary


to the words of the statute?


MR. HUNGAR:  Yes.  We think that is also quite


correct here.  That was not the issue addressed by the


Ninth Circuit, but that is certainly another way to get to


the result which we think is the correct result, that the 

plain language of the statute bars this kind of suit.


Turning to the questions about the meaning of


assessment, it is perfectly clear beyond peradventure that


under -- in the Federal system, the term assessment means


the tax collector's recorded determination of the amount


of tax due under Federal law --


QUESTION:  Do we have a self-assessment?


MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  We don't. 


MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Is every -- every taxpayer is

assessed?


MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- the --


QUESTION:  Every taxpayer is assessed even when


no deficiency is sought?


MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, Your Honor.  The practice of


the Internal Revenue Service is to assess the amount of


taxes shown on the return if that is -- absent some audit


or some reason to think there's an error in the return. 


And in fact, the Internal Revenue Code so provides. 


Section --


QUESTION:  That every taxpayer is assessed even


when there's no deficiency.


MR. HUNGAR:  Correct.  Well, if a taxpayer files


a return showing a bottom line calculation of how much tax 

is due after all credits, deductions, and so forth have


been taken into account, that amount and -- and the tax --


and the IRS checks the addition, concludes that it's


accurate, and is not conducting an audit, that amount is


assessed.  It's -- it's recorded in the transcript.  Now,


of course, it's on the computer.


QUESTION:  You don't have to send them a notice


of -- in other words, I file my income tax.  I thought


there's some provisions that say if somebody thinks I made


a mistake, they have to send me some special notice.  Some


process takes place.  We have some other case on this.  I

thought all that involved an assessment, that it was a


particular thing under the IRC, not just my filing of a --


of the return.


MR. HUNGAR:  The assessment is a particular


thing.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, it's the -- it's


the tax collect -- the IRS's determination of the amount


of tax --


QUESTION:  But you just said to Justice Ginsburg


that if nothing happens -- like I try to pay my taxes


accurately.  So I file these pieces of paper.  And now,


nothing happens.  They just take the money.  They cash the


check.  And -- and you're going to say when that's all


that happened, there was an assessment?  I thought it had


a particular meaning that wasn't that, that was when you 

thought I was wrong, you did something and then went after


me.  But -- but it just -- everybody is called an


assessment?  Does it say that in the code where --


MR. HUNGAR:  26 U.S.C. 6201.  This is not in the


-- the briefs.  26 U.S.C. 6201(a)(1) provides, quote, the


Secretary shall assess all taxes determined by the


taxpayer or by the Secretary as to which returns or lists


are made under this title.  So if the taxpayer has


admitted on their tax return that they owe X dollars in


taxes, the Secretary shall assess that amount and also has


the discretion to conduct an audit.

 QUESTION:  But -- but nobody -- nobody here is


contesting, as far as I can tell, what we were told Monday


is a mere bookkeeping entry.  Does it -- does it -- is a


notice and demand sent out to everyone who's assessed?


MR. HUNGAR:  Not if the taxpayer has conceded


the amount of liability.  That's the point.  If the


taxpayer concedes on the return that their liability is


X --


QUESTION:  So why is anybody trying to enjoin a


bookkeeping entry that nobody knows anything about?


MR. HUNGAR:  Because assessment is the formal


determination by the -- by the --


QUESTION:  But I don't see that there's any


effort to stop a bookkeeping entry from being made --

MR. HUNGAR:  There is, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  -- that nobody gets any notice of and


doesn't -- is -- is, we were told, just a mere bookkeeping


entry.  That doesn't -- doesn't -- it's not necessary in


order to collect the tax?


MR. HUNGAR:  But the statute, Justice Ginsburg,


doesn't say anything about notice.  It says the -- the


Federal district courts shall not enjoin the assessment of


a tax under State law. 


QUESTION:  But nobody is seeking to enjoin any


assessment.

 MR. HUNGAR:  They -- they are.  The plaintiffs

QUESTION:  They -- as assessment being a


bookkeeping entry that nobody knows anything about.  You


just said you don't need any notice and demand.  In the


Galletti case, we were told that's what the assessment is. 


It's a notation in a book someplace.  It doesn't even have


the taxpayer's name on it.


MR. HUNGAR:  If I may answer, Justice Ginsburg. 


What plaintiffs are seeking to do is prevent and restrain


and enjoin the -- the tax department from assessing taxes


under State law in the manner required by State law, which


includes, as part of the assessment, computation and


allowance of the credit where it is due.  And the -- and


the suit in this case would preclude the tax collector


from doing that if respondents were to succeed. 


QUESTION:  May I ask you --


MR. HUNGAR:  That's exactly what the act


precludes.


QUESTION:  -- does the Arizona tax code have a


provision in it comparable to the one that you read us --


to us from the Federal code?


MR. HUNGAR:  I don't believe so, Your Honor.  I


believe what the Arizona tax code provides --


QUESTION:  Then it's hardly relevant, is it?

 MR. HUNGAR:  -- is that the -- is that the tax


collector there, the Department of Revenue, makes a


determination or reviews the returns and ultimately either


determines that that amount will be accepted, that -- that


the amount of tax shown on the return is the -- going to


be accepted as the amount of tax due from the tax


collector, or that they're going to try to require some --


you know, assess a deficiency or whatever it may be.


But in either case, within the meaning of


Federal law, the tax collector's determination of what the


amount is due, either if it's the amount shown on return


-- on the return or if they think it's a different amount,


within the meaning of Federal law, that is the assessment.


And that is what the respondents are trying to 

change.  They're trying to require the tax collector to


assess taxes not in a manner required under State law,


which is the -- the text of the statute, but rather in a


manner contrary to State law. 


QUESTION:  Suppose they clarify that they're not


trying to stop a bookkeeping entry from being made in


Arizona, even though Arizona law doesn't require it, just


like the Feds.


MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, the assessment under


State law in Arizona includes the tax credit.  The


respondents would change that and would preclude the tax

collector from doing that.


QUESTION:  If they couldn't stop a bookkeeping


entry, I assume they couldn't stop the acceptance of the


tax in accordance with a bookkeeping entry.  Isn't that


right? 


MR. HUNGAR:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  I -- I assume it's essential to their


case that they stop that ultimate bookkeeping entry which


determines how much the taxpayer owes.


MR. HUNGAR:  Exactly. 


And the purpose of the --


QUESTION:  Although we were told that there


isn't that bookkeeping entry in Arizona, that they don't


have it.


MR. HUNGAR:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'm


obviously no expert in Arizona tax law.  I'm informed that


the tax collector looks at the returns when they come in,


checks the addition, and in a certain number of cases goes


further.


QUESTION:  But that's not what you described as


the assessment. 


MR. HUNGAR:  The assessment is the tax


collector's recorded determination of the amount due.


QUESTION:  Which we were told they don't have in


Arizona.

 MR. HUNGAR:  Well, it -- again, I think for

assume that the tax collector in Arizona decides whether


they're going to accept the amount of return shown on the


tax as --


for --


QUESTION:  And keeps a record of it.


MR. HUNGAR:  And keeps a record of it.  Exactly.


QUESTION:  I mean, he must keep a record of it


MR. HUNGAR:  Exactly, exactly.  Now, the


Attorney General can address that, but -- but that's my


understanding of Arizona law.


QUESTION:  Isn't the case just simpler if we say


you cannot command the collection of a tax, which is 

what's happening here?


MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.  That -- that


is exactly right.  That is -- that is entirely consistent


with the United States' view of and interpretation of this


act and the Anti-Injunction Act. 


And it's also consistent with the legislative


history and purposes of the act.  This Court has


repeatedly recognized, in Justice O'Connor's opinion for


the -- for the Court in the Grace Brethren case and in


other cases, that the purpose of the act sweeps more


broadly than simply a focus on collection and --

 QUESTION:  But those were all taxpayers trying

MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but the


Court did not say that the purpose and scope of the act is


limited to that context, nor is the language limited to


that context.  To the contrary, the Court said this -- the


act sweeps broadly to prevent Federal court interference


in the administration of -- of State tax systems. 


QUESTION:  But wouldn't you agree that the


primary purpose of the statute was to protect the State's


fisc?


MR. HUNGAR:  That is certainly a primary purpose


of the statute.


QUESTION: 


And insofar as that purpose is 

relevant, you lose on that purpose.


MR. HUNGAR:  It's -- it's not applicable here,


although I think it is important to recognize that it


would be quite extraordinary for Federal courts to be in


the business of ordering State tax collectors to collect


-- to collect taxes from their citizens that the


legislature of the State had deemed should not be


collected.


QUESTION:  It's curious that the Moore's Federal


Practice and Wright and Miller and Hart and Wechsler all


suggest that the Tax Injunction Act does not prevent a

to collect taxes, which is a different situation than


here.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN S. COHEN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. COHEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


I'll begin by stating what our position is.  The


Tax Injunction Act and the associated principles of comity


only -- only -- apply when a district court is asked to

stop the flow of revenue to the State.  For more than 60


years, the act and the associated principles of comity


have been applied only when claimants sought to stop the


flow of tax revenues.  The decisions of this Court support


this.


In challenges to tax credits, the Tax Injunction


Act has been either not considered at all by this Court or


in other Federal courts has specifically -- they've


specifically held, except in Bridges last summer --


they've specifically held that the Tax Injunction Act did


not apply.


It -- this is -- also our position is consistent


with the revenue protective purpose of the Tax Injunction


Act and common sense supports this.  If there's no threat


to the flow of State revenue -- State tax revenues, then


the administration of the State tax laws is the same as


the administration of education laws and penal laws --


QUESTION:  Mr. Cohen, going back to the


language, assessment, levy, or collection of any tax,


which was the subject of questions to your -- your


opponent, you don't question, do you, that the statute


applies to income taxes as well as to property taxes?


MR. COHEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, we don't question


that.


QUESTION:  And would you question its

applicability if the -- the State could not point to a


particular act of assessment or levy or collection in its


procedures? 


MR. COHEN:  Your Honor, we view the phrase,


enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy, or


collection, as a phrase.  We -- we don't believe that any


one word there has special meanings.  That phrase has been


interpreted by the courts to say that the process of


causing a flow of tax revenues to the State will not be


stopped. 


QUESTION:  You mean I -- I can't read this


statute to say that the district court shall not enjoin


the collection of a tax?  I have to read all the other


things with it? 


That -- that's a very strange 

interpretation of any statute.


MR. COHEN:  Justice Kennedy, the -- let's take a


-- I -- I believe the idea was that there is a process. 


The -- at the time the word assessment was first used, it


was 1867 in the Federal Anti-Injunction Act, which was the


model for the Tax Injunction Act in 1937, as this Court


held in Jefferson County.  And at that time if a -- and a


-- the assessment process which was valuing property -- if


that had been stopped, then -- then they wouldn't get to


the collection phase, or if they stopped the levy phase,


they wouldn't get to the collection phase.  So it's a --

the concept was that it took these three things to make


the flow of revenue come to the State.


And that while individuals have an option under


the section 1983 and 1343 together to choose either the


Federal or State courts in which to vindicate their


constitutional rights, the Congress decided that they


should not have that option if it could interfere -- if it


could stop the flow of revenues to the State --


QUESTION:  Let's assume --


MR. COHEN:  -- but it didn't go farther than


that.


QUESTION:  Let's assume it means just that.


MR. COHEN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And -- and let's assume that -- that


you get your injunction in a Federal district court


against the Secretary of State's collection of this tax. 


What is the Secretary of State to do?  His -- his State


statute tells him that he should collect less.  This


injunction says he should collect more.  He will appeal


the case from the district court to the court of appeals. 


Meanwhile, what is he to do?  He is not authorized by


State law, which he thinks is valid, to collect more.


It seems to me during the whole period while


that -- that case is on appeal from the district court to


the court of appeals to the Supreme Court, if it gets

here, the Secretary of State doesn't know what to do, and


his collection of the tax is impaired.


MR. COHEN:  Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  Why isn't that so?


MR. COHEN:  The -- two -- two answers, if -- if


you allow me.  The first is that the district court, of


course, has the power to stay the effectiveness of that


judgment until there is a final decision, and he could be


asked --


QUESTION:  Well, then the statute wouldn't apply


I suppose.  It just says it shall not enjoin.  We're


assuming it has enjoined.  If your reading is correct, it


should be able to enjoin because there's nothing wrong


with enjoining.  Okay?


Let's assume it does enjoin.  Does that not


interfere with the collection, even if you think that


that's -- that's all that's at issue is the collection of


taxes?  How is the State going to collect its taxes?


MR. COHEN:  Justice Scalia, the statute does not


say interfere.  The statute talks about stopping the


collection, and this would not stop the collection.  It


would -- it would allow the collection --


QUESTION:  You have a much narrower position. 


Your earlier position was this whole purpose was just to


protect the State's tax revenue and so long as it doesn't

impair that.  Now you say it can impair that so long as it


does not enjoin it.  That's a much narrower position.


MR. COHEN:  Justice Scalia, I'm not saying that. 


I -- I -- you --


QUESTION:  I thought that's what --


MR. COHEN:  I must have misspoke myself because


what I am saying is that they can't stop the collection of


taxes and that this would not stop the collection.


QUESTION:  But the statute doesn't say stop.  It


says enjoin and enjoin can mean -- can mean command.


MR. COHEN:  In Jefferson --


QUESTION:  And that's exactly what you're doing. 


You're commanding the collection of the tax.


MR. COHEN: 


Justice Kennedy, in Jefferson 

County, this Court unanimously interpreted the statute to


say stop the collection.  That's what this Court said in


Jefferson County, and there are a number of cases in which


a commandment seeking to command the payment of taxes has


been held to be outside the Tax Injunction Act.


QUESTION:  Can I bring you -- can I bring you


back to my question which I don't think I got an answer


to?  What is the Secretary of State supposed to do?  He


has gotten an order from a Federal district court to


collect more taxes than he is authorized to collect under


State law.  He intends to appeal that district court

order, but meanwhile, he has been enjoined from


collecting.  What is he supposed to do?


MR. COHEN:  Justice Scalia, he obeys the order


of the court and he's -- he's only enjoined from --


QUESTION:  Well, that means --


MR. COHEN:  He's only enjoined with regard to


the tax credit.  He's not enjoined from collecting the tax


which includes not honoring the tax credit.


QUESTION:  And I take that -- I take it that's


the answer to -- to Justice Kennedy's question, that his


obligation to collect the tax is an obligation under State


law, and once he is enjoined from recognizing the credit,


he simply follows State law and collects the tax without


reference to the credit. 


The Federal court, conversely, 

doesn't say, you go out and collect the tax.  The State


law does that.  Is -- is -- do you buy that?


MR. COHEN:  Yes, absolutely.


QUESTION:  He believes the district court


decision is wrong, and let's assume it is wrong.  What is


he supposed to do while it is on appeal?


MR. COHEN:  Unless it -- Your Honor, unless it


is stayed, he is to obey it, and --


QUESTION:  And that does not --


MR. COHEN:  It does not interfere with the


collection -- with the flow -- it does not interfere with

the flow of revenue to the State, and that's what the Tax


Injunction Act is basically about. 


QUESTION:  He -- he obeys the injunction and he


obeys State law except with respect to the credit which he


is enjoined from giving.


MR. COHEN:  I agree, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And the result is that he collects


the -- the full tax.  That's the way it would work.


MR. COHEN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose the State law says


if these tax credits are invalidated, all other taxpayers


shall be assessed an additional 2 percent to make up for


-- I'm sorry.  If these -- if these tax credits are


invalidated, other taxpayers shall be -- their taxes shall 

be reduced by 1 percent.  Okay?  I mean, the -- the State


looks forward to this possibility that there will be an


injunction.  What is the Secretary of State to do then? 


Is he to assess everybody else at a lesser amount?


MR. COHEN:  Your Honor, I believe --


QUESTION:  In other words, he is prevented from


collecting the additional amount that he would have had to


collect from other taxpayers had this tax credit been


acknowledged.  The tax credit is struck down, and what the


law says is, if it's struck down, you have to collect more


from everybody else.  Now, I assume in that situation the

district court would not be able to enjoin the collection,


would it? 


So all you're talking about is whether the State


law is -- is drafted in a clever way or not.


MR. COHEN:  Your Honor, if -- if the tax credit


is struck down, the State gets more money.  It has no need


to assess an additional 1 or 2 percent of its taxpayers. 


But if -- if the State in its wisdom chose to do so, then


whoever collects taxes would obey the State law until


another case came to court and another judge told them


what to do.


QUESTION:  All right.  So -- so there would be


some interference.  But what do you do about the word?


I mean, I'm somewhat shaken by the fact that the 

-- the Internal Revenue Code does -- as I have just read


6201 and 6203, it does use that word assessment as


apparently to refer simply to the record keeping function


of the tax division which it says under rules and


regulations the assessment shall be made by recording the


liability of the taxpayer in the Office of the Secretary. 


And therefore, what it seems to have in mind in the IRC is


a simple bookkeeping notation of how much money this


taxpayer owes which takes place in every case.


Now, the -- the act says there shall be no suit


that restrains the assessment of that tax; i.e., you

cannot restrain the Secretary in noting the amount that


the taxpayer owes. 


Now, they're saying stop right there.  End of


the matter.  Now, what in your opinion overcomes that


argument? 


MR. COHEN:  Your Honor, Justice Breyer, it's


interesting about the Internal Revenue Code and the -- the


Federal income tax law because there is a corollary to the


Tax Injunction Act:  the Anti-Injunction Act of 1867.  And


it uses the word assessment.  And there are a number of


Federal court decisions saying that that does not apply to


tax credits.  And in each --


QUESTION:  That's not an answer for the


reason --


MR. COHEN:  May I --


QUESTION:  -- that they're saying they're wrong,


just as they say we were wrong in five cases not to notice


this.  So continue, please.


MR. COHEN:  Yes.  None of them -- none of them


looked at the word assessment in isolation.  What it


looked at -- what those cases looked at was the phrase, as


-- as I've suggested to the Court, that the phrase


assessment, levy, and collection is the process of


creating the flow of revenue.


QUESTION:  But it isn't and; it's or.  Isn't it?

 MR. COHEN:  The -- Justice Scalia, it -- it is


or for purposes of saying that you can't restrain any of


those because if you restrain any of those in the context


of creating the stream of revenue, you have stopped the


stream of revenue.  And that -- that's what history of the


act shows, the purpose of the act.


QUESTION:  So your answer is this.  You say


indeed they've got it correctly defined.  Indeed, it says


assessment.  It says assessment, levy, or collection.  But


that phrase does not refer to every assessment, levy, or


collection.  Rather, in context it refers to those


assessments, levies, and collections that will have, were


they enjoined, the impact of cutting the revenue stream


flowing to the State.


MR. COHEN:  That's our position, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  That's your view.  So we should look


at that in context.  That's why you go to the history and


these other things. 


MR. COHEN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  All right.  I understand. 


MR. COHEN:  I -- I would like to also point out


to the Court that this use of a tax credit as a mechanism


could also to -- that is to funnel money to school tuition


organizations could just as well have been an


appropriation of dollars and vouchers.  And if instead the

State was giving vouchers to school tuition organizations,


93 percent of which went to religious schools, there would


be no question about the individual citizen's option to


choose to go to the Federal court.


QUESTION:  But it wasn't done that way.  I mean,


it's just like saying it could have been extracted by


torture too, and that would have been clearly


unconstitutional. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  But that happens not to be the way it


was done. 


MR. COHEN:  That's correct, Your Honor, but in


Nyquist this Court particularly pointed out that a tax


credit was the same as giving money to the State.  That --


that was this Court dealing with a tax credit that --


where the money was used to support religious schools,


which is just what we're asserting here.


QUESTION:  Mueller certainly distinguished that


part of Nyquist.


MR. COHEN:  I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.  I


didn't --


QUESTION:  The Mueller against Allen case surely


distinguished that part of Nyquist.  I mean, it's much


less valuable to -- after Mueller than it was before


Mueller.

 MR. COHEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, Mueller was a tax


deduction case rather than a tax credit case.  In a tax


credit case --


QUESTION:  Why should -- why should that make


any difference to your argument? 


MR. COHEN:  It -- generally, it wouldn't, but a


tax credit is every dollar that goes to the benefit of the


school tuition organization -- if it wasn't given to them,


every dollar of that would go to the State.  In a tax


deduction, a tax deduction is a more generalized --


helping to support charity, and only a portion of that


money goes to the State --


QUESTION:  Yes.  It may be -- it may be a


smaller amount, but in both cases it goes to the person 

who -- who claims it.


MR. COHEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct,


but it's a smaller percentage.  My use of tax credit with


Nyquist is that that's an unusual feature of Nyquist is


it's dollar for dollar.  In Mueller, there was the --


there were a number of considerations when you deal with a


tax deduction.  They're a little different than tax


credit, and this Court has recognized those.  Generally


they are tax benefits and generally they are to be


considered outside the Tax Injunction Act according to the


cases.

 QUESTION:  Is the point you're making is -- is

I want $3 -- instead of going to general revenues, it goes


to fund campaign -- to presidential elections.

QUESTION:  That's on the -- that's what this is,


isn't it?


MR. COHEN:  Justice Ginsburg, that's exactly


right.  That's what I'm saying.

QUESTION:  Don't kid yourself.


QUESTION:  Go on.  Go first.


QUESTION:  I just want to make sure I didn't


miss something in your argument, Mr. Cohen.  Talking about


the history of this statute, did you refer to an earlier


statute that used the similar language in the same order,


assessment, levy, and collection or collection and levy,


whichever it is, and that that statute only applied to


real estate taxes?  Was that -- did you say that?  I want


to make sure I didn't --

 MR. COHEN:  Justice Stewart, I was referring to


the Anti-Injunction Act of 1867 --


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. COHEN:  -- in which the word levy was not


used.  It was assessment or collection, and I said it was


in the context of valuation then because there was no


income tax in 1867.  And that could be -- for instance, I


know there weren't Federal property taxes, but it could be


in -- in valuation of -- of property for tariffs coming in


or things of that nature.  The word assessment then was


not used in the context of the income tax laws.  That's


all I was saying because there were none.


QUESTION:  And -- and it would be perfectly


natural in the real estate tax context to use them in that


order because the assessment comes first.  Whereas, the


argument of your opponents here is the assessment is the


last thing in the chain of events, which seems somewhat


counter-intuitive if you're -- when you're referring to


income taxes.


MR. COHEN:  I -- I agree, Justice Stewart.


QUESTION:  See, this -- in -- in -- do you know


this in State tax systems?  Apparently in the Federal tax


system assessment refers to an official determination of


the amount that the individual taxpayer owes.  Now, there


are 50 State systems plus the District of Columbia.  Do

you know if there are a significant number of States that


would not consider that official determination of the


amount owed to be an assessment? 


MR. COHEN:  Mr. Justice Breyer, no, I do not


know.  We haven't done a survey of the States.


QUESTION:  But the question I was going to put


was you -- you say that the -- the principal purpose of


this law was to protect the fisc of the State.  And I --


you know, I will concede that, that -- that what Congress


was most concerned about was preventing somebody from


stopping the State from collecting money.  But it's not


unusual that Congress drafts its prohibitions broader than


is necessary to achieve just the narrow purpose.  And if


indeed they -- they prohibited not just stopping the 

collection but also stopping the assessment, it seems to


me we have to take the statute for what it says, if indeed


this is an assessment.  And the mere fact that it goes


beyond what the principal purpose was, I mean, that --


that's often the case with statutes.


MR. COHEN:  Justice Scalia, the State contends


and the United States both contend that this statute is --


the purpose of it was to stop any court -- Federal court


interference with the tax administration process itself. 


And the -- the Federal court decisions, other than


Bridges, reject that point of view.

 And this Court rejected that point of view in


Jefferson County when the -- the issue there was that the


county had sued in the State court against Federal judges


to try to get an occupational tax.  And the Federal judges


removed the case to Federal court, and the county said,


well, the Tax Injunction Act applies here because the


Federal judges are going to raise State tax issues and


this Federal court will be deciding cases having to do


with State tax administration.  And they cited the


Kelleher case out of the Second Circuit which it held that


the Tax Injunction Act was so broad that it applied to tax


-- all State tax administration.  And this Court rejected


that position, and this Court I believe unanimously


overruled Kelleher.  So we --


QUESTION:  Mr. Cohen, we are ships passing in


the night because you're -- I don't care what the purpose


was.  I care what the language says, and my point is that


very often the language goes beyond the narrow purpose


that Congress had in mind.  And when -- when the language


does so, we read the statute as it's written, but you


don't -- don't agree with that apparently.  We -- we have


to intuit the purpose and limit the language no matter


what it says to that purpose.


MR. COHEN:  Mr. Justice, I -- I'm saying that

-- no -- I guess 140 years with the Anti-Injunction Act 


that is the way the Federal courts -- the way we're


suggesting is the way the Federal courts have interpreted


this language.


And we suggest that if there's a problem, as


long as the tax revenue is flowing to the State and we're


not interfering -- we're not stopping that, if there's a


problem with -- with that system that's been there now


for, oh, 100, 60 years for States, 140 years for the


Federal fisc, if there's a problem, the States can take


that problem to Congress to change this exemption.  This


is an exemption from the Federal jurisdiction, which under


the Phillips case is to be narrowly construed.  If -- if


they -- if there's a real problem -- and I suggest there 

is not because the money will continue to flow to the


State notwithstanding our -- the Federal court


jurisdiction here.


And we believe that the law should not be


changed and we request that the -- this Court remain with


the past 60 years and 140 years of judicial experience on


this issue.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL GODDARD


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GODDARD:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


If -- if I may go to the overriding principle


here because I think to some extent that's what governs


the actions of the State and should be appropriate here.


As this Court said in -- many years ago under


the principle of comity, which Mr. Cohen referred to,


comity refers to the scrupulous regard for the rightful


independence of State governments which should at all


times actuate the Federal courts and a proper reluctance


to interfere by injunction with their fiscal operations. 


That's Matthews v. Rodgers. 


QUESTION: 


What -- what happened in -- in 

Nyquist and Mueller?  Is that just the Court overlooked


it?


MR. GODDARD:  Your -- Your Honor, the Court did


not deal in any way with the issue of -- of section 1341


in either Nyquist or Mueller, and I believe under -- under


your decision in DeBuono there is -- which also deals with


1341 and the failure to raise it, there can be a


presumption that the escape clause was exercised.  It is


-- if there is no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy under


State law, obviously jurisdiction in the Federal court is


appropriate.

 QUESTION:  But there -- one sees plain, speedy,


and effective --


MR. GODDARD:  Efficient. 


QUESTION:  -- that's a taxpayer who has to go


through the system.  But that -- that's -- how does that


fit when it's a non-taxpayer who's stopping -- who's --


who's trying to declare a credit unconstitutional?  This


-- this quick, speedy remedy is -- is that the taxpayer


gets a refund remedy, gets a deficiency, whatever it is,


but how does this swift -- how does that play into


somebody who is not a taxpayer?


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, in -- in the Anti-


Injunction Act, that creates a serious problem.  In the --


in this issue -- and I think that a critical thing is 

these -- these taxpayers have a remedy at State law.  This


case was decided by the Arizona Supreme Court in Kotterman


v. Killian, and this -- this -- the Supreme Court denied


cert 4 years ago.  The exact same issues that have been


brought forward in Federal court by the petitioners in


this case were decided by the Arizona Supreme Court under


the Arizona constitution and the United States


Constitution, and there was not an establishment issue in


this case. 


And that brings me back --


QUESTION:  I meant within the meaning of the

Injunction Act, it seems that swift, whatever, remedy was


referring to the taxpayer's remedy under State law --


MR. GODDARD:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- could take care of --


MR. GODDARD:  Yes, Your Honor, and under the


Federal law there's a problem because you can't pay a tax


and get it refunded if you're a third party.  But in


Arizona law, there is standing for -- for these parties


and that's already been exercised.  They're trying to take


another shot by going into Federal court and trying to get


an -- another opinion which will deviate from the Arizona


Supreme Court. 


And excuse me.  If I could refer --


QUESTION:  The same plaintiffs?  If it's the


same plaintiffs, you would have a -- a --


MR. GODDARD:  Your Honor, I -- I didn't mean to


imply they were the same plaintiffs, but they were exactly


the same issues in turning a constitutional violation.


If I could to Justice Scalia's earlier question,


as the -- as the legal representative of the Arizona


Department of Revenue, if there were an adverse decision


in the -- in the district court of Arizona -- and our


Supreme Court has already spoken on the same issue -- I


have a very hard time advising a client as to what they


should do going forward in terms of honoring, under


48 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005 

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 

Arizona law, the school tax credit.


QUESTION:  We have that same problem in habeas


sometimes too when the State Supreme Court disagrees with


the Federal district court. 


MR. GODDARD:  Yes, Your Honor, but in the


situation in habeas, we don't have the Tax Injunction Act. 


We don't have a specific legislative bar that says there


will not be jurisdiction in the district court if there is


a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy at the State court.


And I believe that is -- it doesn't tolerate any -- any


degrees of variation.  As this Court has said, it's --


it's automatic.  There is -- it is -- there are no


exceptions.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: 


Thank you, General 

Goddard. 


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
