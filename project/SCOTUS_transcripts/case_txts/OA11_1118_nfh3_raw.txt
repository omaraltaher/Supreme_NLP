 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANE WEBRE 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 


 (11:05 a.m.) 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 


1
2
3
4  argument next this morning in Case Number 11-1118, 

5

10
11
 In Grable, this Court explained that 
12  "arising under" jurisdiction demands, not only a 
13  contested Federal issue, but a substantial one embedded 
14  in a State claim in order to indicate whether there is a 
15
16  jurisdiction over the State claim. 
17
18  because Minton -- Mr. Minton's claims do not present a 
19  substantial Federal issue, and exercising Federal 
20
21  like his, State legal malpractice claims would --
22
23  the experimental use -- whether that was a viable 
24  theory.  Why isn't that a substantial -- what do you 
25

jurisdiction over his claim and legal malpractice claims 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The question is whether 

serious Federal interest in exercising Federal 

 This Court should reverse the judgment below 

mean by, "substantial"?

 The question was did his fact-bound and 

experimental use doctrine work; how is it applied, what 

is not a substantial question because, first, from a --
a unique case perspective, it involved merely a 
hypothetical determination. 

 MS. WEBRE:  Well, Your Honor, defining 
1
2  substantiality is a difficult point.  I -- I would 
3  answer in two layers.  First, Mr. Minton's claim did not 
4  involve a legal question of does the -- how does the 
5
6  are its parameters? 
7
8  situation-specific affidavit present relevant evidence 
9  of the application here in this particular case.  And it 
10
11 
12 
13
14  would be at issue.  Those were already fully, finally, 
15
16  litigation in Federal court. 
17
18  standpoint, the -- the question of uniformity of patent 
19  law, any decision by a State court, in Mr. Minton's 
legal malpractice claim, would not be binding in any 
20
21  way, on either the PTO in a patent application, or on 
22  any subsequent Federal court deciding a real patent 
23  case. 
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you mean substantial 

beyond the -- the -- this particular case? 

 There were no actual patent rights that 

irrevocably determined in the underlying patent 

 And, second, from a jurisprudence 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MS. WEBRE:  Yes, Your Honor.  And I -- I 

 And, in the Grable case, this Court 

1
2  think that that's where the Federal circuit's 
3  jurisdictional -- the Federal circuit's "arising under" 
4  jurisdiction standard, which the Supreme Court of Texas 
applied here, that's exactly where it goes awry, is that 
5
6  the court improperly conflates the -- the question of 
7  necessity of a Federal issue with the question of 
8  whether that issue is substantial. 
9
emphasized that those are two separate issues.  There 
10
11  are four prongs to the Grable test.  The Federal issue 
12  embedded in the State claim must be necessary to the 
13  State claim; actually disputed; substantial; and then 
14  there is a federalism inquiry that exercised a Federal 
jurisdiction over this State claim can't upend the 
15
16  proper balance between State and Federal authority. 
17
18  just a year later, in the Empire HealthChoice case, Your 
19  Honor -- Justice Ginsburg, you wrote that opinion for 
20
21  "and here's how limited the Grable rule really is." 
22
23  distinguishes between Grable, which presented a merely 
24  pure question of law, and the claims at issue in Empire 
25

the Court, and that acted sort of as an underscoring of 

 The Grable court announced that, and then 

 The Empire HealthChoice opinion 

HealthChoice which were fact-bound and 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

And the -- the Court emphasized that, 

1  situation-specific.  It distinguished the -- the 
2  question of whether a State court is competent to apply 
3  Federal law to the extent relevant to the claims and 
4  found that, yes, it was. 
5
6  certainly, the State courts are going to be deciding the 
7  occasional Federal issue here and there, but let's not 
8  make a Federal case out of each and every State tort 
9  claim that might have an embedded Federal issue. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
 Now, that has been amended slightly.  It --
19
it, now, includes compulsory counterclaims where they 
20
21  didn't used to be a part, but the jurisdictional grant 
22  that Congress gave through the first sentence of 1338(a) 
23  uses the same exact phrase, the "arising under," "any 
24  civil action arising under Federal law." 
25

Now, in the earlier argument, there was some 
discussion of the fact that jurisdiction means a lot of 
different things in a lot of different contexts.  But, 
here, this Court has, on more than one occasion, 
determined that jurisdiction -- "arising under" 
jurisdiction means the same thing in 1331, the general 
Federal question jurisdictional grant, and 1338(a), 
the -- the exclusive provision that's applicable 
specifically to patents. 

And, Justice Scalia, you wrote the opinion 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

And to be --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why isn't that 

1  for the Court in the Holmes Group case and explained 
2  that the linguistic consistency between those two means 
3  that they mean the same thing. 
4
 There is nothing unique about this subject 
matter -- the patent subject matter, that changes the 
5
6  scope of the jurisdictional grant.  To be sure, the --
7  the grant of original jurisdiction to the district 
8  courts is exclusive, and that is different from the 
9  general Federal question. 
10
11
12  significant?  Doesn't that manifest Congress's view 
13  that -- that -- that this is -- that this is a 
14  complicated specialty area?  And so there would be, 
15
16  that involve a patent issue, in Federal court, rather 
17  than State court? 
18
19  Congress did that in a couple of different ways.  First 
of all, I think it begs the question -- it begs the --
20
21  the core question, to say that exclusive -- the fact 
22  that jurisdiction is exclusive answers the 
23  substantiality because, in order to get to exclusivity 
24  of the jurisdiction, you have to get to jurisdiction 
25

 MS. WEBRE:  Yes, Your Honor.  But the --

arguably, a special reason for having these cases, cases 

first. 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 You have to -- it has to be "arising under" 

than the general "arising under" standard. 

1
2  an act of Congress relating to patents before it can 
3  then be exclusive.  So -- so we still have the first 
4  step.  But, also, Congress did not cast the net broader 
5
6
 Even under the -- the statutory framework 
7  after the America Invents Act amendment -- under the 
8  statutory structure, there are still a number of patent 
9  issues -- legal issues that are going to be decided in 
the State courts that do not come within the exclusive 
10
11 
jurisdiction of the Federal courts.  For example, 
compulsory counterclaims, now, come within the exclusive 
12 
13 
jurisdiction, but permissive counterclaims don't. 
 Permissive counterclaims can certainly 
14
15
16  and, yet, those are excluded under the statutory scheme 
17  of 1338(a).  Patent issues raised as a defensive matter 
18  are not sufficient to support "arising under" 
19  jurisdiction under 1338(a).

courts. 

present just as substantive a question of patent law, 

 And I think it's interesting to -- to back 

up a little bit and look at the Federal circuit's 

So, certainly, Congress contemplated a

increased uniformity in the national law of patents." 

 And that was the view of the Federal 

1  evolved perception of its own exclusive jurisdiction. 
2  In the early years of the Federal circuit, in 1984, the 
3  first Chief Justice -- the first chief judge of the 
4  court, Chief Judge Markey, in the Atari case that is 
5
6  American Intellectual Property Lawyers Association, the 
7  Federal circuit wrote, "Congress was not concerned that 
8  an occasional patent law decision of a regional circuit 
9  court or of a State court would defeat its goal of 
10
11
12  circuit's own jurisdiction in 1984.  But, in the time 
13  evolved, the Federal circuit has changed its perception 
14  of its own jurisdiction, and that's why we are here 
15
16  and changed the standard that no longer follows what 
17  this Court articulated in Grable. 
 They -- they have improperly conflated the 
18
19  necessity and substantiality components of the -- of an 
appropriate Grable analysis.  And they totally disregard 
20
21  a proper balance of the State and Federal interests. 
22  The Federal circuit announced that there's an interest 
23  in -- Federal interest in uniformity of patent law, and 
24  then that was that.  That was the end of the inquiry. 
25

today, is, in 2007, the Federal circuit went awry and --

 In fact, in the month of December 2012, the 
23
24  Supreme Court of Texas heard argument in a case called

But, specifically, with regard to Mr. Minton's claim, 
one of his primary theories in -- in this case -- in the 
legal malpractice case, is that the attorney's error, 
with regard to bringing up the Experimental Use 
Doctrine, deprived him of the opportunity to make a 
lucrative settlement with the NASD in the underlying 
patent litigation. 

Elizondo v. Krist that addresses that precise issue. 

 Well, the question of exactly how you prove 

matter of tremendous dispute right now.  That is an 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Webre, is there any 

binding effect of a Federal determination here on State 
law?  And is there any binding effect of any State 
determination here on Federal law? 

1  How do you prove that NASDAQ would have paid him 
2  $100 million, if only these lawyers had raised this 
3  issue earlier? 
4
 And, yet, if this -- if Mr. Minton's claims 
are hailed into Federal court because of the fact-bound 
5
6  and situation-specific application of the Experimental 
7  Law Doctrine, the Federal courts would be Erie guessers 
8  as to that important issue that the State courts really 
9  need to resolve.

12 
13 
14
15
16 
17 
18

21
 MS. WEBRE:  In neither direction would any 
22  decision be binding.  The -- the State -- any decision 
23  in a State court on a legal malpractice matter regarding 
24  issues of patent law would not be binding in any way on 
the Federal courts or on the PTO in handling any of the 
25

State, would what the States say about -- about patent 
law be binding in any Federal cases?  And, vice-versa, 
if it went to the Federal jurisdiction, would anything 
that the Federal court says about -- about State tort 
law be binding on State courts? 

 MS. WEBRE:  No, Your Honor. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it was left to the

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that -- that being 

 MS. WEBRE:  You -- you are right that --

 I mean, they are not going to mess up Texas 

law in that regard.  They may get this case wrong, 

1  patent applications -- prosecution of patents. 
2
3  so, your -- your last argument about the Federal 
4  government messing up -- you know, State tort law in an 
area that -- that is currently very much in the fore in 
5
6  the -- in the decisions of the Texas Supreme Court, that 
7  doesn't really carry a lot of weight, except in this 
8  single case. 
9
10
11  but --
12
13  that it will not, substantially, adversely impact Texas 
14  State law, but that's an illustration of a substantial 
15
16
17  Grable because the -- the embedded issue in Grable that 
18  justified this Court reaching down and grabbing a State 
19  law claim and bringing it up into Federal courts wasn't 
20
21  construction of that statute was unresolved.  But that 
22  it needed resolving.  It needed resolving by a court 
23  whose decision could be precedential, so then it's 
24  resolved from then on. 
25

just that the issue was disputed, the -- the 

State interest. 

 And, in a way, it's akin to the issue in 

And so the -- the question of how do you

7  the application of these specific facts in this 
8  affidavit to the doctrine.  There's -- there's no

17  Doctrine applies. 
18
19  two cases? 
20
21

because the question isn't the -- the significance to 
the particular claim.  The question is the Federal 
issue.  Is there a --

weak argument; it's most unlikely it's not going to

 Any difference in the removability in those 

MS. WEBRE:  I don't believe so, Your Honor, 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MS. WEBRE:  Well, it's -- it's, perhaps, 

HealthChoice case, the -- the issues that the Court 
looked at -- one was the nature of the Federal -- of the 
Federal question itself -- the Federal issue, is it a 
constitutional issue? 

1  "substantial" Federal issue, then it's substantial in 
2  hypothetical B, but not in hypothetical A? 
3
4  more necessary.  But -- and maybe what I need to do is 
back up a little bit and discuss what I think are the 
5
6  factors for a court to look at, when deciding whether or 
7  not an embedded Federal issue is a substantial one. 
 And looking at this -- this Court's 
8
9  articulation in the Grable case and the Empire 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So does that mean that, 
if the claim in the malpractice action is that the PTO 
15
16  acted unconstitutionally -- assume that set of facts --
17  how does that change your analysis? 
 MS. WEBRE:  That -- that would be a more 
18
19  substantial Federal question than the one presented 
here, but I submit that it would not be sufficient to 
20
21  warrant "arising under" jurisdiction here because it 
22  is -- it involves only a hypothetical actual set of 
23  patent rights.  No judgment that can happen in a State 
24  legal malpractice case actually impacts any patent 
25

rights. 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Let's say Mr. Minton won a judgment from a 

 That doesn't give him a valid patent.  He 

look, look, I've got a patent.  And it's --

1
2  State legal malpractice court saying, it was the 
3  negligence, that you would have won the experimental use 
4  exception, your patent would have been declared valid. 
And so he has a judgment from a State court saying, 
5
6  the -- the loss of your patent was the result of the 
7  negligence and not because it was actually invalid. 
8
9  cannot take that judgment and then sue somebody and say, 
10
11
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So go back to -- you 
12  were going through a list of questions, and I posited 
13  let's assume that the malpractice claim does involve a 
14  constitutional question. 
15
16
17  factors --
18
19  continuum constitutional issues would be more 
20
21  substantial.  In fact, this Court grappled with that in 
22  the Grable case and said, we're not going to draw a hard 
23  and fast line on statutory issues. 
24
25

MS. WEBRE:  Yes.  So --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then what other 

substantial; statutory issues would be a little less 

 But then, in the Empire HealthChoice 

opinion, the Court noted that this is a -- the issue -­

 MS. WEBRE:  Well, the -- the -- in the

Alderson Reporting Company 

But, in -- in the resolution of the legal 

1  the Federal issue there was nonstatutory, and so, 
2  therefore, let's not make a Federal case out of it.  So, 
3  in that continuum, that would be one factor to look at. 
 Another factor to look at would be, is the 
4
5
6  uncertain?  Not necessarily the application of these 
7  particular facts to the legal issue because there really 
8  isn't a Federal interest in how this affidavit is 
9  construed or not.

18
19  all of these issues cut in your favor, in all cases 
20
21  that your client win here, but you want us to adopt a 
22  general rule that malpractice suits involving patent 
23  rights can never, ever come under "Federal arising" 
24  under jurisdiction. 
25

issues, as in Grable, is the question of law disputed or 
uncertain?  And the corollary to that is does it need 
resolving?  Because that was the situation in the Grable 
case.  But just because an issue is novel doesn't ipso 
facto make it a -- a substantial issue.

13  matter of res judicata or as a matter of issue

 One is that, as a starting point, the -- the

the benefits of having a -- a clear rule that doesn't 
have to be litigated in every -- every case outweigh the 
fact that one or two might -- might not come out that

 legal malpractice cases, in the wake of the Federal 
 circuit's opinions, the Air Measurement case and 
 Immunocept case in 2007, scores and scores and scores of 
 courts -- State and Federal courts have been grappling 
 with this precise jurisdictional issue. 

 I think this case is about the fifth or 

 sixth cert petition that came up to this Court on this 
 jurisdictional question.  I think there are three or 
 four behind us in queue, and there -- there continues to 
 be uncertainty in the lower courts on this precise 
 issue.

 a question of is "arising under" jurisdiction truly a 
 lenient standard, as the Federal court has articulated? 
 Now, it's true that the -- the entire body 

 of State law legal malpractice cases arising out of 
patent representation is not going to overwhelm the 
 Federal court.  It's not going to -- to --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So my question was even 

 broader.  Let's say we resolve legal malpractice. 
 Then -- then we will have products liability with a 
particular product, and then we will have some food and 
 agriculture cases.  It goes on and on. 

 MS. WEBRE:  Well, I think that is a -- that 

 is a -- that's a substantial issue.  But, like 
 Justice Scalia said, that -- you know, the -- this Court 
departed from Justice Holmes' construct some years ago. 
 But I think that there is the opportunity in this case 
 to provide a great deal of certainty, to provide 
 absolute certainty vis-à-vis legal malpractice cases 
 because of their unique hypothetical aspect.  The 
consequence of the judgment affects no rights. 

 But, second, in reaffirming --

 rearticulating the Grable test, emphasizing the 
 importance and the separateness of the substantiality 
 inquiry, emphasizing the importance of the federalism 
aspect, this Court has a great opportunity to resolve a

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. MICHEL 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR. MICHEL:  It is, Your Honor.  Thank you. 
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the 

 Court: 

 This case is about whether a State court has 

 subject matter jurisdiction over a State law patent 
 malpractice claim that rests entirely on an issue of 
patent law that is only heard in Federal court, and when 
 that issue is dispositive, central to the case, has 
 issues of first impression in them, has no State 
 analogue in any other area of the law, and whether in 
 the deciding issues of questions of law and will not 
disturb the balance between State and Federal judicial 
 responsibility. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about other areas of 
 exclusive Federal jurisdiction, where the claim, if you 
 are stating it initially, would have to go into Federal 
court and not State court, say, an antitrust claim, a

 Is -- is what you're saying about patents, 
 does that go for every area, where initial jurisdiction 
 is exclusively in the Federal court? 

MR. MICHEL:  No, Your Honor.  It does not. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then what's the 
 difference between, say, antitrust and patent? 

 MR. MICHEL:  There -- there are many 

 differences, Your Honor.  First, antitrust has -- has a 
State analogue.  The Texas Supreme Court in 
 Coca-Cola v. Harmer, 218 Southwest --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then take immigration 

 law. 

 MR. MICHEL:  Yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Don't get in the weeds. 

 Take immigration law. 

 MR. MICHEL:  Yes.  Now, once again, the 

 issues -- immigration law may be a -- a differing area 
 where there is exclusive Federal court jurisdiction in 
that area, possibly.  But, once again, the analysis and 
 the application in immigration law, from a malpractice 
 case, may give rise in that area. 

 However --

don't understand this.  Is it the case that there is

 "arising under" jurisdiction only when the Federal cause

 have exclusive jurisdiction? 

 MR. MICHEL:  That --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that -- is that the 

 rule? 

 MR. MICHEL:  I believe, in part. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, any -- any Federal 

 statute that can be sued upon, both in Federal courts 
and in State courts, but as to which Federal courts are 
 the dispositive adjudicators, you say that that does not 
 come within this "arising under" rule? 

 MR. MICHEL:  Does -- does not come within 
 this Court's doctrinal holdings in Grable and Empire 
because we have a Federal balancing and State balancing 
 issue.  And, as we've articulated, when Congress has 
 articulated --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have a case for 
 that, that says, if a suit could be brought in State 
court, even though it involves a dispositive Federal 
 question as to which this Court would be the -- you 
 know, the last interpreter, it cannot possibly come 
 within "arising under" jurisdiction? 

 Have you got a case for that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have a case which 
 says that, when a Federal question is presented in a 
 case over which Federal courts have jurisdiction, but 
also State courts have jurisdiction, although, needless 
 to say, the Federal courts would be dispositive on the 
 issue, such a case cannot come within the "arising 
 under" jurisdiction? 

 MR. MICHEL:  No, I don't think anything that 

expressly.  But the A&T and the --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would find it 
 extraordinary for -- for that to be the rule. 

 MR. MICHEL:  Well, you can't isolate it. 

 That rule is more complicated because it is the 
application of the Grable standard that's the analysis. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But getting back --

 Justice Ginsburg simply made the point, I had thought, 
 that you place a good deal of reliance on the fact that 
 there is exclusive jurisdiction.  And her question to me 
pointed out how far-reaching this case might be because 
 it -- it could involve patents, copyright, all other 
 areas of exclusive jurisdiction.  If that is going to be 
 your special rule, it's not so confined as you suggest. 

 That's all that question meant to me. 

Certainly -- certainly, you -- you could have cases

 where there is concurrent jurisdiction, 1983, in which 
 we'd have the same problem. 

 MR. MICHEL:  I think -- I think the factors 
 that go into determining the -- one of the grounds that 
has been articulated by Grable and the balancing for 
 Merrell Dow is the number of cases that would come into 
 Federal court, and it is a doctrinal decision.  It is a 
 doctrinal rule. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So patent law cases of 

malpractice are smaller in number than copyright 
 cases --

 MR. MICHEL:  Patent law cases --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR -- immigration, other 

 exclusive jurisdictions, so that's okay to -- to remove, 
but those others aren't? 

 MR. MICHEL:  Those --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does that make a whole 

 lot of sense? 

 MR. MICHEL:  That is the articulation in 

Grable, Your Honor.

 "substantial" as to how it affects Federal law, which I 
 think was the bottom line -- or the development of 
 Federal law, the bottom line of Grable. 

 And she says -- you dispute this in your 

brief -- that it doesn't affect the invalidated patent, 
 that there's no way that a judgment on the malpractice 
 is going to be used in a continuation patent dispute 
 because it's not one of the listed preclusive courts. 

 So how does a ruling affect patent law? 
MR. MICHEL:  Sure.  Many -- many ways, Your 

 Honor. 

 First, the test is uniformity, under Grable, 
 the uniformity of patent law -- Federal law, not whether 
 the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why is -- who's going to 

 follow it? 

 MR. MICHEL:  In many situations.  For 

 example, she -- she conflates -- Petitioners conflate, 
 res judicata with issue preclusion.  That goes back to 
your earlier question, Justice Sotomayor, and that issue 
 preclusion will have an effect.  And as, in fact --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Issue preclusion applies 

 only to someone who was a party. 

 MR. MICHEL:  Correct.  That would only apply 
to the inventor; it would not apply to the PTO.  It can

 only be used against, in this, case Mr. Minton.  And, in 
 fact, patent counsel in this case, under the rules of 
 the Federal circuit, under patent law and the Patent 
 Manual, disclosed the State court's rulings in this case 
to the Patent Office during its continuing patent.  The 
 State district court judge made a scope and claim 
 decision. 

 So, Justice Sotomayor, back to your 

 question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that, certainly, is 
 not binding.  The -- whatever the State -- whatever the 
 State court says, as a matter of patent law, has no 
 binding effect on that question coming into Federal 
 court. 

MR. MICHEL:  It does. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How? 
 MR. MICHEL:  Under this Court's decision 

 Marrese v. The Academy of Orthopedic Assertions --
 Surgeons, a State court's decision is entitled to issue 
preclusion, even in Federal forum.  And so that is 
 why -- also the patent -- the continuation patent 
 would -- could be declared invalid for failing to 
 disclose that information. 

 We are not saying it's binding on the PTO, 

but it is an issue of issue preclusion as against Minton

 that would be in front of the PTO and is in front of the 
 PTO, as we speak. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, is that -- my 

 goodness, but you are going to have a purely 
hypothetical State decision here.  The State will have 
 held that -- you know, if -- if he had said this, the 
 result would have been something else.  And you think 
 that that precludes the -- the issue when it arises in 
 real life? 

And you say, since the State court made that 
 hypothetical determination, it precludes me from arguing 
 it in -- in real life. 

 MR. MICHEL:  Yes.  It is a factor --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have any cases like 

that?  It seems, to me, a rather weird -- weird 
 situation.  I mean, maybe it could, but it -- it's 
 strange. 

 MR. MICHEL:  Well, it is a matter of issue 

 preclusion.  This Court -- that is the danger of 
allowing these patent law issues to proceed in State 
 court. 

 This Court -- the State district court in 

 this case entered in a brand-new issue of Federal –

 involves issues of first impression. 

 In this case, the State district court made 
 holdings about issues of whether the question of -- the 
experimental use exception is a question of law or a 
 question of fact. 

 It made the requirement that experimental 

 use had to go to a required claim element, as opposed to 
 a claimed element.  It made the determination -- and the 
Court of Appeals made the legal determination that 
 knowledge of the buyer is conclusive, rather than as a 
 factor.

 MR. MICHEL:  It's going to have a really 

 profound effect on the patent law practitioners who are 
 uniquely situated and work in parcel -- and interlocking 
with the Patent Law Office. 

 It is the patent lawyers who draft the 

 patents, it is the patent lawyers who present them to 
 the Patent Office, they are the ones who engage when 
 they need to be amended or refined or narrowed or 
broadened. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They knew -- they knew 
 these were controverted issues.  You say that they --
 they are controverted issues.  So they would have been 
 alerted to a problem anyway.  And they certainly would 
not accept a State court determination as authoritative 
 resolution of that problem. 

 MR. MICHEL:  The patent --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The patent attorneys.  I 

 mean, you --

MR. MICHEL:  No, the Patent Office will have 

 to take that as guidance because their new taskmaster 
 will not be -- be following Federal patent law because, 
 in this case, the Court injected a brand-new requirement 
 that was never held by a patent lawyer, that you had to

 That's never been held anywhere in Federal

 be looking to for guidance?  The exclusive Federal 
courts?  The Patent Office?  Guidance from the Federal 
 circuits? 

 No, they are going to have their backs 

 watched by the State courts, saying, uh-huh, you know 
 what?  I'm going to impose a new legal obligation on 
you, and you are going to be held for malpractice.  And 
 that's not -- that's not --

 would happen if that came up in an ordinary litigation 
 in Federal court, and the Federal circuit, ultimately, 
decided the question, that the State court was entirely 
 wrong about this; you don't need a witness. 

 Well, that's the end of it, right?  Once the 
 Federal court decides the question, then whatever the --
 the State judge thought was the Federal law is -- is 
gone.

 MR. MICHEL:  No, not contrary -- that was 
 the point I was going to make -- not contrary to the 
 holdings of the United States Supreme Court, contrary to 
 the Federal circuit's holding.  And, in fact, the Fort 
Worth Court of Appeals did not follow the Federal 
 circuit's holding in this area.

 Mr. Michel, that what -- what the State courts are going 
 to do is to say that, notwithstanding that the Federal 
circuit has ruled on a matter and notwithstanding that

 the Federal circuit, that, nonetheless, they will be 
 held to have committed malpractice because they didn't 
 comply with the State's rule? 

Is -- is that what you think the State 

 judges are really going to do? 

 MR. MICHEL:  I think the State judges are 

 going to try to, possibly, apply Federal circuit 
 holding.  In this case, they did not.  They injected a 
new holding, which established a new liability for the

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not -- it's 
 not -- I guess it's not their hypothetical law.  They 
 would be saying, this is what we think the Federal law 
requires, and while we're happy -- or not happy -- but 
 it's interesting that the Federal circuit thinks 
 something else, but that doesn't bind us. 

 MR. MICHEL:  Correct.  Correct.  And it's 
 not just hypothetical.  The hypothetical doesn't mean 
insubstantial.  The hypothetical doesn't mean --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is that worse than the 

 fact that, if it goes to Federal court, all of the 
 lawyers in the State, in all malpractice cases, are 
 going to be, supposedly, bound by the Federal court's 
holding as to State issues of malpractice? 

 I mean, it seems to me it's Twiddle Dum or 
 Twiddle Dee, whichever court system you go to, you are 
 going to terrorize the lawyers of that State on the 
 basis of an opinion of a court that is not dispositive 
on those issues. 

 So I don't -- I don't know why --
 MR. MICHEL:  I think we disagree.  Here, 

 when you try -- for example, in the patent infringement 
 case, the sole trial is going to be the patent 
infringement.

 You are going to try the Federal lawsuit, 

 Your Honor -- Justice Scalia, you are trying that patent 
 infringement lawsuit in State court, in the -- in the 
 case within the case analysis.  The Federal rules, 
that's what is so troubling about --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you -- you are trying 

 the malpractice lawsuit -- the State malpractice lawsuit, 
 in Federal court. 

 MR. MICHEL:  Correct.  But the application 
and the rules governing it are going to be by Federal 
 law.  The rules in this case -- in particular, the 
 substantial issue of the experimental use exception, the 
 only issue we’ve saved was the -- the experimental use 
 exception.  We disagree that just because the State 
court makes an opinion and a holding, it doesn't have 
 real-world effects.  It really does.  It's not an 
 advisory opinion. 

 And there needs to be a distinguishment 
 between the side issue the Petitioners are saying --
they are trying to get you focus on this one micro-issue 
 of whether it will affect an actual patent -- as to 
 whether it will affect patent law.  And it will affect 
 patent law, and it will affect the application of patent 
 law.  And so what you're going to have is you're going 
to have two diverging systems.

 You're going to have -- actually, you will 
 have one on the Federal side, and then you will have 50 
 jurisdictions espousing what they think the law is of 
 patent law and not being bound by the Federal circuit, 
which is going to --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Anytime -- anytime -- I 

 mean, a lot of patent questions -- as you already 
 pointed out, a lot of patent questions come up in State 
 court litigations, contract litigations, every time you 
have a patent question, then must the case go to the 
 Federal court, in your view? 

 MR. MICHEL:  No, that is not our position. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what is the dividing 

 line between patent questions that belong in State court 
and patent questions that belong only in Federal court? 

 MR. MICHEL:  For example, not every 

 malpractice case -- it will be the case within the case 
 doctrine in a patent case that will go to Federal court. 

 For example, failure to communicate a 

settlement offer does not have a case within the case. 
 In a business transaction, it doesn't have the case 
 within the case analysis. 

 So those malpractices arising from them will 
 not go to Federal court.  Breaches of fiduciary duty for 
divestiture of fees don't have the causation element.

 So we are --

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you are talking about a 

 case that has a patent issue, whether it's a contract 
 case, a tort case, a malpractice case -- if it has a 
patent issue, you think it has to go to Federal court? 

 MR. MICHEL:  We do not. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then I repeat Justice 
 Ginsburg's question, how do you decide which of those do 
 and which of those don't? 

MR. MICHEL:  I think this is a case in 

 point.  This case is on all fours with Grable.  There is 
 no exception.  The only distinguishing factor is this 
 hypothetical argument of the case within the case 
 analysis. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why don't you stay 

 within the lines that you give us?  You have said not 
 every patent question that comes up in a State court gets 
 dismissed, just so you can start over in Federal court, 
 what patent questions -- now, let's not talk about breach 
of fiduciary duty general questions -- what patent 
 questions are properly adjudicated in the State court 
 as part of a lawsuit that --

 MR. MICHEL:  Well, the -- the distinction 

 is, for example, in a licensing case, in a patent case, 
where you -- those cases are brought in Federal – I

 mean -- I'm sorry -- brought in State court -- our --
our request here is following Grable, that what will go 
to Federal court are legal malpractice cases arising 
from substantial issues of Federal patent law that have 
that case within the case analysis. 

And it's that narrow -- extremely narrow 
window of cases.  This is not, "Katie, bar the door." 
 We – we’ve set forth the empirical numbers.  They are 
going to be microscopic.  But what they do have is 
Grable's test.  Every element that Grable articulated, 
this case meets. 

 It does involve substantial issues of first 

 impression. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what was the 

substantial Federal matter in Grable? 

 MR. MICHEL:  The issue of the IRS, whether 

 personal service had to be given under an IRS --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  And that was going 
to control, the actions of the Federal agency, of IRS. 

MR. MICHEL:  Correct. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you have no 

counterpart for that here? 

MR. MICHEL:  We do have rules that will 

 govern the law on experimental use exception. 
GINSBURG:  You have -- you have --

 MR. MICHEL:  And that would govern the 

 application in Federal court.  That's why it should be 
 in Federal court, to govern how the agency -- and 
 whether a patent -- and this suit goes directly -- it 
affects patents.  This is going to patent validity. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the -- but the 
 Federal court -- you said before that whatever the 
 Federal circuit says, the State doesn't have to follow 
 it the next time there's a case in State court, but the 
Federal court is certainly not going to follow what the 
 State judge says on experimental use. 

 MR. MICHEL:  It does.  I will tell you --

 the reason why it does, it's in the doctrine of 
 collateral estoppel.  It affects the inventor.  It's 
affecting the inventor in this case.  This holding of 
 the State district court and the State court of appeals 
 are now before the Patent Office --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  How does 

 it -- the patent's invalid. 

MR. MICHEL:  I'm sorry? 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The patent's invalid. 

 Nothing the Court does here is going to change that 
 invalidity.  That -- that's what I don't understand. 

 MR. MICHEL:  Correct.

 his patent back from this action. 

Official 

 MR. MICHEL:  That's correct. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He's going to get money 

 for losing it, maybe. 

MR. MICHEL:  Correct. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how does it affect 

 the patent? 

 MR. MICHEL:  There is a pending continuation 

 patent.  And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We're back to that 

 issue.  Okay. 

 MR. MICHEL:  Yes, but that is a collateral 
 estoppel issue.  Here, let me -- let me give up another 
 scenario because, in a different role, when the patent 
is not declared invalid and, instead, there is a finding 
 of non-infringement, and that's what gives rise to the 
 legal malpractice case. 

 Then you go to State court, and, in that 

 situation, the determination of -- of infringement will 
be raised as a basis for legal malpractice against the 
 lawyer in the malpractice action.  Then the lawyers 
 raise, as within the case within the case exception, is 
 that, oh, the patent was invalid. 

 So, then, in that situation, a State 

district court will be rendering an opinion on a live

 patent, and then that will be binding on the inventor 
 and will affect real live actual patents, and it does 
 affect patents before the Patent Office. 

 Petitioner said we -- it's not an issue of 

res judicata.  They cite a rule.  That's not our 
 argument.  It's an issue of issue preclusion.  It's also 
 the duty and the obligation of the lawyer to disclose 
 that judicial discussion -- discussion to the Patent 
 Office. 

Otherwise his, continuation patent could be 

 declared invalid for inequitable conduct -- for not 
 disclosing material information. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And your -- your 

 distinction between other areas of Federal jurisdiction 
where the Federal law controls and patent is what? 
 What -- Justice Sotomayor brought up immigration law --

 MR. MICHEL:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- copyright law.  Why 
 don't they -- why doesn't what you said work the same 
way in those fields? 

 MR. MICHEL:  I think there are -- there are 
 distinctions in the area of patent law versus any other 
 area of the law namely because, as we get to the 
 State -- and this -- this goes to the analysis of the 
State/Federal balance.  That's why the exclusive Federal

 court jurisdiction. 

Official 

 That's why exclusive nationwide jurisdiction 

 in patent law in the Federal circuit is different than 
 any other area of the law.  It is that balancing test 
that we are required to engage in. 

 That's why it's unique from antitrust, 

 trademark, civil rights, securities, employment.  Those 
 have concurrent jurisdiction.  They may not have an 
 agency involved. 

For example, bankruptcy initially sounds 
 like it's exclusively Federal court issues, but, when 
 you look underneath the bankruptcy, there is core 
 proceedings, and there's non-core.  Non-core are 
 concurrent.  Those can be heard in State court. 
Secondly, those underlying issues in 

 bankruptcy, typically, involve State property right 
 issues anyway.  So they are really applying whether 
 somebody has a perfected security interest lien, whether 
 somebody has a justified debt, whether -- things of that 
nature. 

 So rather than in any other area of law, 

 these other areas, even if they are exclusive in Federal 
 court jurisdiction, some of those underlying issues are 
 basically based on who the party is. 

And they are still applying underlying

 State issues. 

Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So your case turns on 
 the -- the Federal circuit having exclusive appellate 
 jurisdiction? 

MR. MICHEL:  That is one of the most 
 defining factors on the State/Federal balance of 
 judicial responsibility.  Our understanding of that 
 analysis of the federalism and, also, the articulation 
 of -- just as we have showed up -- Petitioners said a 
whole ton of cases were going to come in. 

 We supported statistics that the numbers 

 will be very small.  But the distinguishing factor 
 because of the balancing test that we are required to --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, if there's a large 

Federal interest, I mean, that's what you're saying that 
 there is in the Federal/State balance -- the Federal 
 balance -- it's preponderant on the Federal side. 

 If there is that large Federal interest, is 
 it surprising that the government hasn't come into this 
case, if there's such a Federal interest to be 
 protected? 

 MR. MICHEL:  No, I think the Federal 

 government -- I can't -- I can't speculate to -- for 
 that, Justice Ginsburg.  There could be just many 
reasons why they didn't come in on this case, just like

 they don't come in on many other cases. 

 But the Federal interest here, in the 

 national uniformity, I think, has been well stated, both 
 by this Court and the Federal circuit. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's a difference 
 between you and your colleague on what "substantial" 
 means. 

 MR. MICHEL:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And she says it doesn't 

just mean necessary -- essential in this particular 
 litigation, but, as in the Grable case and the Kansas 
 City Title & Trust, has larger ramifications for many 
 other cases, not just this case and whether there's 
 going to be issue preclusion as to this particular 
inventor. 

 Those -- I don't see an issue in this case 

 comparable to those. 

 MR. MICHEL:  I think there are -- there are 
 a number of issues of -- of greater importance than just 
this case.  The question is the ongoing conflict in 
 Federal patent law on whether the experimental use 
 exception is a question of law or a question of fact. 
 The Federal circuit has gone both ways on 

 that, whether the issue of buyer knowledge is a 
conclusive factor or whether it is just one of 13

 factors. 

Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Whether they -- those 

 questions will come to the Federal circuit, and they'll 
 decide it, and then they'll be settled. 

MR. MICHEL:  Well, we would hope they would 

 be settled, but, then, we're going to have this whole 
 other body of law out there in State courts that aren't 
 bound by the Federal court to answer those questions. 
 And those will govern the practice of patent -- patent 
lawyers. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How likely is that, in 

 practice, that once the Federal circuit weighs in, that 
 the State judges will go their own way? 

 MR. MICHEL:  I think it's a very real 

possibility.  We've had --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, my -- my experience 
 is that Federal judges, including this Federal judge, 
 are not interested in -- in getting into the weeds of 
 patent law, and, if -- if they could rely on a decision 
of the Federal circuit, they would do that just as fast 
 as they can. 

 MR. MICHEL:  You -- you would -- you would 
 think so.  It doesn't appear to be the case because, in 
 this case, we had holdings that -- that experimental 
testing had to be on a required claim element.  There is

 also an issue in this case of whether you had to have an 
 expert witness testify to prove up the experimental use 
 exception, nowhere held in Federal law. 

 The problem is these judges often will have 
never handled a patent law in their career.  This will 
 go to some judges who have been in family law, got 
 elected at the district court, and will never have 
 decided or looked at a patent law case. 

 We're requesting --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would that be the same 

 thing for antitrust, be the same for copyright? 

 MR. MICHEL:  But the articulation isn't the 
 same.  There are other -- in antitrust, there are State 
 analogs.  The -- the judges are familiar with applying 
it.  In fact, the State of Texas, in Coca-Cola v. 
 Harmar, stated that there's a high interest in its own 
 State interest -- I mean, antitrust laws.  The same with 
 trademark, trademark is concurrent jurisdiction. 

 The limited area that applies these factors, 

going back to the balancing test, is extremely narrow. 
 Patent law is unique in that area of almost any other 
 area of law.  We think the Texas Supreme Court got this 
 decision right, and we request that the Court follow 
 Grable and apply Grable to the case at hand. 

            

Thank you.

 Ms. Webre, you have four minutes remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANE WEBRE 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Webre, can I ask you 

about the question presented? 

 The way you presented it to us, it -- it was 

 as though we're -- we're reviewing whether the Federal 
 circuit was right to reject Grable in -- in whatever the 
 names of those opinions are.  But.  In fact, that's not 
the situation at all. 

 The Texas Supreme Court here applied Grable, 
 and I think just the way you would want it applied.  So 
 your -- your contention is simply they didn't apply it 
 correctly; isn't that right? 

MS. WEBRE:  I disagree, Your Honor.  The 

 Texas Supreme Court didn't properly apply Grable.  What 
 they applied was the Federal circuit's improper 
 departure from Grable, in two ways. 

 One is they conflated necessity with 
substantiality, and that comes -- in the Federal 
 circuit's jurisprudence, that comes from a sound bite 
 from the earlier Christiansen case, where the -- the 
 line goes something like, "There is a substantial 
 Federal issue because it is necessary to the parties' 
claim."

 And so it conflates necessity with 

 substantiality, and the -- the Texas Supreme Court 
 followed the Federal circuit's construct.  They said, 
 we're applying Grable, we're looking at substantiality, 
but then they did exactly what the Federal circuit did. 

 And ditto with -- with the Federalism 
 balance.  They pointed to the needs of the Federal 
 interest in the uniformity of patent law, and that was 
 the end of the inquiry. 

And I think that that is a measure of the 
 deference that the Supreme Court of Texas -- as other 
 State courts would do, the deference they grant to the 
 Federal circuit in deciding the question of appropriate 
 scope of patent jurisprudence and the relative 
importance of the -- the uniformity of patent law. 

 And so we arrive to you from the Supreme 

 Court of Texas, but truly presenting the -- the 
 appropriateness of the Federal circuit's redone 
 application of the Grable test. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you answer the one 

 point your adversary raised that -- that gives me 
 pause -- a lot of pause. 

 He says a ruling on patent law of how you 

 should or should not behave in a State malpractice claim 
will affect all of the lawyers who practice in – in

 your State because each of them will have to do or not 
 do whatever that malpractice ruling was because that's 
 what the State is going to -- State courts will follow 
 in the future. 

So it will change those lawyers' behaviors 

 in Federal court. 

 MS. WEBRE:  Your Honor, I think that that is 

 such a speculative road to go down.  What is it the 
 lawyers are going to do different?  A lawyer --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They are going to 

 present an expert all of the time when they don't need 
 to. 

 MS. WEBRE:  They are -- they are going to do 

 some extra work and make an extra belt along with the 
suspenders that they are required to do. 

 And where is the harm in that?  And where is 
 the undermining of -- of the uniformity of patent law if 
 a lawyer in a-- in a real patent case in Federal 
 court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you can think of an 
 example where -- not perhaps on the facts of this case, 
 but where a State court's ruling could, in fact, 
 establish a -- a code of behavior that's not just belts 
 and suspenders, that's something else. 

MS. WEBRE:  Your Honor, I think that – that

 spinning out a hypothetical on that would be truly 
 speculative.  It's hard to imagine a situation where it 
 would be contrary or intentioned with what -- what the 
 Federal courts would hold, particularly since it's -- I 
agree with Justice Scalia's construct, that the State 
 courts are going to try to apply appropriate Federal 
 law --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about just 

 the -- just the flip side of this case?  Let's suppose 
they said, the one -- no, you don't need an expert.  So 
 it's not belt and suspenders; it's neither belt nor 
 suspenders. 

 That's going to affect the conduct of the 

 lawyers in the State in the way that would be disruptive 
of -- of the uniformity of Federal patent law. 

 MS. WEBRE:  If an expert is required under 
 Federal jurisprudence, then an expert is required in a 
 real patent case.  And if the State court makes the 
 mistake in -- in an occasional case here or there, then 
a lawyer practicing in a real patent case -- in a real 
 case in Federal court, needs to make sure that they are 
 complying with the requirements. 

 And -- and if you're going to – 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, right, the 

requirements of the Federal law.  The question is

 there's going to be a different interpretation of what 
 that means in the State court and in the Federal 
 circuit. 

 MS. WEBRE:  Well, Your Honor, if there is a 

conflict, then what you're supposed to follow is the 
 jurisprudence of the courts who -- before whom you are 
 practicing.  If -- if the Federal circuit or Federal 
 district court has something about patent law, then 
 that's what the lawyers should follow in prosecuting a 
patent case. 

 And a lawyer who decides, I'm going to 

 disregard the Federal circuit standards on fact 
 question, expert required, whatever it is, and, instead, 
 follow the Fort Worth court of appeals on this issue, I 
submit that -- that the lawyer does so at his peril, and 
 that doesn't undermine the appropriate uniformity of 
 patent law. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 The case is submitted. 
(Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the 

 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
