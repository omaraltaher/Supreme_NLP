ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. STETSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The exceptionally low Bell v. Hood pleading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard under which a plaintiff's claims will survive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long as they are not wholly insubstantial or frivolous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has no application in a Foreign Sovereign Immunities 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Act.  Subject matter jurisdiction bespeaks the court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

power to decide a case, and before a court in the United 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States may exercise that power over a foreign sovereign, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it needs to decide that that sovereign is not entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to immunity.  "Decide" comes from Section 1602 of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Title 28.  That phrase "not entitled to immunity comes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from Section 1330.  What that means in practice is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court has explained in Verlinden, which is that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court presented with a Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

claim against a sovereign must decide at this threshold 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the litigation, must satisfy itself that jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

exists. 

4 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I take it there will be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

instances, or there could be instances in which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court finds that there is jurisdiction, that there is no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity, and then as the case develops in the fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding stages that, you know, I've made a mistake; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's immunity here.  That could happen. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS. STETSON:  It could conceivably happen, 

  

 

 

 

 

Your Honor.  It generally does not happen for a couple 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  The first is that immunity is -- unless it is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pressed by the sovereign at the beginning, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered to be waived.  So in circumstances where a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign, for example, doesn't raise a factual 

   

 

 

 

 

16 

challenge --

 

17 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In my -- my hypothetical, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

it is raised; the judge rules against it, and especially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a case like this where there's, I think, a foreign 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

subsidiary that's incorporated in domestic --

 

 

 

 

 

domestically in Venezuela, then there might be questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the extent of overlapping management and so forth. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It seems to me that that might -- if there's an initial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding of no immunity, the judge might, in the course 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of hearing the case on the merits that, you know, really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

1 

there's immunity here.  That's -- that's possible. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. STETSON:  It's certainly possible.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

3 

4 

think the more problematic issue is what happened here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though, which is that the D.C. Circuit completed --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This is the opposite, 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

where they didn't know. 

 

 

 

7 

            

MS. STETSON:  That's -- that's precisely 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

right, that the D.C. Circuit here concluded that because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there might be not be immunity, what it said was at this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage of the litigation, it was permitting the claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against the sovereign to go forward. 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think -- I think what 

    

   

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

you have described sounds to me like the 12(b)(6) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard, that is have you stated a claim that would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitle you to relief under this statute.  So to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent that I comprehend your position, it's -- there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

no counterpart to 12(b)(1).  There's no discrete 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12(b)(1), 12(b)(6) standard.  It's one and the same. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's the 12(b)(6) standard. 

 

 

 

            

MS. STETSON:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

not -- I'm not sure that this case blends those two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards, and that's -- in that way.  Here's what I'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say.  With respect to a 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FSIA, what the court is required to do then is to turn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

to what this Court has described as all of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive, detailed Federal standards that are 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially baked into the jurisdictional standard 

 

 

 

 

 

itself.  So for purposes of establishing jurisdiction in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a FSIA case, you certainly would bring, and we did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring, that motion under section 12(b)(1).  But what you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do then is not just to apply this loose Bell v. Hood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  What you do is you apply the relevant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive Federal standards that are included in those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1

4

10 

jurisdictional provisions. 

 

11 

            

Now --

 

12 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And how did -- and how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

would that differ from a 12(b)(6) inquiry? 

   

 

 

 

 

14 

            

MS. STETSON:  It differs in a number of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

different respects, most importantly procedurally.  With 

  

 

 

 

 

respect to a 12(b)(6) inquiry, of course a sovereign who 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

loses a 12(b)(6) challenge wouldn't be entitled to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediate interlocutory appeal. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I was --

    

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't -- I don't quite 

    

   

 

 

 

understand that.  Why would that not be so?  If this 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity is analogous, for example, to absolute -- a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category of absolute immunity for a government official 

   

 

 

 

 

 

or qualified immunity for a government official, those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

are also immunities from suit; and therefore, under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

1 

collateral-order doctrine, an adverse ruling could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

appealed. 

3 

            

MS. STETSON:  True, but -- true, but --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

inasmuch as immunity is at stake, it -- it could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appealed.  But in a way, that proves our point rather 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

than the converse, which is if a right is so important 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it is entitled to -- the sovereign is entitled to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take an immediate appeal, it should be tested with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something other than the Bell v Hood standard. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

            

But more on point --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, no.  Because you could 

  

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

test -- you could determine jurisdiction under the Bell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v. Hood standard, and then you can move to dismiss the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint under 12(b)(6).  And if you're unsuccessful, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you could take appeal under the collateral-order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine.  Why doesn't that serve interest just as well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without producing some of the unfortunate -- arguably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfortunate collateral consequences of labeling this as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional, among which is the fact that this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have to decide all sorts of questions even if they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not contested by the parties? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. STETSON:  So two responses, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The first is, with respect to that last point, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions that the Court has to decide are the questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the sovereign asks it to decide.  It is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

1 

2 

sovereign's prerogative in an FSIA case to call either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the factual or the legal predicates into question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But what is the basis for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

that?  They're just -- you may waive immunity, but is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there a statutory provision that supports what you just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

said? 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

            

MS. STETSON:  Yes.  Section 1330. 

  

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And what does it say? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. STETSON:  It says that a court must 

   

  

 

 

 

 

decide whether the sovereign is not entitled to immunity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before jurisdiction can lie.  And that's one of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curious things about this --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wait.  Where does it say 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that in the text of the statute? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. STETSON:  In the last provision of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1330A, that place. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the section -- I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the question here is -- that seems right.  The question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is whether a sovereign is entitled to immunity, and I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess I -- I would ask you to look at the statute, and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to try to explain to me your reading of the language in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute.  So the statute says "a foreign state shall 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be immune... in any case... in which rights in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property taken in violation of international law are in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

issue."  Right? 

  

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 

            

Now, it seems to me that you are reading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

this statute as if it said that a foreign state shall 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be immune in any case in which rights and property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been taken in violation of international law.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other words, you're taking out the "are in issue" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language and suggesting that the question at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold is -- is -- is whether the rights and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property, in fact, have been taken, rather than whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are in dispute. 

 

 

 

10 

            

MS. STETSON:  Justice Kagan, I think the --

   

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

I think the answer has to do with that phrase "are in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue" that you've focused on.  For a right to be in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, it actually has to be a right.  And as we were 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explaining to the district court in the D.C. Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below, with respect to the parent company who is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff in this case, that parent company possesses no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  The right is not in issue if your right exists. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what -- what is left 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

to be in issue, if you've already decided that there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a right on property and it has -- and that it has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken in violation of international law? 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MS. STETSON:  With respect to a claim 

   

  

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

against a sovereign under that particular expropriation 

   

 

 

 

 

provision, depending on the nature of the claim, if it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grounded in a common law claim, there could be other

defenses that could be raised.  But if it's grounded as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this one was, which curiously, just tracks the language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the jurisdictional statute, "a taking in violation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international law," it is conceivable if you test kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the very end of that hypothetical, that you could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imagine a circumstance where the merits get bound up in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jurisdictional inquiry.  The problem with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's position on that, though, is this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already explained that that is okay.

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

missing what -- and maybe I'm just missing it.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- it seems it's a funny way of writing this if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're right.  If you're right, Congress should just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have said, well, a foreign State shall not be immune in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any case in which there's a right in property taken --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that has been taken in violation of international law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

What is the "are in issue" language doing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

except to say that the inquiry is whether there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute about whether there's a violation of 

   

 

 

 

 

20 

international law? 

 

21 

            

MS. STETSON:  So two things.  The first is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

for there to be a dispute, there has to be a right, and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it has to have been taken in violation of international 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  The problem with the Respondent's reading -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can see this at pages 3 and again at 18 and again at

24 of their brief, they insert the word "claim" at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, which of course, the statute doesn't -- doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

contain. 

4

meaningful to say that when a Bivens action is filed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with jurisdiction predicated on the arising under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, a constitutional right is in issue? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MS. STETSON:  It would certainly be 

  

 

 

 

 

reasonable to say that in the abstract, but here's --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's the problem with -- with engaging too much on, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, "are in issue."  We have explained why the right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must presently be in issue.  There must be a right. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

We've also explained why there has to be a "taken in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of international law."  For purposes of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

expropriation, that is a particularly important phrase. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The issue with reading Federal 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional statutes, as this Court explained just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last term in Manning, is that we're already, for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most part, past the point where we are heeling too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closely to the text.  We look at the dictates of reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and coherence and judicial policy. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this is a curious 

   

  

 

 

 

argument for you to be raising, because your prime --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your lead argument is that the text indisputably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supports your position, is it not? 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

1 

            

MS. STETSON:  Our lead argument certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

depends on the text.  But my point is the text is not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  You just -- you just said we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

shouldn't pay that much attention to what the text says. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

MS. STETSON:  Our text is not our only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

anchor, is my point.  The anchor is, if you get to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point where we are having this intense discussion about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"in issue" -- and this has actually come up before in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Alahi case.  There was a colloquy between the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

majority and the concurrence, and the concurring Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, it must be acknowledged that the words in issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't lend themselves to an interpretation that might be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

infallible. 

14 

            

So what you look at is the context from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

which that decision came. 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So how does it work with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

diversity?  We have a complaint; Petitioner or 

   

  

 

 

 

plaintiff, I'm from Kentucky.  Plaintiff, my defendant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is from Illinois.  Okay?  Filed.  Response:  Hey, I'm 

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

not from Illinois.  I'm from Kentucky too. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

All right.  How does the judge -- what does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

the judge do? 

 

 

23 

            

MS. STETSON:  The judge in a diversity case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

will look outside the pleading in that particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance, take evidence as to whether or not --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:  When?

JUSTICE BREYER:  When? 

  

 

MS. STETSON:  At the beginning.  At the

jurisdictional stage. 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  And --

MS. STETSON:  Under 12(b)(1). 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that's to determine if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there is jurisdiction? 

 

 

            

MS. STETSON:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And you're saying that 

  

 

 

 

 

should be the same here? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. STETSON:  I'm saying that it should be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same here, both with respect to the claim we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bringing right now, which is to the legal sufficiency of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the complaint:  Did that parent company have a right? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Was that Venezuelan subsidiary's company right taken in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of international law? 

 

 

 

            

That sufficiency of the pleading 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional challenge is quintessentially --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Your response to Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Breyer suggests that it's not only a question of legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiency -- and I think that the government 

   

 

 

 

 

 

specifically says this in its brief --

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

MS. STETSON:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that you would also have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

4 

5 

6

9 

a factual -- any factual disputes addressed at that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time.  So if there are factual disputes, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's -- there's a pleading.  It's -- it is legally 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient, but a defendant can come in and say, well, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it might be legally sufficient, but the facts are just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong.  And you would have that at the jurisdictional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage too; is that right? 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MS. STETSON:  We would indeed.  And in fact, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

the way that this particular set of circumstances came 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about, the parties agreed that in order to avoid what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might not be necessary, which was jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery, the parties would -- these defendants would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

front load the legal sufficiency questions before we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get to --

 

 

17 

            

18 

            

19 

I'm sorry. 

 

20 

            

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So if we take --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I'm going to ask you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Breyer. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I was thinking, I 

   

  

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

can't get my hands around this case, or my mind around 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, because it -- it seems to me it's really about a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical matter.  And the practical matter is when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should the judge in this kind of case decide whether or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

2 

not there really is a claim here, a legitimate claim 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

they can win on that falls within the category.  Rather 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

like diversity. 

 

4 

            

And the answer is, it's a foreign country, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

and sovereignty is at issue.  Do it as soon as you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in an ordinary case.  But if you have something special, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe you can't.  Judge, you run your own trial, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keep that in mind.  We don't want to have foreign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

countries in our courts when there isn't really a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty good case against them, and maybe a winning case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

So decide this thing quickly, decide it up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

front.  But to start talking about jurisdiction and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

these things, I can't really understand as well as, say, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg, who taught jurisdiction.  And -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- why are we in this?  Why don't we just give them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that practical advice? 

 

 

17 

            

MS. STETSON:  I think that the reason that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the practical advice might not be enough is -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another response to a question that Justice Alito posed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me earlier, which is for purposes of the FSIA, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a significant difference between a court exercising 

   

   

 

 

 

its power over a foreign sovereign, which is the nature 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of subject matter jurisdiction, and deciding whether it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can exercise that power over foreign sovereign. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What if the Court has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

decide whether it has jurisdiction? 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. STETSON:  It does indeed.  So for 

  

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

purposes of this, that means that the foreign sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can present itself to the court and can challenge, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's on the sufficiency of the pleadings or on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the facts, can challenge the basis for that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

jurisdiction. 

8 

            

And yes, there will be circumstances where a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

sovereign comes in and makes legal challenges, such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have made here, and factual challenges such as might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be made --

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It just seems a little 

   

  

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

bit like an academic exercise to me for the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason:  It appears to me -- and you're going to have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct me if I'm wrong -- that on the legal question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the sufficiency of the complaint, that the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court said, and the court of appeals approved the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding, that there was a sufficient allegations of fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to state a claim.  So I don't think that that ruling 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

depended on facts; it depended on a legal conclusion. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. STETSON:  Justice Sotomayor, that --

  

 

 

 

 

that is correct in this respect.  We decided, along with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the respondents, that we would back load any factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenges to jurisdiction.  So for example, the -- a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

typical factual challenge would be you've attempted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

sue me in U.S. court; I don't have a commercial nexus 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the U.S. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

These challenges, though -- and you can see

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

this best in the D.C. Circuit's panel opinion -- these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenges are challenges of law to the sufficiency of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the pleadings.  Does a parent company have a right in 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

its subsidiary's property that it can allege here?  Does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a subsidiary, a Venezuelan company, have a property that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

was taken in violation of international law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What the D.C. Circuit concluded in those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, and what the words it used at Joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix 183 were, "At this stage, those pleadings were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passable to get past the jurisdictional standards." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  What more do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you want?  I mean, it seems as if you're asking us for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an advisory opinion of what the Court's next step should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be with respect to what issues of discovery it should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have on other legal issues, not on this one.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already ruled that this complaint is sufficient as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of law, that this parent, under international 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law -- I'm not even questioning whether it's right or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong.  I know you say it's wrong and there's a serious 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue of whether it's right or wrong.  But are you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking us for an advisory opinion as to what the next 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

steps are for the court below? 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. STETSON:  I -- I agree with that, 

    

   

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor.  I'm not asking for an advisory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion at all.  In fact, what you just said about not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being sure whether it's right or wrong that the parent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company has a right, that's the problem.  The problem is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that when you're talking about jurisdiction at an FSIA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, you can't just decide that the plaintiff might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have stated a jurisdictional predicate.  You have to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

decide whether that right actually exists. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So what the D.C. Circuit did here, applying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that low Bell v. Hood standard, is to say there is no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent that completely and inexorably forecloses the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs from bringing this --

 

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Under the low Bell v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

Hood standard, as far as I know, and I think they would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be -- bears this out, it's not just 1331.  That's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general rule, that to get into court -- just to get your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

toe in the door, all you have to do is -- you don't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to show that you have stated a claim at that point.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just have to meet the threshold jurisdictional standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

It's -- it's just very strange.  Putting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

together everything you said, what I come out with is in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

19 

order to have jurisdiction, you have to prevail on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits, which is a -- a facts dispute.  They get 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

front-loaded, too.  So everything is decided under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

jurisdictional head. 

 

5 

            

MS. STETSON:  But Justice Ginsburg, the 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

solution, when it comes to preserving that foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign's dignity, is not to dilute the FSIA's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional standard.  It is, if necessary, to make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those merits determinations --

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The question is what is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

the standard? 

 

12 

            

13 

            

MS. STETSON:  The standard is --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it the standard that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

is -- is not this peculiar to 1331.  It is the general 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard for how you determine whether you have -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pass the 12(b)(1) threshold. 

 

 

 

17 

            

MS. STETSON:  But the standard is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

standard that this Court articulated in Verlinden, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that you look at the substantive jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards that are in the FSIA, and you decide whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not they have been satisfied.  Not whether they may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be satisfied, which is the Bell v. Hood frivolousness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D.C. circuit standard, but whether they have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied.  Was there a rate -- right?  Was it taken in 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of international law?  That is the difference 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

between hypothesizing jurisdiction and actually deciding 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

it. 

3 

            

4 

            

I'd like to reserve my time if I could. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

Ms. Goldenberg.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

          

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

               

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

9 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

11 

            

I'd like to start by talking about the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

that we read the text of this provision, because I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a little bit different than the way that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners read it, but not in a way that changes the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bottom line in this case. 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

So the statute says "Rights and property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

taken in violation of international law are an issue." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

What has to be an issue there are rights and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

property.  And as we know from this Court's decision in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Permanent Mission, that means that at the jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage, you have to figure out whether the kind of right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's being asserted falls within the federal law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of rights and property within the FSIA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you think it's -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

taken in violation of international law, and that's also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

1 

a predicate for what's in issue; is that right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't think that "in 

    

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

issue" actually applies to "taken in violation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international law."  I think that "taken in violation of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

international law" is describing and defining the kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of property that you have to be talking about in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

case. 

8 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess the question 

   

  

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

is, though, what's left to be in issue?  If you're right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the question of whether there is a right in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property is decided at the jurisdictional stage, both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law and fact, and if you are right that the question of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether that right in property has been taken in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of international law is also decided, both law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and fact, at the jurisdictional stage, then what is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, the in issue, that's left for the merits? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  So I disagree with part of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

what you said.  I do think that the question of whether 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property was taken in violation of international law is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something has to be decided at the jurisdictional stage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in law, where there's a challenge like there is here, or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in fact, if there's a factual challenge.  But with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

respect to rights and property, those can be an issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So I don't think you need to decide at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional stage whether or not the plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

1 

actually possesses the right that they claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

So, for instance, if you had a plaintiff who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

came in and said, I have a deed to this property and it 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was taken away from me, and the foreign State wanted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come back and say, no, you don't, this deed is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forgery, you never had any relationship to this property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all, that would be in issue and that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that could be decided at the merits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

The rights and property question that has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

be decided at the jurisdictional stage is the one that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court decided in Permanent Mission, which is, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this right that's being asserted here something that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

falls within the definition of rights and property that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FSIA put forward?  And so in Permanent Mission, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question was:  Is this asserted-lien right a right in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

property, even though it's not a right to possession of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the property or to ownership of the property --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm not 

    

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

understanding the distinction.  Could you -- in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, what would be the first question that would be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold question as to a right in property, and what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be the question that would get diverted to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

merit stage? 

 

24 

25 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  In this case, I think the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question mainly is the question about whether what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

being asserted is a right in property.  Here, it's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of whether a shareholder's rights in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

company that they own shares in are something that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights in the property of that subsidiary company, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company that the shareholder has some corporate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ownership interest in.  And that is a legal question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that could be answered at the jurisdictional stage.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, we don't know the answer to that question, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all the --

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And what's the question that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

would be answered at the merit stage? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  The question that would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

answered at the merit stage here, I don't think there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually would be much dispute on the merits.  But, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance, in a case like this, you could have a dispute 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about whether the plaintiff was actually a shareholder 

   

 

 

 

 

 

or was not a shareholder.  Or in the example I gave 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

before, which I think would be the more common 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation, whether the person actually had a deed to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that property, or whether they didn't have a deed. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, but they --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You're -- actually, I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

getting pushed the other way.  I came in on your side, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but I swing back and forth. 

   

 

 

 

25 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Oh, dear. 

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

1 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But this is what's really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

bothering me:  It sounds, the more I hear you speak, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there isn't a good thing that we're going to write 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case that isn't going to get everybody good and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed up, because it reminds me of a case where we set a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of order of battle, as first you have to decide the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, and then you decide this.  And I've never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received so much criticism from the district judges as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for that case. 

 

 

10 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, also --

  

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because they tell us that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cases differ a lot one from the other.  Let us do what's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical in the circumstances. 

 

 

 

            

There are three kinds of issues that can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come up.  There's a set of facts.  Those facts might be 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in dispute.  If you find one way, there is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  Find the other way, there isn't. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

There is a second kind of issue:  that we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

take the facts as given.  Do they, in fact, fall within 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the definition of this statute?  And that can even exist 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a diversity case.  Somebody's from Guam or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

somebody -- you know, that's the kind of -- does it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really fall within, or is it just possible that it falls 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within Federal law arising under diversity or this? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then there's the third kind of case: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

25 

1 

2 

Are you so far out that it isn't even hopeful that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could get into the court on this? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

Now, if you take the third, which is where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

we are, you leave it up to the district judge to decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other two when and if it's most suitable in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  If you don't, I'm worried. 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  But in that circumstance, 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

you are asserting jurisdiction over a foreign State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

based on a nonfrivolous allegation, and that is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

something that doesn't respect the foreign State's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

dignity --

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because you are, in fact, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

asserting jurisdiction over somebody who's from Guam. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because, in fact, you'd have to go into the birth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions and all kinds of things.  The judge wants to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put that off for a while because of other things that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might dispose of the case. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Understood.  But this is a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

special context in which there is a real dignitary harm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the foreign State if the courts of another country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sit in judgment as to something that foreign State --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But how often -- how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

often is that a serious concern?  I mean, I understand 

    

   

   

 

 

 

that the reason you're concerned is that you don't want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a reciprocal burden imposed on the United States when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

it's haled into court in a foreign country.  But does it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really make a difference to a foreign sovereign whether 

   

   

 

 

 

 

it litigates these issues under 12(b)(1), as opposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

12(b)(6)? 

5 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  It does make a difference 

   

  

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

to the foreign sovereign for the reason that I gave.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes a difference to the United States when we're sued 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in other courts, whether there's a dispute at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional stage or later --

 

 

 

 

10 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But why is that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

Why is that such a significant issue? 

   

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, as I said, there is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

something that is a real affront to a foreign sovereign, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

or can be an affront to a foreign sovereign if another 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court sits in judgment of something that foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign has done.  And I think that's --

   

  

 

 

 

 

17 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's going to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

sitting -- it's going to be sitting in judgment, one way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or another.  It's just a question whether it's in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6). 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I can't believe it 

    

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

makes a difference when the ambassador from whatever 

   

 

 

 

 

 

country calls home and says, well, I've got bad news, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're being sued in Federal court.  But don't worry, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

it's only under 12(b)(1), not 12(b)(6). 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  It does make a difference. 

   

  

 

 

 

3 

4

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

And I think it's particularly sensitive with respect to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the expropriation exception, actually.  And that's why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

taking in violation of international law is such a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical threshold issue that has to be decided at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional stage --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there a difference in 

   

  

 

 

 

expropriation and conversion? 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I do think it's an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

important point that here, the underlying cause of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action could be conversion, if someone brought that kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of cause of auction which wouldn't overlap exactly with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jurisdictional determination here.  You would still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have to allege the jurisdictional prerequisites were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

met, the jurisdictional requirements of the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In an expropriation case --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Tell us when the 

  

 

 

 

 

government arrives at this position, because you know we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an amicus brief, people. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you just finish? 

  

 

 

 

 

Expropriation is different because? 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Expropriation is different 

  

 

 

 

because this is a public act of a foreign sovereign 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

taken in its own territory with respect to property in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

28 

its own territory.  And that is something that, in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normal course, is going to be a matter for the courts in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that territory to resolve. 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

The very thing that makes it appropriate for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the courts of another country to sit in judgment on that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of act is that there has been a violation of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international law.  And then you look at the nexus 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements in the expropriation exception, and those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show that the property has some connection to the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States, which makes it appropriate for United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts to sit in judgment. 

 

 

 

 

            

And there actually have been real problems, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real sensitivities, real foreign relations concerns that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been raised in this area, stemming from the D.C. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's 2008 decision in the Chabad case, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the D.C. Circuit first announced the rule that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're considering here.  That's an expropriation case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

against Russia.  The D.C. Circuit decided there was a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonfrivolous allegation that the property had been taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in violation of international law. 

 

 

 

 

            

At that point, Russia, feeling that it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immune and it hadn't gotten a full determination of its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity, dropped out of the case, and the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court started imposing sanctions of $50,000 a day.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

response, Russia initiated an expropriation action 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

1 

2 

against us in Moscow and started imposing $50,000-a-day 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanctions on the United States. 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

So that could happen -- something like that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

could conceivably happen, even under the standard that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're talking about, that a foreign state could take 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense.  But this is a very sensitive issue.  And there 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

are real concerns here. 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Jurisdiction in the case 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

of Bank Markazi.  When the court issued its decision in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that case, Iran filed a suit against the United States 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the World Court. 

 

 

 

12 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  There are real reciprocity 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

concerns in this area.  And I think Congress was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

cognizant of those.  That's part of the purposes of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FSIA.  And so that is the reason why the taking in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of international law, the words "in issue" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't apply to that.  It doesn't say whether it is in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue that the property was taken in violation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

international law. 

 

20 

            

21 

            

22 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then can you --

  

 

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  The question is --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then can you -- I read 

   

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

the dark green brief.  It states a strong case in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposition to the position you're presenting by people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who were once part of the government.  So I would like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

1 

2 

to know when the position that you're now taking, when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did that become the government's position? 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't know that I can 

    

   

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

specify a date, but I think it has always been the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's position and the State Department's 

 

 

 

 

 

position that the actual requirements of the exceptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to immunity need to be satisfied at the threshold, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this court said in Verlinden; otherwise, the grant of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity becomes much less meaningful to the foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

state. 

11 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Are you 

  

  

 

 

 

12 

arguing -- what's important?  A 12(b)(6) --

    

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  No.  I --

    

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- standard, or are you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

in agreement with the Petitioner that all of the factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputes have to be decided?  You seem to be saying no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the second. 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  The factual disputes with 

  

 

 

 

 

respect to whether the property has been taken in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of international law --

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 

  

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- if there are any, and if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

the foreign State chooses to raise those factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputes, do need to be decided so that you can figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out whether you have the right kind of property in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

case. 

2 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

            

Ms. Carroll. 

 

4 

         

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE M.A. CARROLL 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

             

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

please the Court: 

 

 

8 

            

The jurisdictional test under the 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

expropriation exception turns on what is, quote, "in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue" in the suit.  In other words, what is the dispute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

about? 

12 

13 

14 

15 

            

That language contrasts starkly with 

 

 

 

 

language that Congress used in an analogous provision of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FSIA Section 1610(a)(3).  And, Justice Kagan, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes to your earlier discussion regarding the meaning of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

"in issue." 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Section 1610(a)(3), which is reprinted at 

 

 

 

 

 

page 28 of the Addendum to the blue brief, Section 1610 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the section that governs immunity from attachment and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

execution, and it includes a provision for expropriation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  That language says there's -- that there's an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception to immunity where there's been a judgment, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

quote, establishing that "rights in property," quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been "taken in violation of international law." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So when Congress wanted to make the fact of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

a taking in violation of international law a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional fact that must be resolved at the outset, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it knew how to say that, and it used those words in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

1610. 

5 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's not the 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

outset.  That's a question of execution of a judgment 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that's already been in place. 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

This is the issue we're talking about here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

is sort of the commencement of -- of litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MS. CARROLL:  That's correct.  And Congress 

  

  

 

 

 

11 

used very different language in 1605(a)(3). 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you saying that 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

immunity issues are not generally jurisdictional? 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

opposite. 

16 

            

MS. CARROLL:  No, we are saying the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Immunity issues generally 

  

 

 

 

17 

are jurisdictional, are they not? 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Exactly.  The subject matter 

  

  

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

of the court turns on the immunity standard.  They are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one in the same standard, and that's why all of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court's body of jurisprudence on what does it mean for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court to have jurisdiction over a particular subject 

   

 

 

 

 

 

matter are relevant here in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

To be sure, there are some kinds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

jurisdictional inquiries such as citizenship of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

parties in a diversity case; for example, where the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts have to be established at the outset. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you say that for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

commercial nexus, right? 

 

 

5 

            

6 

nexus --

 

7 

            

8 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Exactly.  The commercial 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So what is the difference? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. CARROLL:  The difference here is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

other kinds of jurisdictional provisions don't require 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the establishment of a fact.  They simply require that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the plaintiff has asserted a particular type of claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

We think the language --

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  In other words, you're 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

saying the commercial nexus language, you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish the fact early on --

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. CARROLL:  You have to -- yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- at the jurisdictional 

  

 

 

 

 

phrase because of the way that's written in the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Yes.  Correct. 

  

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because it doesn't have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

language. 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. CARROLL:  And -- correct.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

correct, and I want to be very clear.  The -- there was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a reference earlier that our -- our position suggests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a court has to decide whether there might or might 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

1 

2 

not be immunity.  We don't think that's correct, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's not the position we've asserted. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

The Court certainly does, must, assure 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

itself at the outset that an exception applies.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is, what is the standard that defines --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  And the 

  

  

 

 

 

other -- the other statutes you're talking about and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ones set forth in your red brief just seem to me to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoid the question, which is whether there's a different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach in the foreign sovereign immunity. 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

Our ambassadors have to go to these other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

countries and say -- or their ambassadors, you're being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued.  You have to come into our courts, even though 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're a sovereign.  And we don't want you dragging us 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

into your courts, but you have to come in our courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because someone has raised a claim that is not wholly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insubstantial or frivolous.  That's a very low standard 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in that context. 

 

 

19 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Mr. Chief Justice, the 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Petitioners and the government have cited no other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign immunity context in which the standard they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are proposing applies.  To the contrary, as we noted in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our brief in suits under the Tucker Act, Bell v. Hood is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the applicable standard.  The Petitioners cited Land v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dollar in their reply brief.  Just two years after that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

1 

decision in the Larson case, this Court held that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

about the United States sovereign immunity --

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

5 

            

MS. CARROLL:  That --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- in -- in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

United States courts? 

 

 

7 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Exactly.  Where the court held 

  

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

that Bell v. Hood was the applicable standard.  So the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is why in this one particular area alone would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress have written a standard that departs from how 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional inquiries are determined in every other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context including --

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because there's extreme 

  

 

 

 

14 

sensitivity with reference to suing foreign sovereigns. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Well, I appreciate that 

   

  

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

question because I think it calls out the implications 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the position being advanced by Petitioners and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States.  Because of the mini trial that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires at the outset on the question whether this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign has violated international law, under their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view, if, as is the case here, the defendants are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asserting other merits-based legal defenses to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim, for example, a defense under the act of State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine, the court cannot get to those defenses until 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it has decided whether there's been a taking in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

violation of international law.  The implications of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that are -- I think speak for themselves. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

When a court has to say, first, I have to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

decide has there been a taking in violation of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

international law, I think, yes, this sovereign has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

violated international law.  Now I have jurisdiction to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

consider whether under the act of State doctrine it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not appropriate for me to inquire into the validity of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the foreign sovereign's actions.  That makes no sense. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

Under our view and under the application of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

Bell v. Hood in any other jurisdictional context, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign defendant --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Why does 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that make no sense?  I mean, you -- you establish 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, and there's an additional defense.  Other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

than that, there's no jurisdiction.  I don't see why --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Well, from the -- from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

perspective of protecting the dignity and comity of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign sovereign that has taken U.S.-owned property in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of international law, to say that the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision a court must make is to label the defendant, if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the claim holds up, a -- a violator of international law 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

before it can consider any other defenses that might not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require that determination I think is not consonant with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a view that protects the dignity of the sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

defendant. 

2 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Carroll, I -- though I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

have a good deal of sympathy with the way you read the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language, but it does seem to me it gets you into one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

big problem. 

 

6 

            

 

So, you know, take a case where there is an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

arguable claim that there's been a violation of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

international law, so you would satisfy the Bell v. Hood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard, but then the actual claim that's being made is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just a straight conversion claim.  So you've -- you've 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

gotten to the merits, but in the merits stage all you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about is this conversion claim.  And so you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be adjudicated guilty even though nobody has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided, in fact, whether you violated international 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  And that seems as though it cannot be right. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Well, I -- I think it probably 

   

   

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

can't be right, but the reason that it's not right has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing to do with whether Bell applies. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

Under our view of this statute, Congress and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the executive were reacting to a very specific set of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems, and they adopted a very specific solution. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

They were looking at the Cuban expropriations and other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notorious expropriations of property that were affecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S. interests where sovereigns were using those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expropriations to gain an unfair advantage in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

commercial marketplace.  And they wrote a statute that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

said, we want the courthouse doors to be open to those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of claims; a claim of a taking in violation of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

international law, or a tort claim, the gravamen of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is an assertion that the defendant violated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international law or the defendant's title is no good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the property was taken in violation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international law.  All those are within the scope.

10 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you -- sorry, I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS. CARROLL:  Sorry.  A suit that does not 

    

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

actually press a claim of seeking a remedy for a taking 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

in violation of international law we think should not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought under this statute.  This is not the tort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

exception. 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I see.  So you think that's 

    

  

 

 

 

 

necessarily a merits issue. 

   

 

            

MS. CARROLL:  We do.  Whereas I -- I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

understand the Petitioner's and the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

position to be that this is simply a jurisdictional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact.  So long as the plaintiff can show that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property was taken at some point by someone from someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in violation of international law, that opens the door 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to any kind of claim at all so long as it somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

implicates --

 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know that that's a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

1 

2 

3 

4 

different issue, I think.  Suppose in a diversity case, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

A says, I'm from Kentucky.  And B says -- and he says B 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is from Illinois.  B files an answer:  No, I'm from 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kentucky.  No diversity. 

  

 

5 

            

Doesn't the judge normally make that 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

determination right then and there? 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Yes, with respect --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then why should it be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

any different here? 

 

 

10 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Because this is not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

jurisdictional fact like the citizenship of the parties. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

It's a --

   

13 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, so what?  I mean, the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

reason you do make that right at the beginning, I have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always thought, was not a mystical thing.  It's because 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you don't want to haul somebody across the country in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different places when there isn't even diversity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

jurisdiction. 

19 

            

Here, though, the reasoning isn't quite the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

same.  They say, try it out at the beginning whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is at least a claim here, real claim, that they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did seize the violation -- they did seize the property, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of international law.  That way we don't bring 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

China or someplace all the way over to the United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and cause all kinds of problems without there really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40

2 

being something.  So do it at the beginning, Judge, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't wait till the end of the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Justice Breyer, Rule 12(b)(6) 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

exists for precisely that purpose, and nothing would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have prevented these defendants from proceeding on --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So what difference 

  

  

 

 

 

7 

does it make?  And here I'm --

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- I'm not asking an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

argumentative question.  I don't know. 

    

 

 

            

What difference does it make whether you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

move under 12(b)(6) or move under 12(b)(1)? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. CARROLL:  I think probably the only 

    

 

 

 

 

significant difference it makes is the difference that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito referred to earlier, which is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implications of taking merits issues and calling them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional, and those implications are at least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

among the following: 

 

 

            

Number one, the arguments can't be weighed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms. Stetson is relying on a -- a version of the waiver 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine that although we as plaintiffs in an FSIA case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be happy with, is not how courts have applied it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not how they've asserted it below.  If the sovereign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is asserting its immunity, then the court cannot find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that immunity has been waived.  It must find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

1 

jurisdiction under another provision. 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do we have to -- can we say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

that -- can we just say -- can we say, look, I guess we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't, but -- but I don't care whether it's 12(b)(1) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or 12(b)(6).  Judge, what you ought to do in such a case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is try out right at the beginning of the case if it's at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all possible whether you have a basis here, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff, for getting this foreign country into our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

courts. 

10 

            

MS. CARROLL:  But the consequence of calling 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

it 12(b)(1) is that it is treated as a subject matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction question.  That means serial interlocutory 

  

 

 

 

 

appeals over every new statutory theory -- even if we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just looking at legal sufficiency, defendants can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serially raise new statutory arguments that then go up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

and down. 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's go back to Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

Alito's question. 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

Why I'm confused by this case is I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

both the State Department and your adversary are upset 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the court found that there was a viable legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument that a parent could have property interests in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- in the possessions of a subsidiary. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

            

Is that your understanding? 

 

 

 

MS. CARROLL:  With respect, I -- well, I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

don't have an understanding about the motivations of why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are upset. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I agree. 

    

 

MS. CARROLL:  But with respect -- with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

respect to what the dispute is in the case, what their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal challenge is to the parent's claim, is not about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the character of the rights as rights in property.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments that were made and decided below were the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following:  The defendants contended that the only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

property that was taken was property belonging to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidiary.  The parent doesn't have standing to assert 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those rights.  The parent does have its own rights, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, they own shares in the subsidiary.  Their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

position was not that those rights are not property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights, but that those rights were not taken. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

So there was no dispute about whether those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

rights at issue are quote/unquote property rights.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute is do these two plaintiffs, can they proceed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring a claim of a violation of international law as a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

result of the uncompensated, discriminatory taking of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their property.  That is a merits question.  And the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

Court has made clear that in jurisdictional statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that turn on the nature of the claim, rather than a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual showing, Bell v. Hood is the governing standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across those contexts, even when sovereign immunity --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

1 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  The basis of that, what do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

you think you would have to prove?  That property was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken on the merits, property was taken in violation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a customary international law standard, or that having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established that as the jurisdictional predicate, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was a conversion under the law of whatever 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction is chosen? 

 

 

8 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Our claim is a claim for a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

taking violation of international law, which has long 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized that expropriation must be compensated, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must be for a public purpose, and they cannot be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrary and discriminatory.  Those are 

  

 

 

 

well-established principles of international law. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Property of a 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

domestic citizen? 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Our argument on that issue is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Venezuelan incorporation of the subsidiary does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not bar the claim in a situation where the foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign itself deemed that subsidiary to be a foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

company, treated it that way, and took its property on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that purpose.  The -- the court of appeals looked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closely at that issue.  It said the only cases we can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find -- there aren't very many, but the ones that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out there support this claim.  The restatement and other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commentary support this claim.  And Petitioners, quote, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

1 

have cited no other contrary authority that forecloses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

the claim. 

 

3 

            

They took a close look at it.  If 

   

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

Petitioners wanted to proceed right away to a 12(b)(6) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination, they could have chosen to do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instead, they wanted --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Took a close look at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

it?  It was -- I thought it was under the Bell v. Hood

standard.

Hood, but I would submit that the analysis that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court adopted, I think going back to Justice Sotomayor's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier observation, was a -- a fairly robust 

   

   

 

 

 

determination.  And --

  

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And we did -- we -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did say -- I forgot the name of the case -- that if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a 12(b)(1) question and a 12(b)(6), and you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

think the 12(b)(6) is easy, you still have to decide the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12(b)(1) first.  So you can't substitute the 12(b)(6) as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- has a claim been stated for 12(b)(1).  You have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have the jurisdiction decided first. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. CARROLL:  That's -- that's the holding 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of Your Honor's opinions for the Court in Sinochem and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rudolph, following up on Steel Co.  And what those cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize, fundamentally, is that determining the legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

45 

sufficiency of allegations, even forgetting resolving 

 

 

 

 

 

factual disputes, which Ms. Goldenberg and Ms. Stetson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both conceded would have to be resolved at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold.  But this Court has said, resolving those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of claims, even when limited to legal sufficiency, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, itself, an exercise of jurisdiction.  In the -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court's words, it's vital to establish jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first before getting to those issues.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And if I could go back to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

Justice Breyer's question.  I hate to ask you to repeat 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yourself, but if I could understand your -- your view of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why it matters, is one 12(b)(1) motions, it's -- it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not clear whether one can waive defenses?  And what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

else? 

15 

            

MS. CARROLL:  So there's the waiver issue, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

which is the sort of the opportunity for the defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to continually come up with new theories.  Which has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred in this case when we went back down to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court on remand from the district court, new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional arguments were made at that time that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hadn't been made previously.  There's the court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

obligation to consider issues sua sponte.  This goes to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction.  And as the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court observed in Verlinden, when there has not been a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waiver of sovereign immunity, the court must assure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

46 

itself that one of the other exceptions applies.  And to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that when there are arguments that have been made by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the sovereign, or even when there are just doubts in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, the court must resolve those, because it goes to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

subject-matter jurisdiction. 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

            

 

All of those issues then become the subject, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially, of interlocutory appeal.  And so you end up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a system where these issues are raised, legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues going to the merits, but their whole ball of wax 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is now being put into the jurisdictional determination, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going up and down, back and forth between the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court and the circuit.  I really am not sure how that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serves the sovereign's interests when it means that all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that has to be done before we can get to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straightforward legal merits determinations that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court could decide once it concludes that it has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

jurisdiction. 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

And I suspect it's for that reason that when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress wrote this language, even though the Bell v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hood standard had been long established, far before the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FSIA was written, Congress didn't write anything in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute to suggest, we want this one kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination, and this one determination only, to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done in a way that differs from how any other kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional determination of this type is made.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's always a little

difficult for one party to tell the other party it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't really know its best interests, which is what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're saying.  And -- but -- but isn't, part of it is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Venezuela said, we don't want to be labeled as violator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of international law?

MS. CARROLL:  I'm -- I'm sure that they

24

don't.  I'm tempted to say a lot of things in response 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to that, but I think the -- the most straightforward 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response is that the Bell v. Hood standard is the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, I think, is best addressed to that concern, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because rather than requiring the full-up adjudication 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this defendant's status as a violator of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

international law, it simply applies the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional determinations that apply in suits in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States under the Tucker Act, and says, now that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've assured ourself of jurisdiction, what 12(b)(6) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments would the defendant like to make? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What discovery would you 

  

 

 

 

 

need if they brought this as a 12(b)(6)?  If they came 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in and said, there is no customary international 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property right of a parent in a subsidiary's property? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

What discovery would you be entitled to if they took --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they brought a 12(b)(6) motion?

the discovery necessary under the commercial nexus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements, and the discovery necessary to show a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of international law. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm asking a different 

   

  

 

 

question.  What discovery would you seek, or would you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be entitled to have, on what disputed issues of fact to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine the legal question? 

 

 

 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Well, the defendants have 

  

 

 

 

 

never moved under Rule 12(b)(6). 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I understand. 

    

 

            

MS. CARROLL:  So I'm not sure what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguments, specifically, they would make.  If they were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

making factual arguments --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's the one that they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

proposed to the district court, which was whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

H&P-IDC has standing to assert a taking in violation of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international law on the issue of Venezuela's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expropriation of H&P-V's property. 

 

 

 

            

MS. CARROLL:  So that argument was framed as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a legal argument.  I don't know that it would require 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any discovery at all.  That's why deciding jurisdiction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and proceeding to 12(b)(6), I -- I think, you know, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

again at -- at risk of saying what's good for the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side, I think would serve the comity's interest that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

being asserted here, as opposed to a situation where --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

let's say you have an expropriation complaint, and maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the facts of the case are that there was a payment of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some compensation, but the question is whether it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate compensation as international law requires. 

 

 

 

 

 

And maybe even just on the face of the pleadings, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe the defendant puts in a factual dispute on that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

score.  What that requires, then, is that the court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have essentially a mini trial on what is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valuation of this property.  What's it's going concern 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

value under the discounted cash-flow model?  What was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the value of the compensation provided?  Is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate?  All of that has to be decided up front, with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the end result being either --

20

view, with the end results being either I have no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, even though I just conducted this whole 

   

 

 

 

 

 

trial, or I have jurisdiction but it's jurisdiction only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to rule for the plaintiff. 

 

 

 

 

              

A court under this position -- under their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position can never find that it has jurisdiction to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue a merits -- a merits decision in the defendant's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

favor.  That is an unusual jurisdictional rule, and it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not consistent with how Congress and the Executive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Branch, when they were looking at these sorts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations, and wanting to provide an open door to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

we're not opening the courthouse door only to winning

claims.

They're saying there has been a problem of

9 

10

foreign sovereigns taking property, for discriminatory 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons or without paying for it, using that property to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gain advantage in the marketplace, and we want the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courthouse doors to be open to that.  There's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indication in the text, in the structure, or anywhere 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that says that's supposed to depart from how these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions are normally made. 

 

 

 

            

And I want to address the Permanent Mission 

   

 

 

 

 

 

case which Ms. Goldenberg averted to where she, I think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correctly acknowledged that the only issue in that case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the character of the rights in issue as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

quote/unquote property. 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

There was no issue in that case about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the plaintiff's claim had any merit to it.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants in that case had argued, among other things, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they weren't obligated to pay the tax.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court said, no, we don't address merits questions.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court did consider the character of the -- of the rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asserted as rights in property.  But because that didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicate the merits of the claim, the court had no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasion to consider whether Bell v. Hood applied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And as I mentioned earlier, there is no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

similar dispute here in this case because there's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really any dispute about the fact that the parent-owned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shares, that those are property rights, and that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegation is that the entire value and benefit of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property interest has been completely destroyed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

defendant's conduct. 

 

7 

            

So Permanent Mission simply doesn't speak to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

any of those -- any of those issues. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about Verlinden? 

  

 

 

 

10 

They cite that many times. 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MS. CARROLL:  They do, and I -- and I am

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

happy for it, because I think Verlinden supports our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

position.  Verlinden describes the FSIA correctly as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

comprehensive, substantive regulation of the amenability 

 

 

 

 

 

of foreign sovereigns to sue in U.S. courts.  It sets 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out venue provisions, service of process rules, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations on damages, rules about attachment of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property, and so on.  It also imposes substantive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions requiring a connection between the conduct 

   

 

 

 

 

and the United States.  That's how the personal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction elements work.  And it also, in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's words, include provisions, quote, governing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

types of actions for which foreign sovereigns may be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued and held liable in U.S. courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

That's exactly what we think is the right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

52 

reading of this provision, which is it's a provision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that says if an expropriation and its legality under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international law are what's at issue, that's what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit is about, and if the commercial nexus requirements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are met, then the Court has jurisdiction to decide the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case one way or the other.  And the plaintiff might not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

win, but the Court has jurisdiction to decide it.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has jurisdiction over the subject matter, and that's all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's required for the claims to go forward.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

there's a dispute about the commercial nexus, that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

decided at what stage?  12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6)? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MS. CARROLL:  We believe that has to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

decided at 12(b)(1) because it is a factual requirement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just as, for example, a waiver requirement.  But it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

not unusual to have a jurisdiction provision that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

combines both of those types of elements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The diversity statute is one, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the citizenship of the parties has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established.  And if there's doubt about it or a dispute 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it, the Court must decide at 12(b)(1).  But, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, the amount in controversy need not be fully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved at the outset. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's really 

  

 

 

 

 

all we're talking about here, and whether the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

53 

issues set forth in the statute are ones that should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided at the early stage or not.  And -- and whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's -- there's a commercial nexus, you say, well, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's just -- that's part of the jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision, so it has to be decided at 12(b)(1).  I don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand why that answer doesn't apply in this case as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

well. 

8 

            

MS. CARROLL:  To be clear, they are all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

jurisdictional requirements, and they must all be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided up front. 

 

 

11 

            

The question is, what is the nature of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

requirement in this language about what's in issue?  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a right in property is the taking in violation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international in issue?  That is the type of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction requirement that is not a factual 

   

 

 

 

 

requirement in the sense of citizenship of the parties. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's more like the jurisdictional provisions that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has considered under the Sherman Act or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exchange Act, which grants jurisdiction over violations, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or the criminal laws which grant jurisdiction over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offences, or --

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Does the issue of diversity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

or the issue of commercial nexus overlap with the merits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of those claims? 

 

 

25 

            

MS. CARROLL:  No, they don't.  And that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

54 

1 

2 

3 

another distinction between that kind of jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement and the kind of requirement that simply goes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to what -- what have you put in issue?  What's the case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

about? 

5 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what if 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

there's a dispute about the shareholder status of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights and property issue?  There may be rights and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property, but we think you own only 49 percent of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shares.  And the plaintiffs say, no, no, they -- they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own 51 percent, so they have a right in property. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's a factual dispute that is decided where? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MS. CARROLL:  That is a factual dispute that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

was -- would be part of the merit.  If the point of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument was because of the amount of shares you own, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which of course is not an issue here because the parent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the sole shareholder --

 

 

 

 

17 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, I know. 

   

  

 

 

 

18 

It's a hypothetical. 

   

19 

            

MS. CARROLL:  But if the argument is because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

of the amount of shares you own, you don't own enough to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be able to succeed and be entitled to relief on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim that you've alleged, that's a merits 

   

 

 

 

 

23 

determination. 

24 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's -- well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

or it's a jurisdictional determination because you only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

55 

have jurisdiction if you have rights and property, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'd only have rights and property if you own 51 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent instead of 49 percent.  Why isn't that like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody coming in and saying, I'm not a citizen of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

Kentucky? 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Because the statute doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

say you must show you have rights and property.  It says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you must show that rights and property are an issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the suit.  What's the suit about?  It's about an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assertion by the plaintiff that their rights and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property were taken in violation of -- of international 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

law. 

13 

            

The -- the argument that Petitioners has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

made -- are making now is not a new one.  It's an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument that was made to this Court in the Binderup 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case under the Sherman Act in the 1920s.  It's an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument that was made to this Court in Bell v. Hood in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 1940s.  It's the same argument, Justice Ginsburg, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's been made in the whole Steel Co. line of cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And consistently, the Court has recognized that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction is vital before a court can decide that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

type of issue. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So in your view, on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief Justice's hypothetical, before -- your view is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they move under 12(b)(6) right away and they would say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

56 

1 

you aren't entitled to relief because you only own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

49 percent? 

 

3 

            

MS. CARROLL:  Right.  And nothing would have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

4 

stopped them from doing that. 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, except that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

lot of district judges don't like moving under 12(b)(6) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right away.  They like to have further development 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

before they -- before they decide whether there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim or not. 

 

 

10 

            

MS. CARROLL:  I'm -- I can't say that that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

been an -- an issue in this case where there's been fair 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount of agreement among the parties and the courts as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to what order the issue should be decided in. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

The -- the petitioners here have asserted a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

challenge, a factual challenge to jurisdiction under the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

commercial nexus requirements.  They said even though 

  

 

 

 

 

 

PDVSA is named as the expropriating entity in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decree, and even though PDVSA initiated the eminent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domain proceedings, nonetheless, we assert as a factual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

matter that actually we've shifted ownership and control 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the property to some other PDVSA entity, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity doesn't engage in commercial activity in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States, and so, therefore, there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

jurisdiction. 

25 

            

And as a matter of fairness, of course we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

57 

entitled to examine the -- the factual basis of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assertion.  That's the only discovery that has gone on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so far in the case, and it happened because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners chose to make that factual argument.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't have to.  They could have just said, we think we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a great legal argument on the merits, and so we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to move under 12(b)(6) to dismiss the action for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to state a claim. 

   

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

            

They have never brought that claim.  To this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

day, there is no pending motion to dismiss for any of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the grounds that -- that they have asserted for failure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to state a claim, only under 12(b)(1).  And of course, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Rule 12(b) -- the office of Rule 12(b)(1) is very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different from the office of Rule 12(b)(6).  12(b)(1) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicates all of the concerns of shoving merits issues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the determination, and for that reason, we think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no reason to construe this language to have that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

consequence. 

19 

            

20 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Ms. Stestman -- Ms. Stetson, you have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

minute. 

22 

        

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE E. STETSON 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MS. STETSON:  Ms. Carroll describes this 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

case as a subject matter jurisdiction case like any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

58 

other.  What this Court has already said in Altmann is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the FSIA is sui generis.  Here, subject matter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction isn't just about jurisdiction over a class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of cases or a type of case.  It's jurisdiction over this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign standing in front of the Court.  That is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference between 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  12(b)(6) 

  

 

 

 

 

requires that court to have taken jurisdiction, to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercised its power over that sovereign.  Before that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens, it is the sovereign's prerogative to test

jurisdiction. 

11 

            

In answer, Justice Breyer, to your order --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15

17 

18

25 

order of battle question, the sovereign sets the order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of battle.  This is -- the only order that this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs to give is the one that it already gave, frankly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Verlinden, which is courts apply the substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detailed FSIA standards to determine jurisdiction, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just to hypothesize it. 

 

 

 

            

The difference between this case and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tucker Act is that in the Tucker Act, the jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depends on a claim against the United States.  That's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the language that's missing here.  And in both the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tucker Act and in this case, there is, of course, an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediate appeal.  The reason that an immediate appeal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is tolerated under Section 1291, that narrow class of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases where that qualifies, is because this right is so

important that it cannot be left for later.  That's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference.


            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
