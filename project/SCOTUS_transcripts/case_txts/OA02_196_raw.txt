CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 02-196, the National Park Hospitality


Association versus the Department of the Interior. 


Mr. Geller.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GELLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


This case concerns the applicability of the


Contract Disputes Act to contracts between National Park


Service and the private concessioners who contract to


provide visitor services and to operate and maintain


facilities in more than 100 of our national parks. 

QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, I have a couple of


preliminary questions.


First of all, this is a facial challenge made by


the National Park Hospitality Association, I take it.  How


is the claim ripe for adjudication?  Has the association


been injured actually?  There's no case pending.


MR. GELLER:  Your Honor, to begin with, let me


say that as to this facial challenge point, this -- this


was an argument that was never made below.  It was not


made in the district court.  It was not made in the court

of appeals.  It was not made in the opposition to


certiorari.


QUESTION:  Is it one that we're precluded from


concerning ourselves with?


MR. GELLER:  Well, I'm not sure it's a


jurisdictional issue.


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. GELLER:  So it -- it may well be waived.


But let me also say quickly that I think this


whole --


QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, I think that -- I think


the ripeness issue --


MR. GELLER:  Yes, I was going to address


ripeness.


QUESTION: 


-- subsists whether or not it's a 

facial challenge.


MR. GELLER:  Right.  I was going to address


ripeness separately, Justice Scalia.  In terms of this


facial/as-applied, this is an APA challenge to a


regulation.  I'm not aware that the Court has really used


this facial/as-applied nomenclature --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. GELLER:  -- in that -- in that context. 


After all, under the APA, the question is whether a --


an -- a regulation is arbitrary or capricious or contrary

to law.  Here we have a regulation that categorically


states no NPS -- no National Park Service concession


contracts are subject to the CDA.  If there -- there are,


in fact, some such contracts that are subject to the CDA,


as we believe there are, then that regulation is arbitrary


and capricious.  The agency should have to go back and


draft a more refined regulation. 


QUESTION:  Is that -- is that the standard for


ripeness --


MR. GELLER:  I --


QUESTION: -- whether the regulation is arbitrary


or --


MR. GELLER:  No, no, no.  I --


QUESTION:  Why is this any different -- you


contend that the agency has no authority to speak 

authoritatively on this -- on this issue anyway.  And


therefore, this regulation, as I understand your -- your


position, is -- is of no more effect than the agency's


announcement of what its litigating position will be.


MR. GELLER:  Not quite, Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  All right. 


MR. GELLER:  I'm trying to -- I'm trying to


distinguish the facial/as-applied point that Justice


O'Connor raised from the ripeness question, which I'll get


to in just a minute.

 This is not a -- a -- there was an as-applied


challenge, to begin with, made in the district court. 


This is not a facial challenge in the sense that we're


asking the Court to strike down the regulation based on


hypotheticals or on factual situations that may never


arise.  We know what these concessions contracts look


like.  The NPS has issued standard concessions contracts. 


It seems to us rather easy to determine whether the


services that are called for in those contracts bring the


contracts within the -- within the CDA.  So I don't think


there's anything to this facial challenge.


QUESTION:  Well, presumably there are many


different kinds of concession contracts.  Some might be


covered; some might not.


MR. GELLER: 


Well, I don't think so, Justice 

O'Connor, because there are standard concessions


contracts.  They're in the record and it's clear that they


call for certain types of services.  And we think it's


clear that the Court, as the two lower courts did, can


determine whether those contracts call for the procurement


of services that would bring them within the CDA or call


for the repair or maintenance of real property.


Now --


QUESTION:  How many -- what are there?  10


standard concession contracts?

 MR. GELLER:  Three.  There are, I think, three.


QUESTION:  Three?


MR. GELLER:  And they all call for the same


types of services at national parks.  There are -- there


are copies in the -- in the record.


Now, in terms of your ripeness argument, Justice


Scalia, once again, the -- the Government never made any


suggestion that this case was not ripe below.  The reason


it's not unripe is that the standard concession contracts


and the contracts that, in fact, the NPS is putting out


for bid incorporate within them the statement that these


contracts are not subject to the CDA.  The NPHA and its


members need to know now, in terms of deciding whether to


bid on certain contracts, what their rights are under


those contracts, and therefore --


QUESTION:  But how -- how does it hurt you to --


in the present posture, as I understand it, the


contracts -- whatever it's called -- the ICBA decides


these cases in your favor.  So in the -- in the setting of


a concrete dispute, the contracting officer rules against


one of the concessionaires.  The concessionaires goes to


that board if they want to and the board will rule, at


least on the jurisdictional point, that -- that the


Contracts Dispute Act does apply.  So how are you hurting


by --

 MR. GELLER:  We are harmed, Justice Ginsburg,


because it is important for the concessioners to know, at


the time that they're deciding whether to bid on a


contract and -- and the time they're deciding how much to


bid on a contract, what their rights are under that


contract.  It's a pre-bid -- it's a solicitation in which


the --


QUESTION:  That would be the same case if the


agency simply announced, our litigating position in these


contracts is going to be that they are not covered by the


Contract Disputes Act.


MR. GELLER:  Yes, but the --


QUESTION:  You'd be in exactly the same


position.


to sue?


MR. GELLER:  And we would be --


QUESTION:  Would -- would you have the ability


MR. GELLER:  We would be -- because it is a


provision of these contracts, Your Honor, that


incorporates the regulation that states that they are not


subject to the CDA.  So this is a proper challenge to the


solicitation as including an illegal term.  The contracts,


on their face by incorporating this regulation, say you


have no rights under the CDA.  It seems to us -- and we


think the law is clear, although the Government never made

this challenge, so it's not been briefed -- that the


concessioners have a right to know at the outset, in


deciding whether or not to bid, whether the Government is


right in asserting that they have no rights under the CDA


if they enter into these --


QUESTION:  Well, if it's an invalid provision,


could the contracting party simply contract and then go


into court later on and say, well, this clause is


unenforceable?


MR. GELLER:  Well, I don't know, Justice


Kennedy.  You would be signing a contract that agrees to


the provision in the contract that says that you have no


rights enforceable under the CDA. 


But beyond that, the Government has taken the


position you have no rights enforceable under the CDA.  So


it's not clear how you would follow through on your rights


under that --


QUESTION:  Well --


QUESTION:  If you're -- if you're right,


Mr. Geller, I suppose your client could go into court and


ask for a declaratory judgment, even though there's


nothing in the contract saying, we want to find out which


provision of -- as to review applies to us.


MR. GELLER:  But this is a pre-enforcement


challenge to a regulation --

QUESTION:  In the case that I put, I don't think


you could get declaratory relief until you've alleged that


there was going to be a dispute.  You can say, yes, I --


MR. GELLER:  But there is a --


QUESTION:  -- I might have an argument down the


line and I want to know where I want to go.  That seems to


me --


MR. GELLER:  But -- but, Justice Kennedy, the --


QUESTION:  -- speculative.  I just don't see the


harm to your client in waiting.


MR. GELLER:  The harm, Your Honor, is in not


knowing, at the time you're being asked to bid on


contracts, what your rights are under those contracts. 

QUESTION:  So it's --


MR. GELLER:  It's like any other provision. 


QUESTION:  Is it established -- I mean, my -- my


guess is it is, but -- but if the Government, the Defense


Department, any other Department, presents a -- a private


individual with a contract with 14 conditions and one of


those conditions, in the view of the private person, is


unlawful, not authorized by statute, contrary to statute,


that that person, before bidding on the contract, can go


to court and say, I would like this set aside as unlawful.

MR. GELLER:  Yes, I think there is authority


under -- under the -- under the Tucker Act, which is one


of the provisions of -- that we cited in the complaint,


that allows you to bring challenges to bid solicitations


on the ground that they --


QUESTION:  And these regulations are


incorporated into the contract.


MR. GELLER:  And these -- these are --


absolutely regulations are incorporated into the contract.


QUESTION: 


What is the authority, Mr. Geller? 

You said there is --


MR. GELLER:  I think it's section 1491.  I mean,


it -- it is one of the provisions that we relied on in


the -- in the complaint in this case to bring this


challenge.


And I might say to the Court --


QUESTION:  Is there -- is there any case that


supports this particular --


MR. GELLER:  Yes, there are, but -- but I was


about to say, Mr. Chief Justice, that this -- that the

Government has never challenged ripeness, and that's not


suggest -- it is not to suggest that it's not something


that this Court can consider, but I think it's unfair to


decide that issue on the -- when it hasn't been fully


briefed by the parties.  It's never been challenged at any


time in this case. 


QUESTION:  Unless it force -- unless the failure


to consider it forces us to decide a case on -- on facts


that we find, you know, rather amorphous.


MR. GELLER:  But they're not amorphous, Justice


Scalia --


QUESTION:  That's the purpose of the ripeness


doctrine --


MR. GELLER:  -- because --


QUESTION: 


-- to make it easier for us to decide 

the case.


MR. GELLER:  I'm not suggesting the Court


doesn't have the authority to do it.  I'm suggesting the


issue has not been briefed, that we did present the Tucker


Act as the basis for jurisdiction in the Court --


QUESTION:  Then is the issue before us --


MR. GELLER:  Excuse me?


QUESTION:  Is the issue before us whether the


three contracts that are in the record are procurement


contracts within the meaning of the statute?

universal -- and they don't want to do it if -- or may or

question?  The -- court of appeals addressed this part

are renewed?  In other words, if a -- if it's not a --

MR. GELLER:  Yes.

MR. GELLER:  Yes, yes.

MR. GELLER:  Yes, they are.

curious about.  Why does it matter?  Why do you care --


MR. GELLER:  It --


QUESTION:  -- whether it's covered by the CDA?


MR. GELLER:  Because the --


QUESTION:  What's at stake here --


MR. GELLER:  That's important --


QUESTION:  -- in the real world?


MR. GELLER:  That's a very important question,


Justice O'Connor.  What is at stake are the rights --


the -- the rights, the substantive and the procedural


rights, that are available to -- to a Government


contractor if it -- it gets into a dispute with the --


with the contracting agency. 


Now, under the CDA, there are very important


procedural and substantive rights that are available that 

would not be available under other law, and that's -- that


was --


QUESTION:  Well, like what?  I mean, what --


MR. GELLER:  For example --


QUESTION:  -- what's at stake?


MR. GELLER:  What's at stake principally is,


first of all, an administrative mechanism, which is these


boards of contract appeals, that would -- are available to


decide these matters expeditiously and particularly with


small claims without having to go to court.

 QUESTION:  As opposed to what?


MR. GELLER:  As opposed to having to go to


court, as opposed to having to go to the Court of Federal


Claims where it's not even clear what the standard of


review would be.  The standard of review under the CDA is


de novo.  So that's a very important substantive and


procedural right, in addition to --


QUESTION:  De novo for who?  For the contract


board or for the court if you go --


MR. GELLER:  Both.  After the contracting


officer decides an issue adversely to the contractor under


the CDA, the contractor has the choice either to go to the


Board of Contract Appeals or to file a lawsuit in the


Court of Federal Claims.  In either event, the review is


de novo.


QUESTION:  And if he chooses the contract board,


then the -- the next step, the court step will be --


MR. GELLER:  In the Federal Circuit.


QUESTION:  Directly to the circuit.


MR. GELLER:  Right. 


QUESTION:  You wouldn't go to the --


MR. GELLER:  Right.


QUESTION:  And that wouldn't be de novo, I take


it.


MR. GELLER:  No, it wouldn't be de novo.  That

QUESTION:  But the main thing, as I understood


it, was that you're trying to get out of the agency


appeals.  You don't want to have to go through the agency.


This gets you right into court after the --


MR. GELLER:  No.


QUESTION:  -- contracting officer.  Am I right


about that?


MR. GELLER:  No, and it's not right, Justice


Breyer.  Actually what we want to be able to do is to


avoid having to follow whatever procedures the agency sets


up in its contract for -- for seeking review if there's a


dispute.  We want to go --


QUESTION:  But why can't you do that?  That's


what you've been doing all along. 


That's why you -- you 

have the several decisions of the IBCA.  Every time you go


to the IBCA, they say, yes.


MR. GELLER:  Yes, but the Interior Department


and the NPS has not acceded to those decisions, and it has


issued a regulation that is --


QUESTION:  But then isn't -- isn't the


appropriate thing to go?  You go to the IBCA.  If the


Government wants to challenge the jurisdiction that they


will exercise, the resolution that they make, then it's up


to the Government.  But you can go to the IBCA.  They have

been welcoming you.


MR. GELLER:  Well, those were all prior to the


Government's issuance of the regulation in this case, a


regulation that's now been upheld by the D.C. Circuit.


QUESTION:  Well, but you -- you say the


Government's issuance of a --


MR. GELLER:  The NPS.


QUESTION:  It's the National Park Service.


MR. GELLER:  Yes, yes.  Well, that's what we're


dealing with here.


QUESTION:  There's some dispute as to whether


they even have the authority to issue it.


MR. GELLER:  They don't, in fact, administer the


CDA, Your Honor, so we don't think this is a regulation


that's entitled to any deference. 


Nonetheless, it's their 

position.


QUESTION:  They -- they seem to agree with you


on this point.  I mean, they've -- they've agreed in their


terms that it's not a legislative regulation in that --


MR. GELLER:  Right.

 MR. GELLER:  I don't think --


QUESTION:  -- in effect, claiming that this


so-called regulation is nothing but the Government's


statement of the intention to take a position when and


if --


MR. GELLER:  Well, the --


QUESTION:  -- the time comes?


MR. GELLER:  Our view is that this is a


regulation that represents the views of the NPS.  It's not


entitled to any deference because it's not a statute that


they administer.  The Government would have to give you


its view of how much deference it is entitled to.


QUESTION:  Well, how do you read the --


MR. GELLER:  But this is still an APA --


QUESTION: 


How do you read their concession in 

the footnote?  Because apparently --


MR. GELLER:  I find that --


QUESTION:  -- I -- I take it that is new, by the


way. 


MR. GELLER:  I find that --

challenging not the -- not the ineffective regulation, but


rather the inclusion of what the regulation says --

 MR. GELLER:  We're challenging both. 


QUESTION:  -- in the contracts.  Is that --


MR. GELLER:  We're challenging both.  We brought


an APA challenge to the regulation, as well as a Tucker


Act challenge and a pre-bid solicitation challenge to the


inclusion of these -- this -- this illegal term in the --


in the contracts.


QUESTION:  But isn't it the case that unless you


have an -- an APA issue, there's nothing else that you can


litigate at this point?  I mean, if the only thing that


you have to complain about is that they want to put a term


in a contract that you think they shouldn't be putting in,


it's up to you to decide whether you want to contract it


on those terms or not.


MR. GELLER: 


No, because I think under the law 

we're entitled to challenge that solicitation as illegal. 


We have to bid on these contracts, we're entitled to


know --


QUESTION:  No, but at this stage of the game,


they're not claiming that their regulation is -- is what


they call a legislative regulation. 


MR. GELLER:  They are claiming that that is the


position that they're going to take and that it is


entitled to some level of deference.


QUESTION:  Well --

 MR. GELLER:  That footnote clearly says that it


is entitled to some level of deference.


QUESTION:  And --


MR. GELLER:  This is clearly the position, and


it's been upheld by the D.C. Circuit.  There's no reason


to suggest they're not going to adamantly enforce their --


their views.


QUESTION:  But then -- but if the case isn't


ripe and we should so hold, I assume the appropriate thing


to do would be to vacate the D.C. Circuit's decision to


that extent. 


MR. GELLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  So then you'll be -- what you would


be -- have is the Government has told you in advance what


its litigating position would be and it has no more 

meaning than a -- a statement of what the Government's --


MR. GELLER:  But it is --


QUESTION:  -- position is with no -- no --


MR. GELLER:  But, Justice Ginsburg, as I said,


there's still this provision in all of the contracts.


QUESTION:  The Government would still be asking


you to enter a contract --


MR. GELLER:  The Government would still be


asking us to accede to a position and sign a contract that


contains a term which we believe is illegal that says we

have no rights under the CDA.


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what if the Government


contract had a term that simply said, you know, there


would be damages for delay, double damages depending on


the amount of delay?  And you say, well, I -- we don't


think the Government is authorized to put that in a


contract.  Could you challenge that?


MR. GELLER:  Yes.  I believe so, Mr. Chief


Justice.  There is a very large body of Government


contracting law -- it's not in the briefs because it


wasn't raised -- allowing --


QUESTION:  Well, is it --


MR. GELLER:  -- allowing these sorts of


challenges to illegal terms in contracts.


QUESTION:  But where is the law? 


I mean, is it 

in the cases of this Court?


MR. GELLER:  Well, obviously, these -- these


cases are generally litigated in the -- in the Court of


Federal Claims and in the district courts.


QUESTION:  Is -- is that where the law is, in


the Court of Federal Claims?


MR. GELLER:  Yes.  Well, there are probably some


appellate decisions as well, but the law is fairly


well-settled in this area.  As I say, the Government has


never challenged the ripeness of the CDA --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, you say -- you say it's


settled, and please correct me if I'm wrong if -- if


Abbott Laboratories has been overtaken.  But my notion was


that in order to have a pre-enforcement challenge, you had


to have a pretty strong claim that you are hurting now, as


they were, if they didn't -- if they spent all that money.


MR. GELLER:  Yes.  Abbott Laboratories is -- is


obviously an APA case.  I think we could meet that


standard because we need to know now whether we should bid


on these contracts. 


But there's a separate body of law involving


solicitations for Government contracts is what I'm saying


to the Court.


QUESTION:  And does that get you --


QUESTION: 


That -- that's your stronger card I 

think. 


MR. GELLER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And does that give you an APA cause


of action?


MR. GELLER:  Well, we brought both an APA cause


of action and a challenge under the -- under the Tucker


Act, and you know, we would maintain that we can challenge


this regulation, and in addition, we can challenge this


bid solicitation.  The two really overlap because the


regulation is incorporated into the contract.

 QUESTION:  Was there any finding in the district


court that the inclusion of this provision was critical as


to whether or not you'd go ahead with the contract?


MR. GELLER:  There was no such --


QUESTION:  I mean, I --


MR. GELLER:  There -- there was no such --


QUESTION:  -- I find it a little hard -- if it's


a -- if it's a really good contract, you I suppose intend


to comply with it and you don't think there's going to be


any litigation at all.


MR. GELLER:  Well, Your -- there was -- there


was no finding by the district court, Your Honor, because


there was not -- there was no challenge to the ripeness by


the Government, but the -- the complaint, as I recall, did


make that allegation. 


The complaint made the allegation 

that the contractors needed to know whether these


contracts were covered by the CDA.


QUESTION:  When you say these --


QUESTION:  Well, could it make the further


allegation that if it -- if it were not -- that if it


were -- were not covered, it would not engage in the


negotiations at all?


MR. GELLER:  I don't specifically recall that


allegation.


QUESTION:  It's a commercial matter.  It's hard

for me to see it if there's an advantageous contract, but


you're not going to execute it --


MR. GELLER:  Well, but it's a question of how --


QUESTION:  -- if you go through one form of


remedy or the other in the event of a breach. 


MR. GELLER:  But it's not binary, Justice


Kennedy.  Maybe you would still enter into the contract


negotiations.  It's one factor in deciding how much you'll


bid on the contract.


QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, you -- when you say these


contracts --


MR. GELLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- you keep referring to these


contracts.  They're -- actually you're talking about three


contract forms. 


You're -- you're not discussing any 

particular --


MR. GELLER:  Well, there are --


QUESTION:  -- bid solicitation.  You -- you have


no particular bid solicitation, do you? 


MR. GELLER:  Well, no.  Well, that's not


precisely true, Justice Scalia, because there were bid


solicitations.  In the district court, there were -- there


were lawsuits brought both by the National Park


Hospitality Association on behalf of its members, as well


as -- as lawsuits brought by several concessioners

challenging specific bid solicitations as to them.  And --


and therefore, there was both facial and as-applied, in


effect, challenges to the -- to the CDA point in the -- in


the --


QUESTION:  What they say then is the


Government -- as far as I understand it, the basic point


is that this is not a procurement contract regardless of


who's entitled to what deference.  And the reason that it


isn't is because we are not buying anything, and that


isn't a technical point.  That is an important point


because you and us -- you, the private, and we, the


Government -- are both in the business of selling things


to the Government.  We need somewhat more control over the


interpretation of these contracts.  And that's why the


number of procedures you have to go through in the parks 

department is greater, and all the things that you don't


like about it are things we do like about it.  Namely, we


get a little bit added control.  But that's why


legitimately these are not procurement contracts.


Now, your point in response to roughly that,


or --


MR. GELLER:  Well --


QUESTION:  I'm just trying to get you to the


merits, so I thought I'd --


MR. GELLER:  Yes.  I'd like to turn to the

merits.  Thank you, Justice Breyer. 


Can I -- I'd like to begin by saying it's purely


a matter of statutory construction, and we think that the


statute on its face unambiguously answers the question


before the Court.  And I think it would be helpful if the


Court could look at section 3(a) of the Contract Disputes


Act which -- which appears in many places, including


page 1 of the blue brief, because you'll see that section


3(a) states that unless specifically excluded therein, the


CDA applies to, quote, any express or implied contract


entered into by an executive agency for, among other


things, the procurement of services or the procurement of


construction, repair, or maintenance of real property.


QUESTION:  The reason that doesn't help you is


because --


MR. GELLER:  The --


QUESTION:  -- the question is what's


procurement.


MR. GELLER:  Well, I'm not sure that that's


necessarily the question, but let me address it this way,


Your Honor.


The National Park Service does not contend that


its concessions contracts are not contracts within the


meaning of the CDA.  It doesn't contend that it's not an


executive agency.  And the NPS doesn't contend that any

provision of the CDA or, for that matter, any other


Federal statute specifically excludes these contracts from


the -- from the CDA.  And, Justice Breyer, the NPS really


doesn't even take issue with the fact that these


concessions contracts procure services and procure the


construction, repair, and maintenance of real property. 


In other words, every single statutory requirement on the


face of the statute would seem to be satisfied --


QUESTION:  But I thought they did challenge that


these are -- that it's procurement.


MR. GELLER:  They do not challenge, Your Honor,


that -- that these contracts procure services --


QUESTION:  In the -- in the sense of procurement


as used in Government contracting?


MR. GELLER: 


Well, I think that's the issue in 

the case.  The Government claims --


QUESTION:  That's -- that's the issue in the


case. 


MR. GELLER:  The Government --


QUESTION:  I tried to --


MR. GELLER:  And I would like to turn to that


now because the Government claims that these contracts are


not within the protection of the CDA.  And why?  Its


entire argument amounts to the following. 


The Government says that the word procurement


27

and the phrase, procurement contract, we are told, have a


universally understood and well-settled meaning.  And they


tell us that to qualify as a procurement contract, the


Government says, an acquisition must be for the direct use


and benefit of the Government and it must be paid for with


what the Government calls Government funds.


Now, the first thing to be said, Justice Breyer,


about the Government's argument is that it is a complete


invention.  It is a complete invention.  No Federal


statute defines the word procurement or the word,


procurement contract, to include the two requirements that


the Government tells us are essential.  In fact, the


Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act -- the Government


cites lots and lots of --


QUESTION: 


Well, the word procurement has a 

natural meaning.  If they -- if they have a concessionaire


to come and sell balloons on the Fourth of July, they


don't say they've procured some balloons.  They say


they've arranged for some balloons.


MR. GELLER:  Well, you'd say arranged.  You


could say they procured having someone sell balloons at


the Fourth of July. 


The -- the Office of Federal Procurement Policy


Act --


QUESTION:  No, but that -- that -- that's not

the usual meaning of -- of procure, I should think.


MR. GELLER:  But the -- but there is no statute


that -- the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act,


which is a companion statute to the CDA, actually has a


definition of the word procurement.  You wouldn't know it


from reading the Government's brief because in their -- it


doesn't refer to that, but it contains a definition of the


word procurement that does not contain either of the two


requirements that the Government tells us are essential to


a Government procurement. 


No court has ever construed the word procurement


to include the two requirements that the Government tells


us are clearly established and well-settled by Federal


procurement --


QUESTION:  Mr. Geller --


QUESTION:  What about acquiring --


QUESTION:  -- I'm looking at page 19 of the


Government's brief, and they -- they define procurement. 


They're taking it from the -- the Federal acquisition


regulations to say acquiring by contract with appropriated


funds supplies or services by and for the use of the


Federal Government.  So --


MR. GELLER:  Yes.  That's -- that's not a


statute, but let me address that, Justice Ginsburg. 


First of all, appropriated funds.  It is

clear -- and the Government has not challenged the fact --


that the CDA applies to contracts even when appropriated


funds are not used.  That's clear on the face of the CDA. 


So the Government is forced to come -- come up with this


new phrase, Government funds, which has, as far as we can


tell, no basis at all in any prior statute or any Federal


procurement law.  And the fact --


QUESTION:  It does have a basis in just what


Justice Ginsburg was quoting, 48 C.F.R. 2.101.  So they


say it's not without foundation in the law.  What -- what


that's from is, I take it, it's a memo that -- or a policy


issued jointly by the Secretary of Defense, the


Administrator of General Services, and the NPS


Administrator.  So when they have a reg like that, I'd --


I'd think that it's not so that it isn't somewhere in 

Federal law.  It's right there.


Now, there are some other things there --


MR. GELLER:  But --


QUESTION:  -- that you say are not necessarily


part of procurement.  But that fact that there are other


things that overstate it doesn't mean this does.


MR. GELLER:  But, Your Honor, there are many


other -- the Government principally relies on other


statutes that have the -- have certain provisions like the


ones they would like to introduce into the CDA in them.

But I think it's quite significant that Congress didn't


put these provisions in the CDA.


QUESTION:  But what about -- he put one in -- in


the CDA, 41 U.S.C., section 612(c).  It's discussed at the


bottom of page 18 and the top of page 19 of -- of the


Government's brief.  And what it says is that the monetary


awards in favor of a contractor will be paid out of the


judgment fund and in turn provides for the reimbursement


to the judgment fund, quote, by the agency whose


appropriations were used for the contract, which would


suggest that in all cases --


MR. GELLER:  I don't think it -- it does not --


QUESTION:  -- where there's been a judgment --


MR. GELLER:  It doesn't suggest that at all,


Justice Scalia. 


First of all, they only quote that 

incompletely.  It also --


QUESTION:  Yes, well, tell me why.  I -- I know


that your --


MR. GELLER:  In -- in our --


QUESTION:  -- reply brief -- I don't see how


the -- the --


MR. GELLER:  In our reply brief, it says, by


such appropriated -- by -- by the appropriations of that


agency or such other appropriations as the agency has to


get.

 Now, the NPS is a -- a --


QUESTION:  But -- but it clearly envisions


appropriations, whether they have it already or they have


to get it later. 


MR. GELLER:  But the -- the CDA on its face --


and the Government concedes this -- applies to contracts


that don't involve appropriated funds agencies.


QUESTION:  Well, we'll ask the Government about


that.  That's a -- that's a much more serious point.


MR. GELLER:  Yes.  I think it's clear there's


no -- there's no doubt that the CDA applies to any


contract whether or not it's an appropriated funds agency


or not.


Let me just say that in addition to being, I


think, totally unsupported as a matter of law, the 

limitations that the NPS asks this Court to read into the


CDA would be completely unworkable as a matter of


practice.  I think we've already talked about the


Government funds point which is, I think, a phrase that


they have dreamt up.  It has no basis in law, unlike


appropriated funds, which is not the case of the CDA.


But I think it's also the case that this use or


benefit to the Government notion is completely unworkable. 


If, for example, the NPS were to go out and procure water


coolers for use in the Department of Interior building,


32

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

23

25

the NPS would concede that those would be within the


Contract Disputes Act because they're -- they're for the


use and benefit of the Government.  If the Government were


to go out and procure the same water coolers for use on


the Mall during the Fourth of July, the Court -- the NPS


would say, well, that's not for the use or benefit of the


Government.  I don't know how you could decide what is for


the use or benefit of the Government.


When -- if the Government -- if the NPS issues a


contract to build a -- the World War II Memorial on the


Mall, which is now being -- is now happening, is that for


the use of the public or it is used for the Government? 


We don't think this is a defensible position, and it


certainly finds no basis in the CDA.  We think it's an


irrational reading of the act that has no support in the 

language or the legislative history or the purpose of the


statute. 


And I want to say that even if there was a use


or benefit to the Government limitation in the CDA, we


think it would -- these contracts would still clearly


satisfy it because these concessions contracts are being


let in part to help the Department of Interior, the NPS


fulfill its statutory mission.  If these concessions were


not there operating these restaurants or guest facilities,


the NPS would have to operate them themselves in order to

satisfy its -- the statutory requirement that they provide


for the use and enjoyment of the national parks.  So we


don't think it's possible to say that these concession


contracts the -- that the NPS is completely indifferent to


these concession contracts.  They are clearly for the use


and benefit not only of the public, but also of the NPS.


If the Court has no further questions, I'd like


to reserve the balance of my time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Geller.


Mr. Elwood, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. ELWOOD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


QUESTION: 


Will you tell us why the Government 

doesn't want the CDA applicable here?  I mean, what's --


what's at stake for the Government in not applying it?


MR. ELWOOD:  Justice -- Justice O'Connor, the


reason why the Government doesn't want this applicable


here is that the Contract Dispute Act was passed to


address specific shortcomings in the remedial scheme that


was available for procurement contracts, and because it


was designed specifically for those purposes, it have --


has terms that we don't think are appropriate in this


context.  For example --

 QUESTION:  But that just doesn't tell me, as a


practical matter, why the Government doesn't want it


applicable here.


MR. ELWOOD:  For example, the pre-judgment


interest remedy.  Congress --


QUESTION:  You don't want to pay pre-judgment


interest. 


MR. ELWOOD:  Right, and we don't think it's


appropriate.  Congress provided pre-judgment interest in


the procurement context because procurement contractors


would be required to perform under the contract even


during the pendency of a dispute when they weren't being


paid.  And it was because of that unique position where


they were both being required to make outlays without


getting any income that Congress thought that because 

there was a --


QUESTION:  Okay.  So at bottom, that's it, the


pre-judgment interest feature.


MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I think that and because --


there are other things as well.  For example, the purpose


of the -- one of the purposes of the CDA was to cut


through all of these requirements that you exhaust


administrative remedies, but those simply aren't present


in the concessions context.  Traditionally concessioners


had a direct right of access to courts, and Congress has

never indicated that they thought the remedial scheme was


inadequate for concessioners.  And --


QUESTION:  Is this -- is this claim ripe?  And


why didn't you ever talk about it below?  What's going on? 


It's -- it comes in such an odd posture.  What is the


Government's view on that?


MR. ELWOOD:  The reason why we did not raise


this -- why we did not raise this is because we did not


raise it below.  And as you can tell from the pleadings --


QUESTION:  Why not? 


MR. ELWOOD:  -- is -- because the CDA was kind


of a side show below.  It was a relatively small issue and


it was just not the focus of the proceedings, as you can


tell by the opinion. 


But I think that the Court has raised valid 

concerns about the ripeness in this sense.  The Court has


traditionally said in a pre-enforcement challenge to a


regulation that a claim is ripe if it affects primary


conduct so that -- so that if they don't comply, they


might be held liable.  That's the Abbott Labs line of


cases. 


And here this doesn't affect primary conduct. 


It -- it predominantly just says whether or not -- which


forum you're going to have a remedy in.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I would agree --

 QUESTION:  What about this -- what about the --


the reply?  I came in thinking ripeness was a problem, and


your brother on the other side gave to me what was a very


convincing answer.  What's wrong with that answer?


MR. ELWOOD:  And that is -- the thing is because


it predominantly just determines which forum you have --


which forum you bring your claim in, I don't know --


QUESTION:  I know it doesn't affect -- but what


they're saying is that where the Government offers general


contracts to the industry and there is a term in all of


those contracts which, in the view of the industry, is


unlawful, they -- it's ripe for them to challenge that. 


Now, what I'm afraid here would be that we or you or


somebody, in deciding whether that's an incorrect


argument, would upset what could be -- I have no idea if 

it is -- a practice of contractors objecting to terms in


offered contracts as contrary to law. 


So are you saying now that that is not ripe? 


Are you saying that a contractor who comes into a court


and objects to a term in a proposed contract as contrary


to law does not have a claim because it is not ripe?  Is


that the Government's position?


MR. ELWOOD:  No, I don't think that would be our


position.  If it affects their primary --


QUESTION:  No.  I would think probably you would

at least want to brief it.


MR. ELWOOD:  Right. 


I think that if it affects their primary


conduct, if affects what their obligations would be under


the contract, I think that that claim would be ripe for


pre-enforcement review.  But where it simply determines


which forum they'll bring the claim in, I don't think it


would be covered.


QUESTION:  But they said it's the first that's


at issue here.  Now, is it not because -- you heard what


he said.  So --


MR. ELWOOD:  That -- that's correct.  But I


think simply because it determines which forum you bring


your claim in, I don't think it would be covered.  If I


were --


QUESTION:  So you -- so there's a dispute


between the two sides on what the case law says as to


whether -- and it isn't even a general -- a general attack


upon the form of -- upon a form contract.  But as we


understand from petitioners, there were particular bids


outstanding that were challenged because -- because of a


term in them that -- that was claimed to be unlawful.  And


it is your position that you cannot challenge a particular


bid because of an unlawful term unless that unlawful term


affects your primary conduct.

 MR. ELWOOD:  No.  If it affects something other,


I think, than the forum in which it was brought, I mean,


if it affects what you think your obligations will be,


if -- if it affects the price that you think you should


pay or that you should bid on a contract, I think that


that would be --


QUESTION:  Well, it -- it does on your analysis.


MR. ELWOOD:  -- subject to pre-enforcement


review.


QUESTION:  Doesn't it?  I mean, you said one of


the things that is important is pre-judgment interest.  So


I -- I suppose their liability under the contract is going


to be affected by -- by the correctness of the reg.


MR. ELWOOD:  I don't think their liability --


QUESTION: 


Their primary conduct won't be, but 

their potential liability, if there is a contract dispute,


would be.


MR. ELWOOD:  Your Honor, I confess that I am not


sure if the Government gets pre-judgment interest under


the CDA or not.  But if it were -- if -- if it simply ran


to the contractors, I think that -- that the prospective


interest on a claim that has not even arisen yet seems a


little vague --


QUESTION:  Why is that vague?  I mean, they --


they have to make a bid.  They have accountants.  These

are big companies.  They calculate everything down to the


finest penny, and -- and they say, you know, we take into


account whether we're going to get pre-judgment interest,


which we -- if we have a dispute.  And by the way, we have


one dispute every 3 hours, and so it's a lot of money to


us.  And we will bid $42.36 less if we're not getting


the -- whatever.  All right?  So they work it all out. 


They have accountants who do it. 


And so, if that's so -- of course, if it isn't


so, it's a different story.  But they've said something


like that's so.


MR. ELWOOD:  I think it -- it would turn on --


in that case I just don't think that in advance you can


say with enough sort of concreteness and specificity that


you know how much a particular claim -- the -- the as-yet 

unfiled, unrealized contract claims would be worth.  You


could say --


QUESTION:  But, Mr. Elwood, isn't it really --


isn't a waiver of pre-judgment interest comparable to a


waiver of punitive damages, for example, which if you


insist on it, would affect the -- the amount one would bid


for a contract?  I don't understand why you say it's worth


nothing. 


MR. ELWOOD:  I mean --


QUESTION:  I mean, it's something -- if the

Government is willing to fight about it here and insist --


and put it in every contract, it must be of value to the


Government. 


MR. ELWOOD:  What is actually -- just if I could


clarify this.  What is put into the contract is just a


general term that applicable law will apply and because


applicable law includes all regulations, it is


incorporated that way.  It doesn't specifically include a


CDA waiver or anything of that sort.


QUESTION:  So the contract itself does not


specify that the CDA does not apply.


MR. ELWOOD:  No.  It just says applicable law


governs the contract.


But I think it's just a matter --


QUESTION: 


And is it -- is it your view, since 

you said your -- your interpretation now of the -- the


position that the Park Service is taking that it -- it


doesn't constitute law?  How can it constitute law?  First


of all, the Contract Dispute Act is not within the Park


Service bailiwick.  It isn't -- as you concede, it isn't


the -- doesn't administer this act.  So does that


regulation constitute any kind of law?


MR. ELWOOD:  I think that that's a valid concern


because our position is that this is basically just an


interpretive rule announcing the position that the Park

Service will take and the Park -- and the position that


the Park Service employees will take in administering it.


QUESTION:  So you're saying -- you -- you claim


that this provision is not incorporated in the contracts. 


Is that the position the Government is taking?


MR. ELWOOD:  I think -- honestly, Justice


Scalia, I think it's just -- it's a -- it's a new


proposition for me, and I think that a good argument could


be made that it does not include it because it -- it


really just represents the position of the National Park


Service.


QUESTION:  Even leaving aside the question of


inclusion, what is -- what do you understand your


difference to be from the petitioners with respect to the


status of the regulation itself? 


Is there any difference 

at all?


MR. ELWOOD:  I don't know that there is a -- a


difference with respect to the petitioner's view.  It's an


interpretive rule that the Park Service has --


QUESTION:  Have we got any jurisdiction left?


MR. ELWOOD:  I believe so because it is the


announced position.  It's not just a policy statement.  It


is basically a directive to the --


QUESTION:  Yes, but what's the difference


between a policy statement and an announced position?

The -- the point at which each one is going to have


practical effect is the point at which there is a claimed


breach and an argument, if there is one, over what the


remedial process is.


MR. ELWOOD:  Yes, but I think that the only


difference would be the -- the principal difference would


be policy statements are more -- involve more variance in


that they say as a general policy we will do this, whereas


the -- as an interpretive rule, it just says that we do


not believe that concession contracts are procurement


contracts.


QUESTION:  What -- what is the position of the


Government?  Now, I know this is hitting you cold, but I


think it would be helpful. 


Position one. 


We have not thought of ripeness 

before, and the case has been argued and submitted on the


assumption that, for example, the bidding would be


affected by this term which is incorporated into the


contract.  That's been the assumption, and we see no


reason to depart from it.  It's not jurisdictional.  So


decide the issue we briefed.  That's position one.


Position two.  We haven't thought of ripeness


before, but now that we think about it, we think it's


quite a serious problem and we're not certain what the --


what the -- what the issue is in ordinary contracts, and

we're not certain whether it's incorporated.  So we think


you should say that this case is not ripe. 


Now, do you take position one, which will mean


we perhaps could go to decide the issue for which it was


granted, or do you take position two, which means you see


ripeness as a big problem here that we ought to look at


further?


MR. ELWOOD:  Well, Justice Breyer, it's clearly


been the position of the Court that it is not bound by the


failure of the parties to raise it.  That's in Reno versus


Catholic Social Services, and of course, you can raise


it --


QUESTION:  I'm not asking you what the law is


exactly.  I'm asking you what's the Government's position.


MR. ELWOOD: 


I -- I think our position would 

be -- I mean, we -- we filed a brief in opposition and I


think, you know, if -- if we can win on ripeness grounds,


that's great too. 


QUESTION:  Well, you wouldn't necessarily --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  You wouldn't necessarily win.  I


mean, I -- I don't know if you would win.  I mean --


MR. ELWOOD:  Right.  We might lose the -- the


judgment of the D.C. Circuit as well, but --


QUESTION:  You -- you would have to.  If it's

not ripe, we'd have to vacate it to that extent.  But


this -- in the D.C. Circuit --


QUESTION:  Put you back to square one.  No --


QUESTION:  In the D.C. Circuit, this was a


giant, one of those typical wholesale attacks on many,


many regulations, on the whole -- on the whole rulemaking. 


Is that correct?


MR. ELWOOD:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And this was just a tiny, tiny piece


of a long, long opinion --


MR. ELWOOD:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  -- treating -- so maybe just nobody


noticed.


QUESTION:  It seems unfair to pick it apart in


this way. 
 Just a little part of a major opinion. 

MR. ELWOOD:  Well, I think that it -- it just


points out the fact that, I mean, they -- they had an


awful lot on their plate, and it perhaps eluded them for


that reason. 


QUESTION:  Now, the as-applied/facial.  Was the


as-applied challenges -- did those center on this issue or


did they relate to the -- to another issue?


MR. ELWOOD:  They related to other claims,


Justice Ginsburg.  Xanterra has characterized their claim


as an as-applied claim although they're -- they're not

asking for as-applied review in this case.  But if you


look at their -- their complaint, their complaint involved


their intention to bid on an as-yet unreleased prospectus. 


And so, in that sense, I don't think that is an as-applied


change for two -- for two reasons.  Not only is there no


contract dispute, but at the time that the complaint was


filed, there was no contract.  So we think that it would


be a facial challenge.


QUESTION:  Mr. Elwood, if I can assist you in


giving the merits here, is it -- is it the case, as the


petitioners contend, that the Government concedes that not


all contracts covered by the CDA are contracts in which


appropriated funds are used?


MR. ELWOOD:  That's correct.  To the extent that


it covers non-appropriated fund instrumentalities, it 

covers contracts that would involve the expenditure of


non-appropriated funds.  Those are, however, Government


funds, funds of Government entities known as non-


appropriated fund instrumentalities. 


QUESTION:  Well, once you slip off from


appropriated into -- into Government funds, you don't put


any -- you don't have any statutory text you can appeal to


as -- as separating out the CDA from -- from your Park


Service concessions. 


MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I don't agree, Justice Scalia.

Both the -- well, to begin with, just in terms of giving


an indication of what the commonly accepted meaning of the


term was at the time, the Commission on Government


Procurement Reform, which was the -- which was the impetus


for all of these reforms, defined procurement as purchase


of product or service for Federal use, which incorporates


both a -- a notion of expenditure and Federal use.  And


both the -- the 1969 act --


QUESTION:  Yes, but Federal use, of course -- it


is of use to the Park Service to have facilities available


to the public.  So that doesn't really answer the


question.  The parks -- the Park Service wants parks


available to the public with services in them, restrooms


and buildings and restaurants and so forth.  Doesn't it? 


So in a sense, it is for the use of the Park Service and 

the Government as well as for the public.


MR. ELWOOD:  It is for the use -- well, it is


not for the direct use of the National Park Service, and


that is where the Federal grant and cooperative agreement


comes in.  8 months before passage of the CDA, Congress


explained its understanding of what different types of


instruments would be used for, and it explained in that


that a procurement contract would be an instrument whose


principal purpose is the acquisition by purchase, lease,


or barter of goods or services for the direct use and

benefit of the Government.  And --


QUESTION:  Well, it doesn't really say that. 


And the language in the CDA is broad, and presumably this


was a -- an act that was presumed to have broad


application.


MR. ELWOOD:  It was presumed to have broad


application among procurement contracts.  There's no


indication that they did not intend the word procurement


to have the ordinary meaning that it does in that sense,


as indicated in the Commission on Government Procurement


Reform and the way it was used there, as indicated in the


1969 act creating the commission and the OFPP Act where


the simple use -- word procurement was understood to


mean --


QUESTION: 


Was -- was there ever any amendment 

offered in Congress to make clear that it didn't apply to


concession contracts?


MR. ELWOOD:  There was no -- no, there was no


indication in the entire legislative history that the --


that concessions came up, and in 1,200 pages of reports on


both procurement and non-appropriated fund procurement,


there was not a single mention of -- of -- national parks


concessions. 


QUESTION:  And how long -- at -- at any point


did the CDA -- was it applied or followed with any

concession contracts, or is this something that has arisen


recently?  Was it used at one point?


MR. ELWOOD:  There are a number of Armed Service


Board of Contract Appeals that assume CDA jurisdiction,


and the Board of Contract Appeals of the Department of


Interior started using it in 1989.  But I'm not familiar


with usage prior to that --


QUESTION:  These are for what concessions? 


PS -- PX concessions, for example? 


MR. ELWOOD:  Yes, Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't that -- I mean --


because I was about to ask that question because I thought


you're drawing the distinction between a concession to


provide food and hot dogs and amusement to visitors to the


park, which you say is not covered by the CDA, and it 

seems to me, a contract to provide food and hot dogs


and -- I don't know -- maybe amusement -- I don't know


what they have at PX's -- to members of the armed forces. 


Why isn't at least the latter, although it's a concession


contract, why isn't that clearly for the benefit of the


Government even -- even in the narrow sense in which you


use that term? 


MR. ELWOOD:  No, Justice Scalia.  We would -- we


would agree that that is for the benefit of the


Government.  It's -- it doesn't involve the expenditure of

Government funds, but it's for the benefit of the


Government.  And for this reason --


QUESTION:  So that would be covered by the CDA.


MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I don't believe it necessarily


would because it doesn't involve the expenditure of


Government funds.  It's still private contractors coming


in and being -- and paying the Government for the


opportunity to do that.


But as far as the benefit goes, I think agencies


have a direct interest in providing benefits to their


employees and especially in the PX example because PX's,


for example, are basically a fringe benefit for servicemen


and women and their dependents in that it's -- it's --


basically access is limited to them.  And salary and


fringe benefits of that sort are how agencies procure 

employees.  That is how they attract and retain qualified


personnel.  And in fact, agencies have drawn a distinction


between benefits provided to employees and benefits


provided to the entire public --


QUESTION:  But isn't that the --


QUESTION:  You'd say -- it still isn't covered,


you say, unless the Government pays out cash.  Is that


right?


MR. ELWOOD:  I think that that would be the


better view, but I think obviously a stronger argument

could be made for concessioners.


QUESTION:  Well, why did you say it was not in


the legislative history in that respect?  What -- what is


this?  You -- you quote in your brief -- I just want a


little clarification.  There's a committee report.  The


Senate report says that, quote, concessions contracts do


not constitute contracts for the procurement of goods and


services for the benefit of the Government or otherwise. 


And -- and there's something odd about that statement, but


I got it out of -- you quoted it.  And that seems to be


the legislative history of the act, and apparently it


isn't.  Where -- what's -- what's the status of that


particular remark? 


MR. ELWOOD:  No.  Those are both the -- those


are committee reports --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. ELWOOD:  -- for the 1998 act.  So it's part


of the legislative history.


QUESTION:  So why isn't that legislative


history?


MR. ELWOOD:  Oh, it is -- it is -- I don't


know that I understand your question. 


QUESTION:  It says concessions contracts are not


contracts for procurement of goods and services.

MR. ELWOOD:  That is the act -- the current


concession authority, the current authority under which


the National Park Service issues concession contracts.


QUESTION:  So what we have is in that act --


QUESTION:  That was an act that said they're --


QUESTION:  Yes, I see.  I see.


QUESTION:  -- they're not continuously renewed


with the same --


MR. ELWOOD:  That's correct.  It eliminated


the --


QUESTION:  -- provider.  It was the act that


said, but we're going to terminate these things. 

MR. ELWOOD:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  When did the Park Service first


install this -- when did it first take this position?  It


wasn't just under the regulations, as I understand it. 


When did the Park Service take the position that


concession contracts were not procurement contracts?


MR. ELWOOD:  The first time they took that


position publicly was in 1979 in a Board of Contract


Appeals case, Yosemite Park & Curry Company.  The court --


the IBCA, rather, did not address it, though, because it

was actually before the effective date of the CDA, and


they took it specifically with respect to the CDA there. 


But traditionally -- although it's impossible because of


absence of institutional memory, traditionally concession


contracts have not been viewed as procurement contracts by


the National Park Service.


QUESTION:  But they --


QUESTION:  You indicated that there's a stronger


argument in some instances than in others for the fact


that it's a concession.  A concession contract can be a


procurement contract.  Does that go back to our basic


question about ripeness and we don't know what we're


involved with here?  Or can we take these contracts where,


I take it, they did involve the construction of facilities


at national parks, et cetera, which does benefit the 

Government in the long term?


MR. ELWOOD:  Well, to the extent that the Court


thinks that the specific terms of concession contracts and


what is accomplished under them affects the determination


of whether or not they're procurements, I think that the


Court would have some difficulty in saying authoritatively


whether they all are or an unacceptably high portion of


them are procurement contracts without having a better


idea of what is included with them. 


If I could --

 QUESTION:  But if -- on a case-by-case basis,


then that would indicate the regulation is deficient


because the regulation doesn't purport to -- to use


this -- this kind of fine distinction. 


MR. ELWOOD:  But still it -- it's something that


could be addressed in as-applied challenges where you


could say, in my particular case, where it requires me to


build a lodge or whatever, this is a procurement contract,


and under those circumstances it would be very clear


exactly what was required of the procurement contractor. 


And they could -- they could -- of the concessions


contractor and they could determine whether or not that


particular contract was a procurement.


QUESTION:  The regulation -- the regulation


would then be invalid to that extent.


MR. ELWOOD:  Yes, but the Court has held -- this


Court has indicated in INS versus National Center for


Immigrants' Rights, Babbitt versus Sweet Home, and cases


like that that -- that merely because a regulation is


invalid in some applications, it will not be invalidated


on a facial basis. 


If I could just address specifically --


QUESTION:  Mr. Elwood, is there anyplace we


could look to see how much pre-judgment interest the Park


Service has had to pay each year?  Is it a big-ticket

item?


MR. ELWOOD:  It's not a big-ticket item.  The


only three cases in which the -- the CDA has been applied


to national park concessions are the three IBCA cases


mentioned, and in two of those, the Government wound up


winning on the merits, so there was no pre-judgment


interest paid.  So it's only in that R&R Enterprises case


that the Government would have paid any pre-judgment


interest in this case.


If I could just go to your example, Justice


Kennedy, about the building of buildings on national


parklands.  I believe that is not a procurement for -- for


a variety of reasons.  First, just as a statistical


matter, 78 percent of concessions contracts do not involve


any capital improvements. 


And that is a very broad term. 

It's much broader than just structures.  It's structures,


unremovable property, and fixtures. 


But on the merits, many concessions contractors


have been required, since the very beginning of the --


of -- of concessions, 1872, to require -- they've been


required to build their own buildings.  And historically


that has not been considered something that the Government


gets.  It doesn't get the benefit of those services


because it enters the contracts not for purposes of


getting a building, but because it wishes to have

concessioners provide services to park visitors.  And in


order to do that, it tolerates the building.  The National


Park Service doesn't want buildings in the parks.  It


wants nature in the parks, and it tolerates the buildings


to the extent that they are used to provide visitor


services.  And I think this comes across in the way these


are treated by the contract.


Even though the Government has bare title in


these buildings, in a very real sense it doesn't buy them. 


Every concessioner who builds a building in the national


parks under a concessions agreement will have a leasehold


surrender interest equal to the construction cost of the


building plus inflation minus depreciation.  And they


cannot be put out of that building by anyone until they


are paid that leasehold surrender interest; that is, until 

the building essentially is bought.  As long as a


concessioner is operating out of that building, a


concessioner will hold the leasehold surrender interest,


not the Government. 


Also, I think it's telling that the form


contract indicates that if the concessioner ever leaves


the -- ever abandons the building, ever -- that they have


constructed, that the Government can require them to knock


it down and restore the site to its natural -- its natural


state.  That's section 9b of the standard contract and in

the contract that it's in the joint appendix.  So again,


that's an indication that they're not interested really in


procuring the construction services.  They're interested


in authorizing a concessioner to provide services to


visitors to the national parks. 


Finally, I think it's noteworthy that Congress


obviously knew that concessioners would be building


buildings under the 1998 act, which was enacted against


the backdrop of this regulation setting forth the Park


Service's consistently held view that concessions


contracts are not procurement contracts.  And far from


displacing that view, they actually seem to embrace it


both in the text of the act and in the legislative history


that Justice Breyer mentioned. 


As far as the text of the act goes, I think it's 

telling that -- the different types of language they use


for both the concessions side of the house and the


procurement side of the house.  On the concessions side,


they use distinct language that I don't think you're going


to find in any procurement statute anywhere.  Instead of


saying procure or purchase, they say they -- the -- the


Park Service can authorize concessioners to provide


services, and it even specifies that the services will not


be provided to the Government.  It says they're provided


to visitors, which is obviously very different from

procurement statutes, many of which specifically state


that the service will be provided to the agency.


QUESTION:  Maybe the Park Service wrote that


portion of the committee report.


MR. ELWOOD:  No.  That -- Justice -- Justice


Scalia, that's the actual text of the statute. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. ELWOOD:  And by contrast with that, the


actual text of the procurement provisions of the 1998 --


section 5959, used typical procurement language and


specified that the Park Service will be benefitting from


it.  It says that the -- that the service can enter into


management consultant agreements whereby management


consultants provide services to assist the Secretary in


administering the program. 


So it's a contrast both -- I 

think in both ways. 


Finally, one other thing that I think is telling


is that Congress specifically provided that some of the


most likely to arise disputes under the act, including


specifically franchise-free disputes, which I think people


would think would -- would arise frequently, would be


subject to mandatory arbitration.  And if Congress had


thought there was an administrative remedy for this under


the CDA, I just don't think there would be any need for


them to provide for an -- a mandatory arbitral remedy.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Elwood, is the petitioner right


in saying that -- that when the Government sell goods --


sells goods, that comes under the CDA?


MR. ELWOOD:  That is correct.  Under 602(a)(4),


the -- when the Government disposes of property that is


not -- when the Government -- Government disposes of


personal property, those sales are covered by the CDA. 


However, petitioner has never raised that theory in this


Court -- in any court. 


QUESTION:  Those are not procurement contracts,


are they?


MR. ELWOOD:  No, but they -- they don't purport


to be.  If you look at the CDA, the word procurement is


always used in the clause for procurement of services,


procurement of construction, repair. 


And -- and that was 

tacked on at the end basically because GSA at the time


subjected sales contracts to the same dispute clause, that


was problematic, that procurement contracts were.  But


that still -- in order to get coverage under the CDA under


petitioner's theory, they still must be a procurement


contract or must involve the procurement of services. 


If there are no further questions from the


Court.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Elwood.


Mr. Geller, you have 2 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GELLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


The complaint -- the complaint in this case was


filed under the authority of 28 U.S.C. 1491(b).  The Court


will find that at page 13 of the joint appendix.  And


that -- that statute provides for district court


jurisdiction to adjudicate challenges to the terms of


proposed Government contracts.  And I think if you look at


paragraph 62 and 114 of the joint -- of the complaint,


which is in the joint appendix, you'll see the allegations


that were made in the complaint to fall within that


provision of -- of title 28.


As to the substance of the CDA claim, the


Government makes much of the fact that no, quote, 

Government funds were used here.  And I cannot stress


enough that that is a phrase that they've invented for the


purposes of this case.  It makes much of the fact that the


concessioners received monies here from the visitors to


the national park, remit some of it to the NPS as a


franchise fee, and keep the rest of it.  But these


contracts could just have easily been structured so that


the NPS got all the money in the first instance, kept some


of it as a franchise fee, and paid the rest of it back to


the concessioners.  And in fact, some Government

concessions contracts are written that way.  In that case,


even the Government, I think, would have to concede that


Government funds were used.  We can't believe that the CDA


coverage of the CDA, these important procedural and


substantive protections, turns on such flimsy


determinations as to who gets the money in the first


instance. 


Now, secondly, we -- we've already talked about


the fact that so many services are being provided here


that are for the use and benefit of the Government, as


well as for the visitors of the national parks. 


But I also want to point out that the Government


is the sole beneficiary of the contractual provisions in


virtually every concessions contract requiring the


construction, repair, and maintenance of facilities in the 

national parks.  You know, if the Court will look, for


example, at page 96 of the joint appendix, which is a -- a


provision of the Grand Canyon contract that's in the


record, you'll see there that this contract -- under this


the contract, the NPS is there procuring maintenance,


repair, housekeeping, and groundskeeping for all


concessions facilities.  It seems to us if you look at the


language of that -- of that procurement and compare it to


section 3(a)(3) of the CDA, which -- which provides that


CDA coverage for contracts for the procurement of


61 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

construction or repair or maintenance of real property,


it's impossible to conclude, I think, that this


procurement contract doesn't fall within the CDA.


Thank you. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Geller.


The Court wishes supplemental briefs on the


issue of ripeness, simultaneous briefs, due 3:00 p.m.


Friday. 


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
