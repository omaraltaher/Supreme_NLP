CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-8286, Delma Banks v. Doug Dretke.


Mr. Kendall.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H. KENDALL


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. KENDALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This case presents three issues, two arising


from purposeful and recurring misconduct by the trial


prosecutors, and a third from constitutionally deficient


defense counsel.  Prior to trial, the prosecutors promised


to disclose discoverable material to the defense.  They


knew that Robert Farr would testify as a key witness at


each phase of trial, and they knew that he was an


informant and had been paid for his services.


Mr. Farr did in fact take the stand at both


phases of this trial.  He denied he was an informant.  He


denied he received any consideration for his work.  He


denied tipping off the authorities that Mr. Banks would be


taking a trip to Dallas.  He denied setting up Mr. Banks


for arrest. The prosecutors knew that when Mr. Farr gave


his testimony it was not truthful.  They did not rise to


their feet and ask Mr. Farr to correct this testimony.

 QUESTION: And it - is it your contention that


this is a basis simply for setting aside the sentencing


phase of the trial?


MR. KENDALL: We have asked this Court to affirm


the district court, who - who did grant relief on death


sentence.  We're not asking for relief on guilt innocence


on - on the Mr. Farr claim.


QUESTION: All right.  I'm - I'm - I'm somewhat


puzzled by that, but you have three different claims to


discuss here and I don't want to take too long.  It - it


would seem to me that, if it - if - if this is the


evidence at trial, that - that there's no additional


obligation or special obligation at sentencing where that


becomes really a secondary matter.


MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, the reason why we take


that position is that his testimony at the punishment


phase is absolutely critical for the state to get the


death penalty in this case.  The district court recognized


that.  The Fifth Circuit in this case said that that


testimony was crucial.  What he told the jury was that Mr.


Banks had returned to Dallas to get a gun so that Mr.


Banks could on the return trip commit armed robberies and


take care of and eliminate witnesses.


There was no other testimony that came close to


matching that at the punishment phase, and the state had

the burden to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.


Banks would be a danger in the future.  If they didn't


satisfy that -


QUESTION: Well, but - but you - you have the


burden, don't you, to show that the outcome would have


been - would have been different had the - had the state


come clean at the beginning?  And as I understand it, you


- you assert that - that he would not - a jury would not


have judged him as harshly if the jury had known that he


was going to get the gun in order that Farr could commit


robberies with - with apparently his assistance, rather


than what Farr had told them, namely that he had gotten


the gun in order that he would commit future robberies,


right?  And you think that would have made the difference,


whether he's getting the gun to let somebody else kill or


getting the gun to kill himself?


MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, Mr. Banks denied at


trial that he had any intent to commit any crime


whatsoever with regard to this robbery.  And Mr. Farr had


made it clear -


QUESTION: Understand.  But - but - but you're


saying he admitted that - that he got the gun so that Farr


could commit robberies, right?


MR. KENDALL: We think there's a world of -


QUESTION: And that would have - would have -

would have tapped a wellspring of mercy in the - in the


jury's breast?  I - I don't really see how it would make


that much difference.


MR. KENDALL: No, Your Honor.  The point is - is


that the - the state could not ask the jury to impose the


death sentence unless it first found beyond a reasonable


doubt that Mr. - there was a strong likelihood that Mr.


Banks would commit acts of violence in the future.  We


think there's a clear difference, and the trial


prosecutors recognized this, between Mr. Banks going to


get a gun so that Mr. Banks could rob and kill, as opposed


to providing instrumentality.


But more importantly, Your Honor, Mr. Farr


recanted that testimony at the Federal hearing and that


recantation was found credible by the district court.


QUESTION: Recanted what testimony?


MR. KENDALL: No one had the intent to rob


anybody.  That was a ruse that Mr. Farr used -


QUESTION: Banks admitted that himself.


MR. KENDALL: No.  Mr. Banks admitted on the


stand that he had finally agreed to accompany Mr. Farr to


Dallas to get a gun.  But Mr. Farr denied - Mr. Banks


denied that he had any intent whatsoever to commit any


crime, and he flatly denied that assertion.  Mr. Farr -


this was a ruse that Mr. -

 QUESTION: What - what - what was - what was the


gun going to be obtained for?  Self-defense?


MR. KENDALL: It was -


QUESTION: These people were being -


MR. KENDALL: - it was a ruse -


QUESTION: - threatened by somebody?


MR. KENDALL: Justice Scalia, it was a ruse that


Mr. Farr used that was not true -


QUESTION: Oh, that - that explains -


MR. KENDALL: - to -


QUESTION: - why Farr got it.  It doesn't explain


why Banks got it.


MR. KENDALL: But that was not the theory that


the case - that the prosecutors asked the jury to conclude


beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Farr would - that Mr.


Banks would be dangerous in the future.  The district


court granted relief on that and we think that clearly we


have shown materiality on that point.


QUESTION: As to materiality -


QUESTION: But he - I take it you do not agree


that you have to show that the result would have been


different?


MR. KENDALL: We - we do not agree with that.  In


fact, we believe that this Court has not retired the


Alcorta and Napue standard, and - and it shouldn't use

this case.  The - the standard in Alcorta and Napue that


says if the Government puts up perjured testimony, that if


there's a possibility that that testimony affected the


judgment or if the judgment is reversed.  We do


acknowledge that this Court in Brecht did provide a rule


generally for habeas corpus that is different from that


rule.  But it said in footnote 9 of that decision that


where there are cases where there was a pattern of


misconduct, that the Brecht rule might not apply.  There


is clearly a pattern of misconduct by the Government in


this case. 


QUESTION: Well, you have to show cause and


prejudice, and I thought that under Strickler, the - the


necessity of showing prejudice requires that you show that


there is a reasonable probability that the sentence would


have been different.


MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, we've not -

obligation to show reasonable probability -

do that or?


MR. KENDALL: On - on cause, we do, Your Honor,


and we - we - we've met that clearly.  So it's our


submission here that Mr. Farr's testimony was critical -


QUESTION: Alcorta was a case on direct review?


MR. KENDALL: It was a habeas case, Your Honor,


but the Court has not distinguished between -


QUESTION: But decided long before a lot of our


other habeas cases, which have somewhat limited the


relief?


MR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor, but the


Court, since Brecht, in - in subsequent cases, in - in


Kyles and in Strickler, has continued to refer to the fact


that there's this category of misconduct that has always


been treated differently, and we do not see why it


shouldn't be applied here.  However, we believe that,


given the importance of Farr in this case to the state's


case that we meet the reasonable probability standard, or


whatever the - other standard the Court would impose on


us.


The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court -


QUESTION: May I ask you whether the record shows


that counsel for Banks and Banks thought Farr was an


informant back in 1980?


MR. KENDALL: There was repeated effort by trial

counsel to answer that question.  At a pre-trial hearing,


counsel specifically asked the chief investigator, who's


your informant?  And the investigator said, I'm not going


to tell you.  When Mr. Farr was on the stand, both at the


guilt phase and at the sentencing phase, counsel asked,


are you working for the state, are you an informant?


QUESTION: Well, so there was a suspicion of that


back in `80?


MR. KENDALL: And I think after trial, given the


-


were -


QUESTION: But then 16 years went by.


MR. KENDALL:  Yes, Your Honor, because there


QUESTION: And - and this wasn't evidence that


was under lock and key.  There were witnesses.  They just


weren't easily available.


MR. KENDALL: Your - Your Honor, there was - it


was very difficult for us to obtain this proof.  We - we


had every right to belief the - given the fact that the


prosecutors had said, Mr. Farr has been truthful with you


in every way, that whoever the informant was in this case,


it was not Robert Farr.


We only began to think differently about this


when we finally got access to another of the critical


state witnesses, Charles Cook, who told us in 1992 that

some of his testimony was not truthful. 


QUESTION: Suppose we find that the - or - or


conclude that the defense counsel was not as diligent as


it ought to have been on this point.  Is that somehow


excused by the prosecution's failure to present the Brady


material?


MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, we think that we acted


reasonably and diligently in post-conviction.  We were


misled by the state, and in fact, we used that state


habeas - we filed in - in - in 1992 the claim on


information belief Farr was an informant in this case.


QUESTION: Well, it's - there's perhaps a slight


difference in being misled and simply a - a case in which


the prosecution does not come forward with Brady material. 


There - they may be some distinction in the two.  What is


the standard that you would have us apply in this case to


rule for you with reference - if - if we base that ruling


on the prosecution's failure?  Is it just a standard


Brady?


MR. KENDALL: That would be under Strickler.  Our


view is that because of the misrepresentations in this


case, we were - we were allowed to rely on those


misrepresentations.  We wanted to litigate Farr's


informant status in the state habeas proceedings, but we


couldn't get the evidence to prove that.

 QUESTION: What -


QUESTION: But specifically the


misrepresentations were what?


MR. KENDALL: Were that Farr had - had - had


denied that he was a paid informant.  He was a paid


informant, and the prosecutors in their closing arguments


told the jury that he had been completely -


QUESTION: Okay.


MR. KENDALL: - truthful in every way with you. 


QUESTION: Had they also not given, or - or


before trial had they not also said, we'll give you


everything in the file?


MR. KENDALL: They said, you don't have to file a


discovery motion, we will disclose to you material that is


discoverable, and this clearly was discoverable material -


QUESTION: Okay.


QUESTION: - when they put him on the witness -


QUESTION: But they didn't - the defendant didn't


ask to discover anything.  The prosecutor said, you know,


everything is available to you.


MR. KENDALL: He -


QUESTION: What did - what - what did he ask for? 


What did defendant ask for?


MR. KENDALL: He filed a standard discovery


motion, but the - the Government long before that said,

you don't have to file a motion, we'll provide material


that's discoverable to you.  And there's no argument - the


- the state has tried to say that it, even by calling an


informant, it does not have to reveal -


QUESTION: Did - did -


MR. KENDALL: - that status.


QUESTION: - did - did the defendant get anything


after the prosecutor said, you don't have to file any


formal motion, we'll give you everything you're entitled


to?


MR. KENDALL: It - the prosecution revealed prior


convictions on its witnesses.  It did not disclose Mr.


Farr's informant status or arrangement.  It did not


disclose with regard to Charles Cook.


QUESTION: Were there documents -


QUESTION: Okay, but -


QUESTION: Were there documents or arrest reports


to show Farr's informant status, or was this just a - a -


a circumstance where the prosecution should have said


orally that this is his status?


MR. KENDALL: When we finally obtained what was


represented to us to be the full prosecution file in this


case, there was not one notation in there with regard to


Mr. Farr, identifying him as an informant.  They were


obliged to -

QUESTION: You're complaining that the - that -


that a statement was not made by the prosecution?


MR. KENDALL: That - that we believe the law


required them, once they decided to put this informant on


the stand, to disclose that factor to the defense.


QUESTION: Because it was Brady material?


MR. KENDALL: Because it was Brady material.


QUESTION: All right.  Now, may I go back to


Justice Ginsburg's question?  You - you - you gave us some


examples of - of material that was turned over to you


under this policy in - in which it was not necessary to


file a motion.  Was that material turned over you in


response - to you in response to a specific request from


you, or did they simply come up with this and say, this is


the material that you could get if you moved for it?


MR. KENDALL: It was turned over after a general


discovery motion was filed, but that discovery motion was


never taken up at a hearing.  This was disclosed -


QUESTION: All right.  Did the general discovery


motion refer specifically to what they gave you, or was


the motion simply, give us everything we're entitled to?


MR. KENDALL: It - I believe it said give us

prior convictions.  And -


QUESTION: Well, then that was what they gave


you.


MR. KENDALL: And that's all that they provided,


that's correct.


QUESTION: I mean, the problem that I'm - I'm


having with this is, I thought at - and - and I - I - I


got into this myself, I realize, but I thought they had


said, in effect, we'll give you everything you're entitled


to.  Now we're getting down to greater detail, and I think


the problem is mine, but I want to follow it through. 


They apparently said, you don't have to file a specific


motion.  Justice Ginsburg raises the question, well, what


did you ask for even though you didn't have to file a


specific motion?


You say that you filed a general discovery


request that specifically did ask for prior convictions. 


They gave you prior convictions.  My concern is that the


understanding between counsel was, we'll give you what you


ask for, but we are not volunteering by our representation


to give you anything you don't ask for.  If this is


correct, then the only reason you would be entitled to


this would be an affirmative Brady obligation, whether you


ask for it or not.


Is it the Brady obligation or do you think they

had undertaken something more extensive than Brady


required?


MR. KENDALL: I think that they assured counsel


that whether it was - whether they had to disclose


something under state law or under Brady, that there was


no need for litigation. 

They would provide Brady


material -


QUESTION: But did they assure counsel that


counsel would not have to ask for it?


MR. KENDALL: The letter - the letter says, you


do not have to file a motion, we'll provide you with


material that the law requires us to disclose -


QUESTION: That the law requires us to disclose?


MR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION: Material.  I - I would take that to


mean documents that we have that you're entitled to, and


we don't know that there are any documents reflecting -


reflecting Farr's informer status, do we?


MR. KENDALL: But, Your Honor, it said in lieu of


a motion, and so I think it was fair for counsel to


include that there needed to be no litigation about


discovery -


QUESTION: Well -


MR. KENDALL: - that the Government understood


what state law and Federal law required.

think counsel -


QUESTION: Please answer that question.


MR. KENDALL: I'm sorry.


QUESTION: Did you ever ask the prosecution


whether Farr was an informant?


MR. KENDALL: At trial, there's nothing in the


record where the prosecution was specifically asked.  It's


state habeas.  We pled a - a claim on information belief


that he was a paid informant.  That required the


government lawyer who was - who was one of the trial


prosecutors to respond, we believed, truthfully.  He did


not respond to that, and that -


QUESTION: Now, when was this?


MR. KENDALL: That was in state post-conviction


proceedings, and the - and he has was required to respond


truthfully to that, and under state law that -


QUESTION: He didn't respond falsely.  He just


didn't respond.


MR. KENDALL: But under state law that is a no,


that is a denial.

QUESTION: A failure to respond is a no, rather


than - than a yes?


MR. KENDALL: Any - any factual allegation of petition


that is not addressed specifically in the answer is


treated as -


QUESTION: So as a -


MR. KENDALL: - a denial.


QUESTION: And - and in addition -


QUESTION: It was more than that though, wasn't


it?  It - they - in - in fact, the state put it in a


general denial.  It denied each and every allegation of


the complaint, including the allegation that Farr was an


informer.


MR. KENDALL: Well, it's clear that when you read


their answer that the state had denied our allegation that


Mr. Farr was a paid informant in this case.


QUESTION: And they had in effect at trial in the


jury argument vouched for his truth, as I understand it. 


MR. KENDALL: On - on both at the guilt innocence


phase and at the punishment phase.


QUESTION: Yeah.


QUESTION: That - that's the most shocking thing. 


Do - do we know that - that counsel who allowed Farr to

lie on the stand, and indeed went on to argue to the jury


about Farr's testimony, do we know that counsel knew that


that was a lie?


MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, there aren't -


QUESTION: I mean, you - well, you can argue it


was his responsibility, you know, but I'm not talking


about whether it was his responsibility.


MR. KENDALL: Mr. Elliott gave an affidavit in


state post-conviction that said that he was aware of all


the facts pursuant to the investigation and the


presentation of evidence in this case.  I would think


that, given Farr's important status in this case, there's


no doubt that he knew.  At the Federal evidentiary


hearing, he did not in any way try to say that he did not


know that Farr's - was - had this informant status until


much later at the trial.

Banks and I take it - tell - you want to talk to us about

Cooksey in the - in - in the sentencing phase.


MR. KENDALL: Let - let me - we - let me go to


the Cook claim if I could.  There was another very


troubling due process claim raised in this case, and that


was at the key guilt phase witness.  Mr. Cook had


testified pursuant to a deal and that the state had


withheld impeachment material on him.  Three months before


the evidentiary in the hearing in this case, we received


for the first time a lengthy pre-trial statement that had


all kinds of impeachment material in that and that showed


beyond any doubt that Mr. Cook had lied in his testimony


before the jury that he had not in any way, shape, or form


rehearsed his testimony with the state.


From the time of that disclosure until the


evidentiary hearing, it was clear that this transcript


would serve as evidence for us to prove up our claim that


the state had suppressed material, impeachment material,


on Mr. Cook.  And Mr. Elliott, the trial prosecutor -


QUESTION: What - what did Cook testify to that


was - that was essential to the - to the sentence?


MR. KENDALL: This was the - the key guilt phase


witness, Your Honor.  He was the - the entire narrative of


the crime in the -


QUESTION: Yeah, but you're - you're - you're not


asking for the guilt to be - to be overturned.  You're

asking for the sentence to be.


MR. KENDALL: With regard to the - Mr. Farr,


we're asking only for sentence relief.  With regard to


Cook, we're saying he was the crucial guilt phase witness.


QUESTION: So you're asking for reversal of the


conviction on the basis of Cook?


MR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION: Okay.  What - now, what - what was


essential to the conviction that - that he testified to?


MR. KENDALL: He - he provided - he had to - the


- the prosecutor in his opening statement told the jury,


Mr. Cook is our critical witness, you have to believe him


for us to win this case.  He said that over and over


again.  Cook presented the confession -


QUESTION: Well, he testified that the defendant


confessed to him several times, didn't he?


MR. KENDALL: He - he was the only person who


provided information that Mr. Banks had confessed.  He was


the only person that tied Mr. Cook to - Mr. Banks to any


other evidence in this case.  The trial prosecutor


portrayed him accurately.  He was the critical witness for


the Government at the - at the guilt phase of trial.


QUESTION: And - and what do you say the state


withheld with regard to Cook?  That it had gone over his


testimony in - in advance?

 MR. KENDALL: Well, what he was asked, the first


question on cross-examination was, who have you talked to


about your testimony?  He said nobody.  He said, you


haven't talked to any about this case?  I haven't spoken


to anybody.  That was a bald-faced lie. 


QUESTION: Well, it's on its face incredible


anyway.  You think the jury believed it?


MR. KENDALL: Well, Your Honor, the -


QUESTION: They think the prosecutors can just


put him on without even asking him what he was going to


testify about?


MR. KENDALL: Well, they certainly would - they


certainly would have believed that if the Government would


have disclosed this transcript that showed that three days


before trial Mr. Cook had a very difficult time keeping


his narrative about this crime straight.


QUESTION: How - how does that work?  When this


occurs and - and this - these questions are set forth in


footnote 4 of your brief - when this occurs, does a Brady


obligation arise at that point?


MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, I think that -


QUESTION: I'm the - I'm the prosecutor, I'm


sitting there, I hear this guy say that he's never talked


to me and I know that he has and I know that I have 71 or


74 pages of notes.  Do I now have a Brady obligation?

 MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, for decades the Court


has said that when a government witness lies, the


government attorney has the obligation to correct that. 


The Brady obligation continues, it's pre-trial and it's


during trial.  It can arise during trial depending on - on


what the government witness says, and it's clear that


after Cook gave that answer, that the Government was


obligated, one, to have him correct his testimony, but


certainly not, after he'd given that testimony, to get up


in front of the jury and say, Mr. Cook was completely


truthful.


QUESTION: But my question is, is there a Brady


obligation?


MR. KENDALL: There is a Brady obligation,


absolutely.


QUESTION: Well, now, is your point - your point


is more than just that he said it, he didn't admit that he


had talked to other people before trial, is it?


MR. KENDALL: No, no, no, because it - it was


clear that what the defense was trying to show was that


Mr. Cook should not be believed because he's really been


worked over by the prosecutors to get his story together. 


And that's exactly what the transcript that wasn't


disclosed demonstrated.  He was mocked during this pre-


trial statement by the prosecutors who were preparing him

because he was making so many mistakes and getting things


all out of order.


They didn't believe he was a credible witness


three or four days before trial, and the only reason that


he was, or might have appeared credible, was because of


this session.  This was classic impeachment material.  The


Government had this in their briefcase at trial.  They -


they disclosed the - the brief statement that Mr. Cook had


given four minutes before but not this one.


QUESTION: But you lost on this point in the - in


the Federal court?


MR. KENDALL: Unfortunately, Justice Ginsburg, we


did not lose on it.  The district court did not adjudicate


that claim.


QUESTION: But your time - your - your light's


flashing, and I - when you come back, I'd appreciate your


asking - answering one factual question I have on this. 


In 1996, you're in Federal court with five witnesses about


Farr being a - an informant.  In 1992, you say you learned


from Cook information that led you to think you'd find


those witnesses.  In 1992 and `93, you are in state


habeas.  Why did you not either engage in that kind of


discovery in state habeas or find those witnesses for the


state habeas court?


MR. KENDALL: Because we - efforts were made, we

could not find Farr.  But we - efforts were made, and we


could not find Farr, but we went right to the horse's


mouth.  James Elliott, the prosecutor in this case, knew


that he was a paid informant.  When we raised that claim


in our petition, he had an obligation then to - to tell us


honestly was he an informant or was he not, and he did not


do so.


We wanted to litigate his status, Farr's status


in the state court.  We were prevented from doing so


because of the lack of candor and the lack of discovery


from the prosecutor.  He could have made this very simple


and said, yes he's the guy, let's litigate this in state


court.  He didn't do so.


Let me turn briefly to the ineffective


assistance claim.  The district court granted relief on


that claim after hearing information that this Court has


said time and again is relevant to the capital sentencing


process.  The Fifth Circuit overturned that grant of


relief by making a - two legal mistakes.  First, unlike


the district court, and - and not following the decisions


from this Court, the - the Court vulcanized its review of


our mitigating evidence instead of looking at it in its


entirety and weighing that against the aggravation.


It broke this evidence up into three categories


and said, looking at each one, weighing these on the

QUESTION: What - what categories were -


MR. KENDALL: There was mental health evidence. 


There was testimony about Mr. Vetrano Jefferson recanting


his testimony that - about who was the - who had been the


aggressor in a fight before this crime, and then the


testimony offered by the parents in this case.


QUESTION: All going to guilt or some going to


sentencing?


MR. KENDALL: All - all going to sentence, Your


Honor.  This was -


QUESTION: All going to sentencing?


MR. KENDALL: This was only about sentence, Your


Honor, that's correct.

in the - and I think he even said that they were good


parents, didn't he?


MR. KENDALL: Your Honor -


QUESTION: And - and - and the fact that they


were these horrible parents were - was going to be


testified to by a Dr. Pina, is that it?


MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, there was no claim that


these were horrible parents.  They were loving parents,


but they was a very troubled family that Mr. Banks -

had been subjected to all kinds of problems because of his


very serious dermalogical ailment that he had from birth


all through his life.

the children.  She often had to take the children and


leave the house to assure her safety and Mr. Bank's safety


and his siblings' safety.


QUESTION: She testified to that?


MR. KENDALL: She - she proffered that in state


court, that's correct, Your Honor.  And then the experts,


Mr. Cunningham in Federal Court, testified about what all


this does to an individual in the formative years of life.

the victim for his car?

of offender for whom the death penalty needs to be carried


out against.


I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for


rebuttal.


QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Kendall.


Ms. Bunn, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENA BUNN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. BUNN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


From 1983 to 1996, Banks filed three separate


state habeas applications raising numerous claims, but


Banks failed to diligently pursue his current Brady and


Strickland claims during these state proceedings.  He


elected instead to expend his efforts pursuing other


claims.  It wasn't until Federal habeas proceedings that

he turned his efforts to developing the instant claims.


QUESTION: Did - did the state deny in one of


these habeas applications, deny that Farr was an


informant?


MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, the state never denied


it.  It did fill -


QUESTION: Well, now wait a minute -


QUESTION: Then explain to me what was -


QUESTION: - in - in - in the state habeas


proceeding, the state submitted a response to the


petitioner's petition and denied all the allegations in


the petition, which included the assertion that Farr was a


paid informant and that the state had withheld that


information from Banks.  The state denied that, did it


not?


MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor.  It is not our


interpretation of the record that it did, because this


single sentence found in a 145-page petition was buried in


a - basically a laundry list of claims of prosecutorial


misconduct, at the end of that section containing a great


number of other allegations, which the state responded to


specifically by saying, first a number of them had been


addressed in other sections of the brief, including the


Swain claim, and another Brady claim that was fully


developed.  And then it responded to the remaining claims

by saying that they were all procedural - procedurally


defaulted based on the lack of a contemporaneous


objection.


QUESTION: Ms. Bunn, did not the state say, we


deny each and every factual allegation in this complaint?


MS. BUNN: Yes.  There was a general denial at


the beginning of the - the state's answer to the 145-page


brief.  However, the context -


QUESTION: You better be careful what you deny,


don't you think?  I mean, each and every would include


that, even if it's buried in, you know, if it's buried in


a lot of other stuff.  I mean, you could have said, you


know, everything's so buried we can't tell what's what,


but you didn't say that.  You said, we deny each and


every.


that -


MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, and it does appear


QUESTION: Is it that the case that - do you now


concede that Farr was paid something for his information -


MS. BUNN: Yes.


QUESTION: - by the state.


MS. BUNN: Yes.  Well, not for information.  He


was paid to assist police in obtaining the murder weapon.


QUESTION: Yeah.  And did the state prosecutor


ever disclose that during the trial, even though he said,

QUESTION: He knew - he knew that Farr was


testifying falsely and he - he let that testimony go, and


indeed relied on it in his summation to the jury?


MS. BUNN: What the trial prosecutor knew -


there's nothing in the record to indicate the trial


prosecutors actually knew about the money that Bank - that


- that Farr was paid several months before the trial in


this case by - by police investigators.


QUESTION: But isn't he charged with knowledge of


what the organization as a whole did?


MS. BUNN: In the - in the Brady disclosure


context, certainly he is.


QUESTION: Wasn't it representative of the police


there at the trial the whole time to assist the


prosecutor?


MS. BUNN: Not that - not that I'm aware of that


the police were at the - at - really have testified in the


trial.  But I believe the rule was invoked in the trial,


so he did not sit in on - on Farr's testimony or any of


the other state's witnesses' testimony.  But -


QUESTION: Well, I assume we have to take this


case on the - the premise that the state somehow knew that


the state had paid the money to Farr, and I guess also had

promised some kind of a break not making certain criminal


charges?


MS. BUNN: There is no evidence of any inducement


of that kind to Farr in this case, no evidence of any kind


of inducement whether financial or a break in - in any


convictions for his testimony, contingent upon his


testimony in this case.  That's what distinguishes it from


cases like Bagley and Giglio.


QUESTION: But are you saying that because he was


paid to help get the gun back rather than to testify


falsely?


MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor.  That is correct.


QUESTION: So that he was paid for a critical


role in the scenario that led to the indictment, rather


than post-indictment false testimony.


MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor.  That is correct. 


But again, as far as the cause issue goes, and there is no


dispute that the claim is procedurally defaulted to - due


to Banks' failure to develop it in - in the state court. 


The dispute is whether he has established cause, and the -


the basis - the focus of the inquiry in cause is the


petitioner's conduct, and in this case, the state record


makes clear that Banks was aware of this claim and


actually alleged the claim in the petition itself.


QUESTION: Well, does the petitioner's awareness

that there is a - a claim supersede the prosecution's


obligation to disclose Brady material, and to disclose the


fact that one of its own witnesses lied on the stand?


MS. BUNN: Not that it supersedes the obligation


under Brady, but it does preclude a finding of cause in a


case like this where the nondisclosure -


QUESTION: So the prosecution can lie and conceal


and the prisoner still has the burden to - to discover the


evidence?  That's your position?


MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, because in a case


like this, unlike Strickler, unlike Amadeo, this is more


like - more like McCleskey, where the nondisclosure,


whether in trial court or in state habeas, did not prevent


the petitioner from developing the claim.


QUESTION: But it didn't prevent it absolutely,


but it made it pretty tough, didn't it?  I mean, the -


sitting there in January, the prosecution has been not -


been denying nonstop that Farr has been paid anything,


they're beginning to get some information maybe that isn't


true.  The prosecution is still denying it by denying the


allegation, and they think they're going to have to find


somebody who will prove - who will say that, and they


can't find Farr.


So what are - what were they supposed to be


doing?  They were looking for witnesses.  They couldn't

find Farr.  The prosecution isn't telling them the truth


apparently.  And so, what - what is it that they should


have done?


MS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, this case does not


present a situation where there is a record developed on


what efforts Banks expended on this case.  There's nothing


in the record to indicate that Banks' counsel pursued this


claim, that they sent investigators out to try to find


Farr.  There's absolutely nothing -


QUESTION: I didn't say that.  What I said was, I


was repeating what he said, that - and when they filed it


in January - I don't want to repeat it again, you heard


what he said too - and he said they're just learning from


Cook some time in 1992 that it might be possible to get


evidence that would show what the prosecution was saying


was false.


So I want your opinion.  You say it's quite


clear that they should have investigated this further. 


Really?  Because?


MS. BUNN: Because they were obviously aware of


the claim, aware of the potential existence of the claim. 


They requested no investigative assistance regarding the


claim.  They investigated no discovery regarding the


claim.  They - while they - what they did do was expend


what at that point were pretty extensive resources

pursuing and developing their Swain claim and another


Brady claim.


QUESTION: But you want us to say that the - that


the defendant relies on his peril, at his peril, on the


representations of the - of prosecution?


MS. BUNN: At - in - in a case like this where,


unlike Strickler, where the evidence, the - the


nondisclosed evidence was not in the sole possession of


the state.  It was discoverable as - as actually


ultimately have it in habeas, in - in Federal habeas


proceedings.  Banks was able to procure this evidence.


QUESTION: No, but you are - are - aren't you


arguing, just as Justice Kennedy suggested, that what they


should have done in this case is to go to the court and


say, we want further resources to investigate, and what


specifically we want to investigate is an issue which, if


we are correct, the state is affirmatively lying about. 


We want investigative resources to prove that state's


counsel is lying.  Isn't that your position?


MS. BUNN: Well, yes, Your Honor -


QUESTION: And for failure to do that -


MS. BUNN: - that would be -


QUESTION: - for failure to do that, they're out. 


Isn't that your position?


MS. BUNN: That is part of our position, that

essentially the absence of that, the absence of a request


for investigative assistance, the absence of any -


QUESTION: But, in the - in the - in the face of


the state's representation.  In other words, if - if they


asked for it, I assume the state would have said, well,


we've told them that there isn't anything to this.  And -


and - and you would - you're saying that they should have


pursued it in the face of that for the purpose, among


other things, of proving that state's counsel was lying to


them?


MS. BUNN: Your Honor, they - there was an


obligation from them to pursue the claim further, yes.


QUESTION: Why wasn't there an obligation on the


part of the prosecutor, having deceived the jury and the


court, to come clean?  Why is the burden on the defendant,


who was subjected to false testimony?  Why is - and the


prosecutor knows it - why isn't it the prosecutor's burden


to come clean at any stage, rather than let this falsehood


remain in this record?


I just don't understand why it becomes the


defendant's burden when the prosecutor is best situated to


have the information, was this true or not, did we pay


this informant or not.  Why isn't that a continuing


obligation on any lawyer who makes a representation that's


false to a court?

 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, the first - first it is


not - that's not the question.  It is the habeas


petitioner's burden to allege and prove - provide


evidentiary support for his claim.


QUESTION: Well, but it is the question if - if


Justice Ginsburg is right, that prosecutors have a


continuing obligation.


MS. BUNN: Well, that obligation is essentially


triggered by materiality, so you have that working as


well.  But that does not - the - the state's continuing


obligation does not basically preclude a finding of - of -


of no cause in a case like this.


QUESTION: Well, if I were a defense counsel, I


could think of a - of a - no more damaging material of


cross-examination in this case than to show Farr was paid


money to come up with the story.


MS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, again, that - that


was not the - those are not the facts of this case. 


There's no evidence and - and Farr has not said in post-


conviction that he was paid for testimony.


QUESTION: Yeah, that's true, but I - I mean,


what -


QUESTION: But I think it's even -


QUESTION: - what bothers me about your position


is, if we were to say that a defense counsel behaves

unreasonably when he relies upon an explicit statement of


the prosecutor's, such as I deny the allegation, that's to


say that the justice system lacks integrity, and indeed it


might contribute to that lack of integrity to impose this


kind of obligation and thereby excuse a prosecutor under


circumstances like this.


MS. BUNN: But to find cause in a case like this


would essentially be to hold that a Brady claim can never


be defaulted because -


QUESTION: Of course it can.  All that it


requires is that a prosecutor who says, my files are open,


who says that we do not, in fact, deny that we paid money


for a related purpose to the witness, all it requires is


that he be telling the truth.


MS. BUNN: And I want to focus also on the - on


the record itself and what Banks - Farr was never asked


specifically whether he was a police informant, so he


never denied that allegation.  At the guilt innocence


phase, starting - it - it's in the joint appendix at page


37 - in the middle of questioning by defense counsel at


the guilt innocence phase about his drug - prior drug use


and his drug habit, he - Farr was asked the question, and


have you ever taken any money from some police officers? 


And he answered no.


This was a false statement, but not to be

construed as necessarily as a denial that he was a police


informant, particularly given the context of the


questioning.  Later in the guilt innocence, he was asked -


QUESTION: May I just interrupt with one


question?  But isn't it even more significant that his


real role in the - in the whole story is that he was the


person used by the police as an excuse to go up and get


the gun back two weeks after Banks had left it there,


whereas the record left the impression that Banks himself


wanted that gun to commit future robberies, without any


explanation of the fact that the - that two weeks went by


without any such request?


And then when Farr gets in the picture, they go


up to get the gun, and then Farr says, because Banks


insisted on it, which is not only false, but improbable


and terribly prejudicial at the - at the sentencing


hearing.


MS. BUNN: Again, though, the - the materiality


of Farr's - of this nondisclosure has to be - there are


several factors that have to be assessed in that - in that


issue.  First, the fact that Farr wasn't paid for his


testimony, and the impeachment value of the informant


status itself is limited to the mere fact that Farr had


acted as a police informant in this case and had assisted


police in obtaining the murder weapon.  But that

impeachment did not extend to any inference that Farr had


testified favorably for the state because he had any


financial or any other kind of incentive to do so.


QUESTION: What - what -


QUESTION: But it - it was diametrically opposed


to the notion that he wanted to get the gun to commit


robbery, as whereas the real purpose of the whole venture


is to get the gun to give to the police.


MS. BUNN: But Farr's subjective intent did not


undermine Banks' intent, and Banks actually admitted at


the punishment phase -


QUESTION: Banks' intent as revealed in Farr's


testimony, which is the only evidence in supporting that


theory that Banks was dangerous for that reason.


MS. BUNN: The difference is, Farr's testimony


was - indicated that Banks was - had the intent himself to


participate in the robberies, and Banks limited that to


being willing essentially to - to abet Farr in - in


committing those robberies.


QUESTION: What - what page of the transcript


that you - you cited page 37.  Is that in the joint


appendix?


MS. BUNN: Yes, joint appendix.  That's the -


QUESTION: And that is the - that is the


confession of - I'm sorry - that - that is the perjury -

What police officers -


QUESTION: Of course, this doesn't - this doesn't


deal with whether he has - was a police informer.  It - it


deals with whether the police officers promised you


anything.


MS. BUNN: Yes, yes, that's correct.  And that -


the denial of that, of course, is - is not fault, because


there's nothing in subsequent testimony to indicate that's


- that's untrue.


QUESTION: Have you ever taken any money from


some police officers?  No.


MS. BUNN: Yes.  That is a false statement. 


However, it can - it's - it is far afield to interpret


that as a denial of being a police informant.


QUESTION: Where - where - where is that?  Have


you ever taken any money from police officers?


MS. BUNN: That is at joint appendix 37.


QUESTION: It's three lines down from the top.


MS. BUNN: In the middle of the questioning about


- about Farr's prior drug use, defense counsel asks, and -


and have you ever taken any money from some police


officers?  There is further -

officers did you talk to about this?  I have talked to no


one about this outside of when they called us down


referring to the case -


QUESTION: Yeah.  We got it.


MS. BUNN: - which again is a false test - is a


false statement, but does not specifically deny police


informant status.


QUESTION: Now, it does seem to me that the


Cooksey report that the - I think it - the Cook - the -


MS. BUNN: Cook.


QUESTION: - the witness Cook -


MS. BUNN: Yes, Charles Cook.


QUESTION: - that the - that the report of his


interviews with - with the police was - was very, very


strong and helpful impeachment material.  Do you want to


comment on - on the claim that relates to his testimony?


MS. BUNN: Certainly, Your Honor.  The lower


courts did not consider that claim to be properly before


the court because Banks failed to present it in his


Federal petition, failed to present it in any amended and


supplemental position, and the - and there's nothing in


this - in this record to indicate - that would support a

finding of implied consent, or the trial by consent.


QUESTION: Well, you said, I mean, the - the


Fifth Circuit didn't think that Federal Rule of Civil


Procedure 15(b) applies in habeas, right?


MS. BUNN: That was a basis of its holding, yes. 


That's correct, on debatability.


QUESTION: Is - is that absolutely clear?


MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, it's not, and it -


QUESTION: Well, if it's not absolutely clear,


then - then it seems to me they should have - they should


have granted the - the certificate of appealability.


MS. BUNN: The issue actually before the Fifth


Circuit, the issue that it resolved, was whether - whether


it was debatable - the district court - whether the


district court abused its discretion in denying the 59(e)


motion, because, in fact, the district court never


considered 15(b) because it was never raised to the


district court, that - that particular argument.  So -


QUESTION: Well, that wasn't the basis that the


Fifth Circuit relied on.  I thought it relied on the basis


that there's huge - there's just no question that 15(b)


doesn't apply in habeas.


MS. BUNN: That was part -


QUESTION: And there's a lot of question about


that, it seems to me.

 MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor.  That was part of the


holding.  The stated -


QUESTION: So maybe we should remand at - at


least on the, you know, on the - on the Cook claim to have


the - the Fifth Circuit decide whether a COA - decide the


15(b) question and then decide the Cook claim.


MS. BUNN: I believe that would be an appropriate


course on this issue, and in this - we are not - we are


conceding the debatability of the general applicability of


15(b) in the habeas context.  What we do not find to be -


what we do not believe to be debatable is the


applicability in this case, that essentially there's no


factual predicate for the application of 15(b) in this


case, given that there's - there's simply nothing in the


record to show that any party beside Bank himself,


including the judge - the lower court judges, had any


inkling that this issue was properly before them.


QUESTION: But the Fifth Circuit passed on it,


didn't it?  Didn't the Fifth Circuit pass on the question


of whether 15(b) applied?


MS. BUNN: The Fifth Circuit, after - after


noting that what the Fifth - that - that the district


court's findings regarding the failure to raise the claim,


the failure to raise it in an amended petition, did hold


that it was - that it - that 15(b) did not apply in the

habeas context.


QUESTION: There was one position you took in


your brief and you said that - that the state is not


obliged to reveal the identity of an informer.  That's not


correct, is it, if the informer is called as a witness?


MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, that is our position


that essentially a prosecutor's duty to disclose whatever


information is triggered by the - the potential


materiality of that information. 

And particularly in a


case like this, where the informant is not - was not paid


for testimony, was not given any sort of break for his


testimony, that there's no specific inference that can be


drawn regarding an incentive for testifying favorably for


the state, that that is not -


QUESTION: What authority - what authority do you


have?  What case holds that when the Government puts an


informant on the stand, it does not have to divulge that


capacity?


MS. BUNN: There - I know of no such authority


for that particular proposition, but there's also nothing


- there's also no opinion from this Court saying that a


witness' informant status is per se material, which is


essentially what - what that would -


QUESTION: Isn't there - isn't there a Texas rule


of evidence that says, this is 508(c)(1) of the Texas

rules, an informer's identity must be disclosed if he


appears as a witness for the public entity?


MS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, again, even - even


assuming a breach of a Federal rule of - state rule of


evidence, that would not implicate the constitutional due


process concerns at issue here.  And under Brady -


QUESTION: Well - well, it certainly goes to


whether or not the defendant is - is entitled to rely on


what the prosecution's course of conduct is with reference


to the informer.


MS. BUNN: But again, there's nothing in this


trial record to indicate that trial counsel specifically


requested that information prior to going to trial, that


he - that trial counsel himself didn't pursue -


QUESTION: So you say at the outset of the trial


the defense counsel has to say, now, will you comply with


all of the rules that are in the Texas statutes?


MS. BUNN: Well, there is an obligation from - on


- upon defense counsel to pursue the remedies he's


entitled to, and to - to specifically request the


informant status of any witness, yes, there is an


obligation in a case such as this.  And the fact that


trial counsel did not do that, at least precludes a -


QUESTION: Why is there such an obligation if the


state rules require it?  This - we supposed to say we want

to be sure you've complied with all the state rules that

MS. BUNN: But even assuming that - that


violation, that is not - that does not support itself a


finding of cause to the procedural default of Banks'


failing to develop this claim for years even though


knowing of its existence.


QUESTION: Ms. Bunn, do you have any argument


that this might not have made any difference?


MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, and again, several


factors -


QUESTION: I - I suggest you might train your


guns on that.


(Laughter.)


MS. BUNN: Several factors play into that issue. 


Again, just - just the pure impeachment value itself was -


was weakened by the fact that there was no incentive.  But


also the fact that Farr was heavily impeached already and


that the informant status, weak as it was, was - was


really merely cumulative.  Defense counsel had brought


out, both on direct and then again on cross, his prior


drug abuse, track marks, his denials during cross-


examination, refuted by the defense witnesses, which


included a denial that he acted as a police informant in -


in another case for another jurisdiction.

 QUESTION: This isn't - this isn't what the


prosecution told the jury, was it?


MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor.  This is - this is


from defense counsel.  And third, even without Farr's


testimony, the significant evidence of Banks' future


dangerousness.  Banks admitted at punishment that he was


willing to abet Farr's commission of future armed


robberies by providing him with the weapon.  In fact, he


was willing to drive.


QUESTION: But he did - is - is it correct that


but for Farr there would have been no testimony that Banks


would participate in those robberies, and there would have


been no testimony that Banks and his accomplices would use


the gun to eliminate any trouble that might come up during


that.  Is that correct?


MS. BUNN: Yes.  That is correct.


QUESTION: That's pretty damning testimony, isn't


it?


MS. BUNN: It is a piece of - of - of the state's


puzzle, but it - but given what is left, not material. 


And again, the fact that he was -


QUESTION: It's not material because it would not


have, in effect, raised a serious question about the - the


integrity of the result or the fairness of the trial?


MS. BUNN: Yes.  It would not have put the

state's punishment case in such a different light as to


undermine the verdict.


QUESTION: Well, but don't - didn't you have a


defendant here without a prior criminal record, and - and


the state is trying to prove future dangerousness and that


this is a really bad actor.  I would have thought that


went rather to the heart of the sentencing question.


MS. BUNN: It was definitely favorable evidence


to the state's future dangerousness case, but it was not


all that was there.


QUESTION: Well, you have there as well Mr.


Jefferson, who said that Banks whacked him or hit him hard


and happened to omit that he himself, Mr. Jefferson, had


attacked Mr. Banks' sister, which could be a reason why he


had hit him.


MS. BUNN: Well, the - Vetrano Jefferson's


testimony, though he did amend his version of the incident


in post-conviction proceedings, he did not recant his


testimony that Banks hit him across the face with a gun,


but only that - and not that he had attacked Banks' wife,


but that he had - that he had had a verbal altercation


with her.  And there was no physical - no physical threat


whatsoever that Banks responded to by hitting him across


the face with a gun, and this happened a week prior to the


murder.

 And again, this testimony indicated that Banks


was known to carry a weapon on a regular basis in the


weeks before the murder.  And the murder itself, the


unprovoked nature of it, the fact that Banks essentially


lured a 16-year-old kid to a - an abandoned and secluded


park near his home and shot him three times to steal his


car.


And then - and then the fact that though -


though Farr's testimony was - was crucial on the limited


issue of Banks' willingness to participate himself in the


armed robberies, it still - still the fact that Banks had


it - and himself admitted - admitted at punishment that he


was willing to abet Farr's commission of murder and had,


in fact, been willing to drive what would have been a six-


hour round trip to Dallas in the middle of the night to


procure that weapon to - to aid those -


QUESTION: He didn't admit that - that he was


willing to abet murder.  He just admitted he was willing


to get the gun for robberies.


MS. BUNN: Yes.


QUESTION: Did he say specifically, in order that


somebody can be killed?  He didn't say -


MS. BUNN: He did - he did testify in - in


response to cross-examination by the prosecutor that he


was willing to provide what could potentially be a death

weapon in a robbery case.  And in the light of this future


dangerousness evidence that remains, as well as the


incremental impeachment value of Farr's informant status


within the context of the trial, former's informant -


Farr's informant status wouldn't have put the state's case


in such a different light as to undermine confidence in -


in the jury's verdict.


Again, the state's duty to - to disclose in


these cases is triggered by the materiality of the


evidence, and in this case, Farr's import - Farr's


informant status was not that kind of - of evidence.  It


was not material evidence.


Unless there are no further questions.  Thank


you.


QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Bunn.


Mr. Kendall, you have two minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H. KENDALL


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. KENDALL: Thank you, Your Honor.  Very


briefly, on the Charles Cook claim, I - Ms. Bunn has


conceded that jurors of reason would find debatable the


rule 15 issue.  We would ask that if the Court agrees with


that, that we not go back just to the Fifth Circuit, that


the case be sent back to the court in Texarkana, the


district court, for fact-finding on the underlying claim.

There's not been any fact-finding whatsoever on that


claim, and we think that would be, if the case is going


back to the Fifth Circuit, that that would be entirely


useful.


Thank you very much.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Kendall. 


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
