 Mr. Todd. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. TODD 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. TODD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

10  the Court: 

11

 The rule this  Court announced  in Ring did  not 

12  change  what  is  to  be decided. 

It  only  changed who 

13  decides.  It  did  not make  any conduct 

--  

it did  not 

14  decriminalize any conduct,  nor did it make  any defendant 

15  ineligible for the death penalty. 

16

 We  agree  with  all  the  State  and  Federal 

17  appellate  courts  that have  looked to  determine whether 

18  Apprendi or Ring should apply retroactively  and concluded 

19  that  the Apprendi/Ring rule  is not  the sort  of ground­

20  breaking rule that overcomes this Court's Teague bar. 

21

 QUESTION:  Mr.  Todd, could we  go back to  what 

22  you opened  with, that you said this is  just a -- and you 

23  emphasized this throughout  your brief -- it's  only a who 

24  decides, not what.  But I  thought that the notion in Ring 

25  is that  it adds  elements to  the offense  that were  not 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

3 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  there before.  So now  you have aggravating factors is  an 

2  element of the offense, and by so characterizing it, other 

3  things happen.  It has to  be proved beyond  a reasonable 

4  doubt on the aggravating or the other aggravating factors. 

5  You would have  whatever you have to  prove elements; that 

6  is,  you 

--  

the  confrontation  clause  would  apply, 

7  everything  that  goes  with  making it  as  part  of  the 

8  substantive crime.  Is that not so? 

9

 It's not just a question of, well, before it was 

10  the judge and now it's the jury.  Because it's part of the 

11  substantive  crime,  other things  go  along with  it too, 

12  don't -- don't they? 

13

 MR. TODD:  Justice Ginsburg, my understanding of 

14  this Court's holding in Ring was that it applied the Sixth 

15  Amendment  jury  guarantee as 

--  

as this  Court recalls, 

16  Arizona already found, beyond a  reasonable doubt, this -­

17  these particular aggravators and that it applied it  to -­

18  for purposes of finding these -- these aggravators.  It -­

19  it didn't  change the  substantive reach  of the  statute. 

20  Those -­

21

 QUESTION: 

Well, let  me  give you  a concrete 

22  example.  The judge relied on the presentence report in -­

23  in this case.  If the  -- if it  had to be  found by  the 

24  jury, if the aggravating factor had  to be found by a jury 

25  beyond  a reasonable doubt,  would that presentence report 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

4 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  have been admissible? 

2

 MR. TODD:  Well,  Your Honor, the judge in  this 

3  particular case did  not rely on  a presentence report  to 

4  find  either  of  the  aggravating  circumstances that  he 

5  found.  He  relied on the trial  testimony to find the 

--

6  that the crime was -­

7

 QUESTION:  Well,  just let's say that  the judge 

8  could consider,  or would you  concede that  if the  judge 

9  could make this  determination, that the judge  could, and 

10  judges routinely do, look at presentence reports? 

11

 MR. TODD:  Not under  Arizona law, Your  Honor, 

12  that the -- the aggravating circumstances that are -- that 

13  are present in Arizona law are  not the type that would be 

14  -- you  could rely on a presentence report to find because 

15  Arizona law  doesn't permit hearsay evidence  to establish 

16  the aggravator. 

17

 But the -- the key  question -- I mean, the  key 

18  fact is  that  the  underlying conduct,  the 

--  

has  not 

19  changed at all, that the aggravators are the same today as 

20  they were before Ring.  The  -- it has the conduct -- the 

21  reach of the  statute hasn't changed.  All we're  talking 

22  about is applying  the Sixth Amendment guarantee  to these 

23  aggravators  that the  Arizona put  into their  sentencing 

24  statute as a result from this Court's opinion in Furman. 

25

 QUESTION:  Was it clear under prior law that the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

5 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  aggravators  had  to  be  found  by  the  judge  beyond  a 

2  reasonable doubt? 

3

 MR. TODD:  That's  correct, Your  Honor.  Yes, 

4  Justice Kennedy. 

5

 QUESTION: 

Was  that  in  the statute  or  the 

6  supreme court decision? 

7

8

9

 MR. TODD:  Supreme court decision. 

 QUESTION:  Thank you. 

 QUESTION:  It's sort of like a mixed case on the 

10  substantive procedural part.  It's  -- the argument  that 

11  it's substantive, which is  -- imagine you have a  statute 

12  that says if you use a gun in connection with a drug sale, 

13  it's a  crime.  All right?  And  then this Court says that 

14  doesn't mean the drug in the  -- the gun is in the  attic. 

15  you know, the gun is in  the attic -- that doesn't  count. 

16  That's clearly substantive, isn't it? 

17

18

 MR. TODD:  Yes, Justice Breyer. 

 QUESTION:  All  right.  Now, suppose they have a 

19  subpart (b) which said if the gun is in the attic, you get 

20  more, but the gun in the attic will be found by the judge. 

21  That's just as if those  words, gun in the attic,  weren't 

22  there.  So it's just like  the first statute,  and that's 

23  Apprendi, you see.  That's Apprendi. 

24

 And  you  say,  well,  if  you got  that  second 

25  statute that  looked just  like the  first, this  one does 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

6 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  too.  I  mean, that's the  argument.  And  you say, well, 

2  which way should we look at it.  I'm not sure. 

3

 MR. TODD:  Well, Your  Honor, I -- I think  that 

4  the  -- that this Court's discussion in Bousley or Bousley 

5 

--  

as  -- as  you  were indicating  based  on the  Bailey 

6  decision, sort  of capsulizes  where  -- what  -- what  in 

7  terms of retroactivity analysis, where substantive -- what 

8  -- what a real substantive change is. 

9

 QUESTION:  We -- didn't  we make it quite clear 

10  in Bousley that it was important that we were interpreting 

11  a Federal  law, which we  had the authority  to interpret, 

12  rather  than  what's happened  in  this case  where,  as I 

13  understand it, the  Supreme Court of Arizona has  said the 

14  change brought by Ring was procedural. 

15

 MR. TODD:  That's -- that's correct,  Mr. Chief 

16  Justice. 

17

 The 

--  

this  Court  does  not  construe  State 

18  statutes.  State courts  do that,  and it's our  position 

19  that in order to change the substance of  a crime, this is 

20  something either that the legislative body must do or that 

21  the State court, in the case of a State -­

22

 QUESTION:  Does it follow,  if it is procedural, 

23  that you necessarily prevail?  If -- you -- you  do agree 

24  that he has been sentenced to death by an unconstitutional 

25  procedure. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

3

 MR. TODD:  This Court has said that it was, yes. 

 QUESTION:  Yes, I mean, under our holdings. 

 And do you  know any  case in  which we've  held 

4  that a  death  sentence can  be carried  out  when it  was 

5  imposed pursuant to an unconstitutional procedure? 

6

 MR. TODD:  I -- if  I read your  cases correct, 

7  Justice Stevens,  I believe  that you  have decided  three 

8  cases  since Teague in  which you  have found that  the -­

9  there was a problem, unconstitutional problem, with a jury 

10  sentencing procedure in a capital case and  you have found 

11  that those cases are Teague barred. 

12

 QUESTION:  But the -- the -- what was barred was 

13  considering  whether  or not  there  was a  constitutional 

14  violation.  We  didn't actually  hold that  where it  was 

15  acknowledged there  was a  constitutional violation,  that 

16  the death sentence could be carried out.  Or am I wrong on 

17  that? 

18

 MR. TODD:  My recollection, Justice  Stevens, is 

19  that in each of those cases there had been a prior holding 

20  by  this Court finding some unconstitutional procedure and 

21  that  the  case was  in these  three cases  that procedure 

22  existed, only they  had -- they were on  collateral review 

23  and this Court found them Teague barred. 

24

25

 QUESTION:  I see. 

 MR. TODD:  In our opinion, the only way that Mr. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

8 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  Summerlin can avoid this Court's Teague bar  is if somehow 

2  he can  find that the  Apprendi/Ring rule fits  within the 

3  exception for  watershed changes in the rule.  And as this 

4  Court recalls, in order to do that, the Ring/Apprendi rule 

5  must meet two  tests.  It must  satisfy two  tests.  The 

6  first test  is it must enhance  the accuracy.  The second 

7  test is it  must alter this Court's  understanding of some 

8  bedrock principle. 

9

 Now,  as  to the 

--  

the first  test,  we would 

10  suggest that this Court's line  of cases from 1968  answer 

11  the  first question in  the negative.  That is,  that the 

12  Sixth Amendment jury  guarantee and  cases arising out  of 

13  that are  not to be applied  retroactively.  As you  -- as 

14  you recall  in Duncan v. Louisiana in 1968, this Court for 

15  the  first  time  held  that  the  Sixth  Amendment  jury 

16  guarantee should  be applied to the  States.  And  in that 

17  very case -- in that very case, this Court said that judge 

18  trials are not inherently unfair.  Then a month later  in 

19  DeStefano v. Woods, this Court decided and  held that this 

20  right,  this very right to have a jury trial, would not be 

21  applied  retroactively.  And  then in  a series  of cases 

22  after  that, this Court -- that  in cases where the -- the 

23  right arose  out of the jury guarantee -- this case -- the 

24  Court  did not  apply those cases  retroactively.  At the 

25  time when the military was -- had a  right to a jury for a 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

9 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  civil offense that  the person committed, this  Court held 

2  that that would not be applied retroactively. 

3

 QUESTION:  May  I interrupt you just  once more? 

4  Because I'm  most interested in the  capital cases.  Am I 

5  correct in remembering that after Furman, all of the death 

6  sentences  across  the  country  were  held  invalid 

7  retroactively? 

8

 MR.  TODD:  Well,  Your Honor,  the -- I can't 

9  speak to -- to all the  cases.  In  Arizona what -- what 

10  happened was that  the -- after Furman, that  sentencing, 

11  the  jury  verdict  in  all  the  death  penalties  were 

12  unconstitutional.  And  the -- the Arizona Supreme  Court 

13  simply  applied  Arizona  law and  said  the  sentence was 

14  excessive 

and,  therefore 

--  

because  it 

was 

15  unconstitutional, and therefore, imposed life sentence.  I 

16  don't -- I was unable to find any case that really briefed 

17  or  discussed  the  whole  question  of  retroactivity  or 

18  whether you could -­

19

 QUESTION:  Well, you wouldn't  -- you  wouldn't 

20  contest that Furman was a watershed decision, would you? 

21

22

 MR. TODD:  No, I would not. 

 QUESTION:  So,  I mean, the question  is whether 

23  this  -- whether Ring  is equivalent  to Furman as  far as 

24  watershed decisions go I guess. 

25

 MR.  TODD: 

Of  course,  Justice  Scalia,  our 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  position is that it is not.  It's far from it. 

2

 But  the 

--  

all  these  cases that  the  cross 

3  section -- right to have a cross section of the community 

4  represented  on  a  jury 

--  

that  was  not  applied 

5  retroactively. 

6

 QUESTION:  Let me just  ask you why is Furman  a 

7  watershed decision?  It just  said the procedures were all 

8  wrong.  What -- what  made that watershed and -- and  this 

9  not watershed? 

10

 MR.  TODD:  Because  Furman affected  all death 

11  penalty cases nationwide. 

12

13

14

15

16

 QUESTION:  Because it was applied retroactively. 

 MR. TODD:  And -- and it --

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. TODD:  It -- and it was a complete -­

 QUESTION:  And I suppose if this case is applied 

17  retroactive, this might be a watershed decision. 

18

19

20

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION:  Was Furman decided before Teague? 

 MR. TODD:  Furman, Justice O'Connor, was decided 

21  before Teague.  And -- and also  in Furman, there  was a 

22  major shift in this Court's  thinking and understanding of 

23  the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. 

24

 QUESTION:  Yes, which -- an understanding which 

25 

--  

which  had existed  in  the country  for  a couple  of 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  hundred years, whereas,  as I understand Ring,  it's based 

2  on  a reversal of  -- of  a relatively recent  practice of 

3  announcing in statutes  sentencing factors  as opposed  to 

4  elements of the  crime.  That -- that was a  quite recent 

5  practice and it seems to me quite reasonable to think that 

6  Furman was a watershed  and that -- that Ring and -- and 

7  Apprendi,  which preceded Ring,  was not.  It was  just a 

8  correction  of a temporary wandering off  from the -- from 

9  the common law rule. 

10

11

 MR. TODD:  We would agree, Justice Scalia. 

 QUESTION:  You would  agree that  Apprendi just 

12  corrected a -- a minor wandering law, not an old rule? 

13

 QUESTION: 

There's  a  question  whether  it 

14  corrected anything. 

15

 MR. TODD:  At -- at  most -- at  most, Apprendi 

16  merely  extended  in  an incremental  degree  an  existing 

17  proposition of this Court. 

18

 QUESTION:  Apprendi purported, did it not, to be 

19  setting forth established law?  Did it not? 

20

21

22

23

24

 MR. TODD:  I --

 QUESTION:  And -- right? 

 MR. TODD:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  And did Furman? 

 MR. TODD:  No.  It was a -- a complete change is 

25  my understanding. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

12 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 QUESTION:  There was  no -- there  was no Court 

2  opinion in Furman, was there? 

3

 MR. TODD:  No, there was no opinion by the full 

4  Court where  every -- all the members agreed or a majority 

5  of the members agreed. 

6

 QUESTION:  What will  you do  if -- I mean,  I 

7  absolutely accept your point, at  least for argument, that 

8  -- that if you go  through the factors that favor  calling 

9  it  a  watershed rule,  you've  listed several  that argue 

10  strongly against calling it a watershed rule. 

11

 And I  want your  reaction to  something on  the 

12  other side.  And I have to say,  though, I'm sure he -- he 

13  will  agree with  these words. 

Justice Scalia  will not 

14  agree with the sentiment I'm quoting him for.  But in Ring 

15  he said  -- he  spoke about  the repeated  spectacle of  a 

16  man's  going  to  his  death  because  a  judge  found  an 

17  aggravating  factor  existed  and  added  that  we  cannot 

18  preserve our veneration  for the protection of the jury in 

19  criminal cases if we render ourselves callous  to the need 

20  for  that  protection  by  regularly  imposing  the  death 

21  penalty without it. 

22

 Now,  what I'm using those words to call to mind 

23  is that  here we will have the spectacle of a person going 

24  to his death when he was tried in violation of a rule that 

25  the majority of the Court found to be a serious procedural 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

13 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  flaw.  See,  I'm not  calling it absolutely  overwhelming. 

2  So I'm giving you that, but  on the other side, I'm trying 

3  to focus  your attention on the spectacle of the man going 

4  to his death,  having been sentenced in violation  of that 

5  principle.  What do you want to say about that? 

6

 MR.  TODD: 

Your  Honor,  in our  view  Teague 

7  answers  that  question,  that if  the  Apprendi/Ring rule 

8  would come within the Teague  exception, then certainly in 

9  fairness, it should be applied retroactively. 

10

 QUESTION:  Justice Breyer is -- is arguing for a 

11  -- a  general capital sentencing  exception to Teague.  I 

12  mean, you  -- you could make  that statement that  he just 

13  made in any capital case. 

14

15

16

 QUESTION:  No, but -- but anyway --

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION: 

--  

the -- the -- Teague, of course, 

17  encapsulates  a  long prior  history  with  Justice Harlan 

18  trying  to formalize to a  degree rules that will separate 

19  the more important for the less important.  Is that fair? 

20

 MR. TODD:  Yes, absolutely, Your Honor.  And our 

21  position  is  that this  case,  because of 

--  

it doesn't 

22  increase the  accuracy, the  -- the  Teague/Apprendi rule, 

23  and  it does not -- is not even a bedrock rule, not even a 

24  bedrock rule,  let alone  a -- a change  in this  Court's 

25  understanding of a bedrock rule. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 QUESTION: Where  as, is Teague itself  a bedrock 

2  rule?  It  was judge-made rule, isn't it?  It's not in the 

3  Constitution  itself  or  any statute  anywhere. 

It's a 

4  judge-made rule. 

5

6

 MR. TODD:  Teague -­

 QUESTION: 

And  that  should  trump  the 

7  constitutional right at stake. 

8

 MR. TODD:  Teague is a judge -- judge-made rule, 

9  Your Honor, yes.

 If I may reserve the remainder of my time. 

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Todd. 

 Mr. Feldman, we'll hear from you. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

 MR.  FELDMAN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice, and  may it 

17  please the Court: 

18

 With  respect to the  bedrock principles -- that 

19  is -- that  is, the  bedrock  watershed rules  that  come 

20  within  the  second  Teague  exception  -- the  Court  has 

21  articulated that exception not  in terms of any  rule that 

22  carries  out  a  principle of  the  Constitution,  even an 

23  important  rule  that  carries  out  a  principle  of  the 

24  Constitution,  or  one of  the  amendments that  have been 

25  incorporated, but rather a bedrock rule. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

15 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 And the examples that the Court has given, which 

2  are  things  like  the violation  of  the  rule  of Gideon 

3  against  Wainwright  or a  mob dominating  a trial  or the 

4  knowing  use  of  testimony  that  was -- of  a 

--  

of a 

5  confession  that  was extracted  by  torture I  think give 

6  guidance  as to what  that sort of  bedrock rule is.  And 

7  what it is, is those are elements that, if they exist in a 

8  criminal trial,  you can look at  that trial and  say this 

9  was not -- could not have been a fair trial.  In fact, the 

10  trial conceivably could have come to the right result, but 

11  it couldn't  have been a fair trial if those elements were 

12  not satisfied. 

13

 The  rule  in Ring  and  Apprendi does  not come 

14  within that class. 

15

 QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, what would you think the 

16  result should be for someone  whose capital conviction and 

17  sentence became final after Apprendi but before Ring? 

18

 MR. FELDMAN:  I  -- I think that  -- that was  a 

19  relatively  brief period,  but  during that  period,  this 

20  Court's  decision  in Walton  had  held that  judges could 

21  decide aggravating factors.  And accordingly, the  law at 

22  that time was that and it would have to satisfy the Teague 

23  second  exception  if it  were  to be  applied.  For  the 

24  reasons I've said, I don't think it does.

 QUESTION:  Let me  ask you  something else.  I 

2  don't think you cited or relied on that DeStefano v. Woods 

3  case.  Why not? 

4

 MR. FELDMAN:  We should have.  The Court said in 

5  -- in the -- in the  Duncan case -- actually the quote  is 

6  we  would  not assert  that  every criminal  trial  or any 

7  particular trial  held before a  judge alone is  unfair or 

8  that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge 

9  as he would be by a jury.  That's a quote from Duncan. 

10

 In DeStefano, which was a  pre-Teague case and I 

11  suppose maybe that was  the reason why it was  overlooked, 

12  but  the  Court  relied on  that  particular  reasoning in 

13  holding  that the Duncan  rule, which was  the whole Sixth 

14  Amendment right, should not be retroactively applied. 

15

 The rule in  Apprendi and Ring doesn't  apply to 

16  the whole  Sixth Amendment  right.  It was  long accepted 

17  before  Apprendi  and  Ring  that  any  element  that  the 

18  legislature identifies as an element of the offense has to 

19  be  proven to the  jury.  The question  in these cases was 

20  things  that the  legislature had  -- was at  the margins, 

21  things  that  the  legislature had  set  forth  not as  an 

22  element  of the offense,  but as a  sentencing factor that 

23  only goes  to sentencing.  And  what those  cases did  is 

24  divide up  the -- the universe  of things that just  go to 

25  sentencing and  say some of them  have to be  submitted to 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

17 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  the jury and others don't. 

2

 Those kinds  of line-drawing  decisions are  not 

3  the kinds of things  that are -- that you can  look at the 

4  submission  of that particular fact to a judge rather than 

5  a jury and say this  proceeding couldn't have been a  fair 

6  one.  In fact,  judges make  -- the Court  has recognized 

7  that  judges  make  similar  types  of  decisions  both 

8  procedurally in  terms of  the admission  of evidence,  in 

9  terms of the application of the Fourth Amendment, and even 

10  substantively, in fact,  even in  the capital context,  in 

11  deciding  the presence of  mitigating factors, in deciding 

12  facts that  may be of -- of crucial importance in weighing 

13  the weight of mitigating against aggravating factors.  All 

14  of those  things judges may permissibly  do and may  do so 

15  fairly. 

16

 Given  that  those things  can  be decided  by a 

17  judge fairly, I  don't think that it can  be said that the 

18  rule in Apprendi and in Ring reaches that level of bedrock 

19  importance, that it just is -- is -- necessarily the whole 

20  proceeding was unfair because this element was -­

21

 QUESTION:  Can we go back  to the -- the first 

22  and how you characterize this?  I would imagine you  list 

23  elements of  an offense.  Well, the elements of an offense 

24 

--  

that  has  a  substantive feel. 

Who  decides  has a 

25  procedural feel.  It seems to  me you could  give this  a 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

18 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  substantive characterization  if you're saying  recite the 

2  elements  of 

--  

of  an  offense. 

That  sounds  very 

3  substantive.  What does  it take  to -- to compose  this 

4  crime.  And then  -- well, and  then you say  it -- well, 

5  it's just who decides.  That's a procedural question.  You 

6  can characterize this fairly either way I think. 

7

 MR. FELDMAN:  I  -- I don't think  so.  I  think 

8  for the  -- for purposes of Teague, the best definition of 

9  substantive  offense  -- of  what  is substantive  is what 

10  substantive is  what -- what has been made criminal and -­

11  and perhaps what facts -- on what facts turns a particular 

12  punishment. 

The  definition  of  those  facts  is  a 

13  substantive  point.  And  the reason  for that is  that in 

14  Bousley,  what the  Court  said was  a  -- a  longstanding 

15  concern of  Federal habeas  is  that someone  is going  to 

16  stand convicted  of an offense  based on conduct  that the 

17  law does  not make  criminal or  does not  subject to  the 

18  punishment that he's going to get. 

19

 Now, when a  court comes to a  new understanding 

20  of an element of -- of what the meaning, the  substantive 

21  meaning, of an element of  an offense, what conduct is  or 

22  isn't criminal or can or cannot be subject to a particular 

23  punishment, there  is a risk  that -- that  the defendant, 

24  who  was  tried  under a  different  standard,  does stand 

25  convicted of  committing an act  that the law  didn't make 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

19 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  criminal.  And that's  why substantive  rules don't  come 

2  within Teague. 

3

 But where -- what happened here  is not at  all 

4  times, both before and after  Ring, the -- in Arizona  the 

5  list  of  aggravating circumstances  was  the same.  They 

6  meant exactly  the same  thing.  And that  risk that  the 

7  Court talked about in Bousley  of standing convicted of an 

8  act based on a finding  that you committed an act that  in 

9  fact is not criminal or  couldn't be subject to the  death 

10  penalty, that  risk  was not  raised by  this decision  in 

11  Ring. 

12

 QUESTION:  Mr.  Feldman, do  you think that  the 

13  outcome  of  this  case  necessarily  determines  whether 

14  Apprendi is retroactive or not? 

15

 MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I would think they stand  or 

16  fall together because the Court in Ring -­

17

 QUESTION:  Do you think if we hold this is bad, 

18  we must follow the same rule in Apprendi? 

19

 MR.  FELDMAN: 

Well,  I'd  prefer  not  to  be 

20  categorical about that.  I -- I mean, if the Court reached 

21  that conclusion, I'd  want to see  what the reasoning  was 

22  that the Court used and see whether there are distinctions 

23  or aren't distinctions at that point. 

24

25

 But the Court --

 QUESTION:  But if we -- if we said, for example, 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

20 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  that this is -- this is retroactive because we, in effect, 

2  have said  that the  sentencing factor  is -- is like  an 

3  element so that  we are, in  fact, for purposes  of -- of 

4  serving the jury right, recharacterizing or redefining the 

5  -- the  crime, then that would  cover Apprendi as  well as 

6  this case, wouldn't it? 

7

8

 MR. FELDMAN:  It -- it may well.  It may well. 

 But I don't  think the  Court should reach  that 

9  result for the reasons  I just said, which is  as a matter 

10  of substance  and procedure,  I think  you can  -- if  the 

11  question is,  is this  an element  or is  it a  sentencing 

12  factor,  but  in  both  cases  it's  something  that  the 

13  legislature intended  to set  aside as  this is  something 

14  that's going to trigger a particular penalty, in this case 

15  the eligibility for the death penalty, either way I  don't 

16  think that's a substantive decision. 

17

 If the question is, as  it was in Bousley or  in 

18  the -- the Bailey  case, well, is mere possession of a gun 

19  a criminal act or do you have -- or is something  else, is 

20  it something narrower than that,  it has to be active  use 

21  of the gun, that  is a substantive decision  because there 

22  are  defendants who  might have  been  found to  have just 

23  possessed the gun and -- and therefore not to be guilty of 

24  any crime at all.  And that does tie into  a core purpose 

25  of habeas  as -- as the  Court articulated in  the Bousley 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

21 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  case. 

2

 The  Court has said  in -- said in Tyler  -- to 

3  return to the -- the bedrock, the second Teague exception, 

4  the Court said in Tyler and -- v. Cain, that not all rules 

5  relating to due  process, not even all  new rules relating 

6  to the  fundamental  requirements  of  due  process,  will 

7  satisfy the second Teague exception.  That exception is a 

8  narrow one because States have very vital interests in the 

9  finality of criminal convictions and  in coming to closure 

10  after there's been a criminal  conviction based on a  good 

11  faith  interpretation  and  reasonable  interpretation  of 

12  existing  law,  that  not  having  to  constantly  reopen 

13  criminal convictions as the law  naturally develops, as it 

14  does with respect  to the jury  trial right or any  of the 

15  other rights that have been incorporated. 

16

 Applying that  standard, the -- the  decision in 

17  Ring and the decision in -- in Apprendi also, shouldn't be 

18  applied -- don't  come within the Teague  second exception 

19  because it cannot be said in those  circumstances that the 

20 

--  

that  the  trial, in  violation  of  those  rules, was 

21  necessarily -- couldn't have been a fair trial.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEN MURRAY 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

22 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

2

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR.  MURRAY: 

Mr. Chief  Justice,  and  may it 

3  please the Court: 

4

 I'd like to first go  right to the heart of  the 

5  issue of the  questions that  were between Justice  Breyer 

6  and Justice Scalia and point out that we are not, in fact, 

7  asking for an exception in  death penalty cases of Teague, 

8  but we are asking the Court to look at the specific issues 

9  involved in  capital cases  and how  the Teague  exception 

10  that -- that  implicates accuracy and fairness  is applied 

11  in those contexts. 

12

 And this Court has done  that before in Stringer 

13  v. Black,  the only case  that we  are aware of  where you 

14  were looking at  jury instructions to see  whether they're 

15  old and new.  The -- the criteria and the specific unique 

16  aspects  of  the  death  penalty  and  the  aggravating 

17  circumstances  that  you  were  looking  at, such  as  the 

18  heinous, cruel, and depraved one that's in this case, were 

19  of  a particular  importance  in determining  whether  the 

20  issue was new or old. 

21

 QUESTION:  Did the court of  appeals rely on the 

22  fact that there was  a -- this was a death case as part of 

23  its reasoning? 

24

 MR.  MURRAY: 

It did  in  many  respects, Your 

25  Honor. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

23 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

2

 QUESTION:  You mean it said in so many words? 

 MR. MURRAY:  Well, it -- it pointed out the fact 

3  of the necessity of having evidence  presented in a manner 

4  that  would go to  accuracy in a  capital case, especially 

5  one was -- you know, if somebody  was looking at the death 

6  penalty, and  there was  a  concurrence that  specifically 

7  went into the fact that this was a capital case. 

8

 It's  important to note if -- if we're going to 

9  the first in the Teague exception that implicates accuracy 

10  and -- and fairness, it's important  to note that  at the 

11  heart of  the Sixth Amendment, we  have the right  to have 

12  all the facts  necessary for a  sentencing decision to  be 

13  made by a  jury.  And it's even more  essential in capital 

14  cases.  In death penalty cases,  juries really do  make a 

15  difference. 

16

 QUESTION:  Well,  isn't -- isn't that  because a 

17  lot of  the sentencing -- a lot of the aggravating factors 

18  the  sentencing pivots  are -- are not  only  factual but 

19  normative?  I mean, heinous, atrocious, and cruel is -- is 

20  the -- is a  perfect example of it.  It's -- it's a how -­

21  how bad is it kind of determination. 

22

 This isn't so much a matter of accuracy as it is 

23  a -- a  matter of -- of moral weighing, and does that fall 

24  within prong one of -- of the Teague exception? 

25

 MR. MURRAY:  Prong one of the second exception? 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

24 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

2

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR. MURRAY:  Yes, Your Honor, to the extent that 

3 

--  

I mean, I  understand what  you're saying, but  to the 

4  extent that this is going to categorical accuracy. 

5

 QUESTION:  But it sounds more like judgment than 

6  accuracy is what I'm getting at. 

7

 MR.  MURRAY:  It is -- and  is -- and that's why 

8  the accuracy I  -- we believe has to be categorical.  If I 

9  could  put it this  way.  There's -- there's  a imaginary 

10  line of -- about who can get closest to  being correct in 

11  the term  of accuracy that  really hasn't been  defined by 

12  the Court in this  context, but in everyday  uses accuracy 

13  is -- is  sort of getting it  right.  But that's  not what 

14  really works  out here in  these capital cases  because we 

15  have  this  normative  or  subjective  type  aggravating 

16  circumstances. 

17

 We're talking  about can  we say  for sure  that 

18  jurors  versus  the judge 

--  

the individual  judge would 

19  always get these issues the same.  And  if they would not, 

20  if  they  would  not  categorically  be accurate  in  that 

21  respect, then  we have a problem because the -- the jurors 

22  are  supposed to  be representing  the community's  common 

23  sense. 

24

 QUESTION:  Well, that's -- that's -- everything 

25  you say is -- is  true so far, but I don't  know that that 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

25 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  gets you to satisfy the accuracy prong.  Judges and juries 

2  may -- I -- I don't know how it would really work out, but 

3  they 

--  

they  may  make different  normative  judgments, 

4  different  moral judgments in -- in applying a factor like 

5  this. 

But I  don't  think it  falls within  the  -- the 

6  category of accuracy. 

7

 MR. MURRAY:  Well -- well, Your Honor, we're -­

8  our position is that it's  accuracy only in, as I said,  a 

9  categorical context  because you can't ever  determine who 

10  is  absolutely  right  or  wrong.  It's  not  like adding 

11  numbers.  But you can say that after the Court's decision 

12  in Ballew and  other cases  looking at group  deliberation 

13  and  unanimity requirements and the proper presentation of 

14  evidence to the  jury, that their role  as the community's 

15  voice for what  their sense of -- of the moral outrage, of 

16  what  their  sense 

--  

in  determining  the  eligibility, 

17  because  that's  what  we're  looking  at  here  with  the 

18  aggravators in Arizona,  is going to be more accurate over 

19  the long run than a single judge. 

20

 QUESTION:  Mr. Murray, I  -- I have sort of  the 

21  same problem that Justice O'Connor did.  I find it hard to 

22  contemplate  how  we  could have  held  in  DeStefano that 

23  Duncan v. Louisiana, which for  the first time applied the 

24  jury trial guarantee  of the  Federal Constitution to  the 

25  States -- I  mean, the  entire trial  didn't  have to  be 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

26 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  before a  jury until we decided Duncan.  And in DeStefano, 

2  we said that decision doesn't have to be retroactive, that 

3  the cases decided before Duncan will stand even though the 

4  judge  decided the entire  criminal case, not  just the -­

5  the one element we're talking about here. 

6

 How -- how can you  possibly reconcile that with 

7  what you're asking us to  do here?  This seems  relatively 

8  minor  compared  to  the  quite  more  massive  change  in 

9  accuracy,  if  you  believe  it,  which 

--  

which  Duncan 

10  produced. 

11

 MR. MURRAY:  Well, specifically, Your  Honor, we 

12  have two responses to that. 

13

 First, there are  other cases from  this Court's 

14  precedent  where  the  DeStefano's  refusal  to  find 

15  retroactivity for Duncan  was set aside and  not followed. 

16  For  example, after  Ballew, then  you had  Brown and  the 

17  Burch decisions, and they -- they specifically refused to 

18  find -- follow  DeStefano, and in  fact, this Court  said, 

19  rejects  the  argument  in  Brown  v.  Louisiana  that 

20  DeStefano's  refusal  to  apply  Duncan  retroactively 

21  controlled and because of  a constitutional rule  directed 

22  toward ensuring that the proper functioning of the jury in 

23  those  cases in which  it has  been provided can  be given 

24  retroactive effect.  That is in note 13 in -- in Brown. 

25

 QUESTION:  But -- but those cases do not involve 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

27 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  the precise  issue that  you're bringing  before us  here. 

2  The precise  issue in  Duncan was  the difference  between 

3  having  the  judge  decide  and  having the  jury  decide. 

4  That's the very thing that's  at issue here.  Those  other 

5  cases you mentioned did not involve that very thing. 

6

 MR. MURRAY:  Yes, Your Honor.  In Duncan, they 

7  had dealt with the  issue of whether there  is a right  to 

8  jury trial in the States. 

9

 We  also  have  other cases  from  this  Court's 

10  precedents such as In re  Winship, which was going to  the 

11  burden  of  proof  to  prove  every  element  being  held 

12  retroactive. 

13

 We  have  Mullaney  being held  retroactive  and 

14  Hankerson which talks  about whether  the States can  make 

15  sort of  end runs around by labeling  issues as sentencing 

16  factors -­

17

 QUESTION:  The point is that they didn't involve 

18  precisely what is  involved here.  The  difference between 

19  having the  judge  decide the  case  and having  the  jury 

20  decide the  case.  Our only  precedent dealing  precisely 

21  with that issue says that the decision is not retroactive. 

22

 MR.  MURRAY:  That's correct,  Your Honor,  but 

23  also  you can  remember that  that case  was decided  pre­

24  Teague  when  the balancing  process  that the  Court used 

25  included  a  consideration  and -- and  have  given great 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

28 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  weight to the consideration of  the overall effect of  the 

2  administration of justice. 

3

4

 And I'd also point out -­

 QUESTION:  Teague  -- but Teague does  that too, 

5  does it not?  Gives great weight  to the overall effect in 

6  the administration of justice in a different way perhaps. 

7

 MR. MURRAY:  Teague has done that essentially to 

8  the extent that the Court is going to consider that by the 

9  definition  of a standard that  is set in  Teague.  But it 

10  has withdrawn it as a balancing factor that's specifically 

11  taken into consideration and  can be given as much  weight 

12  as it has previously. 

13

 I'd also point out that Teague as -- as a result 

14  of Justice Harlan's  writings in Desist and  Mackey and he 

15  himself  had  said  that  the  failure  to  hold  Duncan 

16  retroactive  in  DeStefano  was 

--  

probably  eroded  the 

17  principle that new  rules affecting the very  integrity of 

18  fact-finding processes  are to  be retroactively  applied. 

19  So -­

20

 QUESTION:  That  was a separate opinion,  was it 

21  not? 

22

23

 MR. MURRAY:  It was, Your Honor. 

 If  I  can then,  I'd  like to  move  on to  the 

24  substantive and procedural question that  has been raised, 

25  and that  is something that has caused a lot of confusion. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

29 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  But it  is not our position that Ring  -- the rule in Ring 

2  itself  is purely  substantive  because every  substantive 

3  ruling  will  generate  and  will  have  flow  from  it  a 

4  procedural consequence constitutionally.  So Ring  is both 

5  procedural and substantive.  But  it had to be substantive 

6  first  because what  the  Court  said  in Ring  was  these 

7  aggravating circumstances in Arizona  where they are  used 

8  for the purpose  of determining eligibility as  opposed to 

9  the  purpose  of  imposition  of  the  death  penalty  or 

10  selection  under  the  Eighth  Amendment  due 

--  

Eighth 

11  Amendment jurisprudence -- these factors are  necessary to 

12  establish eligibility  for the  death penalty.  Thus,  it 

13  follows that  the conviction  for murder  or first  degree 

14  murder which  the jury can make  in -- under  Arizona law, 

15  plus  the  finding  of  the  aggravating  factor  is  what 

16  actually makes an  individual guilty of a  capital offense 

17  in Arizona. 

18

 QUESTION:  I agree.  I think  you can see it as 

19  substantive or you can see it as procedural. 

20

 But  I  wonder, because  you've  read all  these 

21  cases now, is  that -- is -- do you -- do  you think that 

22  the Teague categories -- how  fixed are they meant to  be? 

23  What  I'm thinking  of in  particular is  the remark  that 

24  actually  the  Chief  Justice made  about  it  did reflect 

25  something to do with administration of justice. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

30 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 So suppose that you had a case in which it looks 

2  as if  it falls on the  substantive side of the  line, but 

3  really to let  everyone out of  prison is going  to -- is 

4  going  to just  devastate the  justice  system.  Is there 

5  room, given Teague, for some  flexibility there?  In other 

6  words, are the  factors absolutely written  in stone?  Is 

7  there any indication they're flexible to read in the light 

8  of Teague's purposes?  What's your reaction to that? 

9

 MR. MURRAY:  Well, our  position, Your Honor, is 

10  that  there  is room  for  flexibility and 

--  

and it  is 

11  essential  if you're going -- if  the Court is going to be 

12  looking at these  cases and  trying to  determine how  the 

13  result of their  decisions will affect everybody  else who 

14  are in similar positions, because the goal of Teague is to 

15  ensure that people in similar circumstances receives equal 

16  treatment.  And in looking  at the specific circumstances, 

17  I think that it is flexible. 

18

 QUESTION:  Mr.  Murray, we  have many  opinions 

19  which -- which comment upon the fact that  the -- the line 

20  between substance and  procedure is an  extremely variable 

21  one and that they really are just -- just two opposites in 

22  various fields,  and -- and where the line is depends upon 

23  the purpose  for which  you're calling  it substantive  or 

24  calling it procedural. 

25

 Now, Mr.  Feldman gave  us what  he -- what his 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

31 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  assessment of  -- of what our  Teague rule means  by -- by 

2  substantive  and that is  if you  have changed the  -- the 

3  punishment or if you have changed the status of whether an 

4  act could be performed without being  criminally punished, 

5  that is a substantive change. 

6

 Now, if you  believe that that's  what substance 

7  versus  procedure  means  here,  this  is  clearly  not 

8  substantive.  Right? 

9

10

11

 MR. MURRAY:  If that's the limitation -­

 QUESTION:  If -- if that's what it means. 

 Now,  if 

--  

if  you  don't  agree  with  his 

12  description of -- of what  the dichotomy is, what is  your 

13  understanding of -- of what  constitutes something that is 

14  substantive under -- under Teague? 

15

 MR. MURRAY:  Our understanding, Your  Honor, is 

16  that the position  that the Assistant SG  gave is included 

17  in  a  broader,  more  universal  definition  of  what 

18  substantive is  and that is at  the core of  a substantive 

19  ruling  is defining what  the elements of  an offense are, 

20  back to the status quo of finding what is a crime, what is 

21  the crime of capital murder -­

22

 QUESTION:  Even though the additional 5 years or 

23  10  years for  -- for an  act that was  innocent was being 

24  imposed under  the rubric  of a  sentencing factor  rather 

25  than under the rubric of element. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

32 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. MURRAY:  Well, anytime that you  -- yes, but 

2  anytime that you change the definition, it's a substantive 

3  -- substantive change -­

4

 QUESTION:  Well, it -- it is substantive for the 

5  purpose of whether it's in a criminal procedure book as an 

6  element or as a  -- as a  sentencing factor, but it's  not 

7  substantive for the purpose of  whether an individual knew 

8  that if  he did this,  he was going  to get 5  more years. 

9  It's not  substantive in that sense.  And I  thought that 

10  that's what Teague was talking about. 

11

 MR.  MURRAY:  Well,  Your  Honor, that  -- that 

12  sounds of the first exception to  Teague, and our position 

13  is that  -- is not the entire universe of what substantive 

14  is about  because in  this case,  although in  Arizona the 

15  individuals were  charged with  -- setting  aside for  the 

16  moment the indictment  issue, they were charged  and given 

17  notice,  at  least  pretrial,  of  the 

aggravating 

18  circumstances for which  they -- the  State was trying  to 

19  impose the death penalty.  So that is known. 

20

 But  the -- the question  is would -- did they 

21  know that the  -- the jury  -- that they  have a right  to 

22  have a jury verdict.  Did they know that the jury  was not 

23  going to be  determining essentially what was  the offense 

24  of  capital  murder? 

And that  is  where  it  becomes a 

25  substantive situation  because  in Arizona  they  do  not, 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

33 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  based on the jury's finding,  convict the individual being 

2  charged in  a capital case of  capital murder.  It wasn't 

3  until Ring came down,  that they finally admitted  that in 

4  Arizona  from  -- from  the  other  side,  but that's  the 

5  essence of the substantive. 

6

 QUESTION:  There  was a question that  was asked 

7  to Mr. Wood  and that  was about do  Apprendi and Ring  go 

8  together, and I'd like your  answer to that.  If we  agree 

9  with you that this is substantive, wouldn't it follow that 

10  Apprendi also would be retroactive? 

11

 MR. MURRAY:  The short  answer, Your Honor,  is 

12  maybe or -- or not necessarily.  It would depend on the -­

13

14

15

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. MURRAY:  -- the reason -­

 QUESTION:  What -- what  -- could you give me  a 

16  reason why they shouldn't go together? 

17

 MR.  MURRAY: 

If 

--  

if  you  rule 

--  

we've 

18  presented basically  four arguments.  If  you accept  the 

19  argument that there  was a misunderstanding of  State law, 

20  not Federal or that  it was an old rule,  which we haven't 

21  discussed yet, we don't think that Apprendi and Ring would 

22  be hooked together. 

23

 If it's the substantive versus procedural  issue 

24  that this Court relies upon,  our position -- it would  be 

25  very difficult to  distinguish Apprendi from Ring.  If -­

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

34 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  if  we're  going  to  buy  our 

--  

our  definition  of 

2  substantive, then they will both probably be the same. 

3

 If we get to the second exception of Teague, the 

4  one  that  implicates  the  fairness  and  accuracy,  our 

5  position is that you wouldn't necessarily have to overturn 

6  or make Apprendi  retroactive if  you're depending on  the 

7  specific and unique  aspects of  capital cases that  we've 

8  been discussing so far. 

9

 QUESTION:  On your  -- your  not a new  rule, I 

10  found that  hard to follow  in light  of Walton.  I mean, 

11  Walton was the law until Ring said it was  -- overruled it 

12  pro tonto. 

13

14

 MR. MURRAY:  Yes, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  So how could it not be -- given that 

15  Walton was the instruction, how could Ring be anything but 

16  new? 

17

 MR. MURRAY:  Well, Ring went back, so  to speak, 

18  to the  old law.  First  off, let  me just  point out  in 

19  answering the question that Mr.  Summerlin's case was pre­

20  Walton.  His case became final 6 years before this Court's 

21  decision in Walton. 

22

 What happened in Walton then was this Court made 

23  the decision,  based on the aspect -- the issue of whether 

24  there is a Sixth Amendment right to juries' involvement in 

25  sentencing in capital  cases.  Walton, until  Ring, was in 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

35 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  essence a  -- a blip in  the history upon  which the State 

2  jumped on to deny relief in these cases. 

3

 In Ring, the  Court recognized  that there is  a 

4  difference between the  Sixth Amendment  right or lack  of 

5  that -­

6

 QUESTION:  Why do you  say Walton was a blip  in 

7  -- in the history?  Are you talking  about from the  time 

8  Arizona reimposed capital punishment after Furman? 

9

 MR. MURRAY:  Yes, Your  Honor, and even  before 

10  that.  For hundreds of years, juries have been having the 

11  responsibility  to determine the  facts that are necessary 

12  for individuals to be eligible for the death penalty. 

13

 QUESTION:  But  surely,  I  mean,  Arizona  had 

14  adopted that system before Walton  or Walton wouldn't have 

15  had occasion to pass on it. 

16

 MR. MURRAY:  Arizona never  adopted the -- the 

17  system wherein the juries would be involved in sentencing. 

18  They  adopted the system where  the jury convicted only of 

19  the  first  degree  murder  and  never  performed  the 

20  eligibility  determination,  although  that's  what  the 

21  statute required. 

22

 QUESTION:  And -- and it was  that system that 

23  came to us in Walton, was it not? 

24

25

 MR. MURRAY:  It was that system, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  So saying that Walton -- when you say 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

36 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  blip,  I  got  the impression  you  thought  it originated 

2  something.  It didn't.  It  just passed on  the existing 

3  system in Arizona. 

4

 MR. MURRAY:  It passed on the existing system in 

5  Arizona  but  for  the  wrong  reason. 

But  for  a 

6  misunderstanding of how the system in Arizona worked, this 

7  Court -- had this Court  been presented with, for example, 

8  the  information the Arizona Supreme Court  gave in Ring I 

9  when  they  explained  that  in  the  Arizona  system  the 

10  aggravating circumstances do serve the eligibility purpose 

11  that they are an essential statutory factual element, then 

12  had  you  had  that  before  Walton,  had  you  had  that 

13  information, Walton  would have  resulted  in a  different 

14  opinion is our position because  you would have known then 

15  what  you  acknowledged in  Ring,  that we're  not talking 

16  about jury  sentencing in  capital cases.  We're  talking 

17  about making determination  of eligibility  for the  death 

18  penalty itself with these aggravating circumstances. 

19

 And I would  point out  this is heinous,  cruel, 

20  and depraved aggravating  circumstance.  It isn't one 

--

21  and this goes back a little  bit to accuracy, but it isn't 

22  one  that  everybody  necessarily agrees  on  because  the 

23  prosecutor himself,  the initial prosecutor in  this case, 

24  did  not, as the  court in  the Ninth Circuit  points out, 

25  believe  that  there was  enough  evidence to  support the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

37 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  heinous, cruel,  and depraved circumstance  -- aggravating 

2  circumstance.  But that --

3

 QUESTION:  Why  -- why should  that be a  factor 

4  that we  take into  consideration?  I  mean, surely  there 

5  could be  a difference  between prosecutors  and the  fact 

6  that  somebody  in the  DA's  office thought  there wasn't 

7  evidence 

--  

enough evidence  to  go ahead,  shouldn't be 

8  crucial in deciding  whether the finding was  correct made 

9  by the court or by the jury. 

10

 MR.  MURRAY:  It  just, Your Honor,  goes to the 

11  fact that  if two people on  the government's side  of the 

12  case  are  disagreeing  on  it,  then it  just  shows  the 

13  absolute  need and the  -- the essential  character of the 

14  jury's  role  in  determining  the  community's  sense  of 

15  whether such an aggravating factor did exist in this case. 

16

 Now, if  I can just  continue on the  old versus 

17  the new  then,  what  happened  then was  that  given  the 

18  understanding of the -- how the Arizona court worked, this 

19  Court went  back to -- to  the basics of  determining that 

20  every element  of an offense, in this case capital murder, 

21  must be  proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the State is 

22  not able to rely upon  mere labels or, you know,  drafting 

23  of  the sentence -- of the  statutes to give  a different 

24  determination to what those aggravating circumstances are. 

25

 And  so  this  is  really  back consistent  with 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

38 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  Mullaney  and 

--  

and Patterson  and  McMillan,  although 

2  McMillan  wasn't  out  at the  time  Mr.  Summerlin's case 

3  became final.  That was 2 years later.  But that series of 

4  cases. 

5

 When we  say it's -- it's old, it's as if Walton 

6  was a -- in  essence, a new rule and  Ring was a new  rule 

7  that  corrected  Walton. 

And  so  we're  back  for  Mr. 

8  Summerlin where he's raised this issue for 20  years since 

9  1983, over  20 years, and  -- and has  sought to have  the 

10  jury verdict on the capital  offense to make -- and  their 

11  determination of  whether he  was eligible  for the  death 

12  penalty.  And he has not been given that. 

13

 QUESTION:  Do you  agree, by the  way, with Mr. 

14  Wood that the  judge -- whatever  his name was -- that he 

15  didn't use the  presentence report  because that would  be 

16  considered hearsay under Arizona law? 

17

 MR. MURRAY:  I  do, Your  Honor.  There was  a 

18  significant amount of inadmissible  or irrelevant evidence 

19  that went to the judge,  Judge Marquardt, who was a  judge 

20  that had his own  problems in this case, but  that went to 

21  him that  would not  have been  reviewed or  heard by  the 

22  jury. 

23

24

 In addition, the -­

 QUESTION: 

But  Mr.  Wood  said  he  couldn't 

25  consider it because it was hearsay.  Is it -­

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

39 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

2

 MR. MURRAY:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  But  the judge  -- no more  than the 

3  jury,  the  judge  could  not  have  considered  that  in 

4  determining whether there was an aggravating factor. 

5

 MR.  MURRAY:  I  understand,  and I  agree that 

6  there  are  rules  that 

--  

and  there  are  rules  and 

7  presumptions  that say  that  the court  is  not going  to 

8  consider irrelevant or inadmissable evidence.  The problem 

9  we  have is that evidence is there.  The judges are human. 

10  They have human frailties as  this case shows, and in  the 

11  long  run, that  is  precisely  why  the  Framers  of  the 

12  Constitution  chose  to  have  the  juries  to  stand  as 

13  protectant bulwarks between the accused and the government 

14  officials who  are, you  know, seeking  to have  the death 

15  penalty imposed on the individual. 

16

 QUESTION: 

Who  don't  have  human  frailties. 

17  Right?  Juries -- juries without human frailties. 

18

 MR.  MURRAY:  We all  -- the juries, the judges, 

19  every one of us have human frailties, Justice Scalia. 

20

 QUESTION: 

There  -- there  were  a  number of 

21  issues that  you raised  in this  case that  -- that  they 

22  didn't get to below.  Is that right?  Because of the court 

23  of appeals' decision on the Ring retroactivity. 

24

 MR. MURRAY:  Yes, Your Honor.  There are all but 

25  -- they did rule on the ineffectiveness at the trial phase 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

 QUESTION:  And they rejected the -­

 MR. MURRAY:  -- as a preliminary matter, but the 

4  remainder of the  rules -- of the ineffectiveness  issues 

5  and the judge issues remain open.  And I -- I would assume 

6  that if we did  not prevail on this, that we'd  be back in 

7  the Ninth Circuit for a ruling on that. 

8

 If  there are  no further  questions, I  believe 

9  I've covered the issues, Your Honor.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. TODD 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. TODD:  If I may, I would like to  respond to 

15  Justice  Breyer's  question  concerning  flexibility  of 

16  Teague.  And I -- I would suggest that if this Court had a 

17  rule that so increased accuracy, a new rule, and so was -­

18  changed  this Court's understanding  of some truly bedrock 

19  principle, then this Court would  not care how many  cases 

20  it affected because it  was so important, so critical  and 

21  that you would apply it retroactively. 

22

 Conversely, if  a rule doesn't reach  that, then 

23  you don't apply it retroactively under Teague is -- is our 

24  understanding.  The -­

25

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1  important?  And the -- the briefs cite Gideon.  Is there


2  anything else? 

3

 MR. TODD:  I think  Gideon is the -- the  ideal, 

4  perfect example. 

5

6

 QUESTION:  Yes, but are there other examples? 

 MR. TODD:  I cannot think of one off the top  of 

7  my head, Your Honor.  These surely are not. 

8

 In 

--  

in terms  of  your concern  with whether 

9  there's any substance component to the Teague -- excuse me 

10  -- to the  Ring or Apprendi opinions, it seems  to me this 

11  Court's  opinion in Bousley  where you're  explaining what 

12  truly is  a substantive change and  you cite to  the first 

13  Teague  exception  in  the  Bousley  case,  that  sort  of 

14  explains  that 

--  

what  you're  really  concerned  with, 

15  particularly on habeas, is that we don't have somebody who 

16  shouldn't  be  convicted,  shouldn't be  punished  in  the 

17  system.  And  so if it falls within  like the first Teague 

18  exception or  if  you've  change the  law,  your 

--  

your 

19  understanding of  the law like in Bailey, or the other two 

20  cases that are cited in  the yellow brief, Fiore v.  White 

21  and Bunkley v. Florida, where  the State court interpreted 

22  State law and determined that in their construction of the 

23  law, they changed the scope of that statute -­
