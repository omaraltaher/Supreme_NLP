CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-1184, United States versus Francisco


Jimenez Recio and Mr. Lopez-Mesa. 


Mr. Dreeben. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This Court has made clear that conspiracy is an


inchoate offense, the essence of which is the agreement to


commit an unlawful act. 


QUESTION:  What does the word inchoate mean?  I


realize you're getting it from our opinions, but --


(Laughter.) 


MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that


it means an uncompleted offense, activities that have not


yet progressed to the point of having violated a


substantive provision of the criminal law, yet which


represent a sufficient step to warrant legal intervention


under the doctrine of either attempt or conspiracy.


QUESTION:  It's the opposite of a choate


offense, I assume, is it not? 


(Laughter.)

 MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, Justice Scalia, except that


word seems not to have appeared in this Court's opinions. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Or in the dictionary. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Well, it is in the dictionary.  I'm


getting it in a minute.  It will take me a minute to


noodle while I get it out of the dictionary. 


But I -- I thought that it meant something


that's not yet formed. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, in the case of a conspiracy,


Justice Kennedy --


QUESTION:  I thought that's what the word meant.


MR. DREEBEN:  It -- it may -- it means that


with --


QUESTION:  Incipient I suppose. 


MR. DREEBEN:  -- with -- right.  With reference


to the object offense.  So a conspiracy is an agreement to


commit an offense.  The offense has not yet been formed. 


It has not actually been realized, but the conspirators


have agreed to commit the offense. 


And the law of conspiracy deems it appropriate


for society to intervene at the stage at which the


conspirators have entered into that agreement so as to


protect society against two things.

 QUESTION:  And taken some act in furtherance of


it? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Justice O'Connor, under the drug


statute, this Court held in United States v. Shabani that


there is no requirement of proof of an overt act in order


to punish a drug conspiracy. 


QUESTION:  When does the conspiracy terminate,


in your view? 


MR. DREEBEN:  The conspiracy terminates, Justice


O'Connor, either when the conspirators achieve the


objective that they have agreed to carry out, or when they


have abandoned efforts to do so.  That fundamentally


reflects the principle that the essence --


QUESTION:  Or when one of them has abandoned


efforts.  I mean, if -- if one of them leaves the


conspiracy, I suppose you have a different conspiracy


then, or what? 


MR. DREEBEN:  No, not automatically, Justice


Scalia. 


QUESTION:  Suppose one of them knows that it's


no longer possible and he leaves the conspiracy.


MR. DREEBEN:  That individual will -- in order


to accomplish a withdrawal from the conspiracy has to do


more than simply leave it.  The law of withdrawal of a --


on withdrawal from a conspiracy requires that the

conspirator do some affirmative act to terminate the


existence of the conspiracy either by going to law


enforcement, or by communicating to his fellow


conspirators that he's done with the venture and he's out


of it.


But the termination of the participation of one


co-conspirator through withdrawal or abandonment or


telling law enforcement does not terminate the conspiracy.


The very nature of conspiracy is a group of individuals


who have come together to carry out an unlawful act, and


in order for the conspiracy to do that, it frequently will


grow and enlarge its membership.  Other members may drop


out.  But so long as there is a common agreement to commit


a definable crime or unlawful act, the conspiracy


continues.


QUESTION:  What if all but one drop out?  Does


a -- does a conspiracy continue as to that one? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, this Court has never


addressed the question, and I could find no cases in the


common law that had addressed the question.  Certainly


under the common law, you cannot have a unilateral


conspiracy, although the Model Penal Code would have


allowed that. 


There may, however, be policy reasons to hold


that once a conspirator has embarked upon his venture,

even if all of the other conspirators are arrested and


give up the effort, that one lone conspirator who still


soldiers on, without knowing that the other conspirators


have abandoned it, might properly be held liable for


seeking to accomplish the aims of the conspiracy. 


QUESTION:  It's a conspiracy of one, so to


speak, right? 


MR. DREEBEN:  If such an animal exists, it would


be a conspiracy in which all members but one have


abandoned the objective. 


In a case like this, however, where what happens


is that two members of a multi-member conspiracy are


arrested, one of them becomes a Government agent, the


other one perhaps does not -- and it's not clear that he


did abandon the efforts to accomplish the goals of the


conspiracy -- but there are many others at large who are


continuing to carry out the conspiracy, the criminal


agreement persists. 


And where the Ninth Circuit got off on the wrong


foot was by believing that a conspiracy ends when its


goals have been defeated.  When the object of the


conspiracy has been defeated, the Ninth Circuit thought,


the conspiracy is over.


That, however, is contradictory to the


fundamental principle of conspiracy law that the essence

of the crime is the agreement between the parties to carry


out an unlawful act, and to take the --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, what about --


QUESTION:  Would you -- would you tell me what


the conspiracy was that survived the -- the claimed end of


the conspiracy?  What -- what -- conspiracy to do what? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Conspiracy to distribute and


deliver marijuana and cocaine. 


QUESTION:  Was it the marijuana and cocaine that


had already been seized by the Government, or some other


marijuana? 


MR. DREEBEN:  As the case comes to this Court,


the conspiracy that survived was the conspiracy to


distribute that cocaine and marijuana that had been


seized. 


But what's crucial is that those conspirators


who remained liable were entirely unaware that the


Government had intervened and frustrated the objective of


the conspiracy. 


And I think that the hypothetical that makes


clear why the Ninth Circuit went wrong is the instance


where the Government enters the market in a reverse sting


operation and goes into the market as a seller, offering


to sell drugs, and a collective of individuals decides to


pool their resources and arrange to purchase the drugs

that the Government is offering.  It is highly likely that


the Government has no intention and never had any


intention of delivering actual drugs.  Therefore, the goal


of the conspirators is frustrated at the inception.  They


don't know it, but they could never accomplish the object


of their conspiracy.  Yet, it's settled in the Ninth


Circuit and elsewhere that the conspirators can still be


held liable because their agreement to perform an act


which, under the facts as they understand them, would be


unlawful. 


QUESTION:  And the difference between an attempt


and the conspiracy, in the attempt you need a dangerous


probability of success or something along that line, but


you don't need that in a conspiracy case. 


MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.  Conspiracy


intervenes at an earlier stage, Justice Stevens.  The


traditional Federal rule is that in an attempt, you need


the intent to perform the illegal act, plus a substantial


step towards its completion.  The law of attempt has


always required a little bit more activity on the part of


the defendant before the Government can intervene and


penalize it.  And that's in part because of the need to


have some corroborating evidence that the defendant


actually did intend to carry out an illegal act and to


avoid penalizing something as a thought crime.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, the first trial in this


case described a narrower conspiracy, did it not, than was


involved in the second trial?  And would you explain what


the difference was in the conspiracy charge initially


made, and the conspiracy charge in the second trial? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the conspiracy charge,


Justice Ginsburg, remained the same in both.  In the --


the indictment was not changed.  It was a single


indictment that alleged the conspirators formed an


agreement at a date unknown to the grand jury, but by


November 18th, 1997, to distribute and possess with intent


to distribute cocaine and marijuana. 


In the original trial, the parties were unaware


of the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States versus


Cruz, which forms the basis for the legal rule that the


Government challenges here.  And it, therefore, proceeded


on the -- what we believe to be the wholly correct theory


that respondents could be held liable for joining that


conspiracy on November 19th when they agreed to become


couriers to move the drugs further down the road in Idaho. 


They did not know that the drugs had actually been seized


earlier by the Government and that the Government was


watching them.  So the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Cruz


meant that what the Government had argued in the first


case no longer was sufficient to support conspiracy

liability.


QUESTION:  Is -- is there a temporal component


to your argument?  If the initial defendants had been


arrested and detained for a month and then they got around


to the sting operation, would it still be a conspiracy, or


does it lapse after some reasonable time? 


MR. DREEBEN:  It doesn't lapse through a period


of time, Justice Kennedy.  What could cause the conspiracy


to end is the conspirators' wholly abandoning pursuit of


the objectives of the conspiracy.  In other words, if all


of the conspirators on the outside -- those who were in


Arizona on the sending end and those who were on Idaho on


the delivery end -- had all concluded that something has


gone wrong with this shipment, the drugs have disappeared,


they could have abandoned the narrowest version of the


conspiracy --


QUESTION:  But so long as one of the end


delivery people didn't know about it and thought that the


drugs were still on the way, he could continue to recruit


people and so forth even if the principals had been in


jail for a month and the drugs had been seized for a


month?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the people who were in jail


were the couriers, not the principals. 


QUESTION:  Well, let's -- let's -- all right.

But even those -- some couriers had -- had been in jail. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Correct, because so long as those


individuals who are involved in the conspiracy are still


trying to accomplish its objective, the conspiracy is


still alive.  And as the -- as in the case of the


Government sting where there's never any drugs in the


outset, the conspiracy is impossible as a matter of fact


for the conspirators to successfully accomplish.  But if


it is accepted that that can be a crime, where there's a


Government sting at the outset, then surely the


Government's intervention in midstream doesn't


automatically terminate the conspiracy as a matter of law,


which is what the Ninth Circuit held. 


QUESTION:  Mr. --


QUESTION:  But explain again what you mean now? 


If, instead of cocaine, it had been powdered sugar, can


there be a conspiracy conviction? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Justice O'Connor, it would depend


on whether the powdered sugar is supplied by the


Government under the representation that it is cocaine, or


whether the defendants are actually seeking to move


powdered sugar knowing that they are seeking to move


powdered sugar. 


QUESTION:  No.  They think they're -- they have


a load of cocaine and that was their intent, but

unbeknownst to them, it's powdered sugar. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Liability.  Because the -- the


question of conspiracy liability is judged by what the


actor perceives to be the facts. 


QUESTION:  How is that different from an


agreement to receive stolen goods and then we find out


the -- goods are not stolen?  That's -- that's not


actionable I -- I had thought. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, it is the same, Justice


Kennedy, and -- and the uniform position in the Federal


courts is that it is.  That would be a mistake of fact,


and when the conspirators or the person who's attempting


to commit a crime has the intent to commit a crime and


takes a substantial step for it, the fact that unbeknownst


to him some aspect of the universe is such that he can't


complete the crime does not defeat the accomplishment of


the objective. 


QUESTION:  Well, if -- for a conspiracy


conviction, I mean, because the whole -- the whole purpose


is to prevent people banding together for wicked purposes,


but if -- if there's no conspiracy involved and he's


mistaken in the fact, I assume there's no crime. 


MR. DREEBEN:  No.  The -- the modern rule,


Justice Scalia, is that there is a crime.  In this


country, the earliest case that addressed it and the case

that all of us are familiar with from law school is People


versus Jaffe, a New York Court of Appeals case from 1906. 


And that case did, indeed, hold -- as Justice Kennedy has


described it -- that if the person is receiving what he


believes to be stolen goods and the goods are not stolen,


he is not liable. 


But the modern focus on attempt law is on the


intent of the actor to commit an illegal act, and the fact


that unbeknownst to him there are circumstances that


prevent him from accomplishing the completed crime does


not defeat his liability for an attempt. 


In other words, attempt law and conspiracy law


have, to an extent, converged on the policy that the


importance of inchoate crimes is to get at dangerous


actors. 


QUESTION:  What case would you cite to us for


this notion under attempt law?  Is -- is there anything


from this Court? 


MR. DREEBEN:  There -- the only thing that there


is from this Court, Justice O'Connor, are two opinions


that have addressed the obstruction of justice statute,


Osborn versus United States and United States versus


Aguilar.  In both of those cases, the Court was dealing


with a statute that didn't use the word attempt.  It used


the word endeavor.  And the Court made quite clear that

the impossibility of the defendant accomplishing the


objective of his crime doesn't defeat liability. 


In Osborn, it was an individual who was


attempting to bribe a juror.  Unbeknownst to him, the


intermediary, who he was using to pay the bribe, was


working with the FBI.  And of course, the bribe was not


going to be paid.  The juror was not going to be


corrupted.  And yet, the Court held that an endeavor to


commit the crime is punishable.


QUESTION:  Does the Model -- Model Penal Code


take a position on this? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  The Model Penal Code goes


very far in the direction of the intent-based focus of


attempt law and conspiracy law.  In the Model Penal Code,


there is no defense for impossibility of any kind, fact or


law. 


What the Model Penal Code does, however, is


allow, in certain extreme cases that it wasn't able to


craft a principle for, a power to a judge to either reduce


the grade of a crime or to dismiss it. 


And the Model Penal Code was thinking about


hypotheticals which have not come up in any cases that --


that anyone has actually found, such as where an


individual believes that he can kill through incantations


and voodoo and sets about to do so.  Under an orthodox,

doctrinaire approach to principles of attempt law, that


individual has the intent to kill, and has carried out a


substantial step.  Many commentators have said that should


not occasion liability because it's inherently impossible


that the actor will achieve his goal and in reality that


person is probably not a dangerous individual who warrants


punishment. 


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what's the difference


between being inherently impossible and the other kinds of


impossibility? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Only a matter of degree, Mr. Chief


Justice, and for that reason, the Model Penal Code


rejected a legal rule that would carve out inherent


impossibility and said that it's really something that


should go to whether a judge should reduce the grade of a


crime or dismiss it. 


Our position is that that sort of --


QUESTION:  Okay -- or dismiss it.  They -- they


just leave it up to the judge?  It's a crime or not


depending upon -- is there any other instance where the


Model Penal Code does this sort of thing? 


MR. DREEBEN:  I don't know if there are any


other instances where the Model Penal Code does it, but


our position is that the sounder approach is to --

 MR. DREEBEN:  -- leave those cases in the hands


of prosecutorial discretion and the common sense of


juries.  The fact is that there really are no


hypotheticals in real cases that resemble the killer by


incantation. 


QUESTION:  What did the Ninth Circuit rely on in


United States versus Cruz?  If -- if the law is as uniform


as you say it is, what -- what did they rely on?  They


must have relied on something. 


MR. DREEBEN:  The Ninth Circuit, I believe, made


a -- a linguistic mistake.  There are an abundance of


cases that say that a conspiracy ends when its goal is


either accomplished or defeated, and those cases, read in


context, mean that if the conspirators actually abandon


their efforts to complete the crime, or all of them are


arrested and they're in custody and they're really not in


a position to go forward anymore, the conspiracy ends at


that point. 


And frequently that sort of a determination is


made for purposes of the admission of co-conspirator


statements under 801(d)(2)(E).  You want to know whether


the conspiracy is alive so you can determine whether to


admit post-arrest statements by one conspirator against


another conspirator.  And in those cases, it makes perfect


sense to say that the conspiracy ended when all of the

co-conspirators are arrested and have given up. 


The Ninth Circuit took that language -- the


language referring to the defeat of the object of the


conspiracy -- and took it literally, and the effect was to


create a defense of factual impossibility.  And the court


actually used those words.  It was factually impossible


for the conspirators to complete their crime.  Therefore,


the conspiracy was over as a matter of law. 


QUESTION:  Is it the case -- four conspirators,


A, B, C, D.  A is arrested, out on bail.  A makes a few


statements which are overheard.  Can you admit that


hearsay against B, C, D, who are later found?


MR. DREEBEN:  It all depends, Justice Breyer, on


whether --


QUESTION:  I thought they couldn't. 


MR. DREEBEN:  -- on whether he's still


attempting to achieve the goal of the conspiracy.  There


are a -- a number --


QUESTION:  You say, would -- in that --


normally -- normally a person who's arrested, that ends


the conspiracy as to that person, doesn't it, at least


normally? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, not -- not necessarily,


Justice Breyer.  In this case, for example, one of the two


arrested couriers, Sotelo, reportedly told Arce, the other

arrested co-conspirator, that they should both tell a lie


to the authorities and then try to escape.  I mean,


that --


QUESTION:  No, I'm not thinking of that.  I'm


thinking it is an -- there -- there is no reason to


think -- all we know about him is he's arrested and he


happens to mention something to a neighbor that has


nothing to do -- who has nothing to do with the


conspiracy.  This statement is not made in furtherance of


any conspiracy.


MR. DREEBEN:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  It's simply made after A is arrested. 


As far as we know, A has nothing further to do with it.


MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.  So long as the


statement isn't made in furtherance --


QUESTION:  But -- that shows -- in other words,


that shows what?  That shows that although the conspiracy


in your view continues -- B, C, D -- but A has withdrawn? 


Is that what it shows? 


MR. DREEBEN:  No.  What it may show is that the


statement wasn't made in furtherance of the conspiracy. 


If he's simply talking to his neighbor, it may not be


doing anything to carry out the aims of the conspiracy. 


If, on the other hand --


QUESTION:  Inadmissible, in other words, even if

A has never been arrested? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Right.  The statement to be


admitted as a statement of a co-conspirator must be both


during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. 


So to continue your hypothetical, if you suppose that


A comes out, and then tries to communicate through


intermediaries that he knows where the drugs are and that


people should take efforts to secrete them before the


authorities seize them, then that statement could be


admitted as a co-conspirator's declaration.


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, could we just clarify


this particular case?  Why the -- the date of the 18th


when the two people involved -- the proof as to them goes


only from the next day on?  And why the -- their


conspiracy starts the day that the drugs are seized. 


Right?


MR. DREEBEN:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Although the larger conspiracy that


they're part of began presumably much before that. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Actually, I -- I think the -- the


way the case comes to this Court, the involvement of the


two couriers begins on November 19th, the day after the


drugs are seized, when they're recruited.


QUESTION:  Yes, but they're charged with a


conspiracy dating from the 18th.  Is that right?

 MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.  That's right. 


QUESTION:  Although they don't enter the picture


until the 19th. 


MR. DREEBEN:  As the case comes to this Court,


that's right.  When -- when the case was charged, the


parties weren't focusing on Cruz and the case was just


charged in the way conspiracies normally are; namely, the


grand jury alleges that the conspiracy came into existence


by a particular date when it could be certain that it did


come into existence.  It may have come into existence


earlier, and the grand jury's charge says from a date


uncertain, but at least by November 18, there was a


conspiracy in place and the following four individuals


were -- are to be charged as co-conspirators, plus others


unknown to the grand jury. 


Now, in light of the way the facts actually


panned out at -- at the trial, and given the holdings of


the Ninth Circuit that the Government failed to prove


pre-seizure involvement on the part of the respondent


couriers, the indictment might have more accurately been


written to say that on November 18th, at least, a


conspiracy was formed, and by November 19th the


respondents joined it.  The --


QUESTION:  Could the Government have charged a


separate, second conspiracy if it had chosen to do so?

 MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think so, Justice Kennedy,


because the crucial aspect of a conspiracy and a defining,


limiting principle is the scope of the nature of the


agreement.  Courts have worked out a multi-factor test to


determine whether you have one agreement or two


agreements.  And it focuses not on literal identity of


membership or complete chronological co-existence of the


participation of each conspirator, but whether there's a


common agreement which each is seeking to advance forward


in his own way and whether the excess of one is dependent


on the efforts of the others. 


Now, in this case, construed most narrowly, the


indictment alleges a conspiracy to move drugs, staring in


Phoenix, Arizona, through Las Vegas, and all the way up to


Idaho and then perhaps beyond that.  That is the


conspiracy in which respondents were involved as


substitute couriers brought in to move the truck from the


Karcher Mall in Idaho to its ultimate destination.  That's


the same conspiracy that existed at the outset.  The


original couriers, had they not been arrested, would have


completed the trip.  So what you have is one common


agreement in which all participants are working to achieve


the same goal, and there is only a switch of two members,


the two couriers, midstream --


QUESTION:  But you were going back to -- I think

you hadn't completed your answer to why it's okay that


even though the proof as to these two defendants starts on


the 19th, not on the 18th, it's okay to have the


indictment say they were participants from the 18th. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Ginsburg, if you read the


indictment as alleging that they were involved on the 18th


and we didn't show that they were involved until the


19th -- and as the case comes to this Court, that's what


we showed -- you have a variance between the allegations


of the indictment and the proof at trial.  And the settled


law on variances is that it is no defense for a defendant


if the proof varies from the conspiracy charged in the


indictment so long as the conspiracy that's proved up is


within the scope of the indictment, a lesser included


conspiracy, so to speak, and the defendants suffer no


prejudice from the variation. 


Now, in this case, everyone knew from the outset


that the centerpiece of the Government's proof against


respondents was going to be the observation of them


driving up after the call was placed to the Arizona


supplier of the drugs and getting into the truck and


driving the truck away down the highway in Idaho,


following which they were stopped and gave completely


unbelievable stories about what they were doing driving


around with a truck filled with drugs.  There was no

prejudice to the defendants in defending against a


conspiracy that was proved up based on the events of


the 18th because those events were always going to be at


the heart of the Government's proof that they were liable. 


So absent a showing of prejudice, the variance between the


allegations of the indictment and the proof at trial does


not warrant any relief. 


QUESTION:  But your -- your principal argument


is not in response to variance.  It's simply that on


the 19th they became -- excuse me -- they became part of a


conspiracy that had begun at least by the 18th.


MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  That's -- that's the essence of your


position. 


MR. DREEBEN:  That's -- the essence of our


argument is that -- and the Ninth Circuit in ruling that


the evidence was insufficient did not rely on principles


of variance or principles of multiple conspiracies or any


other fact-based, record-based analysis that would show


that the Government didn't prove the conspiracy alleged in


the indictment. 


What the Ninth Circuit relied on was its holding


in Cruz which is that a conspiracy ends when the


Government intervenes and renders its completion


impossible.  And the Ninth Circuit, therefore, reasoned

that respondents could not have joined the conspiracy


alleged in the indictment because that conspiracy was, as


a factual matter, over.  Accordingly, the only way on the


Ninth Circuit's view that the Government could win this


case is if the Government showed that respondents joined


the conspiracy before the seizure of the drugs, or if they


were involved in a broader conspiracy that involved other


drugs.  Only under those two assumptions did the Ninth


Circuit think that the Government could prevail. 


And the Ninth Circuit held that the evidence was


not sufficient to prove either of those other


conspiratorial activities.  It never questioned that the


evidence was overwhelming to prove a conspiracy to


participate in the distribution of drugs on November 19th,


when respondents showed up and got in the truck. 


And because the Ninth Circuit was wrong in its


holding that a conspiracy terminates when it becomes


factually impossible of accomplishment, the rest of its


analysis also crumbles. 


I'd like to save the remainder of my time for


rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Dreeben. 


Mr. Shurtliff, we'll hear from you.

 MR. SHURTLIFF:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court, counsel:


Mr. Sullivan and I expect that we were not


invited here to argue our view that the case below was


decided on the sufficiency of the evidence question. 


However, having said that, we would not wish to have it


taken that we abandon that argument. 


Mr. Chief Justice, a number of the questions


posed seemed to go to the heart of what this case is


about.  Justice Stevens asked, what was the conspiracy


that survived? 


The Government argues at length in the brief and


here today that -- notwithstanding the charge in the


indictment and the trial of this case below -- that by


November 18th, 1997, Mr. Recio and Mr. Lopez-Mesa could be


charged with the crime.  The fact of the matter is, is


that the indictment framed what this case was about by


November 18th. 


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Shurtliff, the only


question presented in the petition for certiorari is


whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law when the


Government frustrates its objective.  Now is -- is -- are


what you're about to say going to deal with that question?


MR. SHURTLIFF:  It is, Mr. Chief Justice,


because that's the argument that the Government makes that

we should not sustain the Ninth Circuit decision in this


case as framed by Judge Browning who formulated the


decision. 


QUESTION:  Well, but the Government formulated


the question here. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  I -- I understand that,


Mr. Chief Justice, and -- and we do speak to that. 


The -- the question was posed, What conspiracy


survives, and I'm suggesting that no conspiracy survived,


and that the answer is, is that the Government framed the


case as they would have it and that the issues that the


Government talks about here today and in their brief at


length as to when the -- these two late-comers to the


conspiracy enter -- came into it -- obscures that notion.


Your Honor -- or Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the


question posited in the -- in the petition for certiorari,


with all due respect, I don't think has been really argued


here much today by the Government.  The -- the question is


correctly whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law


when the Government frustrates its objective. 


That is taken from the formulation of former


Chief Judge Browning in this case below that he -- all


they said was -- in describing the case here and referring


back to Cruz -- in Cruz we ruled that a defendant could


not be charged with conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs

when the defendant was brought into the drug scheme only


after the law enforcement authorities had already


intervened and defendant's involvement was prompted by


that intervention. 


The Ninth Circuit didn't say that this was an


impossibility case, that it was impossible for the


conspiracy to continue as to other people.  What the Ninth


Circuit said in that case was in these circumstances -- in


these limited circumstances, in Cruz and in Recio -- that


given the Government intervention in the objective of the


conspiracy, given the Government intervention and the


invitation after that to join the conspiracy by Recio and


Lopez, that they couldn't join the conspiracy.  It was a


new --


QUESTION:  Why would impossibility caused by the


Government be any different from impossibility caused by


somebody else?  You -- you want to reframe -- you -- you


think that we could answer this question no, but still


find for your clients because this is not just


impossibility simpliciter, this is impossibility produced


by the Government. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  I think, Mr. Justice Scalia,


that you could answer the question no and still find for


our clients because this is not the case.  This is not why


they were -- the Ninth Circuit reversed their convictions.

The --


QUESTION:  There wasn't impossibility at all?


MR. SHURTLIFF:  There wasn't impossibility.


QUESTION:  What was it? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  It was termination.  They


added -- typically and historically --


QUESTION:  Well, why was it terminated?  It was


terminated -- people didn't write notes to each other


saying, you know, Let's call off the conspiracy.  It was


terminated, the Ninth Circuit found, because its object


was no longer possible.  I thought that's why they found


it had terminated. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  The object, Mr. Justice Scalia,


was -- was frustrated by the Government intervention. 


The --


QUESTION:  But the Government's position is


there's only two ways a conspiracy can end.  One we know


is not this case.  They didn't succeed.  The other, the


Government says, is that the conspirators have to abandon


it, not that it becomes -- there's an impediment to its


completion, but abandonment by one person, if she


withdraws from the conspiracy and tells the police, for


example, or tells the co-conspirators.  But an


impediment -- another impediment -- doesn't stop the


conspiracy from persisting.

 And the Ninth Circuit I thought pretty clearly


said, Yes, it does, and that -- wasn't there rather sharp


disagreement among the Ninth Circuit judges over this? 


They didn't treat it as a question of sufficiency of the


evidence. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Indeed, Justice Ginsburg, there


was sharp disagreement.  Justice -- Judge O'Scannlain and


eight other members of the court dissented from the -- not


granting the rehearing en banc. 


However, what -- the point I seek to make, not


very well, apparently -- is -- is that what the court


below did not say was that it was impossible to have a


conspiracy, but that they added to abandonment and


accomplishment a new ability to frustrate or end the


conspiracy.  That is Government -- and -- and narrowly. 


Government intervention that frustrates its objective and


that Government intervention invited the new participants


into it. 


And Justice Ginsburg, you -- you inquired as to


what -- or, Justice O'Connor, as to the -- as to the --


what the Model Penal Code might say about that.  And I


would suggest that in that regard, Wharton, in describing


that, said -- suggests that the Model Penal court -- Code


suggests the position that if the conduct is, quote, "so


inherently unlikely to result or culminate in the

commission of a crime that no public danger is presented


warranting defendant's punishment as a conspirator." 


And I think that's what the Ninth Circuit was


saying in this case, that if we look at this historical


purposes of conspiracy -- and the Government has well


traversed that in its briefs and its reply brief -- that


the gist, the gravamen of a conspiracy is the


combination that -- to agree to do something. 


Mr. Justice Kennedy, you inquired whether to do


something that's not illegal is -- can be a conspiracy,


and I suggest that that -- that's part of what brings us


here is the confusion as to when you can and cannot and


ought not have a conspiracy. 


QUESTION:  Well --


QUESTION:  But there -- there is a public danger


presented by people who band together to rob a bank even


when there is no money in the bank.  It's utterly


impossible.  Right?  That -- that's quite different from


the -- the unquestionable fact that there's no public


danger presented by people who band together to curse


somebody with -- with a voodoo doll.  You can say, well,


you know, That's a harmless conspiracy, but a conspiracy


to rob a bank is not harmless.  These are bad people, and


if they don't do this bank, they may do another bank. 


Now, you acknowledge that that is a conspiracy

even though there -- a criminal conspiracy even though


there's no money in the bank.  Right? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Indeed, Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  But you say it does -- it is not a


criminal conspiracy if the reason there is no money in --


in the bank is that the Government has removed the money


from the bank knowing that there's going to be a -- a


break-in?


MR. SHURTLIFF:  There would be no conspiracy if


the Government had intervened in that conspiracy early on


and the involvement of the participants charged was only


as a result of that involvement. 


QUESTION:  So if the Government took the money


out of the bank, that would be different than if there was


just no money there from the outset. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  I'd think not, Mr. Justice


Scalia.  I think the -- the question would be what the --


what the participants who were engaged to participate


in -- in the robbing of the bank thought. 


QUESTION:  They -- well, in both cases they


thought there was money in the bank.  In one case, they


were wrong because there was never money in the bank.  It


was a blood bank.  Okay?


(Laughter.)

 QUESTION:  In the second case, there was no

a -- a robbery, had removed it.  And you say that there's


something different about the second case.


MR. SHURTLIFF:  I -- I don't think there's


anything different, Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  Okay.  I don't think so either. 


QUESTION:  Then what is your reason?  I'm just


trying to get -- A, B, C, and D form a conspiracy to


deprive a person of civil rights, to rob a bank, to commit


an act of terrorism, whatever.  They do it on January 1. 


On March -- in March, a Government agent infiltrates.  Now


it'll fail.  In April three more people join.  All right?


Now, why should the law not be those three


people are just as guilty as anybody else? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Mr. Justice Breyer, they can be,


and they ought to be depending on the facts of the case,


and that's why the --


QUESTION:  The facts of the case are just what I


said.  Now what? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  I think -- I think they're


guilt -- they -- I think they -- they're in on the


conspiracy.


QUESTION:  You think they're guilty.  Okay.


MR. SHURTLIFF:  They're guilty of the

conspiracy. 


QUESTION:  They're guilty and they joined


after --


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Whether they're guilty or not is


another question. 


QUESTION:  No, no.  I'm -- all the facts are


just as I say. 


So, they're guilty, and now what they did is,


after all, join it after the infiltration of the


Government agent made it absolutely certain there would be


no success. 


All right.  Now, how is that different than the


facts before us? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Because the facts before us are


that these two individuals joined at the behest of the


Government, and that they were charged and tried for


activity before the date of November 18th, 1997.  They


were -- the -- the Government's focus on this case was


narrow.  They weren't charged.  And one of the


questions --


QUESTION:  Now -- now I take -- you say, number


one, you take my hypothetical and say, but the Government


-- what did the Government do that was different from the


hypothetical?  The Government --


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Intervened.

MR. SHURTLIFF:  Frustrated. 


QUESTION:  They joined it. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  They frustrated the objective of


the conspiracy --


QUESTION:  That's true in my hypothetical too. 


Now what? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  And then they encouraged the


participation by their intervention of the --


QUESTION:  Oh, they led.  I see.  The Government


led my three extra people to join. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Indeed. 


QUESTION:  So you're saying it's like an


entrapment. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  It's -- it's similar to, but


different --


QUESTION:  No, no.  It's not quite as strong as


an entrapment.  So what you're argument is, is that where


the Government has joined, thereby frustrating the


objective, and in addition brings about the circumstances


through which the later membership, A, B -- of my three


extra people take place, that's close enough to


entrapment, plus the fact that the conspiracy can't


exceed -- can't succeed.  Put those two things together


and you have grounds for not convicting.

QUESTION:  Is that the argument? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  And you have this case,


Mr. Justice Breyer. 


QUESTION:  And all right, and you have this


case.  But -- so it's like a -- a mix.  It's like an


impossibility/entrapment mix.  That's the argument. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Well, I -- I'm not --


QUESTION:  I'm not ridiculing the argument.  I'm


trying to understand it.  It's a -- it's an interesting


argument. 


QUESTION:  Is that what the Ninth Circuit said? 


That -- this argument you're making -- is that the basis


on which the Ninth Circuit held that this -- this


conviction couldn't stand? 


I thought it was just simply, you know, whether


they were enticed in or not.  The mere fact that -- the


mere fact that it was no longer possible to execute the --


the conspiracy was enough. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Mr. Justice -- or Justice


Scalia, I -- I don't think that they got to the notion of


entrapment or enticement, and -- and that's -- I think


that -- and so I can't say that -- that that's part of the


predicate for how they got where they got -- went in this


case.  I think they focused on the Government intervention

and the Government involvement without calling it the


typical terms of entrapment --


QUESTION:  It relied on Cruz, and in Cruz it


said it extends -- the court said it extends conspiracy


liability beyond reasonable limits to say that it


continues when the product can no longer be delivered and


all that remains is for a new recruit to be added. 


But there is no reason given for that in -- in


Cruz.  There must be some legal doctrine that it rests


upon.  Impossibility or entrapment are the -- are the two


categories that we know. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  I --


QUESTION:  This is something else.  I --


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Mr. Justice Kennedy, I think --


I think the question was similarly asked to -- to the


Government, and I -- I would probably agree with their


answer.  I think they relied on Castro, a predecessor case


from the Ninth Circuit, and then they relied on another


case. 


I think what happened -- I don't know -- was is


that -- like many of us, the more you study the area of


conspiracy, I think the more confused you get.  And I


think that's what Justice Jackson was talking about, and I


would urge that we consider what he said because I think 


they -- they blended in and it's different -- it's hard to

dichotomize between impossibility and termination and


multiple --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't -- I don't know what's


confusing about having people with a criminal intent


who -- who join a conspiracy with the intent to violate


the law being called conspirators.  That's not -- it


doesn't sound like rocket science to me. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  But, Mr. Justice Kennedy, the --


the -- in Cruz, he was invited to join the conspiracy


after -- only after -- the Government was sitting there


with the drugs and he was a late recruit to the process. 


He wasn't an early conspirator.  In this case, these


persons were invited to join only after the Government had


fully intervened.  They could have stopped it then.  The


only activity was to get new recruits. 


And what the Ninth Circuit said in both cases --


they didn't say they couldn't be charged with a new


conspiracy.  They could have been charged with it. 


Indeed, they left that open in both Cruz and here.  They


could have been charged in a new conspiracy for the


activities that they engaged in. 


QUESTION:  Well, you think that this


defendant -- these defendants could have been charged in a


new conspiracy?  It seems that -- that undercuts your


argument.  I thought the whole purpose of this argument

was to have some reasonable confines on how long a


conspiracy can exist after everybody knows it's not going


to go forward.  And now you say there was a second


conspiracy that could have been charged? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  I think they could have been


charged with a second conspiracy starting on the 19th. 


They weren't charged.  I -- I --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben said that was a variance


whether it was the -- they joined on the 18th or the 19th. 


The question is what did they join, and why should it make


a difference?


MR. SHURTLIFF:  It should --


QUESTION:  If these defendants didn't know there


had been any seizure, why should it -- why should their


guilt turn on that factor?  As far as they're concerned,


this is a truck that has gotten by the Government's


surveillance. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Justice Ginsburg, the -- the


question of variance is another one of those little things


that pop up and confuse some of us. 


But the issue in this case, there was no


variance because the Government said, we indict you for


activity by November 18th, 1997.  The prosecutor stood


before the jury in his opening and his closing.  The


instructions all went to the issue, We will show that

these persons were engaged in this activity for either a


single load -- the load at issue -- or that they were


members of a larger conspiracy before November 18th, 1997.


QUESTION:  But that's not --


MR. SHURTLIFF:  That's not variance. 


QUESTION:  -- that's -- that's not part of the


question before this Court.  The question before this


Court is whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law when


the Government frustrates its objective.  And whether


there might be some other grounds that the Ninth Circuit


might have decided it on, that is not before us.


MR. SHURTLIFF:  And as to that issue, Mr. Chief


Justice, as we said it in our briefs and I said it in my


brief specifically, I believe, that the policy that's come


down through the -- through the -- conspiracy is not that


old -- that there is no good reason why the answer to that


question ought not be yes, that a -- that a -- it is


terminated as absolutely as if the conspiracy were


abandoned or if it were accomplished because there is no


good -- there is no chance of it being successful. 


There's no chance of the unified activity creating the


dangers that we speak of and -- when we're -- when we're


trying to combat conspiracy. 


QUESTION:  And that -- and that would follow --


that would also be true if the project was impossible from

the outset.  Right?  That -- I mean, that's what I don't


understand.  You -- you say if -- if they enter in a --


into a conspiracy to rob a bank in which there is no


money, that can be prosecuted.  Right? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  It has been, Mr. --


QUESTION:  Well, I know it has been, you say. 


But it can -- but it can be. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Surely.  Surely.


QUESTION:  Well, why doesn't that violate your


principle?  You say there's no harm done there either.


There is just as -- just as much no concrete harm that


could have been done there except the harm of wicked


people banding together, which is what -- what the crime


of conspiracy is directed against.  Why should it make any


different -- difference whether the impossibility exists


from the outset, or whether -- whether it -- it occurs


later in the scheme.  What -- why does that make any


difference? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  I think it probably should not


make much difference --


QUESTION:  No, I don't think so. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  -- in a lot of cases, but I


think each case is fact-specific, Mr. Justice Scalia.  And


I think in this case you have to look at what was charged,


what was tried, and what the conspiracy was about.  And --

certiorari.

QUESTION:  Why don't you proceed with your


argument? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Thank -- thank you.


The issues here raise difficult questions.  The


whole area of conspiracy raises difficult questions of

interpretation and -- and law.  I suggest, and we suggest


that the decision below is not as far-reaching as it might


otherwise appear, that Justice Browning formulated a


result in this case that's much narrower than what we're


about. 


But on the other hand, having said that, and


being here, the question is whether the Government


intervention in these circumstances, in these extant


circumstances, ought end the opportunity and the ability


to join a conspiracy.  We simply urge that frustration of


the purpose of the -- by the Government -- invitation to


join by the Government in these circumstances is no less


or is no more in keeping with the termination of the


conspiracy than would be had they -- some of the people


abandoned the conspiracy or had it been accomplished.


The Government argues that the answer to this


question, if we answered it in the affirmative, would


raise havoc with our ability to prosecute these kinds of


cases.  We would suggest that that's not the instance


here.  Here in -- here and in Cruz, as near as we can


tell, Cruz has been cited once; this case not at all. 


It's not a set of circumstances that are likely to reoccur


often or with great --


QUESTION:  Suppose in this -- suppose in this


case the truck had been apprehended in Arizona, and

neither of the participants at that point cooperated with


the police except to tell the police that their


instructions were to drive the truck to a certain place. 


Then without any Government intervention in calling Recio


and his buddy -- Recio and -- and his co-defendant show up


without any Government intervention.  So we have the


Government seizure, just as you do in this case, but the


scenario plays out just as it was arranged without any


Government intervention.  In that case, would you say that


the -- that the conspiracy continued and these people are


properly prosecuted? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Yes.


QUESTION:  May I ask --


MR. SHURTLIFF:  But that's not what happened


here.  The -- the -- they were intercepted --


QUESTION:  You're making it turn on the


Government having a part in bringing in the latecomers.


MR. SHURTLIFF:  And -- and I -- I retreat again


to the -- what they were charged with and what the


indictment was and what they -- that we will prove that


they were involved by November 18th, 1997.  We will prove


that.  That's what this case is about.  That's what they


kept saying and they argued that throughout. 


Now, here they want to suggest that -- that by


going to the 19th, it provokes no prejudice on the part of

the defendants.  That's not the case they were charged


with.  That's not the case that was tried below.  And so,


in your hypothetical, Justice Ginsburg, I think yes, but


there was no involvement and -- and depending on how they


were charged.  And I --


QUESTION:  Counsel, it -- it looks like the


instruction to the jury said that a defendant may only be


found guilty of the conspiracy charged in the indictment


if he joined the conspiracy at a time when it was possible


to achieve the objective of that conspiracy.  Was that the


instruction given them? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  It was, Justice O'Connor. 


QUESTION:  So that means the jury must have


found that -- that there was evidence sufficient to say


they joined before the impossibility occurred.


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Indeed. 


QUESTION:  Did the Government object to that


instruction, do you know? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  No.  The Government supported


that, Mr. Justice Stevens. 


QUESTION:  What should happen if the trial judge


faithfully followed Cruz?  And under Cruz, the jury should


not have found him liable, but we say that Cruz is wrong. 


Does it still have to go back for a new trial? 


Because the -- on page 76a of the appendix, the

instructions seem to say that -- one of two things.  You


can only find him guilty of the conspiracy if he joined it


prior to 1:18 a.m. on November 18th.  On the other hand,


if you find there's a larger conspiracy, you can find him


guilty, but that larger conspiracy must be to distribute


other drugs than those that were seized.  So I -- I


suppose the proof doesn't support either of those


conspiracies. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  And -- and that, Mr. Justice


Kennedy, is what the Ninth Circuit said, that it doesn't


support either the single load --


QUESTION:  What happens if we think this


instruction was wrong?  Under the evidence, the defendants


should have been convicted, and that Cruz is wrong.  Do we


still have to send it back? 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  I think, Mr. Justice Kennedy,


you send it back to the Ninth Circuit for a determination


whether, but for a decision that Cruz is incorrectly


applied in the facts in this case, would the decision


below remain the same. 


And I suggest, with all due respect to the


Government's position in this case, that the -- that it


could be concluded that notwithstanding the application of


Cruz in the Ninth Circuit below, that the decision of the


Ninth Circuit could by -- almost by redacting it,

eliminating the references to Cruz -- come to the same


conclusion.  The evidence was just simply insufficient to


sustain the conviction for either the single load or the


multi-load before November 18th.


QUESTION:  Of course --


QUESTION:  Assuming Cruz is right.  Assuming


Cruz is right.


QUESTION:  I'm assuming Cruz is wrong, and then


it would seem to me the evidence is fully sufficient to


convict if Cruz is wrong because it doesn't make any


difference if they joined it before or after 1:18 a.m. on


the 18th.


QUESTION:  Can I ask another question?  Is


there -- is it conceivable that the jury found that the


evidence after the impossibility was sufficient to sustain


the verdict?  Because they weren't asked to find that. 


I mean, I don't -- as I understand Mr. Dreeben's


argument, there was plenty of evidence later on, that they


joined the -- they joined an ongoing conspiracy, but the


charge didn't ask them to find that, as I -- maybe


Mr. Dreeben will comment on it in his rebuttal.  I --


MR. SHURTLIFF:  I -- I think that's entirely


correct, Justice Stevens.  The -- the jury wasn't asked to


find that, and the -- and the Government was very careful


in the way they tried this case.  We will show you that

by, and the whole case was by.  In the Ninth Circuit, the


issue was whether by that date the indictment and the --


and the trial. 


The -- if -- if Cruz is -- if Cruz is wrong, the


question would still be whether these persons entered into


a conspiracy. 


QUESTION:  And had you raised that further


question in the Ninth Circuit?  In other words, did you go


to the Ninth Circuit and say, Apply Cruz, period, or did


you go to the Ninth Circuit with other reasons?


MR. SHURTLIFF:  Mr. Justice -- or Justice


Souter, we -- we went to the Ninth Circuit with -- with


other reasons because the court --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. SHURTLIFF:  -- in the instructions that


we've read did apply Cruz, and everybody was satisfied --


QUESTION:  I just wanted to know whether -- I


just wanted to know whether you had raised anything beyond


a Cruz point, and the answer is yes, okay. 


MR. SHURTLIFF:  The sufficiency of the evidence,


ineffective -- there were several issues raised and -- and


decided. 


The Government suggests that if we allow this


decision to stand, that it would cause irreparable injury


and damage to the ability of the Government to prosecute

crime, to catch people who are miscreants, and that it


would make inordinately difficult the choices of the


prosecutor in determining what and how to charge.  We


would suggest simply that that's the obligation of the


prosecutors now.  Cruz doesn't add any burdens to the


prosecutorial responsibility. 


Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Shurtliff.


Mr. Dreeben, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


To address the jury instruction issue first, the


jury in this case was instructed in accordance with the


requirements of Cruz, and therefore, the jury was asked to


find whether there was evidence of respondents'


involvement in the conspiracy before the seizure of the


drugs or, alternatively, whether they were involved in a


broader conspiracy, not limited to the drugs that were


seized. 


At pages 6 through 8 of our reply brief at the


petition stage, we addressed the consequences of what


happens if this Court should conclude that the Cruz legal


rule is incorrect.  And in essence, our position is that


49

any rational jury that found guilt under the Cruz


instructions also would have found that respondents were


involved in a conspiracy to distribute the very drugs that


they drove to the Karcher Mall to pick up.  That was the


centerpiece of the Government's evidence, that respondents


were involved in a conspiracy, and the fact that the jury


may have found that respondents were involved in a longer


conspiracy, or in other conspiracies wouldn't detract from


the rationality of its necessarily concluding that the


respondents were also involved in this conspiracy. 


Even if this Court didn't agree with that


rationale or chose not to reach it, it's important to note


that the effect of the Ninth Circuit's holding is to find


insufficient evidence to prove the crime charged in the


indictment.  That doesn't leave the Government with the


option of pursuing a new trial on correct instructions


with the Cruz findings purged from them.  It would mean


that respondents have permanent immunity from the crime


that's charged in the indictment.  If this Court were to


conclude that Cruz is wrong, and either this Court or the


Ninth Circuit also concluded that the jury instructions


somehow prejudiced the defendants, the remedy would be a


new trial. 


It is also important, I believe, to note that

would go contrary to what this Court has noted about the


evolution of conspiracies.  In a case called Blumenthal


versus United States, which we did not cite in our briefs,


but it appears at 332 U.S. 539, the Court noted that


conspiracies involving elaborate arrangements generally


are not born full-grown.  Rather, they mature by


successive stages which are necessary to bring in the


essential parties. 


And in this case, two essential parties were


brought in not at the inception of the conspiracy, but


after events that the conspirators were aware of required


that new couriers were brought in.  They were not aware


that the Government had seized the drugs, but they knew


that they needed new couriers.  They brought them in. 


Under the principles of Blumenthal, that's all one


conspiracy. 


Respondents' counsel has mentioned the Model


Penal Code provisions.  The Model Penal Code at section


5.01 addresses the question of impossibility under attempt


law and concludes that the defense should not be


recognized and at section 5.03 does the same for


conspiracy. 


Finally -- thank you. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,


Mr. Dreeben.
