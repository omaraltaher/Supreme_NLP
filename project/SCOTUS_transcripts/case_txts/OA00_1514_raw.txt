CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 00-1514, Lance Raygor and James Goodchild v.


the Regents of the University of Minnesota.


Mr. Bolter. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD L. BOLTER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BOLTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Section 1367 is a constitutional and sensible


response by Congress to the serious procedural problems


that were facing the Federal courts prior to 1990.  Those


procedural problems arose due to State claims that were


pending in the Federal courts at that time under this


Court's, what was then called, pendent jurisdiction and is


now called supplemental jurisdiction.  The problem


specifically was what happens to those State claims that


are pending in Federal court when the expiration of the


statute of limitations on those claims occurs. 


The courts were faced with a dilemma at that


point, do they dismiss these claims and risk having them


not be refiled in the State court or do they retain those


-- the supplemental jurisdiction over those claims and


decide issues that might be better suited for the State

courts when they don't -- when the Federal court no longer


wants to exercise that jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  What -- what's wrong with, as some


courts did, conditioning dismissal upon -- upon the


plaintiff's -- upon the defendant's agreement to -- to


waive the statute?


MR. BOLTER:  The problem with that solution,


Justice Scalia, is that there is no guarantee that there


would be an agreement to waiver.  The defendant is -- it's


up to the defendant to agree to that waiver and to say


that they will -- they will not bring up that statute of


limitations defense in State court.


QUESTION:  Right, and if he doesn't waive, then


-- then you proceed in Federal court because it's just not


-- not a proper -- proper basis for dismissing it.  What's


-- what's the matter with that solution? 


MR. BOLTER:  In that -- in that situation, it


might work.  There might be supplemental jurisdiction and


the plaintiffs will not lose their claims. 


However, that is just one court's potential


solution.  There were a number of solutions that were


being attempted at the time with varying effectiveness. 


It didn't guarantee, across the board, that plaintiffs


would be able to bring those State claims in Federal court


and be assured that they would be -- that they wouldn't be

forfeited if the statute of limitations ran out. 


One -- one possible solution to the problem


doesn't make 1367 unconstitutional.  1367 was a -- was a


general response to a general problem that was occurring


below.


QUESTION:  How about the Solicitor General's


suggestion that we construe the statute so as not to apply


to nonconsenting -- actions against nonconsenting States?


MR. BOLTER:  To do that, the Court needs to


address the threshold question of whether the statute


abrogates in -- in the first place, whether tolling is an


abrogation of the State's immunity, and we contend that it


is not. 


QUESTION:  Well, but the Solicitor General says,


as I understand his brief, that we would avoid that


constitutional question if we construed the statute in the


manner that he asked us to construe it.


MR. BOLTER:  If the -- if that scenario was


taken and -- and the construction is -- is construed not


to apply to the States, there will be serious


constitutional problems that will be created by that


construction, particularly depriving the -- the Federal


litigants of their access to the Federal forum. 


QUESTION:  Well, what constitutional provision


do you say would be violated if we followed that

suggestion? 


MR. BOLTER:  The right -- the due process rights


of a plaintiff to have their cause of action heard in a --


in a certain forum, to make sure that they would have


those claims heard. 


QUESTION:  What case supports your position


there?  What case from this Court? 


MR. BOLTER:  I don't know if there's a case


that's -- oh, I'm sorry.  I take that -- that's the Logan


case that -- that shows that a -- that a plaintiff has a


right to have their -- their cause of action heard.


QUESTION:  But not to have a cause of action


heard in Federal court against a State.


MR. BOLTER:  That -- that's correct, not to have


-- not to have it heard in -- in the Federal court against


the State, but to have it heard in some forum.  The way --


QUESTION:  But suppose the State decided it


wasn't going to waive its immunity.  As I understand it,


in Minnesota, you could bring this claim within 45 days. 


The State has waived its immunity for suit in its own


court.


MR. BOLTER:  That's -- that's right. 


QUESTION:  So -- but it -- you're not suggesting


that it had to do that, otherwise there would be a due


process violation.  If that were so, then the State

doesn't have any immunity because due process would compel


it to -- to answer. 


MR. BOLTER:  What we are saying is that the due


process violation would be if you construe the statute not


to apply to the States, you don't have the protection of


tolling a State claim against a State in Federal court. 


And if a State asserts its constitutional defense of


sovereign immunity, that claim could be barred, but be --


in --


QUESTION:  But it wouldn't have been if you had


filed a protective action.  Suppose you had -- with this


uncertain question of Eleventh Amendment immunity from


suit in Federal court, you could have, on the same day you


filed in Federal court and took a chance on that, filed a


protective action in Minnesota State court.


MR. BOLTER:  We -- we could have filed a


protective action, but the -- that has -- I think there


are two parts to that -- that answer.


First, we could have filed a protective action,


but there's no guarantees that the State would have stayed


that action.  It might have -- it might have forced


litigation on that matter, creating res judicata and


claims preclusion issues in the Federal court.  It might


have sought to dismiss it because of claims splitting.


And the next part of the question is that the --

the Supreme Court of Minnesota said that this was a


facially unconstitutional -- section 1367 --


QUESTION:  But wouldn't it -- it wouldn't have


occasion to say that -- as I understand it, when


duplicative actions are brought, the second court, the one


where you file second, generally although it's not


compelled to do this, will say, okay, prior action


pending.  We'll stay this case till the other one is


finished.


MR. BOLTER:  They -- they could do that, but the


point is that it wasn't -- there was no guarantee that


they will.  They might also choose not to stay it and not


to clog up their dockets and have -- have cases affecting


their statistics. 


QUESTION:  You have -- you're using a lot of


mights.  Do you have any -- do we know how Minnesota State


courts treat the prior action pending plea?  Do they


dismiss or do they keep it? 


MR. BOLTER:  They -- if the claim is filed in


Minnesota on -- they will not dismiss if it was clear that


the Federal court would not have exercised jurisdiction


over that Federal -- over that State claim. 


And in Minnesota, it was not clear at that time,


and it's still not clear because the -- the university and


the States have this constitutional defense which they can

assert or not assert.  It's at their discretion.  In fact,


some of the cases that we've cited show that Minnesota,


the university, has litigated cases, on the merits in


Federal court, State and Federal claims. 


So, the point there is that we didn't know that


the court would not exercise jurisdiction over the State


claims, and if we were to file with that knowledge in --


in State court, they could have dismissed on claims


splitting or claim preclusion ground -- or claims


splitting grounds because the Federal court might have


exercised jurisdiction.  It was not clear.


QUESTION:  It seems to me the principle you're


arguing for -- I'm just not sure what its -- what its


boundaries are.  The principle, as I take it, is when --


when the Federal Government creates a Federal cause of


action, any State law that impedes -- and -- and allows


that Federal action to be brought in Federal court, any


State law that impedes the bringing of that action in


Federal court can be repealed by the Federal Government. 


How does that apply, for example, to simple


statutes of limitations?  Let's -- let's assume you -- you


have a Federal statute of -- of a year for certain -- for


a certain transaction or occurrence.  The State statute


for the same transaction or occurrence and the State's


cause of action is just 6 months.  Now, would you argue

that because of the difficulty of claims splitting and so


forth, the Federal Government can prescribe by statute


that the State cause of action shall be extended to 12


months? 


MR. BOLTER:  No, that's not what we are saying.


QUESTION:  Well, why not?  If you say no, then


you acknowledge the principle that, you know, there are


some problems that have no solution, and -- and the mere


fact that you're making the Federal cause of action more


difficult has nothing to do with whether there's Federal


power to -- to solve that particular problem. 


MR. BOLTER:  The -- the scenario that you just


posed about the 6-month and the 1-year time limits -- you


could still file that State claim in Federal court within


6 months.  You have to comply with the -- the State cause


-- the State statute of limitations.  It's just in a forum


that maybe the State will ultimately object to.


QUESTION:  Yes, but the Federal Government wants


to give you 12 months in its courts.  That's -- that's the


policy that it's decided.  We want to give you 12 months,


and here's a State which has a State cause of action.  It


is -- it is putting you to the choice.  You either forego


the -- the State cause of action or -- or you -- you file


within 6 months.  Doesn't that impede, to some extent,


what the Federal Congress wanted to happen?

 MR. BOLTER:  I think in your -- in that


hypothetical, it probably would impede, but that's not the


situation that we have in front of us. 


QUESTION:  Oh, I understand it isn't, but -- but


I -- but the principle you're arguing for, it seems to me,


leads to that conclusion, that the Federal Government can


-- can reconfigure State causes of action willy-nilly so


that they don't impede the bringing of Federal causes of


action in Federal court as Congress wishes.


MR. BOLTER:  What the -- what the statute does


here, if it's applied to a State, is it tolls the time


limit.  It doesn't -- it doesn't change the time limit for


the -- the statute of limitations.  If we were to file


this claim on the 50th day, 1367(d) wouldn't apply.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I wonder about that.  My


understanding is -- correct me if I'm wrong, please --


that the Federal statute gives you an extra 30 days.


MR. BOLTER:  It gives you the -- the tolling --


the tolling provision runs for 30 days after the time


after the dismissal.


QUESTION:  Well, and so if you -- if -- if as in


this case, I think you file on the last day or the next-


to-the-last day in the Federal court, then you're given an


extra 30 days.  So, you do reconfigure the State statute,


contrary to your suggestion.  And -- and I have a

significant problem with that.  It might be that the


tolling provision is necessary in order to make the


Federal courts operate and exercise their jurisdiction in


an efficient manner, but this statute goes beyond that and


gives a longer statute of limitations. 


MR. BOLTER:  Well, it gives a longer tolling --


QUESTION:  It does reconfigure the statute of


limitations. 


MR. BOLTER:  I would respectfully disagree that


it reconfigures the -- the statute of limitations because


it's -- the statute -- the State statute has to be


complied with in order for 1367 to -- to be triggered.  It


has to be filed within the appropriate time period.  And


-- and that meets the statute of limitations objectives


that the State was seeking when it -- when it created that


45-day period.  The fact that it's being tolled after it's


been timely filed is not -- that's -- that's not a core


interest that's protected by the State sovereign immunity. 


Tolling a statute that has been complied with, in this


case filing within that 45 days --


QUESTION:  Well, it hasn't been complied with


under State law.  If -- if the State law acknowledged the


filing in Federal court as -- as satisfying the statute of


limitations, you wouldn't be here.  The problem is the


State law says you have to file the action in State court

within the statute of limitations period, and we're not


going to give you any grace period for a false start that


you made in Federal court.


MR. BOLTER:  Well, the -- the State statute is


silent on tolling.  It's not a condition of -- of the


State's waiver of that 45-day period and --


QUESTION:  But the State court here found that


the State district court did not abuse its discretion in


saying there wouldn't be any tolling, did it not? 


MR. BOLTER:  That's what -- they found that


there was no abuse of discretion, but that was -- that --


the State court's initial decision there was based on a --


an erroneous interpretation of Pennhurst II when --


QUESTION:  Well, but that presumably is up to


the Minnesota courts to decide when the -- when the State


statute is tolled. 


MR. BOLTER:  They have the discretion to decide


that, but it's our position that the tolling provision of


1367(d) can also toll that time period because it's not


abrogating the State's sovereign immunity.  It's not --


QUESTION:  Well, but you know, you say it isn't


tolling because it's -- it doesn't really go to the length


of the statute of limitations, one.  But it does, you


know.  If you say the -- if you want to say a statute of


limitations is tolled for a year, obviously that extends

the time that the State law would have allowed.


MR. BOLTER:  But it doesn't defeat the purpose


of -- of the statute of limitations and -- and the need to


file in a timely fashion with that State statute to begin


with.  And I think that's what the -- the State -- the --


if the State has a core interest in the statute of


limitations, that's what it would be, is that claims are


filed within that time period.  Now, whether it's filed in


a -- in a jurisdiction to which the State ultimately


objects is -- is another point. 


QUESTION:  That isn't self-evident.  I mean, if


what you're saying is true, every State would


automatically allow tolling when suit is filed in a


Federal court within the State statute period.  If it were


self-evidently true that the State policy is not at all


offended by that, you wouldn't have a problem and you


wouldn't be here because every State would say, well, it


was filed in Federal court.  That's good enough for us.


But it isn't good enough for a lot of States. 


And -- and, you know, it's their policy we're talking


about, and their policy is you must file in State court


within the limitations period. 


QUESTION:  May I ask you a sort of preliminary


question I'm kind of puzzled about?  What is the source of


the Federal Government's power to enact the statute at

all?


MR. BOLTER:  Article III to control the lower


Federal courts gives the -- the Government the power to


create these -- these Federal practices and procedures, in


this case, the -- the way to address combined Federal and


State claims, as well as its -- its -- the powers to


protect individuals from losing their due process rights


to have their claims heard and -- and burdening the access


to the Federal courts.


QUESTION:  So, it's Article III you rely on.


MR. BOLTER:  Yes, Article III and -- and partly


on the equal -- equal protection for -- to allow


plaintiffs to have access to Federal courts and bring


their Federal claims and their State claims if they -- if


they need to do that as well. 


QUESTION:  It would just -- when Congress passed


this, Congress I -- I assume was just thinking it was


regulating the procedure in Federal courts, that it was


exercising that power to implement Article III. 


And what you said about due process, I didn't


see any sign of that in the history of 1367.  But you're


not suggesting that before 1367, people were denied due


process because there wasn't a tolling provision. 


MR. BOLTER:  In some circumstances, they were


because of the claims -- the combination of the claims

splitting and claims preclusion laws in the State courts


and States and the statute of limitations on those pendent


claims if they were brought in Federal court could result


in a denial of a forum for that State claim if -- if a


Federal claim was also asserted. 


QUESTION:  Is there -- is there any indication


that Congress, when it amended 1367, relied on anything


other than Article III?  Are you suggesting it relied on


section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment? 


MR. BOLTER:  I don't think it's -- that it's


explicit in the congressional --


QUESTION:  Well, is it implicit?


MR. BOLTER:  I think it's implicit in there that


they're --


QUESTION:  Where do you find that?


MR. BOLTER:  Well, the protections that it --


that it provides --


QUESTION:  I mean, I'm -- I'm talking about what


Congress thought, not what you think. 


MR. BOLTER:  I -- I'm not sure I understand your


question, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Well, my question was, is there any


reason to think that Congress, when it made this


amendment, was relying on section 5 of the Fourteenth


Amendment, in addition to Article III?

 MR. BOLTER:  Aside from nothing explicit, I

than what I could speculate. 


QUESTION:  Well -- well, don't we know that this


came out of the Federal Courts Study Committee? 


MR. BOLTER:  Yes, it did come out of the Federal


Courts Study Committee? 


QUESTION:  And so -- and Congress took the


suggestion of that Federal Courts Study Committee, and as


far as I recall, in that report, they were talking about


the authority of Congress to regulate the procedure in


Federal courts. 


MR. BOLTER:  That's right.  I think that goes to


the Article III, I guess I -- if I'm not -- if I'm


misunderstanding Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Suppose we were to conclude that this


statute must rest upon Article III.  We -- we reject your


due process and equal protection suggestions.  What's the


closest case that you have where we have sustained a power


like this pursuant to Congress' authority to establish


tribunals under Article III?


MR. BOLTER:  I have to think about that for just


a second. 


QUESTION:  Is it Terrell/Taro v. Burt

filing of articles of incorporation on a waiver of the


right to go to Federal court?  It can't burden the right


to go to Federal court? 


MR. BOLTER:  That -- I think that is an example. 


I think probably Nash is also an example. 


QUESTION:  Although I think Terrell/Taro was


probably a Commerce Clause case.


MR. BOLTER:  I'm not sure, Justice Kennedy, if


it was or not. 


I think Nash, though, was also -- I think Nash


gets to your question as well. 


QUESTION:  Which -- which case? 


MR. BOLTER:  The Nash -- the Nash --


QUESTION:  Florida Industrial Commission. 


MR. BOLTER:  Nash v. Florida Industrial


Commission. 


QUESTION:  Nash. 


MR. BOLTER:  I -- I couldn't hear Mr. Chief


Justice.  But I think that case also talks about burdening


the Federal rights in an NLRB case. 


QUESTION:  Going back to the statute of


limitations point, I -- I should know this, but if I file


a complaint in the Nevada State courts and the Nevada


court said, this doesn't belong here, there's no


jurisdiction, the cause of action arose exclusively in

California, and it dismisses, and you then file in


California, is there tolling as a general matter?


MR. BOLTER:  In that situation with -- with two


States, I would say that unless it was within the time


period of California, it would probably not be tolled in


that situation. 


QUESTION:  All right.  Well, that -- that seems


to me very similar to what we have here.


MR. BOLTER:  Well, we have a filing in Federal


court here with -- with a statute that -- that directly


addresses the tolling --


QUESTION:  Well, but you're -- you're -- well,


it does or it doesn't.  But you -- you indicated earlier


that the statute of limitations was not in any way


extended because it was tolled by the filing.  But it is


extended by this additional 30 days.  You basically have


-- what was it?  45 -- the 45 plus 30.  You have 75 days


now, almost double. 


MR. BOLTER:  Well, I think that the tolling


provision is different.  I mean, it does give additional


time, but it doesn't extend the time period that the State


was open and exposed to liability.  It doesn't extend that


45-day period.  They were already notified of it.  They --


they were put on notice.  They had the -- they knew that


they were going to be sued and it was brought in -- within

that 45-day period. 


The fact that it was suspended during a time


period where the State was in Federal court at its own --


its own discretion, it would be -- it would be harmful to


the plaintiffs to have the State be able to use the delay


in time that it's pending in Federal court to bar the


claim from being brought after that in State court.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bolter, what you said might be so


if the only purpose of the statute of limitations were


repose, being notified on time that you're subject to


suit. 


But there are certain statutes that have been


called so-called built-in statute of limitations where the


limitation is considered part and parcel of the right


itself usually when it's in the very same statute, and


that seems to be the kind of limitation that we have here. 


We have a State that is giving up its sovereign immunity,


but only on these terms.  So, why isn't this a built-in


statute of limitations?  So, by necessity there would be


harm when the State says it's the right -- we condition


the right on you bringing suit within 45 days.


MR. BOLTER:  They didn't make, as a part of that


condition, anything about tolling.  That's -- that's I


think the -- the first point, and -- and that's what this


statute is doing, is tolling.  It's not changing that --

that right, that built-in right that you talk about, to


the 45-day period.  That -- that still has to be complied


with.  But this is talking about tolling, which is a


different -- it's a different animal here, but it doesn't


extend that time limit, that -- that built-in time limit


simply by tolling.  It suspends it from running out but it


doesn't extend it.  I couldn't have filed that claim 75


days after it was sued.  I had to file it within 45 days


or else it would have been barred, and 1367 would not have


attached. 


QUESTION:  But I take it you're saying that


whether you regard it as built in or whether you regard


the policy as simply a policy of repose, Article III power


or section 5 power is what it is, and -- and it can


accomplish what this statute wants to accomplish. 


MR. BOLTER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  I don't know why you rely just on


Article III or on section 5, which I think is pretty


remote in this situation.  Why -- why don't you rely on


the underlying Federal statute?  There will always be some


Federal power that justified the Federal cause of action


which is the subject of this extension provision. 


Let's assume it's a Commerce Clause cause of


action.  Under the Commerce Clause, the Federal Government


could have, if it wanted, eliminated the State cause of

action entirely, couldn't -- couldn't it?  It could have


said, we -- we preempt any State action in this field, and


the whole State cause of action would be washed away.  If


it can do that, why can't it do the lesser act of not


washing away the State cause of action, but just saying,


you know, if you bring suit in Federal court on this


Commerce Clause cause of action, you get another 30 days


or whatever, 45 days, whatever it is? 


MR. BOLTER:  Well, it doesn't -- it doesn't --


QUESTION:  Wouldn't that work?  That -- that


makes me feel a lot more comfortable than just relying on


Article III.


MR. BOLTER:  Well, I don't think that it


washes --


QUESTION:  I'm trying to help you. 


(Laughter.)


MR. BOLTER:  I don't know that I understand. 


Are you saying that they had power under the Commerce --


if they had power under the Commerce Clause, could they do


this?


QUESTION:  This statute itself piggy-backs on


whatever substantive Federal statute exists out there, you


know, whether it's under the Commerce Clause or under any


other Federal power.  And -- and that Federal power would


allow the total elimination of the cause of -- of the

State cause of action.  Why -- why is it unreasonable to


allow a mere extension of the -- of the State limitations


on that State cause of action?


MR. BOLTER:  Well, I guess I don't disagree that


it's not unreasonable to toll this -- these statutes of


limitations. 


QUESTION:  Do you know of any case in which this


Court has held that Congress, when passing a statute of


its own, could totally forbid a State to enact a similar


statute?


MR. BOLTER:  I'm not aware of a case like that,


Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Neither am I.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bolter, in any event, that


wouldn't take you very far because so often these pendent


State claims are garden variety State tort law, contract


claims, are they not?  I mean, there's the big Federal


claim, and then you latch onto that the State common law


claims.  So, the State common law claims could arise out


of the same transaction and occurrence, depend on the same


nucleus of facts, and yet not be just a State counterpart


of the Federal statute. 


Don't you -- don't you have that in -- in civil


rights cases?  Let's say, bring a 1983 claim against a


police officer and then you latch onto it State common law

claims for assault and battery? 


MR. BOLTER:  Yes, and -- and that's what we have


done in this case, or that's what we -- that's what this


-- and that's what this statute protects against, losing


those claims. 


I -- I'm not sure if I understood your question,


Justice Ginsburg, about can you do that in Federal court,


I mean, latch onto those Federal claims?  Yes.  I mean,


that -- that is what supplemental jurisdiction is about in


this situation.  So, I don't think that that's -- that's


appropriate to do that.  And -- and it goes back to giving


the State a choice of whether it wants to be there or not


by exercising its constitutional defense of sovereign


immunity. 


I mean, I think the key -- one of the key things


here is that this -- that the tolling does not abrogate


the State's sovereign immunity because it's in a


jurisdiction that it wants to be in at all times.  The


choice is its own.  And the sovereign immunity core


principles described by this Court in its jurisprudence


have been whether and where a State can be sued, and it


doesn't infringe on those core interests.  Tolling has


never been identified as a core interest of -- of


sovereign --


QUESTION:  Just whether and where and not when.

Right?  So, the Federal Government could -- could override


State statute of limitations on sovereign immunity cases


no matter what because it's not really part of sovereign


immunity. 


MR. BOLTER:  I don't --


QUESTION:  The State says, I'm willing to be


sued for 1 year, and you say the Federal Government


doesn't have to observe that 1 year.  It can say, well,


you know, it's 2 years instead. 


MR. BOLTER:  No.  I think that the -- that 1


year has to be respected, but this is about tolling.  It's


not about changing a statute of limitations.  This is


about tolling the time period for it to run out.


If there are no further questions at this time,


I'd like to reserve the remainder for rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Bolter. 


Mr. Rotenberg, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK B. ROTENBERG


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. ROTENBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Your Honors, it's critical to focus on the


fundamental issue of federalism presented in this case;


namely, is it Congress or the State that has the power to


decide when that State can be sued by its own citizens in

its own courts?


QUESTION:  So, in your view, the Soldiers and


Sailors Relief Act -- all of the soldiers in Afghanistan,


when they come back and they find that their statute of


limitations has run out, Congress does not have the power


to extend the statute.  Is that right --


MR. ROTENBERG:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  -- in your opinion? 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Under --


QUESTION:  I mean, there's presently a statute


that says when they come back, people who are in the armed


forces, they will discover that the statute of limitations


in the States has been extended for 6 months.  In your --


or however long necessary.  In your opinion, that's


unconstitutional. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Your Honor, the -- the logic --


it may be unconstitutional is the direct answer to your


question.  The logic --


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, what about -- what


about tort reform?  Suppose in the tort reform statutes


that pass, there is a provision that somehow in there is


favorable to a plaintiff.  That could happen.  And if that


does happen, then the State doesn't want to follow it,


unconstitutional to apply it. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Justice Breyer, the -- the

thrust of Alden against Maine is that Congress does not


have the power under Article I to force a State to submit


to a private suit for damages in its own courts.


QUESTION:  All right.  Is it constitutional for


Congress to pass a copyright law or a -- any of these tort


statutes that are federalized and say that the States


cannot pass a statute that gives a cause of action in tort


that is different? 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Your Honor, the answer to that


question would depend on Federal preemption principles.


QUESTION:  Correct.


MR. ROTENBERG:  Under the Commerce Clause --


QUESTION:  Now, they -- they can preempt.  Fine.


Then if they can do that, why can't they shape


the cause of action in the State so that it corresponds


with Federal law by, for example, extending a little bit


or not extending too much the statute of limitations?


MR. ROTENBERG:  The reason they cannot do -- the


Congress cannot do that, Justice Breyer, is because this


statute, 1367(d), represents a blanket attempt by Congress


to extend statutes of limitations without regard to the


existence of an independent power in Article I, such as


the war power which may suffice to protect --


QUESTION:  That -- that power will always exist


in the Federal cause of action that has been brought in

Federal court. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  It will exist, Your -- Your


Honor, in -- in the --


QUESTION:  In every case to which this -- this


statute applies, there will be involved a Federal power


under Article I.


MR. ROTENBERG:  Well, not in this case, Your


Honor, and this case is a perfect example of the -- of the


situation.  This -- this Court held that, in fact, there


was no power under Article I to hail the State into


Federal court in an age case.  So -- and -- and


petitioners here --


QUESTION:  No, but that's -- essentially you're


going back to the Eleventh Amendment.  I mean, your -- I


understand your Eleventh Amendment argument, but you're


trying to overlay an Article I argument on that, and I


think that's where we're having -- having our difficulty. 


But as I understand it, your ultimate answer to the


difficulty is the Eleventh Amendment. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  We -- Justice Souter, we have


two arguments, yes.  The -- the essential point of -- of


Alden relates to causes of action against the State


sovereign, and this Court in Alden has established a


categorical rule that a State's power to condition its


waiver of immunity is -- is not subject to the Article I

power of Congress to amend.  In Alden, this Court held


that, to the extent Maine chose to consent to certain


types of suits, while maintaining immunity in other types


of suits, it has done no more than exercise its privilege


of sovereignty concomitant to its constitutional immunity


from suit.  So, that is the first and most important point


here. 


With regard to the -- the plenary authority of


Congress to adopt a sweeping statute of limitations


alteration in -- in the States that applies to an


unlimited type of claim, you have to look at whether there


was an express intent to abrogate and --


QUESTION:  May I interrupt you?


MR. ROTENBERG:  -- and that would take you into


a -- a section 5, Fourteenth Amendment type analysis. 


And --


QUESTION:  May I ask you this question as a


preliminary matter?  Putting the Eleventh Amendment to --


to one side just for a moment, because I do understand


your position there, assume this was a suit against a


public utility and the -- and they -- Minnesota provided


an especially short statute of limitations for that public


utility.  Would -- would you think the -- the Federal


statute would be unconstitutional as applied in such a


case, or would it be valid?

 MR. ROTENBERG:  The -- the statute is


unconstitutional if the Court needs to address the


question of legislative power, Justice Stevens, because


there is no case upholding a congressional power to enact


a sweeping expansion of statute of limitations --


QUESTION:  There's no case upholding it, no case


striking it down.  But -- but in any event, you think the


statute would be unconstitutional even if you didn't have


a State defendant. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  That's right, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Well, that -- that goes quite far. 


What -- what is your reasoning there? 


MR. ROTENBERG:  The reasoning there, Mr. Chief


Justice, is simply that since the Founding Convention,


it's been clear that the powers of Congress are defined


and limited, and the residual legislative power does not


rest with Congress.  It rests with the States under the


Tenth Amendment under this Court's decisions in Marbury


and the -- as recently as United States against Morrison.


The -- the point of the matter is, Your Honors,


that my able petitioners' counsel here has -- has failed


to suggest any case law that supports the enactment of a


-- of a change in the State statutes of limitations that's


unhinged from a particular exercise of power --


QUESTION:  But -- but Article III is certainly a

particular power. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor.  But the


tribunal --


QUESTION:  Mr. Rotenberg, did -- did the


Minnesota Supreme Court go that far?  I thought that their


decision as to the unconstitutionality of 1367 related


only to cases in which the State was the defendant. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Justice --


QUESTION:  And to the extent that you're asking


us to consider this broader theory, you're asking us to


take that up -- to go beyond where the Minnesota Supreme


Court left off. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's


correct.  The Minnesota Supreme Court did not hold that


the statute was unconstitutional as applied in all --


QUESTION:  And your position -- your position


would, as Justice Breyer suggested, mean that the Soldiers


and Sailors Civil Relief Act is invalid, insofar as it


tolls State statute of limitations as well.


QUESTION:  In actions against the State.


QUESTION:  This would -- this -- this would be a


big surprise, I think --

 QUESTION:  Why -- why do you want to go that


far?  Why don't you stick with what the lower courts did


and talk about the Eleventh Amendment?  What -- what


possible advantage is it to you to make this sweeping


argument you're making? 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Justice O'Connor, it is


certainly sufficient for this Court to address only the


Alden principle, as Justice Kennedy just mentioned, and


restrict the holding to a State sovereign --


QUESTION:  And in that regard, what's the matter


with the Solicitor General's approach that says the


statute was never intended to cover nonconsenting States? 


Don't interpret as applying.  What's the matter with that?


MR. ROTENBERG:  Justice O'Connor, we agree with


the Solicitor General that the statute can and, indeed,


should be so construed.


QUESTION:  I guess then the next case -- then


the next case we'll have is where the soldiers and sailors


come back and they would like to sue the State.  Maybe


it's a pension.  Maybe it's a tort.  Maybe it's a


contract.  There can be many, many things in States that


-- where the residents have a cause of action, and I guess


even your minimal position would make it unconstitutional


for them to do so. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Justice Breyer, this Court has

not addressed the intersection between its holding in


Alden against Maine, which establishes a categorical rule


that Congress is disempowered from forcing a State to


defend itself against its own citizens in its own State


courts, and the -- the war power.  That case has not been


presented, and I would suggest to Your Honors --


QUESTION:  Well, the war power is -- is an


Article I power.  I mean, a minute ago I thought you were


making a -- a flat Article I argument. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Yes, Justice Souter.  The -- my


-- my understanding of this Court's jurisprudence in this


area -- and Alden isn't the only case that stands for this


proposition, of course -- is that Congress, acting within


its Article I power, is -- has no authority to abrogate


sovereign immunity. 


Now, it hasn't -- Your Honors have not


specifically faced what I would submit is a very


challenging issue, as suggested by Justice O'Connor's


question.  Do we really mean each and every exercise of


Article I power, even and including the war power to


protect sailors abroad?


QUESTION:  Well, what would -- what would


possibly be the ground for distinguishing.  The State has


sovereign immunity or it doesn't. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Justice Kennedy, I agree, and I

think that the practical answer in our federalism is to


allow the States to exercise good judgment with respect to


their tolling provisions.  It -- it strains the


imagination --


QUESTION:  Precisely.  They can waive if they


want to. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Exactly.


QUESTION:  Well, that's what bothered me.  This


may just be a misprint or something, but quite clearly the


State of Minnesota has the power to say that our consent


extends to this tolling provision, doesn't it?  It could. 


It could come out the other way if it wants to.  And,


indeed, they say that the equitable tolling applies to


their statute, don't they? 


All right.  Now, I read their opinion.  I've


read this six times.  Not six, but only two.  Let me not


exaggerate. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  But -- but when they get to the --


QUESTION:  It seemed like six.  Right? 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  When -- when they get to the point,


this very point, it says, however, we read Alden to


require the university's waiver of immunity be limited to


the -- be limited to the parameters set forth in the

statute; i.e., 45 days. 


Well, Alden has nothing to do with that.  But


they seem to think -- and after all, they did say that


this statute says 45 days, but it doesn't mean 45 days in


respect to equitable tolling.  But they seem to think that


our case Alden required them to limit it to the 45 days,


which of course it doesn't. 


So, they seem to be under a misapprehension in


that respect, and I would like you to address that, what


we should do about that. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Justice Breyer, I agree with you


that Alden does not compel a particular interpretation of


State law.  That's certainly true. 


It is also true that the Minnesota Supreme Court


unanimously determined that the 45-day limitation on its


waiver of sovereign immunity is -- is part and parcel of


the statute, as Justice Ginsburg previously mentioned, and


is an aspect of its -- of its sovereign immunity and in --


in addition said that the equitable tolling principle


could be applied.  But it's important to recall that the


Minnesota courts apply the equitable tolling principles in


an extremely conservative fashion. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but my question, of course, is,


what do we do about that sentence in the opinion which


says, we read Alden to require that the waiver of immunity

be limited to 45 days? 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Well --


QUESTION:  That's -- that's -- if they had said


exactly what you just said, I wouldn't have my question. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Justice Breyer, this Court need


not affirm every sentence of the Minnesota Supreme Court's


decision.  It only need affirm the judgment, and the


judgment can be affirmed simply by reference to the fact,


the constitutional fact, that Alden proscribes


congressional alterations of -- of State waivers of


sovereign immunity. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Rotenberg, because sovereign


immunity is kind of a peculiar objection -- that is, the


State -- it's up to the State to waive it or not.  It's


not like a case where the Federal court wouldn't have


subject matter jurisdiction.  Shouldn't, at least for the


period that the State stood silent, which I understand was


about 9 months, in Federal court -- at least for that


period, shouldn't the State be treated as having been


legitimately before the Federal court not complaining


about it?  So, for those 9 months, at least, the


limitation ought to be tolled. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  No, Your Honor.  It -- it isn't


true that Minnesota stood silent for 9 months.  The


university asserted its sovereign immunity defense at the

earliest opportunity, namely in its answer, and -- and


never in any way suggested a waiver of such a -- of such a


defense.  This Court has held repeatedly that waivers of


sovereign immunity by the States is not to be inferred and


not to be implied. 


QUESTION:  What was going on?  I understand, at


least from the dates, that this was raised 9 months after


the litigation commenced.  What was going on?  Usually an


answer is in -- how many days? 


MR. ROTENBERG:  20 days, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. ROTENBERG:  And we filed our answer


asserting sovereign immunity within that time frame. 


There's nothing the university could have done to save


their claim.  The -- they filed in Federal court merely 48


hours before the statute of limitations would -- the 45-


day rule would have expired even under their


understanding, meaning that a filing in the wrong court


suffices to be a filing in the correct court.  So, there's


nothing the university did to delay whatsoever. 


Moreover, we filed a dispositive motion at -- in


a timely way, consistent with the normal course of


litigation in this case.  Most Federal trial courts prefer


that dispositive motions not be filed seriatim.  And we --


we noticed the motion, and there was a scheduling order,

which plaintiff knew about, in the spring of 1997, and we


filed the dispositive motion asserting our sovereign


immunity in June of '97. 


And even if you would say that -- that somehow


the petitioners here were not fully aware, as they should


have been, that the university was asserting its sovereign


immunity from the get-go, by June 3, they had a motion, a


dispositive motion, and the filing in the State forum


still exceeded the 45 days.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I suppose under the rule


you're suggesting that we adopt the State could -- let's


assume that the claim is filed in the Federal court on the


fifth day, and there's 40 days more left.  I suppose the


State could just sit back and wait for 60 days before it


moves to dismiss to allow the claim to go stale, under


your submission. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Justice Kennedy, that's possible


but that was not what happened here, number one, and


number --


QUESTION:  Well, it not only is possible.  It's


the necessary concomitant -- necessary sequence from the


rule you -- you propose.


MR. ROTENBERG:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  It's not possible, it's necessary. 


That's your rule.

 MR. ROTENBERG:  -- it isn't -- it isn't my rule


alone, Your Honor.  Pennhurst explicitly --


QUESTION:  It's the result you want us to adopt.


MR. ROTENBERG:  Yes, it is, Your Honor.  But


Pennhurst specifically suggests -- yes.  Excuse me. 


Pennhurst explicitly says that the expedient of filing the


claim in the State court will avoid any danger of this


kind occurring.  And -- and Pennhurst stands clearly for


the proposition that a filing of the State claim, a


protective claim, which petitioners' counsel here


acknowledged would solve the problem, and filing the


Federal claim in the Federal forum is a constitutionally


appropriate expedient. 


Any contrary indication brings into question the


-- the opinion of this Court in -- in Pennhurst by


suggesting that filing concomitantly in the State and


Federal forums is somehow a due process problem.


Let me conclude with an -- a closing observation


about the due process issue.  Petitioners have not cited a


single case, not a single case, holding that the State's


handling of pendent claims, in the absence of section


1367, somehow violated due process.  And equally


important, Your Honors, petitioners do not seriously claim


that 1367(d) is a valid exercise of Congress' power under


section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to address any

supposed due process problems.  The record is simply bare.


Moreover, due process cannot be the basis of any


supposed abrogation here because the first element of


abrogating the State's sovereign immunity, using section 5


of the Fourteenth Amendment, is an explicit statement of


Congress.  There is no such explicit statement of Congress


here.  In fact, the record is silent as to any due process


claim either in the halls of Congress or in the -- in the


case law, at least as cited or referred to by -- by


petitioners. 


And most importantly, Your Honors, and in


conclusion, whether there might conceivably be an


unfairness in some hypothetical State situation, this


question of unfairness does not trump the Alden principle,


that Congress cannot, by an observation of unfairness


falling short of a due process issue, force a State to


submit to suit against itself in its own courts. 


QUESTION:  I suppose unfairness is what


sovereign immunity is all about, isn't it? 


MR. ROTENBERG:  It may be seen that way by some


plaintiffs, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Rotenberg. 


MR. ROTENBERG:  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


When this Court confronts a general grant of


jurisdiction, like 1367(a), it routinely infers that the


statute does not apply to nonconsenting States.  Such a


construction avoids difficult -- upsetting the balance


between Federal and State powers. 


For similar reasons, this Court should construe


section 1367(d)'s tolling provision not to apply to


nonconsenting States.  That reading avoids the difficult


sovereign immunity questions posed by the application of a


Federal statute to extend the State statute of limitations


against a nonconsenting State in State court.


QUESTION:  You -- basically you're saying clear


statement.  Is that -- is that nub of your point? 


MR. CLEMENT:  The nub of the point --


QUESTION:  The clear statement rule. 


MR. CLEMENT:  -- is this Court should apply a


clear statement rule to this statute, the supplemental


jurisdiction statute, and since there's no indication in


the text or legislative history that Congress had any


contemplation that this would apply to nonconsenting


States, this Court should construe the provision as not

applying to nonconsenting States.


QUESTION:  Do you -- do you agree that in the


absence of a clear statement rule, there is no ambiguity


here that -- that would open the door to our giving this


kind of a construction? 


MR. CLEMENT:  There is -- there is enough


ambiguity in the statute, if the Court wanted to, to reach


the second argument that we offer in our brief, but I


would suggest that the first argument we offer in the


brief, which you could call the clear statement argument,


is a more narrowly tailored and focused answer to the


constitutional issues that are raised by applying the


statute to nonconsenting States. 


QUESTION:  Well, you've only got 10 minutes, and


I'll leave it to you to whether you want to get into it. 


I -- I have trouble with the ambiguity argument.  I


understand your clear statement argument.  I have trouble


with the ambiguity. 


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, if I could, I would focus on


the clear statement argument because I think it does very


narrowly avoid the constitutional issue that's raised. 


QUESTION:  Now, to -- to apply the clear


statement argument, do we not have to at least decide that


it does constitute an elimination of State sovereign


immunity to require the tolling of -- of the action

against the State?


MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think so.  I think this


Court only needs to decide that it would raise grave


constitutional doubts before it would need to apply the --


the clear statement rule because, although in some


contexts, in the abrogation context, for example, a clear


statement rule assumes that -- that the Congress can't


constitutionally do something, in other contexts as


Gregory v. Ashcroft, Will against the Michigan Department


of -- of State -- in those cases, this Court has applied


clear statement principles even though they don't assume


the answer to the constitutional question.  And that, of


course, is consistent with the way this Court approaches


matter as a general matter and its preference to avoid


constitutional questions. 


The -- the Court, for example, just last term in


-- in Vermont against United States ex rel. Stevens,


applied similar principles of statutory construction to


avoid directly addressing the Eleventh Amendment --


QUESTION:  It's fine when you're dealing with an


ambiguous statute.  Sure, just the mere presence of a


constitutional doubt will cause you to resolve the


ambiguity in such a fashion that it doesn't raise a


constitutional principle so you have sort of a clear


statement rule, unless it's a clear statement where

there's a -- but those are ambiguity cases. 


You're -- you're purporting to forego reliance


upon ambiguity and to say even assuming that the statute


is clear, you should not interpret it to apply to the


States. 


And now, do you have any case not involving


ambiguity, where we have applied the clear statement rule


without first finding that it is clearly an abrogation of


State sovereign immunity? 


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think, for example, in the


Stevens case, this Court interpreted the term person not


to include the State.  What effectively we're asking the


Court to do here is interpret the term, any claim, in


section 1367(d) to say any claim except one against a


nonconsenting State.


QUESTION:  Well, I think in Atascadero we


interpreted the word person so that it did not include the


State, even though you could say person means a lot.


MR. CLEMENT:  No.  That's exactly right.


And in Will against Michigan where the Court had


already held that 1983 did not implicate Eleventh


Amendment issues, this Court nonetheless held that in


State courts, the term person in 1983 does not apply to --


to States or to State officers acting in their official


capacities.

 And I think all of those cases and the -- the


Court's decision in Gregory against Ashcroft and in Will


all stand for the proposition that this Court can apply a


clear statement type principle to avoid a


constitutional --


QUESTION:  How -- how do you respond to the


Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act as applied to States


in tolling causes of action against the State?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I -- I think that -- that in


order to maintain consistency with our position in this


case, we would have to ask this Court to apply a clear


statement rule in that case, and the current version of


the statute would probably not apply to States under that


-- under that theory. 


QUESTION:  So, has that been happening?  I mean,


is it the case that the armed forces members have been


suing States or not under the act? 


MR. CLEMENT:  We haven't seen that the -- that


the issue of sovereign immunity arising in those contexts,


and it very well -- well --


QUESTION:  And it could be just that --


MR. CLEMENT:  It very well may be, as counsel


for the University of Minnesota suggested, that States


will have the good sense in those instances to waive their


sovereign immunity defense.  I mean, the same principles

that are going to motivate the Federal Government to pass


the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act are going to


motivate State governments to waive their sovereign


immunity defenses in those claims. 


Now, it seems to me that -- two points I'd like


to make.  First of all, it's worth focusing on the fact


that even before 1367(d), the informal Federal court


practices for dealing with potentially untimely State


claims did not apply to nonconsenting States.  Justice


Scalia, you raised the -- the problem of conditioning a


dismissal on a withdraw -- of statute of limitations


defenses.  But, of course, under Pennhurst II, a State has


an absolute right to insist that the pendent claims


against it be dismissed.  So, in that context, the Federal


court would not be able to condition the dismissal on a


waiver of a statute of limitations defense, nor would it


be able to retain jurisdiction over the claim.  So, it


stands to reason that 1367(d) should no more apply to


cases against nonconsenting States than the Federal court


practices it replaced. 


Lastly, I would emphasize that this


interpretation of section 1367(d) does not place


plaintiffs in an untenable position or in an


unconstitutional bind.  Plaintiffs, in cases where the


State objects to Federal court jurisdiction as a blanket

matter, have the same rights that they would have under


Pennhurst II.  They can file both claims in State court,


the Federal and the State, which seems a complete answer


to any due process objections, or they can file parallel


proceedings. 


Even if the State makes a decision whether to


consent on a case by cases, as Minnesota appears to do,


the State -- the plaintiff can still attempt to get


consent in the first instance, and if it's not, it can


make a protective filing along the lines that Justice


Ginsburg suggested.


In the end, it seems that plaintiffs lack any


case law to support their due process arguments.  I think


that respondent, in fairness, lacks any case law to


support its -- its Article I legislative power argument. 


There's really no need for this Court to make any


significant case law in order to decide this case if it


simply applies the clear statement test we suggest in our


brief. 


If there's no other questions, I'll submit. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Clement.

 I'd like to address something that was brought


up on -- again in questioning the university about being a


nonconsenting State.  It is -- their arguments -- the --


the university and the Solicitor General's arguments rely


on the fact that they were a nonconsenting State


throughout this whole procedure.  And that's not an


accurate characterization of what went on here.  When they


were sued in Federal court, they were not a nonconsenting


State until 9 months later when they brought that motion


to dismiss.


QUESTION:  But they said they put it in their


answer within 20 days. 


MR. BOLTER:  They did do that. 


QUESTION:  And I think Mr. Rotenberg was quite


right that the whole impulse of the Federal rules is you


bring all of your motions at once and not seriatim.


MR. BOLTER:  They --


QUESTION:  But they -- if they raised that --


that Eleventh Amendment in their answer within the time


allotted, I don't think that you can say that it was a


9-month thing that they --


MR. BOLTER:  Raising the defense in the answer


was just like raising any other defense in that answer.


They had to assert it or else they would risk a waiver


argument later on.  All that did was preserve their right

to bring the -- the motion 9 months later. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but in preserving that right, it


-- it certainly does not put them in the position of being


a consenting State.


MR. BOLTER:  Well, they were not a nonconsenting


State.


QUESTION:  Look, what it boils down to is they


hadn't filed the motion to dismiss yet.  That's what we're


arguing about, isn't it? 


MR. BOLTER:  Yes, they had not filed the motion


and until that motion was filed, the court can't rule on


it.  The court can't -- is not going to dismiss the claim,


and there will be supplemental jurisdiction over all the


claims that are --


QUESTION:  Yes, but by the same token, you know


by the answer that they are not consenting to


jurisdiction.


MR. BOLTER:  All we knew by the answer is that


they were asserting an affirmative defense, just like they


asserted a statute of limitations defense or laches or


waiver.  And none of those can be ruled upon by the court


until they are affirmatively brought before them to rule


on.  They might have just decided not to do anything with


it until the matter was tried on its merits, and they have


done that in another case, the Eldeeb case, which they


49 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

received summary judgment on the merits of both State and


Federal claims. 


QUESTION:  Didn't you know also that you were at


risk of an interpretation of 1367?  Justice Souter


suggested that there is no ambiguity, but at least there's


a respectable authority for saying there is and that the


tolling of 1367(d) is limited to cases covered by 1367(c)


and would not take in sovereign immunity.


MR. BOLTER:  We did not anticipate that that


could be a construction of -- of 1367 -- of 1367(d),


otherwise we might have reevaluated whether or not to


bring it.  But that wasn't -- there was nothing to suggest


that that was the status of the case law --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Bolter.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 10:58 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
