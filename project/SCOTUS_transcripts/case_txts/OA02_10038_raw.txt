 Mr. Owen.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. OWEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


9  the Court:


10

 This case presents the question whether


11  mitigating evidence of a 67 IQ, of permanent cognitive


12  impairment, could be given mitigating effect under the old


13  Texas capital sentencing statute.


14

 QUESTION:  Mr. Owen, am I correct in thinking


15  that Smith's case is no longer before us?


16

17

18

 MR. OWEN:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  Thank you. 


 MR. OWEN:  This Court in Penry held that the


19  deliberateness question -­


20

 QUESTION:  May I ask another preliminary


21  question?  I thought that what was at issue is whether the


22  certificate of appealability was properly denied.


23

 MR. OWEN:  That is in the questions presented,


24  Your Honor, and -­


25

 QUESTION:  Because you seem to be asking us to


3


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  grant habeas relief, and I would have thought what we had


2  to consider was the denial of the certificate of


3  appealability.  Am I right?


4

 MR. OWEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  I believe that in


5  this case the question of the underlying merits of the


6  constitutional issue before the Court, it -- I don't want


7  to say merges, but it certainly overlaps with the question


8  about the certificate of appealability and -­


9

 QUESTION:  Well, that's -- that's true of all


10  certificate of -- of appealability cases, isn't it?


11

 MR. OWEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  But it was also


12  true in Penry II, which when it came to this Court, came


13  from the Fifth Circuit on a denial of COA, and this Court


14  resolved the merits in that case by examining the merits


15  of the underlying State court decision and reversed the


16  judgment in the case in exactly the same fashion that we


17  are asking the Court to do in our case.


18

 QUESTION:  Well, as long as we're into these


19  preliminary matters -- and then I'll let you, so far as


20  I'm concerned, proceed the way you wish.  It is true that


21  in this case, isn't it, if -- if we say there should be a


22  COA, the Fifth Circuit is just going to follow its -- its


23  earlier panel opinion, and I -- I assume it must on -- on


24  the nexus rule.


25

 MR. OWEN:  That's exactly right, Your Honor.  I


4


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  think that the -- in fact, in -- within the last couple of


2  years, the Fifth Circuit has taken those rules en banc and


3  has issued an en banc opinion that applies and upholds not


4  just the nexus rule, but the other elaborate sort of


5  framework of the Penry doctrine that we've explained in


6  our brief.


7

 So I think you're exactly right, that if the


8  Court grants a COA and returns this case to the Fifth


9  Circuit, it will be back here in 6 months because all the


10  Fifth Circuit panel could do is say it's controlled by the


11  circuit precedent.  So I think in -- for that reason as


12  well, Your Honor, if the Court concludes that those rules


13  are, in fact, not consistent with its cases, that the


14  shortest route to resolving the case is to do so at this


15  time.


16

 This Court in Penry I held that the


17  deliberateness question was not an adequate vehicle for


18  giving mitigating effect to a defendant's personal moral


19  culpability, and in this case it functioned exactly the


20  same way as it did in Penry.  Also, the future


21  dangerousness question, with respect to an IQ of 67, could


22  only give that evidence aggravating effect rather than


23  mitigating effect.  And in the entire context of this


24  trial, particularly with respect to the arguments of


25  counsel respecting the evidence and how it might be


5


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  treated by the jury, really makes clear the existence of


2  the Penry violation.


3

 QUESTION:  May I ask you, Mr. Owen?  You are


4  claiming low IQ.  You did not in -- in your papers up till


5  now -- you did not make a claim of retardation, just low


6  IQ.  Is that still the -- there is no -- in other words,


7  is no Atkins claim in this case? 


8

 MR. OWEN:  There is no Atkins claim before this


9  Court, Your Honor.  That is correct.  We have filed a


10  successive application in State Court in order to preserve


11  Mr. Tennard's rights to have a determination of whether


12  he's a person with mental retardation.  But the evidence


13  at trial established only his very low IQ, not the other


14  aspects that would have been necessary for a diagnosis of


15  mental retardation.  So there's no Atkins claim before


16  this Court in this proceeding. 


17

 As I was saying, the arguments of counsel sort


18  of highlight the inadequacy of the jury instructions in


19  this case.  Defense counsel's argument was effectively a


20  plea for nullification.  He asked the jury to take account


21  of the defendant's very low IQ in -- in imposing sentence,


22  but he couldn't provide them any sort of road map to tell


23  them how they could get from the low IQ to a no answer to


24  one of the special issues.  For his part, the prosecutor,


25  in replying to that argument, said the low IQ is not even


6


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  relevant to the second special issue, and those were his


2  words:  not relevant. 


3

 So to some extent the State is trying to have it


4  both ways.  At trial, the prosecution argued to the jury


5  that this fact, a 67 IQ, wasn't relevant to the second


6  special issue.  Here, however, tracking the opinion of the


7  Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, it's respondent's


8  position that this evidence was sufficiently relevant to


9  the second special issue that the jury could be understood


10  to have given it effect in imposing sentence.


11

 QUESTION:  But do I understand that the -- that


12  the specific issue that we've got here, assuming we -- we


13  do reach the -- the merits issue as part of the COA


14  problem, is the specific circuit rule that there has got


15  to be a finding of, as I recall, unique severity and a


16  finding of causation.  And as I understand what the


17  circuit said was, because those conditions were not


18  satisfied, we ultimately do not even reach the kind of


19  Penry issue that -- that you described as being in the


20  background.  Is -- is that a fair statement of what we've


21  got in front of us?


22

 MR. OWEN:  Yes.  Excuse me.  Yes, Your Honor. 


23  That -- that is a fair statement, and I think that that is


24  exactly what the Fifth Circuit did with this case, was it


25  applied these preliminary doctrines which are effectively


7


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  threshold tests and they looked at this evidence and said,


2  it's not uniquely severe and there's been no showing that


3  it caused the defendant to commit the crime.  And as a


4  result, the Fifth Circuit never got to the question of how


5  does this evidence possibly fit into the special issues.


6

 Because this is a habeas case and we want -­


7  we're trying to get the Court to -- to ultimately grant


8  relief, we wanted to explain why the underlying State


9  court decision constitutes an unreasonable application of


10  this Court's cases.  And the Court of Criminal Appeals


11  relied, on the one hand, on the unique severity idea. 


12  They said this IQ score, standing alone, doesn't rise to


13  the level of mental retardation, so Penry is out of the


14  picture.  And then it went on to say even if that's -­


15  even if it was wrong about that judgment, there is some


16  way for the -- for the jury to have given it effect in


17  answering the second special issue.


18

 QUESTION:  You say it doesn't have to be related


19  to the -- to the crime at all.


20

21

 MR. OWEN:  Yes, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  I mean, what -- how -- how can that


22  be?  I mean, what if they bring in evidence that this


23  person was severely dyslexic?


24

25

 MR. OWEN:  I think -­


 QUESTION:  I guess that's a great handicap and


8


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  -- and you must feel sorry for the poor fellow, but what


2  does it have to do with mitigating the fact that he


3  murdered somebody?  You know, how -- how does -- how does


4  that have anything to do with mitigating?  I mean, what


5  we're looking for here is mitigation.  That means somehow


6  it makes the act that he committed less heinous than it


7  otherwise would be.  And you say it doesn't matter. 


8  Dyslexia should -- should count. 


9

 MR. OWEN:  I think, Your Honor, that the -- the


10  wisdom of this Court's case in Lockett, the wisdom of the


11  Lockett decision is that that judgment, the judgment that


12  you're describing, is this in fact mitigating, does this


13  support a life sentence as opposed to the death penalty -­


14

 QUESTION:  Suppose the defendant is despondent


15  over global warming and -- and that has nothing to do with


16  -- with the case.  Does the jury hear that too?


17

 MR. OWEN:  I think, Your Honor, that -- that the


18  jury is the person -­


19

20

 QUESTION:  I mean, there are no limits?


 MR. OWEN:  There -- there shouldn't be any


21  limits on admission, Your Honor, or on the jury's ability


22  to give that evidence effect if it chooses to do so.  At


23  some level, we are -- we are left to the jury -- to trust


24  the jury's judgment about what -­


25

 QUESTION:  This evidence was admitted, was it


9


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  not?


2

 MR. OWEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  There -- there


3  is -­


4

 QUESTION:  So we're not talking evidence that


5  was excluded.  You're talking about whether -- what use


6  could be made of the evidence once it was in.


7

 MR. OWEN:  That's correct, Your Honor, although


8  I should point out that to the extent that the lower


9  courts have, from time to time, described these threshold


10  rules, the nexus requirement, the severity requirement, as


11  relevance rules, rules of constitutional relevance, it at


12  least holds out the possibility that in a future case a


13  court might choose to exclude evidence as irrelevant to


14  punishment.


15

 QUESTION:  Are there -- are there any other


16  areas where -- where we just say, you know, there -- there


17  are no rules at all.  The jury -- whatever it likes.  The


18  fellow had a limp, and therefore, if you feel sorry for


19  him because he had a limp, that -- you can determine, even


20  though it clearly is not true that this somehow mitigates


21  his guilt for -- for the murder he committed. 


22

 MR. OWEN:  I certainly think, Your Honor, that


23  suggesting that the jury could respond simply out of


24  sympathy or emotion or an unfocused passion is precluded


25  by the Court's cases, and the Court has approved any


10


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  number of -­


2

 QUESTION:  Right.  So -- so what do you tell


3  them in order to prevent that?


4

5

 MR. OWEN:  I think that what you tell them -­


 QUESTION:  Don't you have to tell them what the


6  Fifth Circuit suggests?  You have to find that there's


7  some kind of a connection between this evidence and the


8  crime that he committed, that -- that, you know, it -- it


9  somehow caused it so that he's less guilty than somebody


10  that did not have that affliction would be.  Isn't that -­


11  isn't that exactly what you're looking for?


12

 MR. OWEN:  No, Your Honor.  I -- I think that


13  what you have to tell the jury is that they are not


14  limited in responding to the evidence and that they should


15  give the evidence their reasoned moral response. 


16

 QUESTION:  Well, are you saying that in -- in


17  most States under Lockett, the trial judge has no


18  discretion to say this is just too far outside the bounds


19  of what mitigation evidence really means?


20

 MR. OWEN:  I think that the bounds that Lockett


21  sets are clear enough to -- to preclude some facts.  I


22  don't -- at this point, I don't have them in mind, but let


23  me say that the rule of Lockett, which is any fact about


24  the defendant's background or character or any of the


25  circumstances of the offense, that is -- I think that is a


11


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  -- that does provide sufficient guidance.


2

 Certainly, Your Honor, every death penalty


3  statute in the country, including now Texas', gives the -­


4  the sentencer very broad latitude to consider the facts


5  and -­


6

 QUESTION:  What about -- what about the other -­


7  the other factor that you say the Fifth Circuit shouldn't


8  have taken into account, that is, severity of the -- of


9  the factor that the defendant claims mitigates?  What -­


10  you say that -- that should not come into -- come into


11  consideration either.


12

13

 MR. OWEN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  So he can -- he can tell the jury,


14  you know, I had a really bad cold that day.


15

 MR. OWEN:  Let -- let me say, Your Honor, that


16  when -- that when the Court said -­


17

 QUESTION:  Is it seriously we -- we have to let


18  the jury just ponder over that question, whether the fact


19  that he had a really bad cold -­


20

 MR. OWEN:  I think the Court could be


21  confident -­


22

23

 QUESTION:  -- should mitigate his crime?


 MR. OWEN:  -- the jury would not ponder very


24  long over the question whether a serious cold meaningfully


25  reduced the defendant's culpability in a way that made a


12


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  life sentence appropriate. 


2

 QUESTION:  No, but by the same token, wouldn't


3  it be fair for the judge to say, no reasonable jury,


4  possessed of reasonable, human sympathy, could possibly


5  find this mitigating?  The bad cold could be kept out and


6  there would be no constitutional error.  Isn't that


7  correct?


8

 MR. OWEN:  I think, Your Honor, that if no


9  reasonable juror could possibly accord the evidence any


10  significance to the ultimate sentencing decision, then it


11  would be consistent with Lockett because Lockett does


12  comprehend facts about the -­


13

 QUESTION:  Okay.  But you're -- you're worried


14  about the other end of the spectrum.


15

 MR. OWEN:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  This is not


16  a case about a -- a defendant with a bad cold.  This is a


17  case about a defendant -­


18

19

20

 QUESTION:  The circuit -- isn't -­


 MR. OWEN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  The -- the question about what is a


21  mitigating circumstance would come up under Texas' current


22  instruction 2, the instruction that says that you can


23  consider all the mitigating evidence, consider all the


24  mitigating evidence.  What is mitigating evidence?  That's


25  a discrete question from the one that's before us. 


13


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Whatever it is, it's a higher -- something higher than 

2  mitigating evidence. 

3

 MR. OWEN:  That's right, Your Honor.  The -- the 

4  severity test -- we don't know exactly how high it has to 

5  be set because in only one case that I'm aware of has the 

6  Fifth Circuit found it to be satisfied.  So there are -­

7

 QUESTION:  Why is it higher than mitigating 

8  evidence?  I don't understand.  I -- I thought you had 

9  just acknowledged in -- in the -- in the exchange with 

10  Justice Souter that a cold wouldn't be mitigating because 

11  it was not severe enough.  Right? 

12

13

14

 MR. OWEN:  No.  I think -- I think -­

 QUESTION:  Oh, that isn't the reason. 

 MR. OWEN:  -- not because it was not severe 

15  enough, Justice Scalia.  No. 

16

 QUESTION:  I see.  Well, why -- why did you 

17  agree with Justice Souter that a -- that a cold could be 

18  excluded? 

19

 MR. OWEN:  Because I do think that -- that 

20  Lockett anticipates that there are facts about the 

21  defendant's character and background which, according to 

22  tradition, according to our understanding of what 

23  constitutes an appropriate basis for extending leniency, 

24  which does not limit itself to evidence that has a nexus 

25  with the crime, that -- that there would be room for a 

14


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  judge to say, in an extreme case -- and I'm not saying 

2  this would be a routine judgment.  I certainly think 

3  Lockett suggests it would be only a very unusual case 

4  where a trial court could say the proffered evidence -­

5

 QUESTION:  Do you want to tell me why?  All I 

6  asked is why.  What is -- what is it that brought you to 

7  the judgment that a cold could be excluded?  You say it is 

8  not because it is too insignificant.  That doesn't count. 

9  And you say it's not because it has no connection to the 

10  -- to the criminal act that he committed.  What -- what 

11  brings you to say that it can be excluded? 

12

 MR. OWEN:  Because I don't think there's any 

13  dimension on -- in which it is relevant to whether the 

14  defendant deserves a life sentence or the death penalty. 

15

16

 QUESTION:  It's not relevant because of what? 

 MR. OWEN:  It's not relevant because it doesn't 

17  reflect any -­

18

 QUESTION:  Because -- because colds don't count 

19  or, you know, what? 

20

21

 MR. OWEN:  No, Your Honor.  No.  I -­

 QUESTION:  I suggest that -- that the reason you 

22  feel it's -- it's not relevant is because either it's too 

23  insignificant or it has no relation whatever to the act 

24  that he committed, one or the other of those.  Maybe both. 

25

 MR. OWEN:  Well, I think that -- that if the 

15


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Court's -- let me back up and say that in any number of


2  cases, this Court has recognized as mitigating


3  circumstances which have no causal connection to the


4  crime.  The best example that I can think of off the top


5  of my head being your opinion, Justice Scalia, in


6  Hitchcock where the Court recognized that Mr. Hitchcock's


7  having been a fond and affectionate uncle to the children


8  of his brother was a fact which the sentencer had to be


9  allowed to consider in deciding whether he ought to get


10  the death penalty or some lesser sentence.


11

 And so I think that at a minimum, adopting the


12  nexus test or the unique severity test would require the


13  Court to overrule all or part of a number of its cases,


14  going all the way back to Lockett, and that there


15  shouldn't be any basis for doing that since the Lockett


16  rule is working perfectly well in practice.  I think


17  again -­


18

 QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Owen, is this position of


19  the -- the severity and the nexus peculiar to the pre­


20  1991 sentences?  That is, have any cases come to the Fifth


21  Circuit involving the new law that simply says the jury


22  can consider all mitigating evidence? 


23

 MR. OWEN:  No, Your Honor, and -- and given this


24  Court's very clear approval of the new statute in Penry II


25  where this Court observed in passing that this new statute


16


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  and its broad opportunity for the jury to consider


2  mitigation was a clearly drafted, catchall provision that


3  complies with Penry I, I don't anticipate that there could


4  be a challenge raised under the new statute.


5

 The only universe of cases that we are talking


6  about is the universe of cases that were sentenced prior


7  to 1991 when Texas changed its statute, and -- and that is


8  a -- a small number of -- of cases.  Probably 85 to 90


9  percent of the people on Texas' death row were sentenced


10  under the new statute. 


11

 QUESTION:  May I ask you a -- a question about


12  the operation of the Texas rule?  Is it your understanding


13  that under the Texas rule, the evidence about how the


14  defendant was nice to his nieces and nephews would be


15  excluded?


16

 MR. OWEN:  No, Your Honor.  That would -- that


17  would come in absolutely.


18

 QUESTION:  You mean under the Texas rule it


19  would come in?


20

 MR. OWEN:  Yes, Your Honor, because the nexus -­


21  the nexus -- the nexus rule or principle or framework is a


22  -- is a -- an appellate review doctrine.  It's not -- it's


23  not a trial doctrine.  These rules were developed by the


24  Fifth Circuit and the Court of Criminal Appeals in trying


25  to apply this Court's decision in Penry.  Going all the


17


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  way back to Jurek, it's always been clear that evidence of


2  the kind that you describe, evidence of good behavior,


3  loved his family, was a solid worker, all of that evidence


4  comes in.  And it's all -- it can all be given mitigating


5  consideration under the old future dangerousness question. 


6  It has much broader consideration now under the new


7  statute, but I don't think it's ever been -- it's never


8  been the case that that -- that that evidence has been


9  excludable.


10

 QUESTION:  Well, what -- what is wrong with the


11  nexus requirement then if it doesn't keep the evidence


12  out?


13

 MR. OWEN:  Because it denies the defendant the


14  opportunity to have the jury -- it refuses to -- to allow


15  a new sentencing hearing for a defendant who comes to the


16  appellate court and says, at the time that I was


17  sentenced, I presented evidence that was clearly relevant


18  to my culpability, like a 67 IQ, and yet the jury wasn't


19  instructed in such a way that they could give it effect. 


20  And the appellate court says, well, if you didn't show


21  that your 67 IQ caused you to commit the crime, then


22  you're not going to get that jury instruction.  So it's -­


23  there's no problem with your death sentence.  That is the


24  problem. 


25

 QUESTION:  So what's the rationale for the nexus


18


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  rule?  It's a -- a sort of a screening process the Fifth


2  Circuit used to determine harmless error or?


3

 MR. OWEN:  No, Your Honor.  I think that the -­


4  the origin of the nexus language is in an attempt to


5  understand what this Court meant in Penry when it said


6  that evidence of a defendant's background and character is


7  relevant to punishment because crimes that are


8  attributable to bad background, mental problems, and so on


9  might deserve a less serious punishment.  And it is -- the


10  Fifth Circuit has seized on, focused on that word


11  attributable and from that elaborated this jurisprudence


12  of causal, deterministic relationship. 


13

 QUESTION:  Of course, in this case -- and I


14  guess in all -- all of the cases involving the -- the old


15  Texas instruction, the State court was proceeding not


16  under Penry II, but just under Penry I.  And it didn't -­


17  Penry II is the case that required full consideration be


18  given to all mitigating circumstances.  Penry I didn't


19  require that.  It just said there had to be some -- some


20  means of giving consideration to it.


21

 MR. OWEN:  Actually, Your Honor, Penry I does


22  say full consideration.  In the -- in the interim, this


23  Court said in Johnson that the test was not necessarily


24  full consideration but meaningful consideration.


25

 And so our position is that at the time the


19


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Court of Criminal Appeals decided this case and said that


2  there was no need for an additional instruction, they -­


3  at a minimum, the test was Johnson's demand that there be


4  meaningful consideration and that under this set of


5  instructions, there was no way to give meaningful


6  consideration to the fact of a 67 IQ, and that that is the


7  -- that is the way in which the Court of Criminal Appeals


8  went astray. 


9

 And in fact, that's illustrated well, I think,


10  by the portions of the Court of Criminal Appeals opinion


11  that try to show how a jury, confronted with the future


12  dangerousness question, could figure out a chain of a


13  reasoning that would get you from this guy has a 67 IQ to,


14  therefore, we can answer no to the future dangerousness


15  question.


16

 It is based on -- it is -- the -- the chain of


17  inferences that the Court of Criminal Appeals suggests is


18  contrary to the evidence that was presented at trial


19  because it relies on characterizations of Mr. Tennard as a


20  follower which are not in the evidence and aren't


21  supported by the evidence.


22

 It is actually contrary to the arguments that


23  were made at trial because the prosecutor told the jury


24  that they wouldn't be allowed to consider what happened or


25  might happen in prison as a way of deciding the answer to


20


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the future dangerousness question.


2

 And it's contrary to this Court's cases like


3  Boyde and Penry II where the Court says, in deciding


4  whether a jury was able to give effect to mitigating


5  evidence under the charge, you don't just look at the


6  language of the charge, but you look at the evidence, you


7  look at the arguments, you look at the context of the


8  whole trial.  The Court of Criminal Appeals effectively


9  covered up the context of the whole trial and said let's


10  see if we can imagine a trial with different evidence and


11  different arguments that might have produced a different


12  result.  And that -- it may be many things, but that is


13  not a fair reading of Penry.  It is not a -- it is not a


14  fair judgment of whether the jury in this case was able to


15  give meaningful consideration to the fact of Mr. Tennard's


16  67 IQ.


17

 QUESTION:  May I ask you, how -- how does the


18  Texas nexus rule work with evidence that the defendant had


19  a war record?  He was a military hero of some kind, but he


20  doesn't argue that affected his conduct in the trial, but


21  just as a general matter, he's a man who should be given


22  special consideration because of his -- his history?


23

 MR. OWEN:  That evidence -- I'm sorry, Your


24  Honor. 


25

 QUESTION:  What happens under -- in Texas with


21


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  kind of evidence? 


2

 MR. OWEN:  I think that what the -- what the


3  court would say is that you don't have to get to the


4  question of whether he showed a nexus because that's the


5  kind of evidence that has a natural home in the future


6  dangerousness question. 


7

 QUESTION:  Why does that have anything to do


8  with future dangerousness?  I don't understand that.


9

 MR. OWEN:  Your Honor, I believe what the -- I


10  believe what Texas would say -- and I'm not saying -- this


11  is my view.  But I think what Texas would say is that in


12  the abstract, good character evidence shows a lack of


13  dangerousness, and for that reason, it can be given effect


14  by returning a no answer to the future dangerousness


15  question.  I think the -­


16

 QUESTION:  Or -- or that he might revert back to


17  his good character in a way that someone who had never


18  shown it might not.


19

 MR. OWEN:  That is correct, Your Honor.  In -­


20  in Boyde v. California, Your Honor observed that certain


21  evidence of good character could be understood as showing


22  that the crime is an aberration from otherwise good


23  character. 


24

 At the same time, Justice Stevens, I think that


25  it was -- it was correctly observed by the concurring


22


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  opinion in Franklin that there may be more relevance to


2  some of those circumstances than just the fact that it


3  doesn't make you dangerous. 


4

 But I think we are down the road from that


5  point, and our point is this evidence, the 67 IQ, is


6  evidence that a juror could reasonably conclude makes you


7  more dangerous, and in the absence of some additional


8  instruction, the jury simply had no vehicle for expressing


9  the -- the conclusion that even having killed deliberately


10  and even though this person poses a risk of future danger,


11  because of his reduced culpability as reflected in his 67


12  IQ, a life sentence is the appropriate sentence.


13

 QUESTION:  Would anything do short of the


14  catchall that Texas has had since 1991?  You say the


15  severity and nexus test is no good and you say that the


16  current catchall is okay.  Is there anything in between


17  those two that would be constitutionally adequate? 


18

 MR. OWEN:  In Penry, this Court suggested that


19  it might be possible to define the term -- let me back up


20  and say, remember, there's a -- the first special issue


21  asks the jury whether the defendant killed deliberately


22  and with the reasonable expectation that death would


23  result.  In Penry, this Court at least held out the


24  possibility that there might be a definition of


25  deliberately which the jury could be provided that would


23


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  focus their attention directly on the defendant's personal


2  culpability.  I am -- I -- I have tried to come up with


3  that definition, but I -- it is hard to hard imagine.


4

 I actually think that the best, clearest, most


5  obvious solution is a supplemental question that


6  effectively directs the jury, having decided the


7  deliberateness and future dangerousness questions, to


8  consider all the mitigating evidence and reach an


9  appropriate judgment about the defendant's culpability.


10

 QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm a little puzzled about why


11  you -- you're not asserting that this defendant was


12  retarded.  You're just asserting that he was not -- not


13  too quick.  Is that -- is that -- I mean, is that a


14  mitigating factor?  He's not retarded.  He's just -- he's


15  just not a whiz kid. 


16

17

 MR. OWEN:  This Court in -­


 QUESTION:  And -- and we should -- that has to


18  be taken into account by the jury?


19

 MR. OWEN:  This Court in Bell v. Ohio, the


20  companion case to Lockett, said that Bell's low average


21  intelligence, or dull, normal intelligence, was a


22  mitigating factor that the sentencer had to be allowed to


23  consider.  We know from the briefs in that case that the


24  IQ score for Mr. Bell ranged between 81 to 90, so we know


25  that 90 is something the jury has got to consider. 


24


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 In Burger v. Kemp, the Court observed that Mr.


2  Burger's 82 IQ was a -- was a mitigating circumstance


3  which the jury would have to be instructed to consider,


4  had it been offered by counsel. 


5

 We know from McKoy v. North Carolina that 74 is


6  an IQ that counts as a mitigating circumstance. 


7

 I think every reasonable juror would understand,


8  particularly when counsel is urging vigorously this is a


9  very low IQ, as counsel did in this case -- would


10  understand that it does substantially reduce moral


11  culpability.


12

 Your Honor, with the Court's permission, I'd


13  like to reserve the balance of my time. 


14

15

16

17

18

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Owen.


 Mr. Marshall, we'll hear from you.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD L. MARSHALL


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


 MR. MARSHALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


19  please the Court:


20

 This case is squarely controlled by the Court's


21  opinions in Graham v. Collins and Johnson v. Texas in


22  which the Court rejected Penry claims based on youth and


23  troubled upbringing.


24

 In fact, Tennard's Penry claim, based on a


25  completely unexplained IQ score, is much weaker than


25


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Graham's or Johnson's for two reasons.  First, Tennard's


2  claim is governed by the AEDPA, which requires deference


3  to the Texas court's reasoning in its opinion, and second,


4  Tennard's disembodied IQ score has really minimal


5  mitigating or aggravating significance within the special


6  issues here because -­


7

 QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me this -- this is


8  not a case of -- of ineffective assistance of counsel


9  where we're seeing if -- if it was proper to overlook the


10  evidence at all.  The evidence was entered, was admitted


11  in the trial court.  And the question is whether or not it


12  was given proper consideration. 


13

 MR. MARSHALL:  Your Honor, I -- I believe it was


14  given proper considered.  Whether it was considered as -­


15

 QUESTION:  Well, but I mean, that's -- that's


16  quite apart from the fact that, you know, it may be


17  persuasive or not persuasive.


18

 MR. MARSHALL:  It is apart from that question,


19  Justice Kennedy.  However, in this case, if you take a


20  look at counsel's strategy as a whole in -- in defending


21  this case, he basically decided to paint Tennard as the


22  less culpable party among his co-defendants and -- and


23  paint him as a follower in illustrating that he allowed


24  his prior rape victim to escape.  In -- in questioning his


25  role in the murders in this case, that was his strategy. 


26


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Counsel certainly didn't believe, I -- I don't think from


2  the record, that -- that this IQ score had any independent


3  mitigating significance beyond that follower theory


4  because he didn't object to the -- the instructions or the


5  special issues that were given and -- and didn't attempt


6  to argue it outside of that context.


7

 Everything that he placed before the jury was


8  the idea that Tennard was a follower in this case and that


9  that made him less culpable.  And that is a fact that is


10  mitigating within the context of future dangerousness, as


11  this Court reasoned in Jurek, where they said the duress


12  or domination of co-defendants would be cognizable within


13  that special issue.


14

 Here, counsel presented the argument and -- and


15  some evidence to the effect that Tennard was a model


16  prisoner when he was incarcerated in his prior -- for the


17  prior rape conviction.  He had no disciplinary


18  infractions.  This was clearly counsel's global theory,


19  not that he was -- that he had any kind of diminished


20  capacity to commit this offense.


21

 QUESTION:  Opposing counsel says, however, we


22  don't even have to get to that argument, that maybe if the


23  Fifth Circuit had considered the case aright, it would


24  agree with you on that point.  But it never got to that


25  point.  It applied its -- its two factors and therefore


27


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  never even had to consider what you're presenting to us. 


2  It just said no causality and not -- not severe enough. 


3  What -- what's your response to that?


4

 MR. MARSHALL:  Justice Scalia, I -- I would say


5  that the Fifth Circuit was really looking at whether the


6  State court's opinion was reasonable in this case.  The -­


7  the State court did apply Penry in a way to try to


8  determine -- applied Johnson and Graham and tried to


9  determine whether this evidence was relevant within the


10  special issues as given and as defined.


11

 QUESTION:  Well, do you -- do you think the


12  Fifth Circuit's uniquely severe, permanent handicap and


13  nexus tests are the proper interpretation of the Penry


14  cases?


15

 MR. MARSHALL:  I believe, Justice O'Connor, that


16  they are one proper interpretation.  They were developed


17  as a screening test of sorts to try to engender some sort


18  of consistency in the many, many, many Penry claims that


19  they -­


20

 QUESTION:  I mean, if we thought that the


21  certificate of appealability should have been granted, I


22  suppose you would then argue, when it went back, that


23  those are the right tests to employ?


24

 MR. MARSHALL:  That would be one argument we


25  would advance, Justice O'Connor.  I -- that's sort of a


28


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  screening, a -- a prima facie analysis of -- of the Penry


2  claim and it's designed to handle a wide variety of types


3  of evidence offered.


4

 QUESTION:  I -- I have a lot of trouble seeing


5  how the first uniquely severe, permanent handicap test is


6  -- is proper in light of Penry.  That's a pretty low IQ in


7  this case, is it not?


8

 MR. MARSHALL:  We know now that it's a low IQ. 


9  I -- I don't know whether the jury was aware of that fact


10  at the time of trial because it was never explained to


11  them, Your Honor.  And it was never contrasted with any


12  other IQ score.


13

 However, I think the Fifth Circuit's opinion is


14  illustrative of -- of the difference between the -- the


15  four-part test that's identified in the Fifth Circuit for


16  determining Penry violations and the additional analysis


17  that goes on top of it, which is even aside from this


18  question of whether we have a nexus, whether we have a -­


19  whether we have severity or permanence, these other


20  factors, the court invariably ends up looking at whether


21  the jury could consider that evidence within the special


22  issues, whether it was relevant in -- in some way, in some


23  meaningful way.  And -- and that's the question the Court


24  identified in Johnson and in Graham that -- that should be


25  -- be the controlling factor in Penry cases.


29


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 So I think -- I think the Eighth Amendment only


2  requires looking at Johnson and Graham, that -- that the


3  jury be able to give effect in some manner to the evidence


4  introduced, not that it be able -- not that it's required


5  to give effect in every conceivable way.  And so the issue


6  isn't really whether Tennard can identify some relevance


7  for this evidence beyond the special issues that were


8  given, but whether he can -- whether we can look at the


9  record and see if it had some relevance within those


10  special issues that was available to the jury.


11

 And I think that's exactly what the State court


12  did in this case.  They looked at deliberateness and as


13  Tennard has argued in his brief, I think quite eloquently,


14  deliberateness was truly designed to deal with the


15  question of party liability.  Whether the defendant had a


16  reasonable expectation that death would occur.


17

 And in this case, where a party instruction was


18  given during the guilt/innocence phase, there was that


19  lingering question of whether Tennard was the primary


20  actor here.  And so that's exactly how Tennard's counsel


21  argued it to the jury.  He suggested that -- that Tennard


22  was a follower.  He wasn't the primary here.  He may not


23  have even stabbed the victim in this case.  It might have


24  been his co-defendant who may be lying or -- or minimizing


25  their own responsibility in order to cover their tracks. 


30


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  And so that's the theory before the jury from counsel's


2  perspective, and that fits squarely within deliberateness


3  here. 


4

 QUESTION:  All right.  Could I -- can I -- can I 


5  interrupt you there?  It seems to me that under the -­


6  let's take the first prong of the First Circuit's test,


7  the unique severity requirement, that in fact, if the


8  unique severity requirement is a proper reading of -- of


9  Penry, then it seems to me we've read that evidence, in


10  effect, right out of -- of relevance and admissibility. 


11  There are millions of followers in this world.  There's no


12  way in the world, I would suppose, on this evidence that


13  -- that one could plausibly argue that this individual's


14  condition was a uniquely severe follower kind of


15  personality, and therefore it would be excluded.  So it


16  seems to me that the unique severity requirement would


17  preclude the argument you just made in support of the -­


18  the court's position.


19

 MR. MARSHALL:  Justice Souter, that is not a


20  question of admissibility, though.  And -- and here what


21  the court was looking at on appeal -­


22

 QUESTION:  No, but it -- it -- as your brother


23  on the other side said, if it's constitutional relevance,


24  it could be a basis for an admissibility ruling. 


25

 But let's, as you say, take the case that we've


31


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  got and -- and on the case that we've got, the -- in


2  effect, the Court is saying there's no need even to get to


3  the argument that counsel for the State of Texas has just


4  made because on -- on no reading of uniquely severe could


5  we say that this is uniquely severe evidence.  And


6  therefore, we don't even have to get to the question of


7  whether sufficient consideration could have been given to


8  this under -- under Penry.


9

 MR. MARSHALL:  Your Honor, it's -- it's a


10  combination question that we're looking at here.  It's


11  whether the evidence had -- had mitigating significance


12  and then whether that significance was beyond the scope of


13  the special issues.  I think that -­


14

 QUESTION:  But you say -- but as I understand


15  it, the circuit and the Court of Criminal Appeals says we


16  don't even have to deal with the substance of these issues


17  unless the evidence is indicative of something which is


18  uniquely severe, which clearly this is not.  So that on


19  the -- as I understand the circuit's position, there would


20  be no need for you to make the argument that you just made


21  to us about the adequacy of consideration that could be


22  given under -- under Penry because on the uniquely severe


23  test, we don't even -- it's not uniquely severe under any


24  reading and therefore we don't even have to get to the


25  question of substance.


32


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. MARSHALL:  Your Honor, that may be true. 

2  However -­

3

 QUESTION:  Well, if it's true, it's a violation 

4  of Penry, isn't it? 

5

 MR. MARSHALL:  I -- I disagree, Your Honor.  I 

6  think that -- I think that the uniquely severe, permanent 

7  handicap test that was identified in -- in the Fifth 

8  Circuit's en banc opinion in Graham is basically a 

9  description of Penry's evidence.  And so the question 

10  is -­

11

 QUESTION:  I think you're wrong about that.  If 

12  this -- if the Fifth Circuit's test is a misinterpretation 

13  of Penry, then I take it you lose this case.  And if the 

14  Fifth Circuit has misinterpreted Penry's -- what Penry 

15  means --

16

 MR. MARSHALL:  No, Your Honor.  The Fifth 

17  Circuit's test is not even at issue in this case.  It was 

18  at issue in the companion case Smith, but here what we're 

19  looking at in the denial of COA context under the AEDPA is 

20  whether the State court's treatment of the issue was 

21  reasonable or not.  And I think -­

22

23

 QUESTION:  It's the same test, isn't it? 

 MR. MARSHALL:  Not quite, Your Honor.  The -­

24  the State court has taken a slightly different tack.  They 

25  did not address the nexus, severity, uniquely severe test 

33


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  when they addressed Tennard's evidence in this case in Ex


2  parte Tennard, as contained in the joint appendix.  They


3  did not apply that test. 


4

 And in the past, they have taken different


5  approaches over nexus, for example.  The -- the State


6  court has always held that nexus is established


7  automatically if a defendant introduces evidence of mental


8  retardation, and they have granted relief in numerous


9  cases on that very point, that there's several cases in my


10  brief at pages 27 and 28 that I've identified where the -­


11  I think there are six or seven -- where the State court


12  granted relief saying that we know mental retardation is


13  uniquely severe because not only, as it was described in


14  Penry, but -- but in earlier cases, that -- that it


15  affects the defendant's ability to control their impulses,


16  it affects their ability to learn from their mistakes. 


17  These are the things that are mitigating and these have an


18  automatic nexus. 


19

 So there's a difference between the way the


20  Fifth Circuit has applied it and the way the State court


21  has applied it, and I don't -­


22

 QUESTION:  But what is the State -- I thought


23  that at one point you told us that -- that the Fifth


24  Circuit got the severity and nexus threshold requirements


25  from the State, that the State initiated those


34


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1  requirements.  And now you say but in Tennard's case, as


2  distinguished from Smith, the State applied some other


3  test?


4

 MR. MARSHALL:  Your Honor, the State court


5  initially began by asking -- by identifying more or less


6  four factors, whether the -- whether the evidence was


7  involuntary disability, whether it was permanent in


8  nature, whether it was severe enough, and whether there


9  was at least an inference of nexus from the evidence. 


10  Those four factors parallel, more or less, the uniquely


11  severe, permanent handicap language from Graham.


12

 And so the two tests have gone in parallel


13  through the years, although the State court has vindicated


14  many more Penry claims than the Fifth Circuit has simply


15  because that's where the meritorious claims were found and


16  that's where they got relief.  So the Fifth Circuit has


17  never been faced with the number of cases that the State


18  court was that presented evidence that rose to that level


19  so that I think in retrospect, the Fifth Circuit's test


20  becomes a little bit severe when it is viewed in that


21  vacuum but when it's compared with the way the State court


22  has done it, basically all of the meritorious claims have


23  been vindicated.


24

 QUESTION:  But you -- you seem to -- what you


25  said were -- you recited four factors, but it sounded like


35


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  severity was one and nexus was another. 

2

 MR. MARSHALL:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is 

3  correct.  However, the nexus requirement has been applied 

4  differently by the State court. 

5

 QUESTION:  You say it has not been applied as a 

6  causation test.  Is that it?  Association but not 

7  causation?  Is that a fair -­

8

 MR. MARSHALL:  That is a fair statement of it, 

9  Justice Souter.  It's -- it's whether the jury could infer 

10  a connection. 

11

 QUESTION:  I'm rather mixed up.  I mean, I'm 

12  taking your brief on pages 10 through 12, and reading your 

13  account of it, what I thought happened is that when the 

14  defendant, who had been sentenced to death, went to the 

15  district court and then to the Fifth Circuit, the Fifth 

16  Circuit did not say, just as Justice Souter said -- it did 

17  not say this evidence helps to show this person will not 

18  commit the crime.  Rather, they said, when faced with the 

19  argument, this evidence shows he's more dangerous because 

20  a mentally retarded person at this level might commit more 

21  crimes.  They didn't decide that issue. 

22

 And then reading from your brief, it said the 

23  reason is because the evidence comes far from 

24  demonstrating that Smith suffered from a, quote, uniquely 

25  severe, permanent handicap.  End quote.  And that the 

36


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  criminal act was attributable to this condition.  Am I 

2  quoting from the right place? 

3

 MR. MARSHALL:  I think that's the brief in 

4  Smith, Your Honor. 

5

 QUESTION:  That's the brief in Smith.  All 

6  right.  So where -- what -- what was the situation in -­

7  in this -- Tennard? 

8

 MR. MARSHALL:  Justice Breyer, the -- the 

9  evidence is an interesting contrast between the two cases. 

10  Smith introduced more than abundant evidence, I think, of 

11  -- of -- that were -- that was mitigating, in effect, the 

12  fact that he had an antisocial personality disorder, all 

13  of these other factors.  Tennard's IQ evidence came in on 

14  a prison record form with just a sole number 67.  The -­

15  the parole officer who testified identified the number and 

16  then admitted on cross that he had no idea who had given 

17  the test, he had no idea what kind of test was given, when 

18  it was given.  All of these factors were -- were laid out 

19  there. 

20

 QUESTION:  When you say no idea what kind of a 

21  test, it was recognized it was an IQ test, wasn't it? 

22

 MR. MARSHALL:  That's correct, Your Honor.  It 

23  was recognized as an IQ test.  And -- I -- my point was 

24  that it wasn't identified as a short-form test, a full­

25  scale IQ score. 

37

1

 QUESTION:  Isn't that something the State would


2  know if it were given in a State prison?  If the tests


3  were given at a certain period of time in a State prison,


4  that's -- that's something that the State could easily


5  find out what were they giving at the time.


6

 MR. MARSHALL:  Your Honor, it was not contained


7  on the -- the social and criminal history form that was


8  introduce, and that's at page 63 of the joint appendix. 


9  It -- it's -- it's not in that form.  And the parole


10  officer who was called as a witness by the defense who


11  brought this form didn't know the answer to that question


12  either.


13

 QUESTION:  But somebody connected with the State


14  correction system would know, would they not?


15

 MR. MARSHALL:  Presumably someone would know. 


16  The psychologist who administered the test would know.


17

 QUESTION:  Well, the State could have informed


18  itself fully of what goes on at State prisons with regard


19  to IQ tests. 


20

 MR. MARSHALL:  That's possible, Your Honor,


21  except that it was the defendant's evidence in this case. 


22  And I don't think that the State necessarily looked at it


23  as any significant evidence, just like I don't think the


24  defense looked at it as significant evidence. 


25

 QUESTION:  But all of this goes to the weight


38


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that the evidence might have, but it -- what -- what does


2  it have to do with whether it is appropriate to erect this


3  threshold test for considering whether it even needs to be


4  considered as -- as an issue on appeal?


5

 MR. MARSHALL:  Justice Souter, under -- under


6  both Graham and Johnson, we're trying to figure out


7  whether the evidence had some relevance within the special


8  issues, not whether it had every bit of relevance it


9  should have had, but whether it just had some meaningful


10  relevance.  And so I think looking at the weight of the


11  evidence is part of that analysis.  We have to look and


12  see what the jury would have -- what meaning the jury


13  would have given -­


14

 QUESTION:  No, but it -- it -- you -- you don't


15  -- I take it your argument is not that they couldn't give


16  it any weight at all.


17

18

 MR. MARSHALL:  Correct, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  So the -- the -- what I'm going to


19  call the screening question we have before us is does a


20  Court even have to get into the use that might be made of


21  that evidence, whatever its weight, unless that evidence


22  satisfies these two threshold requirements -­


23

24

 MR. MARSHALL:  Your Honor, those threshold -­


 QUESTION:  -- or the State's equivalent of the


25  two threshold requirements?  Isn't that the issue before


39


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  us?


2

 MR. MARSHALL:  I believe that is the issue, and


3  I might add that those threshold requirements are


4  questions as to what relevance the evidence had and how it


5  could have fit within the special issues.  So when we're


6  looking at severity and nexus, we're looking at how does


7  the evidence mitigate moral culpability, how does it tend


8  to excuse the crime.


9

 QUESTION:  But the -- the circuit, I take it,


10  would say, all right, given the fact that there may be an


11  argument over the weight to be given, accepting that, we


12  don't have to decide whether enough weight could be given


13  to that evidence for Penry purposes unless that evidence


14  indicates something that is uniquely severe and was the


15  cause of the crime.


16

 MR. MARSHALL:  Generally speaking, Justice


17  Souter, the evidence that fails to pass that test does


18  have some relevance within the special issues because,


19  generally speaking, it tends to either show that the crime


20  was an aberration -- what we're looking for is something


21  that's -- when we're trying to identify Penry error, we're


22  looking at evidence that's solely aggravating in answering


23  those special issues, not necessarily evidence that just


24  has some relevance outside those special issues, just


25  whether it has only aggravating relevance within them or


40


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  no relevance within them. 


2

 And I think that's what the Court was talking


3  about in Graham and Johnson, where we looked at youth and


4  -- and determined that, yes, youth had -- may have some


5  significance outside future dangerousness, but the fact


6  that it has some significance within future dangerousness


7  cures any potential Penry error.  And that's exactly what


8  these factors that the Fifth Circuit has identified, and


9  the State court to a lesser extent, are designed to root


10  out, to try to catch those types of evidence and determine


11  whether they indeed had some relevance or not.


12

13

14

 QUESTION:  Can I --


 QUESTION:  You're saying --


 QUESTION:  -- procedurally I -- I see what -­


15  what we have in -- in your case is it's -- there's a


16  reference to lower court in your brief, and I'm not sure


17  which it is.  I thought that what had happened is the


18  Fifth Circuit had been fairly been clear that their two


19  controversial matters determined this.  But the fact is -­


20  and I'm trying to get the procedural part right -- is they


21  didn't say anything.  And so all we have is the lower -­


22  is the lower court opinion.  Is that right?


23

 Did -- did the -- and the lower court had said,


24  well, one of the reasons that they lose is because the


25  future dangerous part of the Texas test gives effect to


41


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  this.  And that's where we are. 

2

 MR. MARSHALL:  That's correct.  The -- the Fifth 

3  Circuit -­

4

 QUESTION:  So what you've done is you got rid of 

5  the other case which did clearly present it. 

6

7

 MR. MARSHALL:  Yes, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  And now what you're saying now is 

8  this case doesn't really present the issue that we took it 

9  to deal with. 

10

 MR. MARSHALL:  Correct, Your Honor.  This case 

11  -- the Fifth Circuit looked at the State court 

12  adjudication -­

13

 QUESTION:  Now, what do you suggest we do?  I 

14  mean, suppose I happened to think that -- that the Texas 

15  Fifth Circuit is applying two tests that are really 

16  erroneous and not a correct interpretation?  If I -- if I 

17  thought that was a big issue and maybe that was so, have 

18  you any suggestion as to how we should proceed? 

19

 MR. MARSHALL:  Well, Your Honor, contrary -- I 

20  mean, and in contrast to Penry and the prior cases that 

21  came before the Court, this is not here on de novo review. 

22  We're now bound by the AEDPA, and we're looking at 

23  reasonableness.  And so I think the Court is necessarily 

24  looking at it from a different angle now, and -- and so 

25  whether the Court simply disagrees with the test is not an 

42


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  issue here and really wouldn't be merited -­


2

 QUESTION:  What about saying we've seen in other


3  cases like Smith, for example, that the Fifth Circuit has


4  continuously denied review or reversed or affirmed or


5  whatever on the basis of these two tests?  And so we think


6  it's a reasonable assumption that that played a role in


7  their decision here too, particularly since whether this


8  case does fit within Graham and -- and the other one you


9  cited, is certainly open to reasonable argument.  Now,


10  what would be wrong with taking that approach?


11

 MR. MARSHALL:  Your Honor, I think that again,


12  if the Court disagrees with the test that was applied in


13  the Fifth Circuit, the Court is still stuck with -- with


14  determining whether it was the State court's opinion that


15  was reasonable or not.  Now, the Court could await another


16  case raising the issue and there are more.  By my last


17  count there are approximately 100 and may still -- on


18  death row in Texas who were sentenced under this


19  sentencing scheme, and so I'm sure those claims will


20  arrive again some day. 


21

 But -- but in this case, I don't think the Court


22  has that option when applying the AEDPA to the State


23  court's opinion.  And further, I -- I think what we're


24  really looking at is whether the Fifth Circuit's -- or -­


25  or whether the -- the Federal court's application of the


43


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  AEDPA was debatable.  So we're even one step further


2  removed from reasonableness in that sense.  I don't think


3  that this is the case for it, and -­


4

 QUESTION:  Could -- could I get back to what you


5  had just said before Justice Breyer asked you the


6  question?  You -- you were -- you were describing why it


7  is that these two tests do, indeed, bear upon the Penry


8  determination.  You -- you said, as I understand it, if it


9  isn't severe enough, it can be taken into account in the


10  future dangerousness determination.  Right?  If it's too


11  severe, the only way it can cut is to make him more


12  dangerous in the future, but if it's -- if it's milder, it


13  can be -- it can be -- it can cut both ways.


14

 MR. MARSHALL:  Generally speaking, yes, Your


15  Honor. 


16

 QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, what about the other one? 


17  What about the -- the nexus requirement?  How does that


18  bear upon the Penry -- the Penry issue?


19

 MR. MARSHALL:  We're -- in trying to -- in


20  trying to analyze the -- the Penry claim, we're trying to


21  figure out whether -- whether the evidence introduced at


22  trial had -- had significant relevance to moral


23  culpability that was outside the scope of the special


24  issues.  And I think it's the combination of those


25  factors, not necessarily each one, one by one, that gets


44


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  you there, but the nexus requirement basically just asks


2  the question whether it actually has relevance to moral


3  culpability and whether that relevance reaches the level


4  that it placed it outside the special issues.


5

 QUESTION:  All right.  With respect to the


6  first, I can understand why it bears upon the Penry thing. 


7  With respect to the second, it seems sensible, but I don't


8  -- I don't see how it has any bearing on the -- on -- on


9  whether you can give that -- that factor some effect under


10  the special issues.


11

 MR. MARSHALL:  Well, for example, Justice


12  Scalia, I -- I think that the evidence of follower status,


13  for example, that -- that was argued extensively to the


14  jury in this case would have a nexus to the crime because,


15  of course, it involved the circumstances of the crime. 


16  And so, therefore, it would fall within the special issue


17  of deliberateness where the jury is asked to resolve the


18  issue of -- of the specific intent required in a party


19  situation like this. 


20

 QUESTION:  Yes, but I mean it -- it accidentally


21  had a nexus to the crime because, you know, he claimed


22  that he was a follower in this crime.  What if he


23  introduced the same evidence?  He has a low IQ and in all


24  other situations he's a follower, but there's no direct


25  evidence that in this crime -- in this crime he was.


45


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

2

 MR. MARSHALL:  Well, then I think -­


 QUESTION:  Why do you need the nexus in order to


3  make it considerable by the jury?


4

 MR. MARSHALL:  Well, then I would question


5  whether the evidence actually had relevance to moral


6  culpability if it had no connection to the defendant or


7  his crime.  And so I think that's the inquiry we're


8  looking at here, is -- is -- and again, it's part of the


9  -- the multi-part test that the Fifth Circuit and the


10  State court have devised. 


11

 And I think the best explanation occurs in -- in


12  the Fifth Circuit's opinion in Robertson v. Cockrell which


13  was handed down last year.  It was an en banc opinion at


14  325 F.3d 243.  The court summed up its entire body of


15  Penry jurisprudence there and identified the four factors


16  that are relevant, voluntariness and so on. 


17

 QUESTION:  Would you clarify one thing for me? 


18  I may have missed it.  The nexus requirement -- does that


19  require a nexus to the crime or a nexus to the likelihood


20  that he'll be dangerous in the future?


21

 MR. MARSHALL:  It -- it requires a nexus, at


22  least an inferential nexus, to the crime itself, Your


23  Honor. 


24

 QUESTION:  Well, then -- then I take it being a


25  veteran or a war hero or something like that, which


46


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  clearly had nothing to do with this particular crime -­

2  that would not be -- not satisfy the nexus requirement. 

3

 MR. MARSHALL:  It would not, but it -- but -­

4  but again, that evidence would be relevant within future 

5  dangerousness because it would go to good character.  So 

6  while good character evidence doesn't necessarily have a 

7  nexus to the crime, good character evidence is relevant 

8  within the -- the special issues, and the Court held that 

9  in Jurek that -­

10

 QUESTION:  All right.  What -- what about the -­

11  the case of the individual with the -- with the abused 

12  childhood?  Assume -- assume a case -- I think one of the 

13  briefs mentioned this.  Assume a case in which the parents 

14  didn't teach the child to be a thief or a murderer or to 

15  commit crimes.  They simply abused the child.  It's -­

16  it's clear that -- from our cases that that evidence would 

17  be admissible.  What I don't understand is how that 

18  evidence could ever satisfy the nexus test.  There's no 

19  way you can say as a causal matter that the fact of the 

20  abusive childhood caused this crime, which I take it is 

21  what the -- the Fifth Circuit would require.  Am I -- am I 

22  missing something? 

23

 MR. MARSHALL:  The rule is not that strict, 

24  Justice Souter.  It -- it requires an inference of 

25  causation.  And I think child abuse is most--

47


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  Well, I mean, that's -- that's what I 

2  mean by cause.  How could you ever infer causation? 

3

 MR. MARSHALL:  I think child abuse is -- is 

4  truly analogous to youth, for example, which I think the 

5  average juror does understand has a connection to moral 

6  culpability.  And it's -- as youth is something that most 

7  people have common -­

8

 QUESTION:  No.  But you're -- you're -- I -- I 

9  don't mean to be short with you, but I think you're 

10  changing the terms of the question.  It isn't whether 

11  there is an association with moral culpability.  The 

12  issue, as I understand it, is whether this mitigating 

13  evidence is relevant to this crime in the sense that there 

14  is a possible causal inference, not some broader 

15  association.  Am I wrong about that? 

16

 MR. MARSHALL:  No, you're not wrong, Justice 

17  Souter.  I -- I think that is -­

18

 QUESTION:  Okay.  Then how can you draw the 

19  causal inference?  Why -- why on that -- on that threshold 

20  relevance understanding, why -- why ultimately wouldn't we 

21  have to say, well, under the Fifth Circuit rule, the 

22  abused childhood evidence really is irrelevant?  It can 

23  never be considered. 

24

 MR. MARSHALL:  If child abuse was the evidence 

25  presented in this case, we may have a bigger problem, Your 

48


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Honor.  That is a more difficult topic.  However, it's not 

2  the case here. 

3

 QUESTION:  But it's utterly inconsistent with 

4  our cases, isn't it?  I mean, haven't -- isn't it 

5  perfectly clear that that evidence is admissible? 

6

7

 MR. MARSHALL:  It is, of course. 

 QUESTION:  And -- and must be given we'll -­

8  let's use the term, meaningful consideration, by the jury. 

9  And -- and it couldn't be given any consideration on the 

10  causation -- if there's a causation requirement. 

11

 MR. MARSHALL:  I don't think that's absolute, 

12  Your Honor.  I -- I think there may be some causation 

13  argument where we're looking at, as I said, common 

14  knowledge.  Jurors -- jurors know that people who are 

15  abused as children turn out a certain way and -- and that 

16  it's --

17

 QUESTION:  Yes.  I -- that's what I would say. 

18  I -- I don't know why you concede so readily that it has 

19  no -- no causal nexus.  I -- I think the reason that -­

20  that we usually allow that as mitigating evidence is that, 

21  you know, you -- you beat a kid cruelly and he turns out 

22  to be a cruel kid.  I don't know why -- why you -- why you 

23  make the concession. 

24

 Has the Fifth Circuit ever used its nexus 

25  requirement to exclude evidence of severe maltreatment as 

49

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  a -- as a child? 


2

 MR. MARSHALL:  Your Honor, I -- I'm not aware of


3  cases that -- that they excluded evidence of severe child


4  abuse.  However, in some cases where there was mild or


5  moderate, sketchy evidence of child abuse, they have used


6  that -­


7

 QUESTION:  That's the other factor.  That's not


8  the nexus factor.  That's the severity factor. 


9

10

 MR. MARSHALL:  Correct, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  I -- I guess that gets us -- I guess


11  the difference between your answer to Justice Scalia and


12  your answer to me gets -- gets us to the question, what do


13  they mean by cause?  And -- and I thought the Fifth


14  Circuit was requiring something much more than, as you put


15  it, an association with the personality.  I thought it was


16  requiring something more specific.  But maybe I'm wrong. 


17

18

 MR. MARSHALL:  I -­


 QUESTION:  I mean, your answer to Justice Scalia


19  suggests that I -- that I am wrong, that the circuit isn't


20  requiring what I thought it was. 


21

 MR. MARSHALL:  Your Honor, I think in Robertson,


22  the most recent case in which the Court took up the issue


23  of child abuse -- and I see my red light is on, but I'll


24  finish answering.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. OWEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


 QUESTION:  Mr. Owen, is your understanding the


6  same as Mr. Marshall's that we're talking about a universe


7  of 100 cases? 


8

 MR. OWEN:  I -- I tried to count them myself,


9  Your Honor, and my number was closer to 50.  And I don't


10  know on what -- I don't know where or how we disagree, but


11  I think the universe of cases is -- is obviously more than


12  perhaps 40 and -- and I guess by his count fewer than 100. 


13  Again, it's only the people who were sentenced -- and


14  again, I think we need to emphasize that a ruling in favor


15  of Mr. Tennard would only affect the sentences of people


16  who introduced mitigating evidence at their trial that had


17  relevance to moral culpability outside the inquiries that


18  the jury received in its instructions.  So, again, there


19  would be a subset beyond the number of cases just tried


20  prior to 1991 that would include the cases in which


21  certain kinds of mitigating evidence like the 67 IQ in


22  this case were introduced. 


23

 Let me address Justice Breyer's question first


24  about the Fifth Circuit's treatment of the claim in this


25  case.  Justice Breyer, I'd like to refer you to pages 20

1  to 22 of our brief, and at those pages we described the


2  way in which the Fifth Circuit analyzed the claim in our


3  case.  And I think it is -- it is the case that they


4  applied both the unique severity test and the nexus test


5  and found us wanting on both scores.  And then ultimately,


6  in the way that the Fifth Circuit has, having reached the


7  merits, it said that we didn't get a COA.  So I'm -- I'm


8  not sure.  I think -- but that -- they did -- they did


9  apply the test, and so I don't think there would be


10  anything inappropriate about this Court assessing the


11  appropriateness of the test.


12

 With respect to the trial record, I do want to


13  emphasize that the word follower does not appear in


14  defense counsel's closing argument.  Defense counsel did


15  not make the argument that Mr. Tennard was a follower,


16  that his 67 IQ made him a follower, that he followed other


17  people in committing this crime.  There is only one -- one


18  comment from defense counsel, a single sentence in the


19  course of the closing argument which says with respect to


20  an earlier crime that Mr. Tennard was involved in, that he


21  was not the leader.  It doesn't say, and he was less


22  culpable than anybody else.  He doesn't say, he only got


23  involved in that crime because he was following somebody


24  else. 


25

 This is not a case that was defended at trial on


52

1  the theory that Mr. Tennard, because of his 67 IQ, is a


2  follower.  It is a case that was defended at trial on the


3  theory that having a 67 IQ is the sort of globally


4  disabling quality that affects everything Mr. Tennard


5  does, every action that he takes, every thought that he


6  has, every judgment that he makes.

 QUESTION:  Was that argument made?


 MR. OWEN:  It is certainly argued, Your Honor,


9  that -- as defense counsel puts it to the jury, he says,


10  you have a man who has an IQ that is that low, and he says


11  to the jury, none of you know what it's like to have a 67


12  IQ.


13

 And I think -- and the -- and the prosecutor,


14  for his part, doesn't dispute the lowness of the IQ score. 


15  The prosecutor's argument isn't, oh, come now, a 67 IQ


16  isn't that low.  The prosecutor's argument is, under these


17  instructions, ladies and gentlemen, you're not asked why


18  Mr. Tennard became a danger.  You're being asked whether


19  he's a danger.  That's the only thing that the -- that the


20  jury was asked to consider. 


21

 I think that -- that it's important to keep in


22  mind the quality of this mitigating evidence. 


23

 It also was suggested that counsel didn't object


24  to the instructions, didn't ask for a special instruction. 


25  While he did not ask for a special instruction at the


53


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  point of the jury charge, there is a pretrial motion filed


2  by defense counsel which complains that the Texas statute


3  does not permit the consideration of mitigating


4  circumstances, which asked for definitions of the key


5  terms in the statute, and that was denied.  So it's -­


6  it's certainly not a case in which there was -- it was -­


7  you know, the people at trial were unaware of this problem


8  with the instructions.  That's evident from defense


9  counsel's argument. 


10

 I think that the -- the one -- one thing I want


11  to emphasize about the nature of this mitigating evidence


12  is the way in which it's -- it's -- it does affect moral


13  culpability.  And the quote I found that I liked the best


14  on this actually is from a concurring opinion in Skipper


15  where, in the course of explaining why they felt that


16  evidence of good behavior in jail didn't qualify as Eighth


17  Amendment mitigating evidence, Justice Powell joined,


18  among others, by Chief Justice Rehnquist, said, evidence


19  of a reduced capacity for considered choice bears directly


20  on the fundamental justice of imposing capital punishment. 


21  This evidence in our case is evidence of that kind of


22  reduced capacity that the jury had no vehicle for giving


23  that kind of mitigating effect to in imposing sentence.


24

 We'd ask the Court to reverse the judgment


25  below.
