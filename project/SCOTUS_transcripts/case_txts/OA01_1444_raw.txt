JUSTICE STEVENS:  We'll hear argument in


Number 01-1444, Chavez against Martinez.


Mr. Robbins, whenever you're prepared, you may


proceed.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. ROBBINS:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and


may it please the Court:


The Ninth Circuit held in this case that


petitioner Ben Chavez could not assert a qualified


immunity defense to a section 1983 lawsuit alleging that


his interrogation of respondent violated the Fifth and


Fourteenth Amendments. 


We believe that ruling to be 

mistaken. 


First, there was no constitutional violation at


all on these facts.  But second, if there was a


constitutional right implicated, that right was not


clearly established in the particularized sense required


by this Court's qualified immunity cases.  Officer Chavez


could not reasonably have known that what he was doing


violated that right, and the judgment of the Ninth Circuit


should, therefore, be reversed. 


QUESTION:  May I ask this question on that point

that you addressed before you get through?  Supposing he


thought at the time of the questioning that the


material -- the answers would be used in evidence later


on, and he knew that it would have been a violation of the


Constitution to use those answers later on.  Would he be


entitled to qualified immunity then? 


MR. ROBBINS:  Yes, because the Constitution --


well, because the first inquiry would be has the


Constitution been violated.  Whether he thought --


QUESTION:  But your -- I'm just directing my


question at -- you sort of said even assuming a


constitutional violation, he nevertheless is entitled to


good faith immunity.  And I'm saying, well, assume the --


the facts I've just granted, including an assumption that


the -- it would have been a constitutional violation to 

use the evidence. 


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, I think -- I think the --


the answer is that while -- while he might have believed


that the Constitution would in time be violated, because


he could not himself violate it, he couldn't -- he


couldn't be liable under section 1983 for committing a


Fifth Amendment violation.  So the point is you don't even


get to the question of clearly established if there's no


established constitutional violation at all. 


QUESTION:  But we -- we do somehow extend the

Fifth Amendment protection to the period before the actual


introduction of the evidence in a criminal trial.  That is


to say, we -- we permit a witness to refuse to answer


unless the witness is given -- is given immunity from


prosecution.  Now, how do you explain that, unless somehow


the Fifth Amendment has some antecedent application before


the evidence is actually --


MR. ROBBINS:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- introduced at trial?


MR. ROBBINS:  I -- I think you've put it exactly


right.  It has some antecedent application.  That is to


say, it applies prior to the moment at which it's actually


violated.  The premise is we need to ensure against -- in


a way it's a prophylactic protection much like Miranda is. 


That is to say, we will let you assert it in what is 

concededly, for example, a civil litigation setting, a


simple deposition.  No one would suggest that that is a


use in a criminal case.  But we allow you to assert it


because if we didn't, it would compromise your ability to


ensure that the right is protected later.


QUESTION:  Well, suppose in a civil case, the


judge orders the witness confined to custody until he


testifies in violation of what we can say in common


parlance is his Fifth Amendment right to self-


incrimination.  Is that not a violation then and there

to -- to confine the -- the defendant until he testifies?


MR. ROBBINS:  I think it is consistent with a


body of well -- well-developed law that to penalize


someone, particularly through that kind of a sanction, for


the assertion of a right is in the nature of a -- sort of


an unconstitutional condition.  And there's a well-


established body of law that says --


QUESTION:  I -- I don't know that we usually


talk about a violation as an unconstitutional condition. 


We -- we would say, Your Honor, I want my client released


because you are violating his Fifth Amendment rights.


MR. ROBBINS:  But I -- I --


QUESTION:  And I think in a very realistic --


real sense you are. 


MR. ROBBINS:  Yes. 


I -- I think there is a body 

of case law that says that if you are punished for the


assertion of a right, then under the Constitution you can


be relieved of that coercion. 


However -- but let me be clear -- the actual


violation of the Fifth Amendment is exactly what the text


of the Fifth Amendment says.  It says that your right is


not to be a witness against yourself in a criminal case. 


I suggest, Justice Kennedy, that the result -- that the


holding in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission is


inexplicable if you believe, as the Ninth Circuit does,

that it is sufficient simply to coerce an otherwise


incriminating statement because in Murphy against the


Waterfront Commission, the holding of that case is that


the State court was correct in requiring the witness to


testify even though there wasn't a statute that protected


him against incrimination because the Fifth Amendment


itself provides the fail-safe that if you are coerced into


giving an otherwise incriminating statement, it cannot be


used against you. 


And my central submission on the Fifth Amendment


point -- and of course, this is before we even get to the


question whether Office Chavez could have -- you know, has


qualified immunity.  Our central submission on this is


that you don't even have to get to that point because the


fail-safe of the Fifth Amendment ensures that 

Mr. Martinez's statements could not be used against him in


a criminal case if they were indeed legally compelled --


QUESTION:  What -- what in your opinion in the


Constitution prevents a policeman from going and beating


up a witness? 


MR. ROBBINS:  The Fourteenth Amendment. 


QUESTION:  So, the Fourteenth Amendment means


that you could -- in other words, your -- your client


could have violated the Fourteenth Amendment if -- other


things being equal --

 MR. ROBBINS:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- because he was a witness.  He gets


at least -- at least the suspect --


MR. ROBBINS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- gets the same pre-trial protection


as a witness would, and the Fourteenth Amendment prevents


coercion being used against a witness who doesn't want to


testify.


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, let's be clear.  It doesn't


prevent all coercion.  It prevents a subset of coercion


that shocks the conscience for purposes of the -- the


substantive component of due process.


QUESTION:  The substantive due process. 


MR. ROBBINS:  Yes, Justice O'Connor.  That's


correct. 


But -- but I think it is important that we not


torture the language of the Fifth Amendment to accommodate


the worry that police officers will torture witnesses


because that concern is completely -- can be completely


accommodated, and routinely is in the courts of appeals,


under the aegis of the --


QUESTION:  You're not saying -- those things


that would violate the Fifth Amendment weren't introduced


into trial do violate the Fourteenth Amendment for the


similar reasons.

MR. ROBBINS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- that those things -- you could say


that. 


MR. ROBBINS:  Yes.  You -- you could say --


QUESTION:  All right.  Then why didn't he


violate the Fourteenth Amendment? 


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, he -- well, again, let me --


I -- I  want to answer that, but I -- I -- because this is


a qualified immunity case, I always want to drop the


footnote that we have an extra layer of protection here


arising from the fact that none of these propositions


could have been -- none of the propositions adverse to us


could plausibly be said to be clearly established within 

the right sense of the term. 


Getting to your question, Justice Breyer, he did


not violate the substantive component of the Due Process


Clause because that inquiry turns on a set of concerns,


including did the acts shock the conscience.  Were they


committed with the intent to harm the witness in the sense


required by Sacramento against Lewis? 


The failure of the Ninth Circuit in this case


with respect to the substantive due process analysis was


that it thought that any interrogation which would render

a statement involuntary and therefore inadmissible at


trial must, therefore, give rise to a freestanding


substantive due process claim, actionable and enforceable


under section 1983.  That's just wrong. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Robbins, going back to the Fifth


Amendment self-incrimination privilege, I take it the


thrust of your argument is that a police officer who fails


to give Miranda warnings quite deliberately, doesn't say


you have a right to remain silent, doesn't say any of the


rest of it, never commits a violation of 1983 unless and


until there's attempt to use the information in court.  So


you can say, police officer, you're not required to give


Miranda warnings if we're not going to use this testimony


in court.


MR. ROBBINS: 


I am saying -- I think the answer 

to that is yes.  The -- the --


QUESTION:  So that the Miranda is -- is not an


obligation of the police officer. 


MR. ROBBINS:  I -- I respectfully beg to differ,


and I -- I also think -- I must say, given the prominence


of the Miranda discussion in the respondent's brief and in


the green -- green brief supporting respondent, I believe


the Miranda concerns in this case are an utter red


herring, and let me say why.


The sanction for the violation of Miranda is, in

fact, that the statements taken in violation of Miranda


cannot be used in the direct case of the government. 


That's the penalty for Miranda, and if that happens, you


get the statement struck in the direct case for the


government. 


QUESTION:  But there -- you're saying there is


no 1983 penalty.  The penalty is you can't --


MR. ROBBINS:  I -- I think there is no 1983


penalty, but the suggestion that as a consequence, because


you don't have a freestanding section 1983 claim when the


evidence never comes in, when the statement is never


offered, the suggestion that that is therefore going to


be -- send a signal to police officers that they should


violate Miranda, you know, at their -- at their discretion


I think is terribly mistaken, and for a very important 

reason and it's this:  If you don't give Miranda warnings,


you run a serious risk that the failure to give those


warnings will be taken as part of the calculus under the


Fifth Amendment voluntariness inquiry.  And a statement


which is involuntary for Fifth Amendment purposes is


unusable for any purpose at all, direct case, impeachment,


derivative use.  The government then has to put on a


Kastigar hearing to show that all of its evidence was


independently derived, which is, as the Court said in


Kastigar, a heavy burden for the government to meet.

 It is a fool's errand I suggest, Justice


Ginsburg -- a fool's errand -- to go about deliberately


violating Miranda simply because the violation will not


cause -- give rise to a section 1983 violation. 


QUESTION:  I -- I just have to tell you, I -- I


can see your -- your point on Miranda.  Miranda is an


exclusionary rule.  But I'm not sure that all of the Fifth


Amendment is -- is treated in that way because of the


questions we've initially covered.


MR. ROBBINS:  Well --


QUESTION:  If -- if you beat the defendant to


get the defendant -- to get the confession, it seems to me


there's a very strong argument that that is a Fifth


Amendment violation --


MR. ROBBINS:  I think --


QUESTION:  -- A Self-incrimination Clause


violation.


MR. ROBBINS:  I think -- respectfully, Justice


Kennedy, I think there is a wealth of this Court -- this


Court's cases that cannot be reconciled with the


proposition that coercing a statement is enough by itself


to constitute a Fifth Amendment violation.


QUESTION:  All right.  You -- I think you could


say after -- after 30 years or 50 years of -- of


jurisprudence, policemen know they're not supposed to beat

up suspects or the -- the equivalent.  And -- and you can


say, all right, at this point, I would think that does


shock the conscience for a policeman to beat a confession


out of somebody, and so I don't care if you call it


Fourteenth or Fifth. 


But then the question here would be, why in


heaven's name, when the person is undergoing serious pain,


or he thinks he's dying, where the doctors are saying, get


out of here, et cetera, whatever they're saying, and he


continues to press and then says, well, you're going to


get your treatment after you confess -- not confess --


after -- after you answer my question.  What were you


doing?  Then we'll treat you.  He says, you want your


treatment, you'd better -- you better say something,


et cetera, et cetera. 


Why isn't that the equivalent of 

beating somebody up?


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, let me attempt, if -- if I


might, Justice Breyer, to -- to very quickly answer


Justice Kennedy's question.  I -- I think the belief that


the Ninth Circuit held that it's enough under the Fifth


Amendment simply to coerce a statement that would


otherwise be incriminating cannot be reconciled with


Murphy and with the -- with Balsys, with the immunity


cases, with all the cases that stand for the proposition


that so long as the use immunity has not been compromised,

you do not yet have a substantive Fifth Amendment


violation.


To turn, Justice Breyer, to your question, I


acknowledge that there is coercion in this case.  We


don't -- we don't blanch on that.  There was coercion and


the facts of this case are tragic, but the -- but the


reality is this.  This officer was there to find out a


very important piece of information under extraordinarily


exigent circumstances. 


QUESTION:  Well, was this tried below with a


Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim?


MR. ROBBINS:  I don't know that it was


denominated substantive due process.  I think --


QUESTION:  Is that in the case? 


MR. ROBBINS:  I --


QUESTION:  I mean, is it open to resolution on


that basis? 


MR. ROBBINS:  There's -- there's no question


that the Ninth Circuit decided a Fourteenth Amendment due


process question.  I don't think they -- they labeled it


substantive versus procedure.  And indeed, as we


suggest --


QUESTION:  Well, if --


MR. ROBBINS:  -- they conflated the two.


QUESTION:  -- if -- if we think the facts here

show sufficient coercion to rise to the level of a


violation of substantive due process under the Fourteenth


Amendment, should the judgment be affirmed --


MR. ROBBINS:  No. 


QUESTION:  -- but on a different basis?


MR. ROBBINS:  The judgment must be reversed,


first, because there is not even a suggestion that the


intent to harm requirement under Sacramento against Lewis


has been satisfied.  And under this -- in this kind of a


case, you cannot have a substantive due -- due process


violation without that.  No one before you today has


argued that that Sacramento against Lewis --


QUESTION:  What is -- what is the source of the


substantive -- of the intentional harm requirement? 


MR. ROBBINS: 


Is that -- the source I -- I 

suggest is the -- the principles this Court articulated in


Sacramento against Lewis for police conduct that's taken


in enormous haste where -- where there is not the


opportunity for a second chance.


But let me go -- there's a terribly important


thing, Justice O'Connor, I have not yet gotten to say in


answer to your question.  The further and perhaps most


fundamental reason why it would be a mistake, I


respectfully suggest, to affirm this judgment, even on the


due process argument, is that this is a qualified immunity

case.  So you must conclude not only that on balance this


rises to the shock-the-conscience standard, but that it


does so with such remarkable clarity that it must have


been surely apparent to this officer that he was violating


that standard.  You cannot find that on this record. 


The Ninth Circuit thought so because of Mincey,


which is a fair trial and admissibility of evidence case,


not a freestanding substantive due process case and which


had all manner of important differences from the facts of


this case, including an absence -- a total absence -- of


exigency.


With the Court's permission --


QUESTION:  Exigency.  May I ask you a question


about that?  You said the man was dying.  This was the


only -- only chance. 


But there was an eyewitness, Flores, 

to this entire thing.  Why wasn't it enough for the


police, if they wanted some view other than the police


officers who engaged in the -- in the shooting, just to


interview Flores? 


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, I -- I think the record


suggests that he was not a completely clear -- did not


have a completely clear view of the facts.  But he's just


one witness.  This is the man who was there.


QUESTION:  Wouldn't he be a lot clearer than a


man who -- who is -- who has been blinded, who has -- was

paralyzed, who's under heavy medication?


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, he -- he was the most


important non-police witness to these events, and I


suggest that the officer would have been derelict not to


have found out what happened from him, which is what he


was trying to do. 


And with the Court's permission, I'd like to


reserve the balance of my time. 


QUESTION:  Yes, you may do so, Mr. Robbins.


Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and


may it please the Court:


The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-


incrimination safeguards the integrity of the criminal


trial process and ensures that an individual is not


convicted on the basis of a coerced confession. 


But the privilege against self-incrimination is


not a direct limit on the primary conduct of the law


enforcement officers.  This is not to say that there are


no substantive constitutional limits on what law officers


may do to obtain information or to secure a confession.


But those limits are to be found in the Fourth Amendment

and in the law of substantive due process, not in the


Fifth Amendment self-incrimination privilege --


QUESTION:  So beating a prisoner to compel a --


a statement is not a Fifth Amendment violation.


MR. CLEMENT:  That's right, Justice Kennedy. 


It's not a Fifth Amendment violation.  It very well might


be --


QUESTION:  But it could be a Fourteenth


Amendment violation. 


MR. CLEMENT:  It very well -- Justice O'Connor,


it very well could be a Fourteenth --


QUESTION:  And very likely would be. 


Is there some intent element in that for the


shocks-the-conscience --


MR. CLEMENT: 


Well, I think generally, at least 

as I understand this Court's decision in -- in Sacramento


against Lewis, in these kind of executive action contexts


where things are ongoing, I think there is some kind of


intent element.  I think that --


QUESTION:  It's not enough, you think, to find


that the officer should have known that you couldn't ask


questions in the manner that was done here under these


circumstances, and that to proceed gives rise to an


inference of intent.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'm not sure how intent

would need to be proven in any particular case, but I


would say the critical difference between the Fifth


Amendment inquiry and the Fourteenth Amendment inquiry,


when it's -- when it's done in the context of the


admissibility of a coerced confession, is in that context,


what the courts are taking into account is the effect on


the integrity of the trial process of using a coerced


confession. 


It's a different calculus, though, when you're


trying to regulate primary law enforcement conduct because


it strikes me that not everything that a law enforcement


officer could do to coerce a confession -- there -- there


may be some acts that may be sufficiently problematic that


you'd certainly want to keep the confession out of the


trial.


QUESTION:  What about the order of a trial judge


in a civil case who orders the witness held in contempt


and confined unless he testifies, and -- and there's a


valid Fifth Amendment privilege that the judge is


overlooking?  No Fifth Amendment violation there?


MR. CLEMENT:  No.  I don't think there's a Fifth


Amendment -- I don't think there's a complete Fifth


Amendment violation.  The courts intervene there to


protect the privilege. 


QUESTION:  So, if you go in and you want a writ

of habeas corpus and you don't mention the Fifth


Amendment. 


MR. CLEMENT:  You mention the Fifth Amendment,


but I think the important thing is the Fifth Amendment in


this context works a -- a bit like the takings clause. 


And Justice Souter, for the opinion for the Court in


Balsys, noted that the self-incrimination privilege is


unusual because it's not purely and simply binding on the


government.  It doesn't say that in all contexts, the


government cannot coerce confessions.  What it says --


QUESTION:  Well, if there's a 1983 suit against


a judge in -- in this hypothetical case, what's -- what's


the violation?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, typically those cases have


been dealt with on -- on habeas. 


And what I would say 

is --


QUESTION:  Suppose it's a 1983 suit.


MR. CLEMENT:  If there's a 1983 suit in that


context, I actually don't think a 1983 suit would lie in


that context.


QUESTION:  Why wouldn't there be a 1983 suit


provided that -- and I think this is the assumption of


Justice Kennedy's question -- provided that the witness


had invoked the Fifth Amendment?  There would be a 1983


action there because that is one at least of two instances

in which we allow the Fifth Amendment to have an


application in anticipation.  We say if he raises it, and


they don't come forward with immunity, we're not going to


let this entire process go forward to no avail since


nothing can ever be admitted in evidence anyway.  The fact


is we -- the -- the rule allowing it to be raised in


anticipation I suppose would be the predicate for 1983


liability here.  That's not this case, but that -- that


would be true in the -- in the case of the -- the civil


example that Justice Kennedy gave, wouldn't it?


MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's a very good point,


Justice Souter, and the Court has also treated in the


penalty context --


QUESTION:  Well, is it good enough so that you


concede there would be 1983 liability there; i.e., that 

there would be a violation of the Fifth Amendment in that


case?


would --


MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think so, but I think it


QUESTION:  Not that good.


MR. CLEMENT:  -- at least be a better case.


But as I was trying to say --


QUESTION:  Is there any violation in the case


that I put, any constitutional violation?  I mean,


that's -- that's extraordinary.

 MR. CLEMENT:  There is a -- there is a --


there -- what there is is there is an ongoing interference


with the Fifth Amendment right that the courts will


vindicate, but there isn't a complete constitutional


violation.  And I think the critical distinction is that,


as -- as Justice Souter said for the Court in Balsys, the


privilege against self-incrimination is not purely and


simply binding on the government.  The government can


compel testimony in exchange for a valid grant of


immunity.  What it can't do is compel testimony and


attempt to use it in a criminal case.  And --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe the -- the point where it


would make a difference I guess -- nobody is talking about


weakening or overruling Miranda.  We have Miranda on the


books, and Miranda set some technical requirements.  You


have to give a warning.  Now, a failure to give a warning,


pure and simple, is not going to hurt anybody if that's


never used in trial, so there isn't 1983 damages, unless


you beat the person up.  Then there is.  And that comes


under the Fourteenth. 


But there are a set of cases where it will hurt


people.  The set of cases where it will hurt people is


where because they violated Miranda but didn't beat him


up, and got a statement, they kept him in jail.  That's


rather like the case Justice Kennedy's thinking of.  So

there he is in jail for a week or a month and he's been


hurt, all right. 


And the question I guess is -- it's really not


this case, but the question is, is there going to be a


1983 action in that kind of case?  And if you say it comes


under the Fifth Amendment, the answer is going to be yes. 


And if you say it comes under the Fourteenth Amendment,


the answer is going to be no.  I don't know if we


should -- it seems to me what we're going to decide in


this case is effectively going to decide that.


MR. CLEMENT:  No.  I don't think that's true. 


I think that, for one thing, if the person is imprisoned


on some basis, that may raise an independent Fourth


Amendment violation.  There may be other --


QUESTION: 


Then he goes under the Fourth, and he 

claims he's wrongly seized and imprisoned because they got


this statement out of him in violation of the Fifth. 


That's -- I mean, this is -- this is what's -- what's


worrying me is not so much this case, but what we're going


to write and the implications of it.


MR. CLEMENT:  And -- and I think that this Court


has already clarified in Balsys that what you need for a


self-incrimination violation is both the coercion of the


testimony and the use of it in a criminal case.


QUESTION:  But may I just interrupt,

Mr. Clement?  Supposing there's a witness, a reporter or


somebody, who claims a -- a privilege against divulging


information, and that -- and the court holds him in


contempt and locks him up for 30 days or something, and he


claims he -- his Fifth Amendment right was violated, you'd


say there's no Fifth Amendment violation.


MR. CLEMENT:  I would say there's no -- there's


no damages action.  Of course, he could get --


QUESTION:  So how could he get out of jail then?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, he could get a habeas action


to get out because the court would be granting relief --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I think --


MR. CLEMENT:  -- to protect the Fifth


Amendment --


QUESTION: 


With all respect, I think you're 

evading the point that there -- let's assume there's


damage.  He's -- he's locked up, as Justice Breyer says,


for 5 days for not testifying, and you say there's no


Fifth Amendment violation.  I can't understand that.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, in any event, let me just


say that the privilege works quite differently in the


custodial context.  The reason that hypo even comes up is


that in the context of a civil trial, the individual has


to raise the -- the Self-incrimination Clause themselves. 


And we have a different rule that operates in the context


24

of police custodial interrogation.  In that context, the


privilege is self-executing.  The individual doesn't have


to raise it. 


And -- as -- the other thing that's different


about the custodial context is that in the custodial


context, this Court has not insisted on a pre-testimony


grant of immunity.  They've always held that the


exclusionary rules prevent a constitutional violation from


occurring.


And if I could resort to the analogy to the


takings clause.  In that context, it's not enough for the


government to take property.  It's only a constitutional


violation if the -- if the government simultaneously takes


property and refuses to grant just compensation.  In the


same way, there's no self --


QUESTION:  But are you saying that -- to go back


to a question that was asked earlier, that if there -- if


the police just take somebody into custody and beat him up


in order to get -- get him to talk with no intention of


using the evidence at all -- they're just trying to


investigate a crime -- is there any constitutional


protection against that kind of conduct?


MR. CLEMENT:  Yes, and it's the substantive due


process protection. 


QUESTION:  Okay.

 MR. CLEMENT:  And I think to get back to that


point, what's important is in the context of trying to


protect the integrity of the criminal trial process, I


would think the courts would want to be quite careful


about what they let into evidence.  But in the context of


law enforcement officers, they're dealing with other


objectives than simply trying to get a confession to


secure a guilty verdict. 


QUESTION:  Well, on the facts of this case,


should it be analyzed then under the Fourteenth Amendment


for coercion --


MR. CLEMENT:  It --


QUESTION:  -- an activity that might violate the


Fourteenth Amendment? 


MR. CLEMENT: 


I think it should, Justice 

O'Connor, and I would respectfully suggest that that's


best done on remand --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. CLEMENT:  -- because, although there is a


due process argument in this case, it's nobody's fault


that in light of the -- the governing precedent in the


Ninth Circuit, the Cooper decision, that nobody thought


that they had to prove shocks-the-conscience, or any of


the factors relevant to a substantive due process inquiry. 


Again, that's not the way respondents briefed the case,

but one can hardly blame them for briefing the case they


did, given that the Ninth Circuit had held under Cooper


that as long as the conduct was sufficiently egregious to


have the evidence be inadmissible, therefore you have a


full substantive due process violation.  And I think


it's --


QUESTION:  And you disagree with Mr. Robbins who


said, but because of the qualified immunity, you wouldn't


send this back in any case.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I -- I don't really disagree


with him.  I think this Court could reach the qualified


immunity issue if it wanted to, but I think perhaps the


path of least resistance would be to just note that there


is a substantive due process limit, and that's something


that's best to be resolved on -- on remand. 

I think the important -- oh, sorry.


QUESTION:  That's all right.  You can make that


sentence, if you want to.


MR. CLEMENT:  No.

MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you very much.

Court:


I -- I would start with simply the simple


observation that the district court made a finding of fact


in this case at page -- it's 28a and 29 of the petition


for writ of certiorari in the -- in the appendix.  And it


goes directly to the issue of what we've been discussing


and that is the -- the intent. 


And just if I can back up a little bit


procedurally, in argument today, for the first time I


heard counsel say that they acknowledge there's no quarrel


that there was coercion in this case.  In the district


court, the entire argument was there was no coercion. 


At the court of appeals, the entire argument was there was


no coercion. 


At the court of appeals and the district court, 

the -- there was never a discussion or -- or even was the


case of Urquidez -- Verdugo Urquidez cited for the fact


of -- that this was -- the Fifth and the Fourteenth


Amendments were only a trial right.  Those issues are


being heard here for the first time.  They were briefed


for the first time in the opening brief.


Cert was granted in this case on whether there


was a violation of the Fifth Amendment, not -- the


Fourteenth Amendment wasn't even discussed on cert. 


So we've gone through this journey of ever-

changing theories of -- of liability in this case, but I


think we have to go back to the beginning.


The district court found at page 28, finally


defendants argued that Chavez was not attempting to


abridge the right against self-incrimination to -- to


exact -- extract self-inculpatory data or leads.  And the


court goes on to then describe what was argued by the


defense, that Mr. Chavez was there simply to find out what


happened. 


The court directly rejected that.


QUESTION:  Mr. Paz, I'm sorry.  I don't -- your


page 28 in the cert petition?


MR. PAZ:  It's 28a in the appendix of the -- of


the petition for cert, yes, Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  And where? 


I didn't -- I don't find 

it on that page.


MR. PAZ:  It starts at the -- at approximately


the -- the bottom of the page.


QUESTION:  "Finally defendants argue --"? 


MR. PAZ:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  I'm with you.


MR. PAZ:  Yes. 


So the district court carefully looked at the


evidence that had been presented, and the district court


decided the case really because the testimony of Chavez at

the time the tape recordings that he made on the day of


the incident and his deposition testimony -- he said


simply, I'm investigating the crime.  I was there to


investigate what -- the crime had been committed, the


crime of attempted murder on two police officers on the


theory that somehow or other this farm worker had taken


away the officer's gun and was going to use it on the


officers when they shot him.  That was the core of the


case.  That was all of the evidence in the case. 


The subsequent declarations that were submitted


were only submitted after -- after Mr. Martinez submitted


a motion for summary judgment that as a matter of law,


using all of the evidence provided by the defense and


giving them the benefit of the doubt on all the evidence,


that there was a violation of the Fifth and the Fourteenth 

Amendment. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Paz, let me -- let me tell you


why I have difficulty with the proposition which you're


urging, which is that any coercion that would suffice to


require the confession to be excluded from -- from trial


is also a coercion that violates the Fifth Amendment,


not -- leaving substantive due process aside. 


Suppose you have a situation in which a --


a felon has taken a hostage and buried the hostage


somewhere, and suppose that it is possible for the police

official to use a degree of coercion which would not shock


the conscience.  It isn't beating the person with a rubber


hose, but let's say failing to give a Miranda warning, or


using a -- a sort of trickery that -- that would amount to


coercion, threatening perhaps, you know, if you don't


confess, your brother will be prosecuted or something like


that.  It would be sufficient to exclude the testimony


from the confession from the trial, but the policeman


doesn't care about that.  He wants to save the life of


the -- of the hostage who's been -- who's been buried. 


Now, you would say that that -- that policeman


by extracting that confession has violated the Fifth


Amendment. 


MR. PAZ:  There may be a violation, and -- and I


would agree that most likely if -- if it was in violation 

of Miranda, there would be -- there would be no -- it


would not be admitted into a criminal case.  Maybe -- it


may be under the Quarles exception. 


QUESTION:  What -- you'd say that the person


would -- would have a -- a 1983 action against the


policeman? 


MR. PAZ:  No.  No, I think clearly that's the


kind of a case in which qualified immunity was designed to


prevent.  Qualified immunity gives as -- as it did in --


in --

time.


MR. PAZ:  Then -- then clearly --


QUESTION:  You have to answer Justice Scalia's


question.  You can't get away on qualified immunity.


MR. PAZ:  Oh, no, no.  I would say --


(Laughter.) 


MR. PAZ:  I -- I would say Quarles gives us the


direction.  When there is an immediate danger, when


there's a danger to the public, then clearly there would


be no constitutional violation.  The Court has already


made that decision.  I -- I don't think that that's really


an issue that we have to struggle with. 

QUESTION:  You can violate the Fifth Amendment


when there's a danger to the public?


MR. PAZ:  That's what Quarles, I believe, says. 


Quarles says that -- that the Miranda violation was not --


was not sufficient.  And I -- as I -- as I recall in


Quarles, the evidence was admitted against him.  He -- he


said, the gun is over there, and that evidence came in to


prove the violation of -- of possession of a weapon.  So I


think that the Court implicitly said that we're -- in this


emergency situation, that there is no -- no Fifth

Amendment --


QUESTION:  You -- you think this applies not


only to the -- the unique aspect of the Fifth Amendment


that -- that Miranda constitutes, but to all Fifth


Amendment violations.


MR. PAZ:  No.  What I -- I think once it becomes


coercive, once it becomes physical, once it becomes --


then I think that you would interfere with the core values


of -- of the Fifth Amendment. 


QUESTION:  Justice Scalia's hypothetical asked


about coercion.  There was no coercion in Quarles.  There


was just an absence of Miranda warning. 


Forget Miranda.  Let's just talk about coercion. 


Is there a Fifth Amendment violation in the case that he


put where there was -- there's an element -- there's a --

there's a degree of coercion?  There's no Miranda warning.


That's out of the case.  There's no sovereign -- qualified


immunity.  That's out of the case.


QUESTION:  Coercion to keep it out of trial.


MR. PAZ:  I -- I would say yes that there is a


Fifth Amendment violation.  The question then would be,


what is the remedy?


Under those --

suit when he's in prison suing the -- suing the policeman.


MR. PAZ:  And I don't believe that's -- that


would be the conclusion because the remedy would not be


appropriate because there had been, as we saw in -- in


Saucier versus Katz, there's a situation in which the


police have to act, and so the police act if it's


reasonable, even if it's a reasonable mistake, even if


they have the wrong guy and they try to coerce the wrong


person, it may be reasonable under an emergency


circumstance. 


QUESTION:  I see.  So let's assume somebody


is -- you think he's going to blow up the World Trade


Center.  I suppose if -- if we have this necessity -- this


necessity exception, you -- you could beat him with a


rubber hose.


MR. PAZ:  I would hope not, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Oh, it's necessary. 


MR. PAZ:  No.  I think --


QUESTION:  Since when is -- is necessity a --


you know, a justification for ignoring the Fifth

Amendment? 


MR. PAZ:  Your Honor, only in the limited


situation.  I think the first hypothetical you gave me --


gave us was you simply were going to ask him questions


repeatedly.  Now, I -- I don't think the rubber hose


example was before me.


QUESTION:  Do you know -- okay.  Do you know any


of our -- any of our cases that -- other than Miranda


which, you know, is -- is in a field by itself, do you


know any of our cases that say that there is a necessity


exception to the coercion prohibition of the Fifth


Amendment? 


MR. PAZ:  Not at all, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  So maybe the answer would be that --


that it's not -- the Fifth Amendment -- the -- the Miranda 

rules are methods of enforcing the Fifth Amendment so that


if all is violated in -- in Justice Scalia's hypothetical


is a Miranda rule and the person is not proceeded against


in court and the person has not been physically injured in


any way and has not suffered any real harm except not


being read a right that didn't matter anyway, he would


have no damages.


MR. PAZ:  That would be correct.


QUESTION:  So he could bring his lawsuit, but


he'd gain nothing.

 MR. PAZ:  I would agree with that analysis. 


QUESTION:  Except that my hypothetical was not


Miranda.  My hypothetical was that he was coerced in some


fashion other than the failure to give a Miranda warning,


and short of beating with a rubber hose.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. PAZ:  The distinct -- the distinct


difference in this case is -- and I understand that the


exigence is -- the exigent -- the -- the terrorist


situation is a difficult one.  It's not our case. 


Mr. Martinez was riding a bicycle home. 


QUESTION:  It's not your case.  That's right. 


MR. PAZ:  There was no call.  There was no


crime.  There was nothing that had happened except he was


riding his bicycle home. 


So we really can't -- I don't 

think that this is an appropriate vehicle.  There may be


such a case that will at some time --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe this is a Fourteenth


Amendment case, not a Fifth Amendment case at all.


MR. PAZ:  I did -- I did consider that.  And --


and I think clearly it is a Fourteenth Amendment violation


under all the cases --


QUESTION:  Was it tried on that basis --


MR. PAZ:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- presented on that basis?

 MR. PAZ:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, it was.  It


was -- it was -- that was the allegations from -- from the


beginning.  But -- but --


QUESTION:  I don't see why the Fourteenth.  I


mean, the Fourteenth -- the Fifth applies to the States


because it's incorporated in the Fourteenth.


MR. PAZ:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  And -- and therefore, if in fact you


violate the Fifth in -- in a way that's significant, not


just -- I mean, causes significant harm, not just you


didn't read a Miranda right, but you hurt somebody, then


why wouldn't the Fourteenth carry that through to the --


QUESTION:  By way of the Fourth Amendment. 


MR. PAZ:  Yes.  I believe it does.  I believe


the history -- and the history -- the early cases, the --

the Bram case in 1897 began with the concept of the -- of


the Fifth Amendment protecting all of the rights.  And of


course, Bram was a case in which -- it was against the


United States. 


But as -- as -- there's an evolution that


I've -- I've seen through our cases that -- that show that


the Fourteenth Amendment, once it was incorporated, it


actually incorporated the Fifth Amendment privileges.  It


actually -- the Fifth Amendment was really the -- the core


values of what the Constitution meant to embody.  It goes

back to -- Bram cites the early -- early cases in England


where, although the right against self-incrimination was


an evidentiary rule, in Bram they -- they laud the fact


that it became a constitutional rule, that it became


immutable so that no act of Congress -- as we decided in


Dickerson not too long ago, no act of Congress could


change that.  So --


QUESTION:  But isn't it clear by now in our


cases that if a policeman uses excessive force that rises


to the level of a Fourth Amendment violation, that we will


address it under that amendment, that the Fifth Amendment,


the language of it refers to use in trial of the


testimony?  And -- and you don't have that limitation --


MR. PAZ:  I would --


QUESTION: 


-- under a substantive due process 

claim. 


MR. PAZ:  I would disagree with you on one


point, and that is the -- the language of the amendment


talks about a criminal case, and in our brief, we did talk


about the meaning, the distinction between a criminal


trial and a criminal case.  And all of the -- all of the


language -- the most recent is in Hubbell.  There's the


discussion about the fact that the Fifth Amendment


covers -- the values of the Fifth Amendment covers


everything from civil to administrative to bankruptcy

cases.  The Arnstein case in 1923 talked about the Fifth


Amendment protecting a bankrupt person in a bankruptcy


proceeding, not even involving a criminal proceeding at


all.  So the extension of the Fifth Amendment goes to


really the core values.  We just don't force people to


talk, and the State can't do it.  And --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  I -- you -- you mean --


you say it extends to a bankruptcy proceeding.  You mean


you can refuse to provide testimony that can be used


against you in a bankruptcy proceeding?


MR. PAZ:  That was the holding in Arnstein in --


in 1923, and a bankrupt person who was under the


bankruptcy proceeding simply said, I have a right to


remain silent.  I don't want to answer these questions. 


The court upheld that right in the bankruptcy proceeding. 

So early law certainly didn't -- didn't say it had --


QUESTION:  Simply because he didn't want to


answer the questions, or because --


MR. PAZ:  They may --


QUESTION:  -- the -- the questions would


incriminate him --


MR. PAZ:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  -- in a criminal proceeding. 


MR. PAZ:  That's correct.

 MR. PAZ:  But -- but there was no criminal


proceeding --


QUESTION:  Well -- yes.  There wasn't any yet


pending.  I mean, I think we all understand that you --


that you acquire some pre-trial Fifth Amendment rights


to -- to remain silent, but whether that means that there


has been a Fifth Amendment violation before the entrance


is -- evidence is introduced in trial is -- is a separate


question. 


MR. PAZ:  I --


QUESTION:  Nobody questions that -- that there


are some aspects of our Fifth Amendment law which -- which


allow you to plead the Fifth Amendment before the evidence


has been introduced in trial.


MR. PAZ: 


And -- and once the -- the right has 

been given to the -- to the American people to plead the


Fifth Amendment in any pre-trial proceeding, including


an -- an interrogation at -- after a -- after a shooting


such as this, and after the person is the sole suspect of


a horrible crime, then obviously that is part of the


criminal case.  That is part of the entire criminal


process. 


If we would say we only have a Fifth Amendment


right to remain silent if we introduce it into a court --


into a court proceeding, then Mr. -- persons like

Mr. Martinez who were never charged with a crime would


have no remedy.


QUESTION:  But it doesn't have to be part of the


criminal case.  I mean, as -- as your bankruptcy example


indicates. 


MR. PAZ:  I agree.  I agree, Justice Scalia.


I think it's important that we try to focus on


what really are the bright lines here.  We have three


bright lines that were violated by -- by Sergeant Chavez


in this case.  The first is clearly coercion that goes


back to -- to the early cases. 


The second bright line is that there was --


there was an invocation in this case.  Mr. Martinez twice


said, I don't want to talk.  Leave me alone until they


give me medical treatment.


There was invocations implicitly.  When he first


opened his mouth, he says, leave me alone.  Leave me


alone.  I'm dying.  Those are the first words out of his


mouth.  That's an invocation.  No reasonable police


officer, no -- no basically trained police officer could


believe that questioning a fellow in his condition was


permissible.


QUESTION:  This -- this question is somewhat


like Justice Scalia's question.  Suppose the same facts so


far as the hospital was concerned, but that the -- that

the incident involved a kidnapping and the injured person,


your client, was a witness to the kidnapping.  We wanted


to know what the kidnapper looked like so we could get the


child back. 


MR. PAZ:  Then it's clearly -- he's not a


suspect.  Clearly, it -- questioning is -- is obviously


needed.  It's necessary.  Of course.  But -- but --


QUESTION:  Well, if -- if the questioning -- and


suppose he says, go away, I'm sick, I'm sick.  And they


said, no, no, we want your answer.  Why is there coercion


in -- no coercion in that case --


MR. PAZ:  Because he's --


QUESTION:  -- but coercion in your case? 


MR. PAZ:  Because he's not a suspect.  Because


he's -- he isn't the sole --


QUESTION:  But that's -- that's a Miranda


question. 


MR. PAZ:  I think not. 


QUESTION:  And -- and it's a -- well, it's also


a basic Fifth Amendment question. 


MR. PAZ:  It is. 


QUESTION:  But why isn't -- why isn't the


element of coercion the same in each case?


MR. PAZ:  Because the -- the constitutional


obligation.  When the person is a suspect, the

constitutional obligation rises above.  That's the


difference. 


QUESTION:  Well, that -- for purposes of a


damage action, not for purposes of Miranda, or what's


admissible.  But for purposes of a Miranda action, should


a suspect be in a better position than a totally innocent


witness insofar as the police beating him up is concerned?


MR. PAZ:  No, I would think not. 


QUESTION:  No.  All right.  Well, if they're --


if they're the same, then I -- I guess it would be --


you'd get to the same result.  If they had beaten him up


or been coercive, it should be the same problem whether


he's the witness or the suspect.  And if they've gone past


whatever point is reasonable, I guess there should be


damages. 


And if they're doing it for a good reason 

because they want to stop an attack or something, well,


that's just the way it is.  And -- and that's -- I'm


trying to figure out if that's what the law is and what


the right words are to get to that place and how you deal


with this mass of -- of constitutional rules, if -- if


that's the proper result. 


MR. PAZ:  I think the proper result is -- is


given -- given Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, the proper


result is if this is a -- a witness who has information


about some exigent circumstance, then there -- the Fifth

Amendment doesn't attach at all.  And obviously the


officer is not going to use leading questions, coercive


questions to get information.  The basic concept of


getting information under those circumstances is you want


it to be trustworthy.  You don't want the officer putting


words into the person's mouth and brow-beating them to


come up with something that's a bad lead.  So obviously we


want to have the kind of questioning that would be, in


fact, seeking the truth as opposed to putting words into


someone's mouth as what occurred in this case. 


The -- I'd like to address a point that's been


raised, and -- and it may not be totally necessary.  I'd


just like to make the distinction that the -- the basis,


the entire heart of the discussion that coercion is


somehow permissible unless the cases are introduced into a 

criminal case or into a criminal trial are -- are the --


the immunity cases. 


In the immunity cases, they -- they -- I believe


that the defense has -- or that the petitioners have


totally confused the grant of immunity and coercion in a


public trial after a grant of immunity where a person is


told, you must answer the questions.  And -- and the


distinctions is one is an inquisitional situation where if


the officer has a person alone and they're forcing them to


answer questions, there is no public trial, there is no

judge there to make sure that they're -- they're not


being -- there is no overreaching, there is no brow-


beating.  The person who was even under a grant of


immunity can say, I'm not going to talk, and face the


consequences of going to jail and sit in jail with dignity


and say, I'm not going to talk.  I believe that it's more


important to assert my right not to speak than to be --


than -- than sitting in jail.  Our law still doesn't allow


the court or the jailers to use coercion to extract their


statement.  A person in this country still could have the


dignity to say I don't want to speak and I'll take the


punishment, and if it's just punishment, that it's been


done by a court, then that is not coercion, the kind of


inquisitional coercion that this -- that this Court and


the United States has always said we don't tolerate. 

Are there any other questions? 


QUESTION:  Going back to your earlier


distinction between the suspect and a witness, if someone


is suspected of kidnapping a child, and that child is not


going to live without some medication -- I believe this


example was brought up in one of the briefs -- and the


suspect, whatever answer, will certainly be incriminating,


the police may not exercise any coercion to get the


suspected kidnapper to tell where the child is so the


child could get life-saving medication?

 MR. PAZ:  I believe that there can be some


questioning, and I think that the questioning has to be --


even if it's forceful questioning, there must be limits. 


And it's -- certainly it's a balance because it has to


take into account what is the circumstance of this person.


The danger in saying I agree with that


hypothetical, Your Honor, is that what if the person is


the wrong person.  What if the suspect really isn't the


person who kidnapped the person?  What if they're just


wrong and they got the wrong person?  That's the danger,


and that's why we have to --


QUESTION:  And on the other side is -- is the


life of a child. 


MR. PAZ:  That's correct.  And it's -- it's


always a difficult choice, but we have -- we have to --

QUESTION:  -- it's difficult at all if they know


that this is the fellow that did the -- they have all


sorts of evidence.  They know this is the guy that -- that


buried the child, or deprived the child of medication or


whatever.  It's not a hard question at all.


MR. PAZ:  Then I think -- I think that there


is -- we have to look at Quarles for guidance and, again,


it has to be the degree of the -- the degree of coercion


that is permissible.  It's difficult to say that any


coercion is permissible.  But again, given -- with the

limited hypothetical and limited facts, it's -- it's


difficult to make a judgment at this point.


QUESTION:  Mr. Paz, what do you -- what do you


do with the Murphy case that's relied upon so extensively


by -- by Mr. Robbins?  As I understand that case, it was a


State legislative commission which accorded immunity to


the witness under State law, but of course could not


accord immunity under Federal law.  And we held that the


witness, nonetheless, had to testify, and we said, of


course, if the feds try to use the evidence, it will not


be admissible because it was -- it was obtained under


coercion.  But we, nonetheless, allowed the State to


compel the testimony.  Now, were we allowing a Fifth


Amendment violation?


MR. PAZ:  No, Your Honor. 


That -- that was, as 

I understood, that the -- the use immunity that was


granted in -- in Waterfront was extensive with the


privilege.  It was allowed -- that is, as I understand the


reading of the case, was that the privilege that -- that


the -- the immunity that was granted was sufficient to


cover both any State prosecution as well as Federal


prosecution.


QUESTION:  No, no, no.  That wasn't the case. 


That was the whole problem.  The State could not grant


immunity from Federal prosecution.  It -- it granted

immunity only from State prosecution.  And we said,


nonetheless, the State could -- could lock the person up


until he testified.  And the only consequence would be


that if he did testify, it would not be introducible in


Federal trial because it -- it had been coerced.


Now, I -- you know, it's a bizarre case, but it


does seem to stand for the principle that Mr. Robbins


asserts, which is that there's no Fifth Amendment


violation until the evidence is introduced.


MR. PAZ:  We all make mistakes, Your Honor. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  You think -- you think that was one


of our mistakes. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION: 


Did you -- did you come up anywhere 

in your -- in your research on this with anything that


suggests that -- that once the person is a suspect, and


once he's in custody of the police, that the criminal case


has begun?


MR. PAZ:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Or is it clear that that isn't?  Is


it clear that the criminal case that the Constitution


refers to is -- is not really begun until it's what we'd


call technically is a criminal case, the filing, you know,


indictment, or -- et cetera?

 MR. PAZ:  I -- I think there was good language


in -- in Colorado versus Connelly.  Justice O'Connor wrote


a concurring opinion I think that covers the point quite


well that said that -- and there was also the --


QUESTION:  It says that -- what?  That the


criminal case had begun at the time he was in custody?


MR. PAZ:  As I recall, the -- the discussion was


that there had been an argument that the -- that Mosley's


statement -- that that by using Mosley's statement,


because there had been no police coercion, that it was


permissible because the purpose of the -- of the rights,


the Fifth Amendment, was to prevent police misconduct and


coercion.  And -- and in that context there was a -- there


was a discussion about -- that the -- that the -- that


there was -- that because the rights protect outside of 

the criminal case and outside of the trial, that there was


no -- there would be no deterrence.  There would be no


reason to enforce it at that point. 


Also there was Michigan versus Tucker.  Both


Michigan and -- and Colorado versus Colony -- Connelly


both discuss about a two-part inquiry.  Should -- should


we -- and the Court indicates in both of those cases that


there's an analysis of whether the police officer conduct


violated the Fifth Amendment, and then secondly, what is


the remedy.  So really, those two cases talk about the

MR. ROBBINS:  Thank you, Mr. -- Justice Stevens.


Let me just quickly make a couple of points. 


It seems to me that petitioner can win this case


the hard way or the easy way.  The easy way is recognizing


that this body of law is, as one of the members said this 

morning, a complex of constitutional issues with cross


currents that cut in a variety of directions, that in


light of Verdugo Urquidez, in light of Sacramento against


Lewis, it cannot be said that any of these constitutional


principles was sufficiently clearly established to warrant


the rejection of qualified immunity.  But I want to win it


the hard way. 


First, because under Sacramento against Lewis,


the standard for substantive due process is intent to


harm.  That wasn't pled.  That wasn't tried.  There's no

such argument before you today.  No one thinks that if


Sacramento against Lewis applies, there can be a


substantive due process claim at all.  That's why it


wasn't in the complaint.  And no one here before you is


suggesting intent to harm. 


Now, on the Fifth Amendment, Justice Kennedy,


I'd like to take one more crack at the concern that you've


articulated because I think it is -- it is in fact


possible to square those concerns with the holding in


Murphy against Waterfront Commission which, as far as I


can tell, is perfectly good law and consistent with what


this Court said in footnote 8 of Balsys about the fail-


safe of use immunity provided directly by the Fifth


Amendment.  So long as the government has not compromised


the availability of use immunity under the Fifth 

Amendment, there hasn't been a Fifth Amendment violation.


In each of the penalty cases that are suggested


by your hypothetical, that's what the government has done. 


They have said to the witness, you may not have immunity. 


You may not assert your Fifth Amendment.  If you assert


your Fifth Amendment right, we're going to put you in


lock-up right now.  The Court has consistently said, you


know, if you forfeit the use immunity and actually put a


guy in jail because he insists on it, that's as good as


use.  That's a protection that stems from the Fifth

Amendment itself. 


And that's -- that explains all of the so-called


penalty cases.  The police -- the Garrity case in New


Jersey, the two Lefkowitz cases out of New York.  That


explains -- what is, in fact, going on there is someone is


being punished or penalized for the assertion of a


privilege, including the right against use. 


But as long as the fail-safe in the words --


Justice Souter, that you used in -- in footnote 8 of


Balsys, as long as the fail-safe of use immunity has not


been compromised, as it has not been in this case, there


is not yet a full Fifth Amendment violation, which can


only happen when there's a use in a criminal case. 


And that is exactly the point that this Court in


Verdugo Urquidez said in the passage that the Ninth 

Circuit decided to call dictum and ignore.  That was a big


mistake.  And on that ground alone, it's the Fifth


Amendment portion of its decision --


QUESTION:  But, Mr. Robbins, why couldn't -- why


couldn't --


MR. ROBBINS:  -- that should be reversed at the


first threshold.


QUESTION:  Why couldn't you view the continued


questioning under the circumstances of this case as


tantamount to punishment when you have locked somebody up

who won't answer questions? 


MR. ROBBINS:  Well, I -- I think because --


well, for one thing, the availability of use immunity is


still there.  What you -- what I think it would -- what I


think -- what I think it would amount to is continued


coercion of a statement which arguably at some threshold,


once you cross it, does indeed become too coercive to


render the statement admissible.  But that's when the


Fifth Amendment fail-safe steps in and says, you may not


use it.  That would violate the Fifth Amendment.  But


because the fail-safe wasn't compromised in this case, as


it was in the line of cases suggested by Justice Kennedy's


hypothetical, there cannot be a Fifth Amendment, and we


don't even have to reach the question of qualified


immunity. 


JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you very much,


Mr. Robbins.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
