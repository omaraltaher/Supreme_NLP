JUSTICE STEVENS:  We'll hear argument in


Number 01-1325, Washington Legal Foundation against the


Legal Foundation of Washington. 


Mr. Fried, you may proceed when -- whenever


you're ready.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. FRIED:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may


it please the Court:


I wish to argue four propositions.  First, that


the interest in these IOLTA accounts is the private


property of Brown and Hayes, the clients.  Second, that it


was not regulated; it was taken. 


Third, that it has 

value.  And fourth, that an injunction or declaratory


relief is an appropriate and practicable form of relief in


this case. 


Now --


QUESTION:  Before you start, Mr. Fried, may I


ask you one broad question?  You don't agree, I take it,


with the conclusion of the dissent in the court of


appeals, which I don't think agreed with your fourth


point.


MR. FRIED:  No.  I think we are entitled to a

declaration, or to an -- or an injunction just as was


received in Eastern -- in Eastern Enterprises, just as was


received in Hodel v. Irving, just as was received in


Nollan and Dolan.  And in our -- in our complaint filed,


we asked for declaratory or injunctive relief, so I think


that is available, and it is a practical and proper form


of relief in this case. 


QUESTION:  The only point I was really want --


you -- you do not understand the dissenters in the Ninth


Circuit to have gone that far, though, do you? 


MR. FRIED:  How -- how far, Justice Stevens? 


QUESTION:  To have held that you're entitled to


injunctive relief.


MR. FRIED:  They did not go that far.  They --


no, they did not.  No, they did not. 


QUESTION:  In fact, they specifically said this


equitable relief would not enjoin takings, but would


simply stop Washington Supreme Court from requiring the


LPO's to comply with the IOLTA rules.


MR. FRIED:  Well, if the injunctive relief,


which we asked for -- and here in the -- the complaint, I


believe, is on page 100 of the -- 100 of the joint


appendix.  I think it's on -- no, I'm sorry.  It's -- yes,


in the -- in the joint appendix.  We ask specifically for


injunctive and declaratory relief in general.

 Now --


QUESTION:  Mr. Fried, what plaintiffs have


standing to ask for injunctive relief in this case?


MR. FRIED:  Certainly Brown and Hayes.  There's


a question whether Daugs and Maxwell do, but certain --


QUESTION:  But in the -- in the complaint was an


injunction sought on behalf of Brown and Hayes?


MR. FRIED:  Yes.  An injunction was sought in


general.  A general injunction was sought.  I'm sorry. 


I'm not putting my hand on the -- on the section in the


complaint, but --


QUESTION:  I -- I thought it read to the


contrary, that it was on behalf of the LPOs.


MR. FRIED:  It was on behalf of the LPOs, but


then finally -- yes.  Now I have it.  Thank you.  In the


joint appendix on page 30, we ask specifically that they


permanently enjoin the defendants.  This is paragraph 3. 


So we asked for that relief, yes.


QUESTION:  And -- and you ask for it now on


behalf of Brown and Hayes, not --


MR. FRIED:  We certainly do.


QUESTION:  -- on behalf of the foundation. 


MR. FRIED:  We -- we ask for it on behalf of any


and all parties in this case. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Fried, the question that Justice

Stevens raised, which I was then addressing, was not what


was in your complaint, but what was the position of the


dissenting judges in the Ninth Circuit.  And I read from


that dissent -- so you are clearly asking for something


that the dissenters did not say you would be entitled to


when they said --


MR. FRIED:  We are asking for more than the


dissenters would have given us.  That is correct, Justice


Ginsburg. 


QUESTION:  Yes.  They said the equitable relief


would not enjoin takings. 


MR. FRIED:  Yes.  We are asking for more than


that.  We are asking for it because it's very clear on


this Court's precedents that where compensatory relief


would be impracticable, or is not contemplated in the 

program, an injunction is -- is proper.  And this Court


has on numerous occasions in very similar cases granted


injunctive relief.


QUESTION:  You -- you mentioned your complaint,


and then we have this passage in the dissent.  When did


the idea of an injunction of the takings -- when was that


squarely presented to any court?  Because it would seem


that if you had presented it, that this is rather curious,


what we get in the dissent. 


MR. FRIED:  It's been presented throughout,

Justice Ginsburg, and in fact, in the Fifth Circuit case,


which is virtually identical to this case, not only was it


presented, but an injunction was granted.  And exactly the


injunction which we received --


QUESTION:  If you just could tell me at what


point you made it clear to the court that you were seeking


not what is described here, that is, that the -- that the


injunction would be addressed to the compliance of the


LPO's with the IOLTA rules.


MR. FRIED:  I think that the -- I submit,


Justice Ginsburg, that that paragraph, which I have read


to you, makes that clear.


QUESTION:  But that paragraph --


MR. FRIED:  And in the summary -- and I'm -- I'm


informed that it was also made clear in our summary 

judgment motion.  So that the courts were well aware, as


the complaint should have made them aware, but also were


well aware that we were seeking an injunction for all


parties in all respects.  And after all, that is precisely


the relief that was obtained in the Fifth Circuit case.


QUESTION:  Let -- let me see if I can help you


get to the other major parts of your case by asking this


question. 


In Loretto, could the property owners have


obtained an injunction against piercing the building for

the little antenna or the wire on the grounds that there


was no compensation?  I doubt it.  I would think the


government, after Loretto, would continue to be able to


poke the holes in -- in the wall -- or maybe I'm wrong --


even though compensation was negligible.  Could there have


been an injunction there, and if the answer is, well, no,


why can there be an injunction here?  And maybe that gets


you to the --


MR. FRIED:  They --


QUESTION:  -- the nature of the taking that


occurred in this case. 


MR. FRIED:  The -- I think that's exactly the


reason.  If there were an -- if there is compensation in


this case, exactly as the Court said in Eastern


Enterprises, it would -- in effect, compensation being 

dollar-for-dollar is the equivalent of shutting down the


program.  And that was the case in Webb's as well. 


I -- I might just mention, Justice Kennedy, that


the respondents throughout this case say that the Eastern


Enterprises case, which is very important to our


injunctive claim, was really only a plurality.  There was


not a majority for the Court.  I don't believe that the


fifth Justice, which was yourself, disagreed with the


remedy.


And indeed, the fifth Justice said that this was

not a takings case -- Eastern Enterprise -- because unlike


this very case we have, this was not the -- the -- you


said, rather the exaction is a forced contribution to


general government revenues.  I'm sorry.  I'm reading the


wrong -- I'm reading the wrong passage. 


In the Eastern -- Eastern Enterprises case, you


said that the reason -- the reason that you didn't think


that was a takings case was that a valuable interest in an


intangible or even a bank account or accrued interest,


which is, of course, this case, had not been appropriated. 


Well, this is a bank account and accrued interest --


QUESTION:  Well, what about my hypothetical on


Loretto?  I -- I take it Loretto establishes that there


was an invasion, a taking --


MR. FRIED:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- but let's -- let's assume that the


compensation was just so minimal it just really couldn't


be calculated.  It was 10 cents or something.  Could you


have had an injunction against installation of the


antennas in Loretto on the ground that the compensation


can't be figured?  I think not.  And if that's -- if my


conclusion is right about that, how is your case


different? 


MR. FRIED:  My -- our case is different because


in this case, as in Webb's, as in Eastern Associates, to

give compensation is to simply erase the program.  While


in the case where physical property is taken, to give


compensation still leaves it open to use that property


while -- where what you have is money and you must make


compensation for that, then to make compensation for a


dollar is to pay a dollar.  That's what the Court said in


Eastern Enterprises. 


QUESTION:  Why doesn't that just prove that you


have the wrong clause of the Constitution?  That is, your


clause of the Constitution, the one you're pushing, says,


nor shall private property be taken for public use without


just compensation.  Foreseeing that you can take the


property for public use, you just have to pay money for


it.  Just compensation. 


Now, if paying the just compensation can't work 

out, or it's too hard or, you know, the person doesn't


have enough of an interest to get anything, that doesn't


mean the government can't take it.  It just -- if there's


something wrong with it, it means that that that which is


wrong with it is that it violates the Due Process Clause,


not the Just Compensation Clause. 


MR. FRIED:  That would be correct if Webb's had


been a due process case, but it was not.  It was a takings


case.  And in Webb's, they didn't say you can take that


interest so long as you pay just compensation for it.

They say, you've got to stop.


QUESTION:  Then the rationale -- you'd say


even -- I mean, occasionally some case does have something


that's a little hard to follow, but the -- the theory that


that is consistent with the Just Compensation Clause,


rather than the Due Process Clause, is?


MR. FRIED:  That it makes no sense.  It's not


that it's hard to calculate.  We would be happy to argue


how you would calculate it.  The point is that to


calculate it and to pay the just compensation is to shut


down the program.  It makes no sense.  There's no program


left after you have paid just compensation.


QUESTION:  Yes, but if -- if it is shown -- and


I guess we don't know here because it hasn't been


determined. 


If it is shown that no compensation is due 

because it wouldn't have earned or produced anything, then


how is it a taking?  I mean, that's -- because the Takings


Clause refers to the taking without just compensation.  If


the compensation is 0, how is it a taking? 


MR. FRIED:  The compensation is not 0, and the


premise of the --


QUESTION:  If.  If it were, how -- how is it a


taking? 


MR. FRIED:  If it were.  But the --


QUESTION:  Well, then what is your answer?  Is

it a taking if the just compensation is 0?


MR. FRIED:  Yes.  It is a taking, but it is --


as the -- because this Court --


QUESTION:  How is it in -- in the language of


the clause? 


MR. FRIED:  Because this Court in Phillips has


held that economic -- that -- that there is private


property and it has value even though it has no realizable


economic value. 


But we do not concede that there is no economic


value here, and the fact that it could not have earned


interest --


QUESTION:  But that has not been determined, has


it?


MR. FRIED:  Yes, it has. 


It has been 

determined.  It has been determined and conceded by the


respondents that there is interest in this case of $5


and $2.  They go on to argue, ah, yes, but absent the


IOLTA program, that would not have been earned.  This


Court in Webb's specifically addressed that point and


said, we accept the proposition that apart from the


statute, Florida law does not require that interest be --


be earned on registered deposits.  So it was quite clear. 


This is just another version of --


QUESTION:  But weren't those gross figures

rather than net figures?  Those --


MR. FRIED:  Those are gross figures, yes,


Justice Stevens. 


QUESTION:  But can we assume, along with


Justice O'Connor's question, that there's no net loss to


the property owner?  We assume the -- the interest is


the -- goes with the principal, and therefore it's


property, and property has been taken.  But has there been


any net loss to the person from whom the property has been


taken?


MR. FRIED:  Perhaps and perhaps not.  Let's say


that there has not.  I -- we argue that that does not


matter.  It is the gross -- it is the gross interest that


is in -- involved here --


QUESTION: 


Even if it had been --

MR. FRIED:  -- and that is the point --


QUESTION:  Do you agree if it was a taking and


you were to get just compensation, you would get the net


loss rather than the gross loss? 


MR. FRIED:  No.  We would get the gross loss. 


I think the --


QUESTION:  You -- you again, Mr. Fried, are


going quite beyond the position of the original panel,


later the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit, who made it


clear -- and this is on page 83a of the original panel

decision -- that said, just as a client is not entitled to


the full amount that a lawyer collects for him, but only


that amount less the lawyer's reasonable expenses and


fees, so just compensation for the interest taken by


IOLTA, after IOLTA causes the interest fund to exist, is


something less -- is something less -- than the amount of


the interest. 


MR. FRIED:  That is what the dissent says. 


We do not agree with that.


What we agree with is what this Court said in


Phillips when this Court said that -- and it used the


example of the rents -- the government may not seize rents


received by the owner of a building because it can prove


that the costs incurred in collecting the rents exceed the


amounts collected. 


If the argument that's being made now 

were correct, then that statement would be incorrect


because it would mean --


QUESTION:  Well, isn't the difference --


MR. FRIED:  -- that the government may seize


those rents. 


QUESTION:  Isn't the difference, Mr. Fried, that


in the -- in the rent example, what the -- what the


members of the Court were assuming was that if somebody


wants to be a bad businessperson, he's perfectly free to


do it, and until he goes bankrupt, or loses the property,

he can collect the rent. 


The situation here is different because the


situation here is such that there's nothing to collect. 


The -- the way the background principles of the banking


statutes are set up, or -- which are effected by the


banking statutes means that the -- the rent, the penny,


the interest, never gets to the person who owns the


principal.  And isn't that why -- isn't that exactly why


Phillips does not determine the result in this case?


MR. FRIED:  I think not, Justice --


Justice Souter, because the Court in Phillips said


specifically this interest -- so it assumes there is --


this interest is the private property of the clients,


Brown and Hayes.  It said that this is -- that's what this


Court said.  It is their property. 


Now, it doesn't 

disappear as their property because they would incur


expenses in collecting it. 


QUESTION:  Well, I may not be the -- the best


expert on what the -- what the majority meant by that. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  But I think thought what the majority


meant by that was that when you aggregate, as -- as is the


case in these IOLTA accounts, of course there is a


fractional sense that is attributable to every item


that -- a fractional sense of the interest that's

attributable to every item that goes into the aggregation,


but it doesn't follow from that that any of that


attributable amount could ever be netted out and ever be


received under the banking statutes by those individuals


to whom it is attributable.  If, in fact, it were the


other way, then the IOLTA scheme would force a separate


NOW account to have been set up. 


MR. FRIED:  The -- the Court certainly did not


say that any of that interest could be netted out and paid


net to Brown and Hayes, but it did say, quite


unambiguously, that that interest -- not in some general


sense, but exactly that interest -- was the private


property of clients, Brown and Hayes. 


Now --


QUESTION:  But was it taken from them?  So, I


mean, I -- I can see why you see Webb is very, very


similar, but the difference that I saw is that Webb says


the money should be deposited in an ordinary interest-


bearing account, and here it's being deposited in a -- in


an account that is really the creation of the government's


program that just couldn't have borne interest unless you


collect all these funds together.  So without this


program, the person couldn't have earned interest. 


Now, has the government taken that?  If they


have taken it, then why didn't the government take it when

they -- when they tax it.  Suppose the tax law was illegal


because it's very unreasonable.  Why wouldn't that then be


a taking?  Why wouldn't the government take it when the


government has a currency reg that imposes certain


conditions upon the use of that interest? 


I'm back to the same point.  Why isn't this


really a due process problem, not a takings problem? 


MR. FRIED:  Well, that's a -- I mean, that is --


that is an argument which depends on traversing the


premise established by this Court in Webb's and Phillips.


QUESTION:  That's why I -- I said the difference


in Webb's is that in Webb's it's an ordinary interest-


bearing account.  Here it's an account that is nonexistent


without the IOLTA program coming in and saying we will put


funds together, and those funds could not have earned 

interest on their own. 


MR. FRIED:  Well, that is the argument that the


Solicitor General made in Phillips, that this is


government-created property, and it was rejected.


QUESTION:  I'm making the same argument in


respect to taking. 


MR. FRIED:  And it was rejected by this Court. 


It was rejected. 


QUESTION:  But do you agree with that -- that


premise?  Couldn't a -- a group of attorneys or real

estate brokers form their own consortium and say in order


to avoid wasting this interest, we're going to put the


interest in a special fund and we'll give clients a check-


off system where we'll expend it the way they want? 


Private -- private enterprise could do exactly what IOLTA


is doing, could it not? 


MR. FRIED:  It might very well. 


QUESTION:  If -- if the government let it, and


just because the government doesn't want to let it,


doesn't mean the government has a right to do it on its


own.  Isn't that your point, or isn't it --


MR. FRIED:  Well, that is -- that's one of the


points. 


QUESTION:  Well, it could do it theoretically,


but as a practical matter, computing the -- the various 

payouts would -- would be so expensive that -- and the


payouts so small that it's just not practicable.  Isn't


that --


MR. FRIED:  If I could just address the


gross-versus-net point.  The interest to which we are


entitled, to which the clients are entitled, is -- it was


calculated by respondents -- $5 and $2.  That is the


amount to which they are entitled.  It may well be that


along the way, the accountants will say, fine, and we'd


like $3.50 of that, and the lawyers may say, fine, and we

want actually $4 of that.  And it may well be that at the


end of the day they don't have any money.  That's not any


of the government's business. 


QUESTION:  But that -- that was not the position


that any judge has brought so far because the original


panel that held in your favor said, yes -- and I don't


want to repeat myself, but something less.  It would be


something less than the amount of interest. 


I have a question that -- that's puzzling me


about this theoretically we could have it separate. 


I thought that the program can only work, as far as the


tax law is concerned, if the client has no control over


the disposition of --


MR. FRIED:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  -- that interest.  If the client has


control, then it's taxable to the -- then it -- interest


like any other interest would be taxable. 


So, here, the IOLTA has this peculiar aspect to


it.  You can it's interest belonging to the client, but


that client has no right to dispose of it as long as it's


going to be nontaxable income. 


MR. FRIED:  The client has a right to dispose of


it, but -- or ought to have a right, under the


Constitution, has a right to dispose of it --


QUESTION:  But then it would be interest --

 MR. FRIED:  -- but he will pay taxes. 


QUESTION:  Yes.  But that's another --


MR. FRIED:  That's -- that's life. 


QUESTION:  -- another -- I would like to go back


to a very basic question, and it's -- it's essentially


this.  If you had not -- no IOLTA program with the tax


advantage that you get that makes the whole thing work,


and we went back, we just got this injunction, stop it


all, it seems to me the big gainer, the person who is


really benefitting, and who lost the last time around is


the bank because the bank had the free use of these funds,


and IOLTA comes along and takes it.  It really takes it


away from the banks.  And then if you succeed, it goes


back to the bank.  Am I right that that's the --


MR. FRIED:  It may. 


It may go back to the bank, 

which, in a competitive industry, would presumably work


its way down to the -- to the clients, but I don't need to


make that argument. 


QUESTION:  Why -- why don't you, though, have to


make exactly the same argument if IOLTA goes down the


drain -- compulsory IOLTA goes down the drain on your


theory?  Why don't you have to make the same argument


about the -- the background government regulation which,


in effect, gives the interest to the bank?


MR. FRIED:  It doesn't give the interest to the

bank.


QUESTION:  Sure, it does.  It says, look, bank,


you can take in money, but you can't pay out any interest


on it.  You can't pay out interest on a straight checking


account and you can't pay out NOW interest to a


corporation.  Therefore, in effect, you get to keep it.


MR. FRIED:  Well, the --


QUESTION:  And the -- the effect of that, it


seems to me, is just as much to deprive your client of the


$5, if there is any deprivation at all, as -- as it is to


deprive it when it says IOLTA gets it instead of the bank.


MR. FRIED:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Except your -- your client is not


compelled by -- by those banking regulations to deposit


any money in the bank, is he?


MR. FRIED:  No, it is not. 


QUESTION:  And your client, I suppose, is not


compelled to engage in this consensual transaction with


the broker.


MR. FRIED:  It is -- the client is compelled to


engage in it if he wishes to buy and sell real estate.


QUESTION:  And the client --


MR. FRIED:  He's not compelled to buy and sell


real estate. 


QUESTION:  And the client is compelled to

deposit the money if it wishes to get banking services. 


But in no instance -- either the IOLTA case, or the


background regs case -- does the government say to the


person with $10 in his pocket, you've got to put it in the


bank, or you've got to spend that money on real estate. 


MR. FRIED:  Well, indeed, not. 


QUESTION:  But the compulsion is the same one


way or the other. 


QUESTION:  I think -- I think the point is


that -- that your client must -- must be willing -- what


is it -- must deposit money in the bank if he wants to


deposit money in the bank.  That's the compulsion here.


MR. FRIED:  He must --


QUESTION:  He must deposit money in the bank if


he wants to deposit money in the bank.


MR. FRIED:  He must deposit money in the bank if


he wants to buy and sell real estate, the way you have to


pay money to a grocer if you want to eat. 


If I may, I'd reserve the balance of my time for


rebuttal.  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Burman.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BURMAN


ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT


LEGAL FOUNDATION OF WASHINGTON


MR. BURMAN:  Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:


I would like to start with the question that


Justice O'Connor posed because I think it goes to the


heart of the flaw in plaintiffs' case.  There is an


independent requirement -- an independent element of their


cause of action which is that they show that there was


just compensation due and denied by the State of


Washington.  That has not happened here. 


QUESTION:  So the position of the State of


Washington is that it can take any property so long as it


doesn't have -- so long as compensation can't be


calculated.


MR. BURMAN:  No.  The position is that there is


no unconstitutional taking if we would pay compensation. 


Certainly the -- the plain language of the clause says the 

property may be taken. 


QUESTION:  Doesn't -- doesn't the State have


some duty to recognize that the Constitution protects


property and it shouldn't take property that doesn't


belong to it?


MR. BURMAN:  In certain circumstances, the Just


Compensation Clause acts a shield.


QUESTION:  So -- so if you can get it --


MR. BURMAN:  The process might well --


QUESTION:  So if you can get away with taking

property just because it can't be valued, then you can


take it.


MR. BURMAN:  That is not --


QUESTION:  That's the position of the State of


Washington. 


MR. BURMAN:  That is the position of this


Court's cases, not the position of the State of


Washington, which does not go that far.  Our position is


that --


QUESTION:  Well, there might be some due process


claim, mightn't there?


MR. BURMAN:  One was not stated here. 


QUESTION:  We're trying -- what -- what we're


looking at here is a takings claim. 


MR. BURMAN:  Correct. 


Other plaintiffs might 

well have a due process claim.  These plaintiffs may well


still have a First Amendment claim since their real


complaint with this is their subjective ideological one,


subjectivity which this Court has said is not the business


of the Just Compensation Clause. 


QUESTION:  Once again, I -- $5 and $2.  It's not


a whole lot of money, but it's their money.  Why -- why do


you say it can't be calculated? 


MR. BURMAN:  Under this Court's cases, it is not


their money.  The Court has been very careful to say that

what we look at, because the Just Compensation Clause is a


type of indemnity provision that is worried about


responding with -- to loss of pecuniary or monetary


value -- the Court in the parcel aggregation cases, such


as Boston Chamber and Sage, made it very clear that if it


is not economically practicable, if the costs of


aggregation would exceed the benefit, there is no just


compensation.


QUESTION:  But you're -- there you're talking


about something that has to be sold for money.  This is


quite calculable.  We know exactly how much interest was


paid, and we know that that interest belonged -- under our


case law, belongs to these plaintiffs.  What -- what is


the problem?  $5 and $2.


MR. BURMAN: 


Answering the question of whether 

it's property, as the Court made clear in Phillips, does


not answer the question of whether there is a taking, or


the question of whether there is just compensation. 


QUESTION:  Well, who has the $5 and $2?


MR. BURMAN:  The government does, as it had the


additional value in the cases such as the Boston Chamber


case, and in --


QUESTION:  Mr. Burman, am I right?  It's not


$5 and $2.  That's gross.  And with the --


MR. BURMAN:  That is gross.  And, in fact, in

Webb's, the very case they rely upon, the Court said the


government can deduct the cost of protecting that money


before you calculate what is due.  That is exactly what


happened --


QUESTION:  Right.  That's why he says he wants


the injunction. 


MR. BURMAN:  Webb's did not have an injunction.


QUESTION:  I know it didn't.  It didn't need it.


And his point was -- his point was that since -- if you


could theoretically give the compensation, which is


impossible for the reason you say --


MR. BURMAN:  It's --


QUESTION:  It's impossible.  They're not


entitled to anything in cash.  But look, if you could do


it theoretically, there would be no more program, so give 

us an injunction because it comes to the same thing.


MR. BURMAN:  Where the textual language is just


compensation, and where the value is economic or pecuniary


or monetary loss, as this Court's cases often say, it's


not just that there is no way to remedy this problem. 


There is no remedy called for by the Constitution.  The


remedy is just compensation.  I take this --


QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose there were a State


in which a group of lawyers or real -- people with real


estate accounts got together and say, we really should

pool this interest and we'll give our clients a choice of


four different things that they can allocate the money to. 


And we're just going to do that as a service, and we think


it's good business.  Actually we might -- the company that


does this might make a few dollars themselves.


If that were in place, could the State of


Washington do what it does now, say, you know, this looks


like a good idea?  We think we'll take it for what we


like.


MR. BURMAN:  That may be a very different case.


These plaintiffs have never tried that.  That is not their


complaint.  They make no allegation --


QUESTION:  But can -- do they even have the


possibility of trying that given the regulation that you


now have? 


MR. BURMAN:  Actually, we don't know that.


QUESTION:  You've taken away, in effect, a


business opportunity, have you not?


MR. BURMAN:  No.  We don't know that that's the


case because they've never presented it to the State


supreme court. 


QUESTION:  Well, it's certainly profitable for


you to do it.  Why do you think you can do what private


business can't? 


MR. BURMAN:  Our burden is not to come up with

hypotheticals for other cases that they might bring. 


These two plaintiffs brought their case. 


QUESTION:  Well, your burden is to answer


hypotheticals --


MR. BURMAN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- that establish whether or not a


property interest is being taken in violation of the


Constitution here. 


MR. BURMAN:  Correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And you say that simply because it


can't be computed, A, because of the small amounts, and B,


because of the government's unique program, that it is not


property anymore. 


MR. BURMAN:  And the difference is what is


unique about the government's program and what Boston 

Chamber says would be relevant, if individuals could do


it, was aggregation that reduces the transaction costs. 


In a hypothetical where --


QUESTION:  Now, does -- does this mean --


let's -- you know, banks pay higher -- higher amounts for


certain deposits above a certain amount.  And you're


saying that if the government passes a law that says


I have to -- I have to deposit my $5,000, together with


other people's $5,000, thereby getting additional interest


for all of it -- right -- you can keep the interest

because I wouldn't have gotten it anyway.


MR. BURMAN:  Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  What a -- what a wonderful scam. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BURMAN:  There is an element of compulsion


there that is not present here, and there is no -- you --


you posit no regulatory purpose.  This arose out of a


clear regulatory purpose to --


QUESTION:  I don't care if there's a regulatory


purpose or not.  I mean, that -- that may go to some


other -- some other element, but as -- as to whether


you've taken my property, the interest was paid because of


my $5,000, and then you come back and say, oh, yeah, but


you wouldn't have gotten that much because you wouldn't


have been -- well, that's true. 


I wouldn't have, but the 

fact is I was in with those other people and I did get


them more money, and that more money is mine.


MR. BURMAN:  And -- and they should present that


argument.  It may well be that they could come up with a


scheme that would reduce the transaction costs and create


a net value, and the plain language of the rule says if


that happens, the lawyer has to honor it. 


QUESTION:  They're -- they're arguing --


MR. BURMAN:  It is the lawyer's obligation. 


QUESTION:  All right.  I think they're saying, I

agreed with you.  You know, I agreed with you.  But I


wrote a dissent.  So they're saying that was a dissent. 


You lost.  Now, it is the law of the United States that


this is property.  Indeed, it is their clients' property.


Now, you tell me on that assumption, since I


lost, why is it not a taking of that property for which


they are entitled to just compensation, and, in this case,


the just compensation would have to take the form of an


injunction.  Now, unless -- I'm -- I'm anxious to hear the


answer to that point.


MR. BURMAN:  You lost only on the question of


whether the majority should have looked at those


additional elements.  The majority was very clear to say


we express no opinion.  We state no view on these other


questions. 


That would be nonsensical if in fact it 

follows automatically from what the majority said, but


clearly that's not the case. 


QUESTION:  Good.  So tell me why it doesn't.


MR. BURMAN:  With respect to the injunction


question, if I could jump ahead to -- to that part of your


hypothetical, Eastern Enterprises, we believe, is a


different situation where, as in the Youpee case, the


Court basically said Congress could not have intended this


circularity, and so we are not going to read the statute


that way.  This is different when you have the State, and

it's different where, even the dissenters in the Ninth


Circuit below admitted that the amount due, if any, is


going to be smaller than the gross interest.  In cases


such as Webb's, in cases such as Sperry, even in Phillips,


the Court seemed to acknowledge that the deduction made


sense. 


QUESTION:  But Justice Breyer's question I think


was, is there or is there not a taking of property here?


MR. BURMAN:  There is property.  We believe


there is no taking, and Mr. Dellinger will address that


perhaps more directly than I will.  But it is --


QUESTION:  How -- how would you define what's


happened to the property?  It's been regulated out of


existence?


MR. BURMAN: 


The property was transferred, just 

as in Connolly, just as in Eastern Enterprises. 


QUESTION:  Oh, it's been transferred but not


taken.


MR. BURMAN:  Correct.  It has not been taken by


applying the multi-factor test that the Court says applies


when you have a transfer of dollars, which is what


happened in those cases.  And when you apply that test,


these plaintiffs admit no investment expectation, no net


economic loss. 


QUESTION:  It -- it seems to me an odd rule that

it's not a right of the owner to decide to whom the owner


can transfer the property.


MR. BURMAN:  These owners transferred the


property to an intermediary on its way to a third party. 


It would be a really odd rule if somehow the right to


exclude was independent of the economic value of money. 


Just as interest may follow principal, it would make sense


that the right to exclude has to follow the economic value


when you send it to an --


QUESTION:  Mr. Burman, let me ask you something


as a practical matter.  If the Court disagreed with you


and concluded there was a taking and they were entitled to


some relief, can the problem be solved by simply adding a


little explanatory provision in the proposed escrow


instructions, that if you don't want your money in the 

combined account, you can do something else with it? 


MR. BURMAN:  The -- the --


QUESTION:  Otherwise, it's going in the IOLTA


account.


MR. BURMAN:  The problem if -- as I understand


it, is that if you give the client the right to opt out,


the IRS says that becomes taxable.  We're not saying that


you net out the taxes --


QUESTION:  It would become taxable to the person


opting out.

 MR. BURMAN:  Correct, and that --

if -- if the person entering into the escrow says, having


understood it, look, if I opt out, I'm not going to get


anything, so I don't care, you can do this, would -- could


it still function?


MR. BURMAN:  It -- I believe it might well be


able to function, and I think it's important that there's


no compulsion --


QUESTION:  How could it?  They're client --


QUESTION:  Are you sure it's not taxable to the


person who opts out? 


MR. BURMAN:  It is -- it may be taxable to the


person who opts out.


QUESTION: 


Not to the others? 

MR. BURMAN:  It may not be to the others. 


I don't know the --


QUESTION:  Why not?  Because that person would


have disposition either way.


MR. BURMAN:  Oh, if they had the right.  You --


and -- you're correct. 


QUESTION:  And -- and in order to have this

disposition. 


MR. BURMAN:  I stand corrected.

 QUESTION:  So you couldn't do -- you couldn't do


this --


MR. BURMAN:  And it's not the tax that needs to


be netted out.  It's the cost of individually recording,


tracking, paying, and reporting to the IRS that eats up


these nominal amounts.  That is the problem here.


If I could make one correction to something


Mr. Fried said.  There is no compulsion here.  You don't


have to go to an escrow agency that has an LPO or a


lawyer.  You can go to one that does not have one.  In


Washington and many States, that's the case.  There is no


compulsion here --


QUESTION:  Except correct one -- or explain one


thing to me.  I thought that if it netted out so that


there was no net amount available to the depositor, 

that -- I mean, the other way around.  If it netted out


that there was -- something was due, even 5 or 10 cents,


then that would be improper, and you'd have to give them


the money back. 


MR. BURMAN:  Absolutely.  Banks effectively


encumber interest with their charges.  That's what the


plaintiffs' complaint alleges.  They say prior to IOLTA,


banks paid no interest.  They bundled and effectively


encumbered it there.  When required to separate it out, I


can guarantee you, you won't be allowed to go to a bank

and say, I'd like to withdraw my $100 and my 5 cents of


interest and maybe I'll pay a year $5 in service charges


later if I feel like it.  That does not happen.  This is


money that is encumbered, and you should look at the net


amount. 


If there is no value lost, there is no taking


under this Court's cases. 


Kimball Laundry could not be more clear.  In


Kimball Laundry, the Court said for any --


QUESTION:  -- back to my example.  My example of


you -- you compel a bunch of people to -- to


contribute $5,000 apiece.  No money lost?  I could not


have made that -- that additional -- that additional


interest on the $5,000.  So It's perfectly okay for the


State to say, hey, you know, this -- this interest is 

ours.  We made it on your money, but you couldn't have


gotten it otherwise.  That seems to me extraordinarily


strange. 


MR. BURMAN:  If you compelled them to do it,


that might be a different case.  It is Mr. Fried's


proposal, which I believe if he had a narrower argument he


would have made it, but he gives you the radical and


startling argument that you only look at the gross amount


and even -- and that even if there is no net value due,


which in case after case -- such as Kimball Laundry and

Marion & Rye -- the Court has said, if no economic value


lost, no fair market value, no violation. 


Here you have a perfectly functioning market. 


The banks.  They decide what is the fair market value of


the time value of money and they encumber it within the


costs --


QUESTION:  Well, it's not a perfectly


functioning market when you have Federal and State


regulations. 


MR. BURMAN:  That's part of the baseline that


they do not challenge. 


QUESTION:  If that's your definition of a


functioning market, the -- it's the Federal Government


that says it has to be deducted -- it has to be spent for


charity purposes. 


MR. BURMAN:  It's --


QUESTION:  And I take it that regulation isn't


attacked.  I'm not sure why.


MR. BURMAN:  Correct.  They do not attack it. 


It's the Federal Government that creates a tax system that


requires a lot of record-keeping.  They do not challenge


that baseline cost, and our argument is that for that


reason, there is no value lost, no violation --


QUESTION:  Now, what choice did the plaintiffs


have in going into this arrangement or not?

 MR. BURMAN:  As in Yee and PruneYard and Florida


Power, the plaintiffs voluntarily went into a transaction. 


They gave up their right to exclude.  They gave up this


interest for an intermediary for it to move on.


QUESTION:  If they wanted to engage in the real


estate transaction, did they have another choice? 


MR. BURMAN:  Certainly.  They could have filled


out the forms themself, and gone to an escrow agent that


did not employ an LPO or a lawyer. 


Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Burman. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER


ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS


JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON


MR. DELLINGER: 


Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court:


To establish a violation of the Just


Compensation Clause, let's remember there have to be three


elements.  There has to be property -- established by


Phillips.  There has to be a taking in the constitutional


sense, and there has to be a denial by the State of just


compensation. 


Mr. Burman has suggested why that is missing in


this case because there has been no just compensation


that's denied.  The justices of the Washington Supreme --

 QUESTION:  Well, but -- but that's the issue


before us.  I'm just not sure of a precedent which says


that if just compensation can't be calculated, the


government is free to take someone's property for itself. 


And -- and I'm just baffled by what that principle might


be.


MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Kennedy, it is a taking


when the government takes your property without a


sufficient regulatory basis.  And the compensation they


owe you, if it is zero, and zero is paid, there is no


violation.  I know it is somewhat surprising since the


founding generation was so wedded to rights of property,


but the Fifth Amendment expressly confirms the authority


of government to take property for public purposes, State,


local, and National. 
 They have to pay just compensation. 

If they take $1 million of your property and pay


you $999,000, they've violated the clause.  If they -- if


your property is worth $10, and they pay you $10, they


haven't violated.  And if it loses $10 in value, and it's


worth zero, then they owe you nothing.  There's no denial,


no violation of the Fifth Amendment. 


Professor Fried would say in that instance, if


the value declines from $10 to zero, you enjoin them from


taking it.  That's not the answer.  The answer is that the


compensation is zero.

 Now, in this case, by definition, as the


justices of the Supreme Court of Washington -- insofar as


the English language would permit it -- said we do not


want to take property that individuals could earn on their


own.  They say at page 149 of the joint appendix from the


original IOLTA order, in adopting these amendments to the


Code of Professional Responsibility, we make clear that


those funds available for the IOLTA program are only those


that cannot under any circumstances earn net interest.


And they even were careful at page 165 of the


joint appendix to say that as cost-effective subaccounting


services become available, making it possible to earn net


interest on smaller amounts for increasingly shorter


periods of time, more trust money will have to be invested


for a client's benefit under the new rule.  The rule is


self-adjusting.  Unquote. 


QUESTION:  So you give -- you give the same


answer to my $5,000 hypothetical that your -- your brother


would.  Right? 


MR. DELLINGER:  My answer is that --


QUESTION:  I mean, so long as the government


sets it up that way and I couldn't make any more money,


the money that the government makes on my money is the


government's.  Right? 


MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, because this Court's cases

make it clear, Justice Scalia, that the amount of just


compensation that is due is the amount of your loss.  And


if your loss is zero, there's no denial of just


compensation.


QUESTION:  I don't think the cases make clear


what you have to deduct from it.  What if -- what if it


would be clear that I would have had to have to sue for


it, and -- and I would have had to expend attorney's fees? 


Does that all have to be deducted from the just


compensation?


MR. DELLINGER:  No.  I would not -- I would not


count that as all.  The -- the proper measure is what a


willing buyer would pay a willing seller.  In this


instance, I think, it's the -- what is taken is the


ability to use one's money to earn money for a period of 

time. What would a willing buyer pay for that?


If I have a few thousand dollars to invest


for 72 hours and say to Professor Fried, you can pay me


for the value of that -- my right to earn that money; if


he goes to the bank and the bank says, you can deposit


here for 72 hours, but when you come back, you will owe us


money, he's going to pay me zero. 


Now, if --


QUESTION:  That's if you took his right to earn


interest.  But that's not what you took here.  You

took $7.  He did earn interest.  It was not some abstract


right to earn interest that was taken.  What was taken


was $7. 


MR. DELLINGER:  I think that is a


mischaracterization of the facts, Justice Scalia, that the


money that he put in, if invested at that rate, in a world


without transaction costs, would have earned that amount


of money, but that world doesn't exist in the -- in the


Milky Way. 


QUESTION:  Whose money earned the $7?


MR. DELLINGER:  The $7 --


QUESTION:  His money earned it, didn't it?  And


didn't we say in our earlier case that if it's his money


that earned the interest, the interest belongs to him?


MR. DELLINGER: 


That's not the case because 

the --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, isn't the -- isn't


it -- it's their money that earned it.  Isn't interest by


definition that which is netted out that the bank pays


you? 


MR. DELLINGER:  Precisely, it's --


QUESTION:  And if that is the definition of


interest, then there was no $5.  There was no interest


earned on this amount.  Isn't that --


MR. DELLINGER:  That is exactly correct,

Justice Souter. 


QUESTION:  Or did -- did they -- I'd like to --


just to spend a couple of minutes at some point addressing


the question of whether -- whether the program took it


from him.  That is to say, I guess there's a sense in


which -- suppose a robber had come and said to the


depositor, your money or your life.  I mean, what would


the depositor have done?  I guess he'd be dead.  This


money wouldn't have existed.  Did he take it from him? 


Did he obtain it from him?  There -- there is a problem


there that I'd just like you to address. 


MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Breyer, I think the


cases make it clear that you look to what a willing buyer


would pay a willing seller. 


QUESTION: 


That's compensation, but I wonder 

what about -- I mean, there is a sense in which the


program took the money, but who did it take it from?  Did


it take it from the property owner?  Is there a sense --


or do you concede the point that there's a taking? 


MR. DELLINGER:  The money that is -- the money


that is acquired -- taken in the common language sense --


comes from the money that is generated by the pool of


funds.  It's not money that could have been paid to the


individual client.  And these rules make it clear that if


you could pay it to the individual client, because you

can't -- you can't find out who he or she is, or allocate


the money to them.  So it has no net value.


QUESTION:  I thought we decided that issue in


Phillips.  I mean, you could argue that point --


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- but didn't we decide that point in


Phillips, that there was a taking --


QUESTION:  I don't know if we did that.  I mean,


property --


QUESTION:  -- and that the property did


belong --


MR. DELLINGER:  Well, you -- you did decide in


Phillips that the interest was property, but you have to


look to what the value is. 


QUESTION: 


Somebody's property or the property 

of -- of the --


MR. DELLINGER:  It is the -- it is the property


of the client, and if there is an -- a way of getting net


interest to the client, these rules require it. 


Now, several of the examples suggest --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, does -- Washington has


the same program as in Texas?  That is, if a mistake is


made, and this money could have earned net interest, then


you can get a refund. 


MR. DELLINGER:  Absolutely correct.  You -- you

inform the IOLTA program that the money could have earned


net interest, and if that's true, the interest comes to


you.


Now, several of the examples were in a sense


more naked wealth transfers.  What's different about this


program -- we've -- we've addressed the fact that


there's -- this third element of a denial of just


compensation is missing, but I do want to address the fact


that we don't believe that this is a taking because if you


apply this Court's Penn Central analysis, all of the


factors point in the same direction, in addition to the


absence of investment-backed expectations.


This is a program that serves an important


regulatory goal of avoiding the appearance of self-dealing


by lawyers. 


Now, it -- it raises money for an important


cause.  And we don't deny the importance of that to the


program.  It is a cause -- ensuring equal access to


justice -- which enhances confidence in the system of


justice, and helps the petitioners and everyone else who


uses that system. 


But the relevant regulatory interest noted by


the justices at the beginning of their process is that


where lawyers are placing funds of their clients in a


bank, and the banks are in a position to benefit the


44

lawyers, you have a risk of violating one of the first


principles of legal ethics that lawyers are not to benefit


directly or indirectly from their clients' funds. 


QUESTION:  So the -- so the property can be


misused and the State can take the property.  That's --


that's your formulation. 


MR. DELLINGER:  That is not the formulation. 


The -- the funds have to be taken from the bank.  They


can't remain with the bank because of the serious ethical


problem that was noted in the briefing to the justices


that the banks are earning interest and providing benefits


to the very lawyers, or in the case the real estate escrow


agents who placed the money there.  If you can't


economically return it to the client, if that cannot --


if that is not economically feasible, and you can't 

ethically leave it with the bank, then it has to go


somewhere.  It doesn't have to go to IOLTA.  It has to go


to some charitable use to avoid this ethical problem. 


QUESTION:  Why can't -- why can't the private


system design mechanisms so that clients and attorneys can


designate the cause to which they want it to go?  Then,


they're having control over their property.


MR. DELLINGER:  Well, there are two problems


with that kind of -- of client control.  One is the tax


consequences to the client.  If the client directs where

the funds go, the interest would be attributable to the


client. 


And secondly, if you --


QUESTION:  Well, I suppose if the client


designated a charity, that would be a charitable


deduction.  Maybe or maybe not. 


MR. DELLINGER:  That's correct.  It -- it --


I think that goes to the right to control, and the


government often regulates the right to control one's


property, particularly in a heavy -- heavily regulated


industry such as banking. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, in -- in that --


I want to get clear on that example.  If there were such a


designation, leaving the tax consequence aside, isn't --


isn't it true on the facts under the Washington scheme 

that the cost of identifying the amount that would go to


the charity would be greater than that amount so that, in


effect, ultimately the -- the charity would net nothing,


there would be no tax, a tax return would have to be filed


saying zero.  Is -- is that right?


MR. DELLINGER:  That is -- that is precisely


right. 


Now, if you -- if you choose to have a law firm


do your transaction, but the client says, I want some


other escrow agent, and not the lawyer, then you don't get

into IOLTA. 


But here, I think we have a dispositive flaw in


that there is simply no just compensation.  And the reason


there is no compensation is that it's actually quite


complicated to track and allocate all of these funds. 


It may seem counterintuitive that you can't allocate that


interest back.  But in Texas, for example, if you look at,


I think, footnote 2 of the -- of the brief of 49 State


bars, in Texas, where they made $5.5 million, it was on


40,000 attorneys' trust accounts that may have had as many


as 1 million discrete deposits.  And if we're wrong


that -- and there's somehow you can allocate it back, you


do so. 


Now, the --


QUESTION: 


Well, you could have separate funds. 

You could -- you could have four different funds that


attorneys could choose.  You could choose Save the Whales,


or help -- help litigation fee --


QUESTION:  Or you can have an injunction.


MR. DELLINGER:  It is possible but it is not


required.  I don't believe that the Fifth Amendment has a


dog in the fight over -- over what charitable use the


State of Washington chooses when they serve this important


purpose of making sure that there is -- that there is not


this ethical conflict.

 There are really five different ways that we


could win this case, just -- because there are so many


pieces on the gameboard.


You could conclude that it's not a taking


principally because it has a valid regulatory purpose.


It's not -- two, it's not a taking because of


the absence of any real investment-backed expectations.


Three, even if it's a taking, we've established


that zero compensation is due. 


Four, even if you think some compensation might


be due, they've never gone to the State -- not a single


client -- and tried to prove up the amount of


compensation, which is very much in dispute if you look at


their earnings credit analysis, unlike Eastern Enterprises


where we knew the exact amount, it's very much in dispute 

whether some or all of those costs would have been borne


down. 


And finally, even if you reject all our other


positions, you then reach an argument that we don't need


to make because we believe in our other arguments, and


that is, why not treat this as a valid revenue measure? 


Unlike the bad revenue measures of Eastern Enterprises,


where the State, or the Government was imposing a


retroactive onerous burden on a few identifiable, known


people, here it's prospective, reasonably broadly based,

and raises -- and modest in the exaction.  That looks even


as a financial transaction.


QUESTION:  Courts have the power to tax?


MR. DELLINGER:  I'm sorry?


QUESTION:  Courts have the power to tax?


MR. DELLINGER:  Courts have the power -- and


other agencies often -- to impose fees.  That's a State


law issue, but whether it's an IOLTA assessment, or a user


fee, or however you want to characterize it, if you look


at it like that, I'm not sure why it doesn't stand up


quite well. 


Whenever you're talking about money, you have to


decide why isn't this just a valid way for the government


to raise money?  And part of the Takings Clause shares an


overlap with the bill of attainder and the ex post facto. 

Are you singling out a few individuals retroactively, as


Justice Kennedy focused on in Eastern Enterprises.  Here


you're not.  Anybody who chooses to engage in X will


pay Y.  When X is a lot of people -- 40,000 in Texas --


and potentially all of us who do transactions, and Y is a


perfectly reasonable amount of money, nonexistent in our


view, but minimal at worst under their characterization.


Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. FRIED:  Thank you, Justice Stevens. 


Just a few points.  First, this is not a revenue


measure.  It is not a tax.  It has never been argued to be


a tax.  Indeed, if it were a tax, we would have no


complaint.  Indeed, it is our answer to the arguments


made, the dog-in-the-manger argument that was made in the


court below, and the argument made by AARP, that if the


government wants our money, they should get it the


old-fashioned way.  They should tax. 


Now, the court said, and AARP said, it's


inconvenient to tax because that comes with strings. 


That's called democracy.  They don't like the strings. 


And so the bar association and the justices wish to 

acquire the money. 


QUESTION:  May I -- I shouldn't be taking your


rebuttal time, Mr. Fried, but are you saying that if they


did this by a statute, it would be perfectly okay?


MR. FRIED:  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm saying


that if they did it as a --


QUESTION:  -- as part of the revenue code.


MR. FRIED:  -- as a tax -- if they did it as a


tax because it --


QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me the program was

exactly the same, it was adopted by a legislature, and had


the title tax on it. 


MR. FRIED:  Because in every jurisdiction and


certainly in the Federal Government, taxes have to jump


over certain hoops.  There are institutional constraints,


and it's exactly those constraints that the justices and


the bar associations want to escape.  They have told us


so.  It's all --


QUESTION:  I'm not sure I know the answer to my


question.  If they did exactly what I said, would it be


permissible? 


MR. FRIED:  It would be an entirely different


question.  I wouldn't want to concede it, but it would be


a different question, and a harder one because this Court


has granted greater leeway to tax, and the reason it has 

is because taxation is a recognized institutional form


with lots of institutional hurdles that the respondents do


not wish to endure.  They wish to do -- do an end run


around them. 


Now, as to the regulatory purpose here, I think


it's sufficient to note that prior to IOLTA, there were


plenty of regulations -- both of escrow agents and


lawyers -- to prevent them from self-dealing, and lawyers


were disbarred if they violated them.  This IOLTA measure


was passed, and it was passed only as a way to raise funds

for legal services.  So I think that the regulatory


purpose is an after-the-fact invention. 


Now, also we do not say that it is impossible to


value the taken here -- the amounts taken.  It's perfectly


possible.  It's $5 and $2.  It's simply impracticable to


force Brown and Hayes to sue for it.  That's the


impracticability.  It's not impossible.  We do not say


that.  And that's why cases like Kimball Laundry are


completely beside the point.


QUESTION:  Mr. Fried, may I ask you another


question that is troubling me about this, in addition to


the question of is it really the bank whose -- whose


economic gain has been taken?  But this is a question


about the -- the class sets involved.  Now, I know this


isn't a class action, but the injunction is going to be to 

cover everyone in this group.  And some of them may be


outraged by this and others may say, we'd much rather that


IOLTA get it than the bank.  So there's something


troubling about an injunction that's going to cover all of


these people who may have very diverse views about what


they would like to see happen. 


MR. FRIED:  Yes, and the solution for that is


the political process rather than the process of judges


and bar associations raising revenue.  And under the


political process, the result you describe happens all the

time.  It should not happen here.


QUESTION:  I'm not sure I understand that


answer.  If the choice is between the banks and IOLTA, and


some of the people say we don't want to prefer the bank,


we want to prefer IOLTA.  You're -- you're making the


choice for them in saying, you have to prefer the bank


because we're enjoining it. 


MR. FRIED:  Well, we're enjoining it -- we are


asking you to enjoin it because it is an illegal program. 


The result of the injunction, or a -- a declaration would


be what you described.


QUESTION:  Mr. Fried, you may have another


minute if you didn't get your rebuttal through. 


MR. FRIED:  No.  I -- I think that's --


JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you. 


MR. FRIED:  -- sufficient.  I thank the Court


for its attention. 


(Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
