CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We’ll hear argument 

(10:08 a.m.) 

first this morning in Case 08-661, American 

Needle v. The National Football League. 

Mr. Nager. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. NAGER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

In this case, the Court of Appeals for the 

Seventh Circuit held that an agreement of the 32 teams 

of the National Football League was immune from any 

scrutiny under section 1 of the Sherman Act on the 

ground that the agreement allegedly fails the 

plurality of actor requirement of this Court's 

jurisprudence. 

The 32 teams of the National Football League 

are separately owned and controlled profit-making 

enterprises.  Under this Court's decision in NCAA, as 

well as the Court's more general joint venture 

jurisprudence, those clubs are entities whose distinct 

agreements are, indeed, subject to section 1 scrutiny. 

The fact of the matter is there is a long­

standing consensus, judicial and legislative, that

agreements among sports teams about whether and how 

they will participate in the marketplace is subject to 

scrutiny under the Sherman Act, section 1. 

The Court's decision in NCAA is most 

directly on point.  In that case, the Court held that 

a policy of the NCAA that restricted the ability of 

member institutions of the NCAA to sell TV rights 

violated section 1.  Just as with the NFL, the 

decisions of the NCAA were ultimately controlled by 

the vote of its members, and for that reason, the 

Court held that the NCAA policy was a horizontal 

restraint, and it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there was no joint 

venture with respect to the television rights, meaning 

there was no separate activity, other than the 

televising of the shows at issue.  Here, the Solicitor 

General is saying there is a joint venture, and it has 

to do with the licensing of trademarks, with their 

quality control, et cetera. 

Isn't that a substantial difference? 

MR. NAGER:  No, I don't -- I don't think so, 

because what we’re -- what we’re asking about here is 

-- is the question of whether or not the agreement of 

the teams involves a plurality of actors.  And just as 

in NCAA, the members' institutions -- because they

controlled the operation of the NCAA and the policy 

that it was promulgating, there was a plurality of 

actors. 

So, too, here, the 32 teams of the National 

Football League have entered into an agreement and 

control the use, collectively, of the trademarks and 

logos of the individual teams.  And for that reason, 

there is concerted activity that is involved. 

Justice Sotomayor, the point that you raise 

might be of -- a point of difference that the NFL 

could argue in the context of an ancillary restraint 

analysis, in the context of a rule of reason analysis, 

but it’s not a point of distinction that they can 

argue properly in the context of the concerted conduct 

inquiry. 

The NCAA case simply applies the consistent 

teachings of this Court in cases like Sealy, BMI, and 

Copperweld, that separately owned and controlled 

entities entering into agreements -- those agreements 

constitute concerted conduct subject to scrutiny under 

the antitrust laws.  The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does that cover 

everything that the NFLA does?  Because everything is 

subject to agreement.  It's all concerted action.  So, 

is everything under the Sherman Act, and then it goes

to rule of reason analysis?  Or are there some things 

that escape, entirely, antitrust analysis? 

MR. NAGER:  Certainly everything in the --

that’s challenged in this case, because this involves 

a restriction on the activities of the venturers 

themselves.  But more generally, I would -- I would 

answer your question, Justice Ginsburg, to say that 

yes, that everything that these 32 separately owned 

and controlled teams joined together to do by -- in 

concert, by agreement, by consent, is a contract. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Changes in the -- in the 

rule apply?  They make a change to make it -- give 

the passer more protection, but there's -- this really 

hurts certain teams, which mostly run, and so -- rule 

of reason? 

MR. NAGER:  Yes, it is concerted activity. 

I don't think it would be a plausible rule of reason 

claim. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, how -- you know the 

litigation system.  How do we know? 

MR. NAGER:  Well, I think we know the 

following, Justice Kennedy:  That under this Court's 

rule of reasons jurisprudence, a plaintiff has to be 

able to plead an identifiable anticompetitive effect 

in a market in which the defendant plausibly has

market power, and the -- the plaintiff also has to be 

one who can --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, my -- my 

hypothetical:  Two or three teams which aren't 

particularly popular in the league are hurt by the 

rule change.  And --

MR. NAGER:  That --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And notice, there’s --

that the owners sit around the room, they are liable 

for a conspiracy.  I mean, this is serious stuff. 

Triple damages. 

I don't -- and my question, really, was the 

same as Justice Ginsburg’s.  Can you give us a zone 

where we are sure a rule of reason inquiry will be --

would be inappropriate?  We can take care of it on 

summary judgment.  Because if you don't have some sort 

of section 1 carve-out for joint action, then -- then 

everything is under the rule of reason. 

MR. NAGER:  Well, Justice Kennedy, let me 

answer your question in two parts.  First of all, to 

the extent that the Court is looking for a zone, the 

concerted conduct doctrine is the wrong place to do 

it, because remember, if something is deemed not to be 

concerted conduct, it is a per -- then it's per se, 

not subject to section 1 and per se legal.  And I

think for the Court's jurisprudence over the last 

30 years, the Court has been trying to get out of per 

se rules and have a more focused inquiry into what the 

anticompetitive effects and pro-competitive effects of 

a particular restraint are. The concerted conduct 

doctrine would be a very blunt tool to use for that 

purpose. 

Now, that is not to say -- and I appreciate 

your question -- in the NCAA case itself, where 

conditions of competition and the like were raised, 

Justice Stevens's opinion for the Court says that in 

contrast to the TV restraint, these other types of 

rules and regulations of the sports league are 

presumptively competitive, pro-competitive, 

presumptively favorable to consumers, because they are 

integral and bound up with the creation of the 

football venture itself. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me give you 

another example that you mention in your brief.  The 

NFL teams agree among themselves regarding scheduling: 

They’ll play 16 games a year and they will have a 

playoff schedule and they won't play any other games. 

Now, would that be a clear case under the rule of 

reason?  You mention and some of your amici mention 

that, for example, the English football leagues

Official 

MR. NAGER:  Justice Alito, if I -- I may not 

have gotten all of your question, but let me answer it 

in two parts.  The antitrust laws do not require joint 

ventures to maximize output.  They don't require joint 

ventures to maximize competition.  They simply 

prohibit people entering into contracts from 

unreasonably restraining trade. 

So a mere agreement among the team owners 

that they would have a 14-game schedule rather than a 

16-game schedule is not a prima facie showing of an 

anticompetitive impact, because all it's showing us is 

what the joint venturers have done with their own 

output.  They have -- you haven't alleged a 

market-wide reduction in output.  Now, if by your 

question you were saying, in addition --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if one of the 

team wants -- one of the teams wants to play 

additional games --

MR. NAGER:  Well --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- against a rival team 

where they will get more money? 

MR. NAGER:  What I -- what I was going to 

jump right to is:  If in addition to changing the 

league schedule, the team owners in concert agreed to

prohibit the teams of the National Football League 

from -- from playing any other games -- doing an 

exhibition game in Japan, the Redskins and the Giants 

playing another game -- that might show a market-wide 

reduction in output.  And the Court's decision in NCAA 

says very specifically that the most important 

condition of ensuring the competitiveness of joint 

ventures is ensuring the freedom of the individual 

venturers to produce output, increase output. 

Now, that doesn't mean that a league rule of 

that type would be unlawful.  All I'm trying to 

suggest is if, in addition to changing the schedule of 

games for the league, they also imposed a restriction 

on the individual venturers from producing additional 

games on their own, we might have something that 

looked more like a plausible rule of restraint --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They couldn't -- they 

couldn't stop that team from joining another league? 

Let's assume -- and I -- you know, I don't know enough 

about football, but let's assume there are two leagues 

playing.  One of them plays on Saturday and the other 

plays on Sunday.  You’re suggesting that the venture 

couldn't stop their members from joining that other 

league?  What's the purpose of being in a venture if 

-- if you are free to reject it and go to somewhere

Official 

MR. NAGER:  What I'm saying is, first of 

all, it would plainly be concerted activity on the 

part of the team owners because they would have 

entered into a horizontal restraint on the activity of 

the venturers.  Whether or not that horizontal 

restraint violated the antitrust laws, one would have 

to go through the following analysis, Justice 

Sotomayor:  First, we would ask whether or not that 

restriction is an ancillary -- an ancillary restraint. 

And an ancillary restraint, starting with 

Judge Taft, later Chief Justice Taft's, opinion in the 

Addison Pipe case, is:  Is that restraint reasonably 

necessary to achieve the efficiency-enhancing purposes 

of the joint venture and is it no broader than 

necessary? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems --

MR. NAGER:  And if it is, then we would 

analyze that restraint by reference not only to its 

own pro-competitive benefits and anticompetitive 

effects; we would analyze it by reference to the 

benefits of the joint venture as a whole. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, it seems to 

me -- your last few answers seem to me to beg the 

question.  You start out by saying, well, obviously

it's a horizontal agreement among the teams, and then 

you explain how you are going to analyze it. 

I thought that was the very question before 

us:  Whether these sorts of rules and regulations are 

horizontal agreements between the teams or whether 

they are part of a particular -- a single entity’s 

articulation of rules. 

MR. NAGER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you are 

exactly right, and the real --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That you have been 

begging the question?  Is that -- that part? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. NAGER:  Well, let me try to address 

Justice Sotomayor's subsequent question in the context 

of the way you are posing the question, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

The reason it's a horizontal restraint is 

because these -- under the Court's doctrine, 

consistent teachings, whether it be Sealy, BMI, 

Copperweld, these teams are separately owned.  They’re 

separate decision-makers joining together, and they’re 

making a decision about how they are going to jointly 

produce something or not produce something.  And 

that's what makes it concerted activity under this 

Court's consistent teachings.  The distinction between

unilateral activity under section 1 and concerted 

activity under section 1 has consistently been the 

distinction between ownership integration of assets --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Can I --

MR. NAGER:  -- and contract integration of 

assets. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Can I interrupt with this 

question?  Is it not part of your burden not only to 

argue there are multiple actors, but also that their 

agreement has an adverse effect on competition? 

MR. NAGER:  It -- absolutely, as the 

plaintiff in the case, Justice Stevens, that we do. 

That is not the ground of decision of the court below. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I understand it isn't, but 

it is part of your burden to say that this is not a 

pro-competitive agreement. 

MR. NAGER:  Absolutely.  And I'm not --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  If -- if we find for you 

and it goes back, then you would -- you would bear 

that burden. 

MR. NAGER:  That's correct.  And, in fact, 

in this case, Justice Stevens, I would point out that 

the NFL initially moved to dismiss the -- the rule of 

reason count on the ground that it didn't state a 

cognizable, plausible rule of reason claim, and the 

district court judge denied that motion. 

He found that the complaint alleged a market 

in which he could not say, as a matter of law, that 

the NFL defendants did not have market power, and he 

recognized that the -- that the teams had agreed 

together to prohibit competition in an aspect of their 

licensing activity and in an aspect of their 

merchandising activity. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How does it work? 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But what if he -- what if 

he further concluded that the agreement had the 

overall effect of stimulating additional -- it was 

pro-competitive in that it would equalize the economic 

strength of the teams and, therefore, made them all 

better competitors on the playing field?  Would that 

have been a defense?

not quite sure.  I thought you were saying if in the 

response to a motion to dismiss --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right. 

MR. NAGER:  -- he had -- had held --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  He said:  Sure, there’s an 

agreement here, but the burden is on the plaintiff to 

show that the agreement has an adverse effect on 

competition.  And that the -- as I understand the 

facts, you've -- there’s revenue sharing here, isn't 

there?  That they -- they all share in the product of 

the sales of the joint product? 

MR. NAGER:  Well, let me explain what 

they've done, and I will then explain why it does have 

a -- identifiable anticompetitive effects, which 

certainly satisfy the pleading standards for a rule of 

reason claim. 

What the teams did here was they got 

together and they agreed that they would not 

themselves individually license their trademarks or 

logos.  They agreed that they -- under -- the current 

market system included the issuance of multiple 

blanket licenses.  They would eliminate all but one of 

those blanket licenses from the market, and they would 

give it in the exclusive control of Reebok, and they 

would limit the circumstances in which they competed

Mr. NAGER:  -- that's just showing that each

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

Mr. NAGER:  And again, they --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I'm trying to look --

what I'm trying to get in my mind is what specific 

restraint you are focusing on. 

You listed three or four, and one of them is 

you want, in effect -- I'm joking about it, but it's 

true -- you are arguing that the Yankees should 

compete with the Red Sox in selling shirts. 

Another thing you are complaining about, 

which is the one I understand less, is that these 

teams got together and they agreed that they would 

just have one person sell all this stuff together. 

And what you think is that they individually should 

have decided whether to choose that one person, or 

maybe to choose two people, or three. 

MR. NAGER:  We --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right? 

MR. NAGER:  Not quite. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.

MR. NAGER:  No. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is this issue before us

this is a unitary operation? 

MR. NAGER:  You’re --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought that was the only

MR. NAGER:  That is the only issue,

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why am I worrying

MR. NAGER:  Because counsel has an 

obligation to respond to questions.

JUSTICE BREYER:  I find --

Mr. NAGER:  You'd be a good blocker.

is irrelevant, but given Justice Scalia's persuasive

MR. NAGER:  Thank you, Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but it seems to me 

what we are doing is exploring the consequences of 

completely discarding the unitary theory. 

MR. NAGER:  Well, we're not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so -- and the earlier 

questions, it seemed to me, were helpful.  The 

Saturday/Sunday scheduling issue, it seems to me, 

pretty clearly on its face does limit competition. 

You -- you have one day instead of two days. 

Then Justice Stevens said:  Suppose it makes 

them better players because they are rested and so 

they can perform better.  I take it that was the 

purpose of the question.  And I -- I still don't get 

any answers.  I don't know where we are with this. 

MR. NAGER:  The answer to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and it's a 

difficult area, but I’d like -- and -- but I’d like 

some guidance. 

MR. NAGER:  Well, the guidance I would give 

you, Justice Kennedy, is that as Justice Scalia says, 

the only question before the Court is whether or not 

these agreements constitute concerted activity.  They 

plainly do, because they are agreements between 

separately owned and controlled competing businesses.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Nager, I think you 

answered my question originally:  Yes, everything. 

Because they are separate entities, they agree on 

everything.  There’s agreement in every case.  So 

there’s nothing that you would take outside, and you 

put everything under the rule of reason analysis. 

MR. NAGER:  That -- that is correct.  But 

that doesn't mean that the rule of reason is some 

unstructured, indeterminate --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One -- one concern in the 

litigation is, you know, if it doesn't come under the 

Sherman Act at all, they go home after the case is 

dismissed on the -- on the pleadings. 

But once you say no, it's got to be a rule 

of reason analysis, then you have discovery, which can 

be costly.  And I thought that that was a feature of 

this case, that the -- that the plaintiff wanted more 

discovery, and the court said:  You've had enough. 

MR. NAGER:  Well, no.  The -- the judge only 

allowed discovery on the single entity issue.  He did 

not allow discovery on -- on the rule of reason 

question.  So there's been -- not been -- discovery on 

the substance of the case has not been conducted. 

So in that regard, the question of how the 

case would be managed going forward is something that

would be in the hands of the district court on remand 

from this Court and the court of appeals, after this 

erroneous conclusion that the agreements don't 

constitute concerted conduct is put to the side. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, could you 

articulate for me as succinctly as possible the extent 

to which your position departs from the position of 

the Solicitor General? 

MR. NAGER:  The Solicitor General's position 

is correct insofar as it criticizes the Seventh 

Circuit's reasoning. 

The test that the Solicitor General proposes 

is conceptually and doctrinally unsound, and it will 

create a lack of clarity where there presently exists 

clarity in the cases, and it will produce inefficiency 

and waste in the conduct of litigation that does not 

presently exist.  And I could give --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I would have 

thought it’s just the transfer of the inefficiency and 

lack of clarity from the -- the first question to the 

rule of reason.  I mean, I'm not quite sure it -- you 

don't have the same problem.  It's just a question of 

where you want to rest the inefficiency and confusion. 

MR. NAGER:  Well, I understand your point,

reason inquiries are not as refined as they need to 

be, since the Solicitor General's concerted conduct 

inquiry includes rule of reason inquiries -- indeed, 

on its effective merger standard, it says it has to 

survive a rule of reason analysis or somehow be 

waived, or you would have to do it as part of the 

concerted conduct inquiry, so that there is no doubt 

to the extent that -- that the rule of reason is a 

continuing project of this Court, we would be 

transferring some of that project into the concerted 

conduct inquiry. 

With all respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't 

think that would be a healthy development in the law. 

The courts actually understand the concerted conduct 

doctrine as it presently exists. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I -- I thought 

the purpose of their submission was to respond to some 

of the questions we've seen, like scheduling, like 

what the rules are going to be about, about the game. 

There are some things that it just seems odd to 

subject to a rule of reason analysis.  And you 

yourself have said:  Well, that’s going to be an easy 

case under the rule of reason.  Why doesn't it make 

sense to sort of carve those out at the outset, rather 

than at the end of the case?

MR. NAGER:  Well, I think the answer is, you 

should -- you should use English language and doctrine 

to address the issue that you are actually trying to 

address, rather than call it something else. 

Right now, we have an antitrust doctrine 

that says you've got to have concerted conduct and you 

have to have an unreasonable restraint of trade.  We 

have courts that understand how to apply this Court's 

cases on concerted conduct.  This Court, for 

understandable reasons, is sensitive to the fact that 

the rule of reason is not quite as well understood and 

is an evolutionary doctrine, perfectly well understood 

by me. 

There are certain issues this Court has 

said come up in a rule of reason analysis and, to 

quote the Court from Cal. Dental, "can be dealt with 

in the twinkling of an eye"; that is, some claims, as 

the NCAA Court said, are not going to be serious rule 

of reason claims and can be dismissed on the 

pleadings.  The Court said that in Twombly as well. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  And as I understand your 

position, that could be the result in this case.  We 

don't know whether the district court was right or 

wrong in what he did on the -- on the rule of reason 

issue.

MR. NAGER:  In terms of what this Court --

obviously, on my client's behalf, I have to vigorously 

state to the Court we think we have a bona fide, 

serious rule of reason claim -- but, yes, Justice 

Stevens --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  And one thing I wondered 

about the record:  There is discussion in the briefs 

about the fact that the teams share the revenues from 

these -- these sales.  Is that -- how did that get in 

the record, the revenue sharing aspect of their -- of 

the different teams' participation? 

MR. NAGER:  Well, I -- I didn't handle the 

case below, so I don't quite know how it got into the 

record.  It is my -- certainly my understanding that 

there is an affidavit in the record that says that the 

revenues that the NFLP entity receives are distributed 

to the teams in equal shares, so that that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would -- wouldn't that --

that affidavit support the conclusion that this is 

basically a pro-competitive agreement because it tends 

to make competition stronger on the playing field, 

and, therefore, that's a sufficient defense under the 

rule of reason, and that's the end of the ball game?

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but you are not just 

competing --

MR. NAGER:  That’s the very thing the case 

challenges. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But with regard to sales 

of the paraphernalia and so forth that you have here, 

you’re not just competing among the members of the 

league; you’re competing in a market that includes all 

sports paraphernalia. 

MR. NAGER:  No, our market was alleged and 

held not to be legally invalid by the district court, 

to be NFL-logoed hats and apparel. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  That assumes there is no 

competition between the sales of those logos and the 

sales of other sports logos. 

MR. NAGER:  Well, that -- that's correct. 

And the district court judge held that that was a --

based upon this Court's decision in NCAA and the 

International Boxing case, was a plausible market to 

allege in which the NFL teams had market power.  And 

so it would be a question for the district court 

managing the case going forward to determine whether 

or not that was a factually supportable market.

Solicitor General is asking us to remand under his new 

test to find out whether you are challenging the joint 

venture or challenging simply the licensing to one 

individual or one entity.  What are you doing?  Do you 

have an answer to that? 

MR. NAGER:  Well, the -- the answer is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Meaning -- I don't --

MR. NAGER:  I understood -- that the 

American Needle said in the court below that what it 

was challenging was the grant of an exclusive license 

to NFLP that prohibited the individual team 

competition and limited all competition in the market 

in blanket licenses. 

When the case came to this Court, on page 2

second sentence:  "American Needle alleged that the 

decades-old agreement among the member clubs to 

collectively market such intellectual property was 

unlawful under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, at 

least after the 2001 decision to collectively license 

the marks to a single headwear manufacturer."

were arguing, and they have understood it throughout

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 

MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I think that by focusing on a rather mundane 

aspect of the NFL commissioner's powers, this may help 

to explain why the United States is not four-square in 

support of either party's theory in this case.  Among 

the powers that is vested in the commissioner by the 

NFL -- by the NFL constitution is the power to incur 

expenses to carry on the ordinary business of the 

league, and this includes renting office space, hiring

employees, and procuring supplies. 

And if the commissioner, pursuant to that 

delegation of authority, decides from which company 

he's going to -- to acquire paper for the league's 

offices or decides what the wage scale for secretaries 

in the league offices should be, our view is that 

that's the conduct of a single entity.  It may be that 

the commissioner's power to do those things is 

ultimately derived from the consent of the individual 

teams within the league, but once that consent has 

been given, once that authority has been centralized, 

then the commissioner's decision about a paper 

supplier or wages for employees --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then the question I 

have -- I now understand this much better in light of 

that.  And -- but I don't -- and -- and I see your 

point.  What I'm not certain about is:  Is it better 

to characterize it as a single entity, in which case 

we get into the kind of confusion that I think exists 

in this case?  Or just say, look, it's a joint 

venture? 

If Panagra creates a joint venture, of 

course they are going to buy things like office space 

and employees, so it's reasonable by definition.  We 

don't even look into it.  Those things that are close

enough -- take your criteria from 17, page 17, which 

are excellent criteria in my mind, and you say these 

are the criteria by which we decide whether those 

ancillary parts of a joint venture that is itself 

reasonable are also reasonable. 

MR. STEWART:  I guess we would say two 

things:  The first is, up to now there has been no 

such thing in the law as concerted action that is per 

se legal or per se reasonable. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  We wouldn't say 

per se.  We are saying that the justification here: 

They are reasonable.  Why are they reasonable? 

Because there is a legitimate joint venture, and this 

is an ancillary part of that legitimate joint venture. 

People can attack it, but it's going to be 

no easier to attack than if they tried to attack what 

you call a single entity. 

MR. STEWART:  I guess my point is that if, 

for instance, a disappointed bidder for the paper 

supply conduct -- contract challenged this as a 

section 1 violation and said the commissioner's 

decision to go to Staples rather than Office Depot was 

unreasonable --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.

offering a better product at a lower price -- that 

there are certainly decisions that the commissioner 

could make with respect to procurement of supplies or 

the setting of wage levels that would be unreasonable 

in a business judgment sense, in that they wouldn't 

effectively carry on the mission of the organization, 

but they wouldn't be unreasonable in the -- the 

section 1 sense. 

And the other thing I would say is that line 

of argument could have been made in Copperweld; that 

is, the Court could have concluded that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Copperweld -- look, your 

second criteria opens it up to attack in precisely the 

same way that my use of rule of reason does, because 

they are going to have to show it doesn't 

significantly affect actual or potential competition. 

Therefore, they file their claim; they say they win 

under the second criteria.  That’s precisely the same 

as a person filing his claim and saying it's 

unreasonable. 

We are only talking terminology, but what 

worries me about this is the terminology, because I 

think that the lower courts have taken Copperweld 

terminology and transferred it to a place where it 

does, I think, perhaps not belong.

MR. STEWART:  Well -- well, in Dagher, for 

instance, the Court was dealing with a situation 

that's in some ways analogous to the one that you have 

here; that is, a joint venture in which entities that 

were economic competitors in some aspects of their 

businesses joined forces with respect to other 

aspects.  And the Court in Dagher didn't squarely 

resolve these questions, whether section 1 applied, 

but it said that in pricing its products, Equilon, the 

joint venture, was acting as a single firm, a single 

entity. 

The other point I would like to make 

about my -- my paper and employee example is that, in 

our view, the NFL commissioner, when carrying out 

those functions on behalf of the league, would be 

acting as a single entity, even though his power was 

derived from the consent of the teams. But if the Jets 

and the Giants agreed among themselves as to what 

wages they would pay their secretaries or from whom 

they would buy paper, that would be an entirely 

different thing.  The fact that those teams are for 

some purposes part of a --

commissioner had entered into a multitude of different 

contracts, but specified a minimum price in every one 

he specified? 

MR. STEWART:  I think the section -- the 

question of whether section 1 applied would not be any 

different; that is, the central section 1 that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So the fact that this is 

an exclusive agreement is kind of a red herring in 

this case, isn't it? 

MR. STEWART:  It -- it may not be a red 

herring with respect to the ultimate resolution of the 

case; that is, if the court on -- the lower court, on 

remand, if the case were remanded, applied rule of 

reason analysis, the -- the precise nature of the 

contract might bear on whether the restraint was 

reasonable, but it wouldn't bear on the question of 

whether concerted activity was involved; that is, 

what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't -- I'm 

sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt your answer. 

MR. STEWART:  I guess my point was, once --

once the teams decided that they would -- rather than 

each negotiating individually, either with a single 

licensee or with multiple licensees, once they decided

they would negotiate as a collective and that any 

potential licensee had to go to the collective rather 

than to the individual teams, that's the central 

section 1 issue.  And if the -- the collective had 

decided, we will give contracts to a multitude of 

potential bidders, that would not have affected the 

fact that concerted action was involved. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So under your --

following of your paper case, are you saying that if 

the teams delegated to the commissioner the authority 

to decide whether we are going to enter -- whether the 

league is going to enter into one contract on logo 

products or let each team decide, that would be all 

right? 

MR. STEWART:  That would -- that initial 

delegation of authority would be subject to a 

section 1 challenge, because that would be concerted 

action in the same way that the Court in Dagher 

said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why isn't the 

decision to order paper from one company rather than 

another subject to section 1 challenge?

If somehow a plaintiff wanted to say there

MR. STEWART:  I guess under our theory, we 

would first ask, as to an entity like this, which is 

entities that compete in some respects with --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's -- let’s not go 

into this case.  Let's -- let's stay with your single 

commissioner. 

MR. STEWART:  I think we would ask first: 

Is -- is the commissioner acting as a single entity 

when he exercises delegated authority in making a 

business judgment about which supplier to buy paper or 

what the wages should be? 

If the answer is yes, then the section 1 

inquiry is over, then the case is no different from a 

challenge to the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, how does that stop 

any group of competitors from coming in and saying: 

Gee, I want to sell my gas; I'm going to let this 

single commissioner decide how much my gas will sell 

for, and if he chooses to sell it at the same price to 

everybody, both gas products, that's okay.  How do you 

get to that? 

MR. STEWART:  Well, I think if a single 

business is deciding whether to buy paper from one 

supplier or from several, that wouldn't be subject to 

section 1 review, because the decision of the single

business might affect the welfare of the competitors, 

but it wouldn't be concerted action. 

And our point is that when -- I think the 

way in which our position differs from that of the two 

parties is that on the one hand, I think it is the 

logical implication of Petitioner's position that 

because the commissioner's authority to buy supplies 

for the league or hire referees for the league is 

ultimately derived from the consent of the individual 

teams who are independently owned, the logic of 

Petitioner's position suggests that that would be 

subject to section 1 scrutiny. 

On the other hand, the logic of the NFL's 

position suggests that because the commissioner can 

set price, can decide from whom to buy paper on behalf 

of the league, the Jets and the Giants could reach a 

similar agreement, and the -- or the Jets and the 

Giants could agree on the prices they will pay 

secretaries --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, no, no, 

because they are not part of the broader concerted 

entity.  There's no separate -- you’re saying, well, 

just because all 32 teams can act as -- as an 

individual entity, any group of those teams can act as 

an individual entity.

MR. STEWART:  I think that follows logically 

from the position that this is one entity.  Because in 

Copperweld, for instance, the Court noted that 

coordination between different divisions of a single 

company would not be subject to section 1 scrutiny, 

and that implies not just that all the divisions could 

get together, but that any two could confer among 

themselves without raising section 1 concerns. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGG H. LEVY 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. LEVY:  Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

The formation of a professional sports 

league, like the formation of any joint venture, may 

be subject to section 1 scrutiny.  Were it not for an 

act of Congress, the merger of the National Football 

League and the American Football League in 1970 would 

be one such example.  But there is no challenge to 

venture formation here. 

There is no dispute that the NFL, including 

its licensing arm, NFL Properties, is a lawful 

venture.  If venture formation is not an issue, then 

decisions by the venture about the venture's product

are unilateral venture decisions, unilateral venture 

actions.  They are not concerted actions of the -- of 

the venture's members. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do we have to ask 

what was the intent at the beginning, as kind of an 

originalism thing?  Everybody sits around and says: 

Let's have a football league.  And 20 years later, 

they say:  You know, the sale of hats and shirts is a 

pretty good thing; let's get into that business, too. 

That would -- that would -- that's case 1. 

Case 2 is, when they formed the league 

initially, 30 years ago, they said:  And be sure we 

will sell hats, and -- I don't understand the base 

point from which I find that this is a single entity. 

MR. LEVY:  Your Honor, we know here that at 

least as of 1963, when NFL Properties was formed, that 

there was a single entity formed, a single entity to 

produce and promote NFL football. 

Now, I take issue with your suggestion --

your implication that there was a decision made here: 

Let's set up a separate line of business; we are going 

to sell hats also.  That's not what happened, and the 

record on that is unambiguously clear here.  It's 

undisputed.  Clubs --

with my question that this is a relevant inquiry?  Is 

it part of the original agreement or isn't it, and why 

is it that the original agreement is somehow 

sacrosanct?  I don't understand. 

MR. LEVY:  I'm not suggesting that the 

original agreement is sacrosanct.  That's why I 

suggested that by 1963 -- or the mid-1960s, when NFL 

Properties was formed, there was venture formation at 

that point. 

At that point, what was the question?  The 

question was:  How should the league, how should the 

venture members, best promote the venture product? 

And the decision was made to use the licenses of their 

intellectual property as a promotional tool. 

On that issue, the discovery and the record 

below was undisputed.  There is documentary evidence 

from the NFL Properties' articles of incorporation. 

There’s testimony from an NFL executive, Mr. Herzog. 

And the best proof, if there were any question about 

that, is reflected in the -- the organic documents of 

NFL Properties, which at the outset said that, if 

there were any revenues from the licensing activities, 

they would be donated to charitable and educational 

causes. 

Now, you know, Dagher confirmed the general

principle, but if the venture is lawfully formed, the 

venture's decisions about how best to produce and 

promote its product are venture decisions, not the 

decisions of the venture members. 

But Copperweld provides the framework that 

decides the issue here, and neither Mr. Stewart nor 

Mr. Nager mention Copperweld, except in passing. 

Copperweld is the case by which this Court turned the 

page, if you will, on the formalism of prior cases, 

including Sealy, which Mr. Nager --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May -- may I ask you to 

go back just one step?  Because you seem to treat this 

as though the NFLP was formed in 1963 and that was the 

end of it, but another description is:  Well, it was 

formed, but then there were some teams that were not 

in it until later, and there were some other parts, 

that it has expanded.  What it does has expanded since 

1963. 

So it wasn't one point in time where there 

was formation, and then if you didn't -- if you’re not 

challenging that, everything else is okay. 

MR. LEVY:  Well, I -- I don't disagree with 

that, Your Honor.  I think that in 1970, the league 

expanded.  There was a merger.  That merger of the 

National Football League and the American Football

League would have been subject to section 1 challenge 

because it involved venture formation, but an act of 

Congress said that that wasn't necessary. 

After 1970, there have been six teams, I 

believe, that have been added, essentially created, if 

you will, like Adam's rib.  They have been created 

from the other NFL clubs, but it's essentially the 

same venture.  The venture has expanded its production 

capability by adding new teams.  It's expanded its 

output by adding new teams. 

And the role of licensing of intellectual 

property throughout that process has remained the 

same.  The role has been to promote the venture's 

product.  It's not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  Did the 

teams -- did the NFL Properties or some centralized 

entity always exploit the trademarks of all the 

franchises, or was there a long period of time in 

which they each individually franchised their 

products? 

MR. LEVY:  The record, Your Honor, says --

reflects that there was very little exploitation of 

intellectual property of the franchises prior to the 

creation of NFL Properties.

that was done by the individual teams? 

MR. LEVY:  It was done, and it was done -- I 

mean, that's sort of an historic artifact.  It was 

done, I believe collectively, through Roy Rogers 

Enterprises.  But the -- but the teams continued to 

own their intellectual property.  That's right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The problem, as I see, for 

you in this case is that the basic conclusion is in 

the court of appeals, where it says:  "Viewed in this 

light, the NFL teams are best described as a single 

source of economic power when promoting NFL football 

through licensing."  Well, how do we know that? 

MR. LEVY:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Their allegation is that 

that isn't true.  And I have -- and Copperweld just 

seems to me to be very confusing on this, since --

since my hornbook knowledge of it was we have 

Copperweld to deal with the case that we don't make 

booths in department stores compete in price against 

each other.  All right? 

Normally, however, we say independent 

vendors can't get together and say they fix prices. 

That's per se.  And joint ventures are in the middle, 

so we apply a rule of reason. 

Now, very simple.  I thought that has been

the law since Panagra.  I don't know what, in fact, 

Copperweld has to do with it.  And they are saying 

that this basic joint venture for promoting is not a 

reasonable agreement.  So why shouldn't they have 

their shot?  You might well win, but they want to make 

that claim. 

MR. LEVY:  The reason we know that this is 

not your typical joint venture is because Copperweld 

established a standard that said that what section 1 

is intended to regulate is not matters of form, not 

general market conditions, but rather the sudden 

joining together of independent sources of economic 

power.  That's --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine, but that's the 

conclusion here.  That's not the -- that's the 

conclusion.  The question is:  Should they be 

permitted to join their centers of economic power into 

one when they promote and sell their T-shirts, 

sweatshirts, et cetera? 

MR. LEVY:  But --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, you can't answer that 

question by announcing the conclusion. 

MR. LEVY:  But, Your Honor, we know that 

they are not independent sources of economic power,

venture on their own.  No NFL club can produce a 

single unit of production, a single game or --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, can't it ask someone 

to do that? 

Oh.  Oh, you are saying the game. 

MR. LEVY:  That's -- that’s right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What does a game to do with 

this?  I thought we were talking about T-shirts and 

helmets, and I -- I thought it's the simplest thing in 

the world.  You pick up the phone and say:  Hello, 

Shanghai, do you have a helmet? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. LEVY:  Your Honor, if -- if this were a 

venture designed to go out and license or manufacture 

or distribute caps, you’d be right.  But this is 

different, and we -- the undisputed evidence in the 

record below demonstrates it's different. 

It's different because the purpose of the 

licensing here is to promote the product.  It's to 

promote the game.  And the NFL member clubs are not 

independent sources of economic power in generating 

that game. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  This is a summary judgment 

motion? 

MR. LEVY:  Yes.  It was a summary judgment.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the stated purpose is 

to promote the game.  The purpose is to make money.  I 

don't think that they care whether the sale of the 

helmet or the T-shirt promotes the game.  They -- they 

sell it to make money from the sale. 

MR. LEVY:  I --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, it promotes the game 

if the money from the sale goes to the whole group, I 

suppose.  But -- but don't tell me that there is not 

-- absent this agreement, there would not be an 

independent, individual incentive for each of the 

teams to sell as many of its own -- of its own shirts 

and helmets as possible. 

MR. LEVY:  Your Honor, I’d agree with you 

100 percent that the purpose of the licensing is to 

make money, but not necessarily to make money through 

the royalties.  The purpose of the licensing is to 

improve and promote the attractiveness of the game 

product, to get more people interested in watching the 

games on television, to get more people interested in 

buying tickets to the game. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I suppose that --

that could -- that issue could be tried.

think so.  And I suppose that's a triable issue, as to 

whether the purpose of -- of selling these things is 

to promote the whole NFL or to promote the particular 

team. 

MR. LEVY:  And --

JUSTICE SCALIS:  It wants its own adherents 

and wants to sell its own product. 

MR. LEVY:  In the abstract, that's a triable 

issue, Your Honor, but not here.  Here, the record was 

undisputed.  There’s evidence in the record on that 

point.  The record -- there was evidentiary -- there 

was documentary evidence.  There’s evidence that goes 

back to the organic documents of NFL Properties.  And 

as I mentioned before, in the early days, the -- the 

net revenues, if any, the net royalties of the 

licensing operations went to charity.  So there’s no 

-- there’s no question here.  Discovery was allowed on 

this issue, and the record is undisputed. 

So we have a classic case, a perfect, clean 

opportunity for this Court to apply the principles of 

Copperweld and the principles of Dagher to an area of 

the law that has been troubled for many years.  Since 

1984, the courts have wrestled with the question of 

how to deal with professional sports leagues and 

section 1 claims against professional sports leagues.

And the cases the courts have been -- have

II case, the courts have been guided principally by 

pre-Copperweld precedent that rests on an era of 

formalism, an era when even an agreement between a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What decision could the 

sports teams make that would be subject to the 

antitrust scrutiny under your definition of the 

permissible range of the joint venture activities?  It 

seems to me that if the venture wanted to make sure 

all the teams hired secretaries at the same 

$1,000-a-year salary, that under your theory, that's 

okay, because it's a joint venture. 

MR. LEVY:  Your Honor, my view is that the 

-- the NFL clubs are not separate sources of 

independent power.  As a result, they are a unit. 

They are a single entity, and it's a --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the answer to my 

question is there is -- you are seeking through this 

ruling what you haven't gotten from Congress:  an 

absolute bar to an antitrust claim.

MR. LEVY:  The direct answer to your 

question is this:  With regard to section 1 claims --

let's put aside section 2 claims.  Let's put aside 

claims between the NFL and other leagues.  Let's put 

aside claims that relate to nonventure conduct, like 

the example of creating a trucking company that’s 

reflected in our brief. 

The -- I can understand an argument, and we 

suggested as much in our brief below, that if the 

league engages in a practice of representing itself, 

going to the market -- the clubs go to market as 

independent entities.  I can see an argument that 

would basically say, based on estoppel principles, 

that they should not be able to agree on -- on uniform 

prices or uniform wages for secretaries, for example. 

We did -- we made the point in our brief in 

the context of -- of coaches.  But even -- even in the 

context of coaches, put aside for a moment, section 2 

remains available to the coaches if in fact they can 

demonstrate that there has been monopolization or 

attempted monopolization of a market. 

But the line that I draw is the line between 

production and promotion of the game.  Coaches are 

closer to production and promotion of the game than 

secretaries, but I -- you know, there may be some --

some gap there.  But -- but as long as the NFL clubs 

are -- are members of a unit; if they compete as a 

unit in the entertainment marketplace, as -- to use 

the language that Justice Rehnquist used -- they 

should be deemed a single entity and not subject to 

section 1 --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But now the question is: 

Are you basing that on economic-related data about the 

pros and the cons of -- you know, the economic harms 

of stopping them from competing versus the economic 

benefits of allowing them to act as a separate -- as a 

single entity?  Or are you basing it on a pure legal 

word called "single entity"? 

And what worried -- I thought when I read 

the opinion, first, of the district court, that he's 

just following what I think started in the Seventh 

Circuit, unfortunately, of taking this word "single 

entity" and throwing around -- throwing it around all 

over the place and stopping the economic analysis. 

But then when I read the last paragraphs of 

his opinion, he seems to be saying, when I go back to 

the record, which you want me to do, I will discover 

that there is lots of information showing economic 

benefit to this venture of promoting together. 

There's nothing to suggest they could compete, and so

it's clear, to the point where they don't get to 

trial, that this is a reasonable agreement. 

All right.  Now, is -- have I -- am I right 

in thinking what you are thinking? 

MR. LEVY:  That's not my position, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Good.  Then I 

want to know what your position is. 

MR. LEVY:  My position is based on the 

intended scope of the Sherman Act, section 1 of the 

Sherman Act, which this Court, in Copperweld, made 

clear.  The principle is articulated five or six 

separate times in the Copperweld opinion that section 

1 of the Sherman Act is intended to regulate the 

sudden joining together of separate sources of 

economic power.  That’s --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes --

MR. LEVY:  That's not this case. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I wouldn't read --

can you read Copperweld as follows?  Copperweld is 

ratifying a decision by an entrepreneur or several to 

organize his entrepreneurial entity as one where there 

are obvious efficiencies in doing that, such as it 

would obviously be inefficient to have the sales 

people behind counters in a single department store

competing with each other in price. 

A joint venture is a situation where it's 

debatable whether or not there is that kind of 

efficiency in organization, and, therefore, we apply a 

rule of reason.  That's Panagra.  I don't see anything 

in Copperweld that’s intended to overrule Panagra. 

And as long as Panagra is not overruled, we would 

apply, at least to major decisions by joint ventures, 

a rule of reason. 

Now, what is wrong with -- and you might 

still win on the rule of reason.  But why isn't that 

analysis correct?  I’m putting it forward as a 

hypothesis for you to discuss. 

MR. LEVY:  The analysis is not correct 

because there has been no challenge to venture 

formation here.  I don't disagree that if there had 

been a challenge to venture formation here, that the 

considerations that you identify with regard to 

Panagra would apply.  But that's not the case here. 

There’s really no ambiguity about what has been 

challenged here. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  There is very definitely a 

joint venture here to play football, but there isn't a 

joint venture to build houses, and there isn't a joint 

venture obviously in sight to promote.

So they’re saying that there’s such a 

different activity, the playing of football versus the 

promotion of a logo, that we ought to go and look 

under a rule of reason as to whether a joint venture 

in promoting a logo is justified in terms of 

competition's harms and economic benefits. 

MR. LEVY:  Justice Breyer, I agree with you 

that there is a difference, an important difference, 

between venture and nonventure activity.  If the NFL 

clubs were to create a trucking company or, in your 

example, would go off and build houses, that's not a 

venture activity. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it would be if they 

tried to do it, but, there, they would be attacked on 

the ground that under the rule of reason, they do not 

have the justification such that the antitrust law 

would allow them to do it. 

MR. LEVY:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And they are saying:  And 

promoting is precisely the same.  That's why it seems 

to me to be something that you can't decide in theory. 

It's a matter of going back to economic facts with 

witnesses and so forth. 

MR. LEVY:  Your Honor, the ancillary 

restraints doctrine would enable the court, in the

circumstance that you describe, to categorize the 

decision to build housing as a non-venture activity --

a non-venture decision, and, therefore, it would be 

evaluated independently of the considerations that 

apply to the venturers' objective. 

But, here, you cannot separate the -- the

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, but you -- you 

certainly could because they certainly could --

theoretically, each club could sell its own logo. 

MR. LEVY:  Each -- of course, each club 

could sell its own logo, Your Honor, but the clubs 

have decided that the most effective way to promote --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  They have decided not to 

do it that way, but it could be done. 

MR. LEVY:  Forgive me.  I shouldn't speak 

over you. 

The clubs have decided that the most 

effective way to promote their product, to promote NFL 

football, is to do so collectively, to ensure that the 

marks of all 32 clubs are -- are out there, in --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But maybe they also 

collectively decide the best way to make money and 

finance -- attendance and so forth, all agree on a 

housing program that they all jointly sponsor.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  It would be the most 

effective way to -- to raise the money to pay these 

players who make so much money. 

MR. LEVY:  Well, that doesn't -- there’s a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but if it's a 

plausibility standard at the threshold inquiry, 

there’s a range of things, and I guess your -- your 

friend on the other side is just saying selling logos 

is closer to selling houses than it is to playing 

football. 

MR. LEVY:  Well, but there is a difference 

here, Your Honor, because there is a record.  This --

this wasn't decided on a motion to dismiss.  It was 

decided on summary judgment.  There was undisputed 

evidence that the purpose of the licensing, going back 

40 years -- 45 years, at this point, was to promote 

the game, and that's not an implausible determination 

to be made, but the -- but the evidence was 

undisputed.

where there’s the type of -- you know, the range of 

issues that needs to be -- you know, that needs to be 

resolved, of the kind that you described. 

You know, this is a situation that Judge 

Moran --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if there’s a 

factual -- if there’s a factual dispute about whether 

a particular activity of the league is designed to 

promote the game or is designed simply to make more 

money, than that is the sort of thing that goes to 

trial? 

MR. LEVY:  Well, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't 

put it in terms of “make more money” because I have 

agreed with Justice Scalia --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or do something 

else, do something other than promote the game? 

MR. LEVY:  If -- Your Honor, just as in 

Dagher -- in Dagher, the issue was how to price the 

product.  It's a fundamental decision that any venture 

has to make.  This is a decision -- the undisputed 

evidence shows that this is a decision about how to 

promote the product, and that’s no different from 

pricing a product in terms of the -- you know, the 

operations of a venture.

product, unless you have decided on how to promote it, 

and the antitrust laws in the Sherman Act encourage 

promotion.  They encourage -- Copperweld encourages 

business people to make the judgment about how best to 

produce and to promote their product and how best to 

compete in the marketplace. 

They made very clear that they don't want 

those judgments cabined or inhibited or chilled by --

by decisions by the court or decisions by a jury. 

But, here, Judge Moran did what we thought was the --

and we continue to think is the most appropriate way 

to serve the interests of both the Sherman Act and the 

considerations that this Court has recognized in 

Twombly and other cases, and that’s to provide an 

early opportunity for a determination of whether or 

not the venture -- the venture conduct, the venture 

decision that is at issue, is a venture decision of a 

single entity or whether it is a collective decision 

of the -- of the venture participants. 

He allowed discovery limited to the single 

entity issue.  The -- the -- there is no challenge to 

the scope of discovery here.  We have a complete 

record on this point that confirms and addresses the 

question that you presented, that the purpose of 

licensing here is to promote the product.

But even if it weren't -- even if it 

weren't, I’d suggest that -- that the -- the evidence 

shows that fans identify with the logos, and we are 

talking about the logos and the marks here, not 

because they have some sort of intrinsic value, not 

because they, you know, derive -- they derive some 

value from their attractiveness or appeal, 

independently in the marketplace; they derive their 

value from their identification with an NFL club that 

competes on the football field.  And even -- even 

American Needle's president so confirmed in the 

declaration that he submitted in the case. 

So we have here a record that makes this --

this judgment for the Court relatively 

straightforward.  It provides a straightforward 

opportunity for this -- this Court to confirm the 

principles established in -- established in Copperweld 

and to -- and to extend the principles that this Court 

noted in Dagher. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The -- if the 

reasonableness of this decision, that T-shirts promote 

the game, is so self-evident, then why wouldn't the 

rule of reason control completely?

go to the single-entity question when, by your own 

answer, it is undisputed, so abundantly clear, so 

reasonable? 

MR. LEVY:  The answer --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the need to -- to 

label it “single entity,” as opposed to label it what 

it is, reasonable? 

MR. LEVY:  The answer, Your Honor, is 

inherent in the rule of reason.  In the modern era, 

defending a claim like this on the merits involves an 

investment of tens of millions of dollars, thousands 

of hours of executive time, hours and hours of court 

time.  In the Salvino case, there were 3 years of 

discovery spent on rule of reason issues --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But is not the whole 

purpose, and I certainly sympathize with that 

argument.  But isn't the proposition of antitrust law 

that we have a reason for worrying about concerted 

activity?  We have a genuine concern as -- well, 

Congress does -- about independent entities joining 

together and fixing prices. 

And we permit them to do so, as Justice 

Breyer indicated, when the venture has a purpose 

that’s independent than -- from the individual 

interests, but we say, when it doesn't, we have to

ensure, under the rule of reason, that what they are 

doing is reasonable. 

I'm -- I’m very swayed by your arguments, 

but I can very much see a counterargument that 

promoting T-shirts is only to make money.  It doesn't 

really promote the game.  It promotes the making of 

money.  And once you fix prices for making money, 

that's a Sherman Act violation. 

MR. LEVY:  But, Your Honor, I would agree 

with almost everything that you said, but we are not 

dealing here with independent sources of economic 

power.  These clubs are not independent.  None could 

produce their product on their own. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they own the 

trademarks, so they could. 

MR. LEVY:  They do, but the trademarks don't 

have any value.  They don't have any purpose 

independent of the game.  The trademarks are invented 

to identify the clubs on the field.  They are -- they 

are promoted and distributed to -- to encourage 

loyalty among fans of the clubs.  The -- the 

trademarks are simply a tool that the clubs use to --

becomes Patriots.  Everything -- no competition 

anywhere.  Now, you say that's ridiculous, and once 

you say that's ridiculous, you are now into the 

business of deciding whether this aspect of the 

undeniable legal joint venture to play baseball or 

football -- whether this aspect is properly the 

subject of merger. 

And once you’re into that, you’re into your 

$7 million, and I can't really think of anything 

that's going to help you there. 

MR. LEVY:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And the SG in its brief, 

you see, on that key 16 and 17, it seemed to me, 

simply reproduces in precisely somewhat different 

language, but precisely the argument you are now 

having:  Is this the kind of thing that should be 

merged?  We know by applying the rule of reason. 

And, second, if it is merged, is this 

particular aspect of it something where there could be 

competition, and there isn't much justification? 

That's their rule, too.  Again, we are back to the 

rule of reason.  So, how do I save you the $7 million? 

MR. LEVY:  But, Your Honor, this case is the 

perfect example.  We were able to resolve this case on

of reason discovery, and your reference to the 

Patriots tractor store drives home a distinction that 

I think is worth leaving with the Court at this point. 

This is not a situation, like the situation 

to which we adverted in our brief, where John Deere 

and International Harvester get together and fix the 

prices of their logos for sale to cap manufacturers. 

John Deere and International Harvester, for 

many years -- I mean, early on, they gave away the 

hats throughout the Midwest to encourage farmers to 

buy their farm equipment.  They are independent 

sources of economic power. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you -- you say that 

the -- that the trademarks have no value apart from 

the -- from the game.  I guess you could say the same 

thing for each individual franchise of each of the 32 

clubs.  They are worthless, if NFL football 

disappears.  So does that mean they -- they can agree 

to fix the price at which their -- their franchises 

will be sold, by concerted agreement, because after 

all, they’re worthless apart from the NFL? 

MR. LEVY:  Well, I -- I certainly agree with 

your -- your premise, Your Honor, that they are 

worthless apart from the -- except -- I mean, there’s 

some residual value.  I don't -- I don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 

MR. LEVY:  I don't dispute -- dispute that. 

Could they agree on prices for their franchises to be 

sold?  Yes, I assume they could agree because they are 

not independent sources of economic power. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, okay, you --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So we don't even ask the 

question whether under the rule of reason such a thing 

is reasonable or justified? 

MR. LEVY:  Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought I was reducing it 

to the absurd.  But you --

(Laughter.) 

MR. LEVY:  You know, I -- I can bring the 

basic point that I -- I want to leave you with back to 

our example that's a little bit closer to home. 

In 1999 -- 1919, when Judge Covington and 

Mr. Burling went to join forces, they formed a law 

firm, a venture.  Ninety years later, that venture 

decides on the prices, the rates that Mr. Ludwin and I 

will -- will decide for our -- will charge for our 

services.  Sometimes that venture, the firm, decides 

that we won't do business with a particular client or 

that we’ll limit our business to a particular client 

in a particular industry.

Nobody suggests that that decision of the 

venture, a lawful venture, is subject to section 1 

scrutiny as a violation of the Sherman Act, 

constitutes a concerted refusal to deal. 

But if Mr. Ludwin and I leave the -- leave 

the firm and we set up solo practices and then decide 

on what our rates are going to be or then decide on 

what our -- what clients we will serve and not serve, 

that is an agreement between independent competitors. 

That's the fundamental difference. 

That is a fundamentally different situation 

between -- compared to the situation of the firm 

setting our rates.  And it reflects the intersection 

of Copperweld and Dagher.  It shows how Dagher and 

Copperweld fit together hand in glove to demonstrate 

that the NFL, for purposes of promoting its football 

product, is a single entity.

General's position and the NFL's position are taking 

rule of reason concepts and trying to push them into 

the concerted conduct inquiry, which will have the 

effect, of course, of confusing courts that presently 

understand the inquiry.  That's Justice Breyer's point 

about terminology. 

It also has substantive impact because of 

the way litigation gets conducted.  As Mr. Levy has 

said, this case was litigated below at the district 

court judge's direction only on the concerted conduct 

question, not on the -- the rule of reason questions. 

So, American Needle didn't have the opportunity to 

conduct discovery and make proof about anticompetitive 

effects and to try to rebut the arguments that the NFL 

was making about pro-competitive justifications. 

The NFL's argument is asking -- they are 

asking for a per se rule of legality for everything 

that the NFL does that is related to football.  That 

can't be the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's the answer to

on the subject, as with all joint ventures, the case 

law treats law firm partnerships as joint ventures and 

subjects them to the rule of reason, and every 

commentator, whether it be Judge Bork or anyone else, 

has said:  But, of course, law firms don't have market 

power so they couldn't possibly have anticompetitive 

effects on the market, and a rule of reason claim 

trying to challenge the rates at which a law firm sets 

its partnership rates wouldn't pass -- survive a 

motion to dismiss. 

With respect to his analogy to Dagher, the 

difference between the Dagher effects -- of course 

this Court in Dagher didn't accept the argument that 

I made on behalf of Texaco and Shell that they should 

be treated as a single entity if, in fact, their 

formation was lawful.  This Court only ruled on the -­

on the price-fixing issue. 

But the argument that was made in Dagher was 

if you had a wholly integrated joint venture, one in 

which there had been a complete pooling of relevant 

capital, a complete sharing of profits and losses, and 

an enforceable non-compete agreement, in those 

circumstances the -- the owners of that joint venture 

were not like typical joint venturers; they, in fact, 

were like the shareholders in a publicly held company

because their only interest at that point is in their 

investment.  They have no other economic interests 

that are affected by their ownership and control of 

that entity.  And at that point, they could be treated 

as one. 

And Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court 

has some resonance of that in it, but it specifically 

says it’s only addressing it in terms of the per se 

rule.
