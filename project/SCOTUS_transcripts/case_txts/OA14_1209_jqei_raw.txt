CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  14­1209,  Sturgeon  v.  Frost. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Findley. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MATTHEW  T.  FINDLEY 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

ANILCA  was  the  result  of  a  grand  bargain. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  enacted  ANILCA  to  finally  resolve  land 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ownership  in  Alaska,  a  process  that  began  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Statehood  Act  and  continued  with  the  Native  Claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Settlement  Act,  both  statutes  that  granted  land  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  and  native  corporations  to  further  economic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

development  and  self­sufficiency  for  Alaska  and  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people. 

            

ANILCA  very  carefully  balanced  conservation 

 

 

 

 

with  those  important  goals. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  ­­ Mr.  Findley,  can  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

ask  two  quick  clarifying  questions  just  so  I  understand 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  at  issue  here? 

 

 

 

            

Your  argument  applies  to  the  navigable 

 

 

 

 

 

rivers  generally;  is  that  right?  In  other  words,  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

navigable  rivers  running  through  the  federally  owned

land  as  well  as  to  those  running  through  the  inholdings? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  If  a  navigable  river  is 

   

  

 

 

 

surrounded  by  the  outer  boundaries  of  the  park,  yes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  covered  by  Section  103(c). 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  is  there  any  information 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  record  about  whether  your  client  actually  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

running  his  boat  on  the  portions  which  were  ­­ are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  federally  owned  parts,  or  instead  it's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inholdings? 

            

            

            

            

Is  that  what  you  called  them? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FINDLEY:  That  is  one  word  for  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  FINDLEY:  He  was  within  the  shore.  On 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

either  side  of  where  his  hovercraft  was  stopped  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  public  land. 

 

 

            

            

            

            

            

            

            

question. 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Was  Federal  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  FINDLEY:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Was  Federal  public  land? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  FINDLEY:  Yes,  exactly. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  Thank  you. 

  

  

 

 

MR.  FINDLEY:  Oh,  sure. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Just,  again,  a  preliminary 

   

  

 

 

MR.  FINDLEY:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  it  conceded  by  all  or

is  it  not  that  this  is  navigable  ­­ that  these  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

navigable  waters? 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  Yes.  And  the  Ninth  Circuit 

  

  

 

 

 

 

issued  decision  in  2001  called  Alaska  v.  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  Judge  Kleinfeld  which  adjudicated  the  Nation  River 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

navigable. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  that's  not  contested 

  

 

 

 

 

here? 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  No,  it  is  not  contested  here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  you're  claiming  a 

  

 

 

 

 

right  not  merely  to  use  the  hovercraft  in  the  nonpublic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands.  You're  claiming  that  there's  no  residual  right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  control  navigable  waters  in  the  Federal  lands  area? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  What  Mr.  Sturgeon  is 

  

 

 

 

 

arguing  ­­ we've  been  very  specific  about  that  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Park  Service  does  not  have  authority  to  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  Park  Management  Regulations  to  cover  State  navigable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters  that  run  through  these  ANILCA  parks. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what  do  you  do  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ANILCA  provision  that  says  that  boating  and  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

water  activities  within  public  lands,  within  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  lands  can  be  regulated? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  Yes.  And  those  apply  to  all 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

kinds  of  waters  that  are  not  navigable.  Those  apply  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  waters  and  those  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  not  what  it  says. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

It  says  any  waters  in  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  It  doesn't  say  navigable 

  

 

 

 

 

waters.  And  there  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  it  could  apply  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

both,  is  what  I'm  saying.  What  says  it  excludes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

navigable  waters? 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  You  turn  back  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  public  lands  in  the  statute,  which  makes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  for  anything  to  be  public  lands,  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must  hold  title. 

 

 

            

And  there  really  is  no  dispute.  The  United 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  does  not  hold  title  to  the  submerged  lands  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

navigable  waters.  So  those  navigable  waters,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

aren't  public  lands. 

 

 

            

Section  103(c)  makes  crystal  clear  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

not  part  of  the  park  and  they  are  not  subject  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  solely  enacted  to  manage  our  claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  wasn't  sure,  but 

    

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  thought  maybe  they  were  suggesting  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

navigational  servitude  and  its  reserved  rights  were  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  title. 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  They  are  not  title  interests. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They  are  both  nonpossessory  use  rights.  Even  the  Ninth

Circuit  made  crystal  clear  that  the  navigationable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servitude  is  not  something  the  United  States  owns.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Submerged  Lands  Act  itself  disavows  an  actual  title 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  proprietary  interest  pursuant  to  the  navigational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servitude.  Reserved  water  rights,  it  had  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer:  They're  a  nonpossessory  use  right. 

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  it  ­­ it  ­­ it  may  well 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be,  you  think,  that  the  Federal  government  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  do  this  in  the  exercise  of  its  navigational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servitude  even  though  it  doesn't  have  authority  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  as  you  assert,  under  the  Park  Service? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  Our  objection  is  to  the  Park 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Service  asserting  its  regulation  on  these  navigable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters.  Our  position  is  Congress  expressly  denied  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  the  Park  Service  in  103(c). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Okay.  Do  ­­ do  we  have  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve  the  further  question?  Whether  if  the  Park 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Service  can't  do  it  somebody  else  can  do  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  You  don't  have  to  resolve  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  question.  I  mean,  ANILCA  makes  crystal  clear 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that  Federal  government  is  not  bereft  of  authority  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

navigable  waters.  The  EPA  has  authority,  Corps  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Engineer  has  authority. 

 

 

            

The  specific  issue  here  was  you  ­­ you  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pockets  of  land  that  were  about  to  be  surrounded  by

these  new  ANILCA  CSUs.  Those  included  State  navigable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters,  and  that  included  over  40  percent  of  the  native 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation  land  selections  under  the  Native  Corporation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Settlement  Act. 

 

            

The  concern  was  whoa,  if  you're  about  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surround  us  with  these  parks,  we  don't  want  to  be  part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  parks  and  we  don't  want  to  be  subject  to  park 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation.  The  idea  was  if  you  weren't  part  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

park,  you  weren't  subject  to  park  regulation  the  day 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  ANILCA  was  enacted,  and  that  status  quo  carries 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  after  ANILCA  was  enacted. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Suppose  you  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

regulation  or  a  statute  that's  applicable  to  all  United 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  parks.  Is  it  applicable  here? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  If  it's  a  regulation  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Park  Service  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  No,  let's  say  ­­ let's  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  it's  a  statute,  suppose  a  Federal  statute.  So  you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

need  a  permit  for  a  fire  in  a  Federal  park.  Applicable 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

or  ­­ or  ­­ or  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  You  have  to  look  at  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  a  regulation  that  was  solely  enacted  to  manage 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

park  land.  The  hovercraft  regulation  we  have  here,  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crystal  clear.  That's  exactly  that  type  of  regulation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  Park  Service  made  a  judgment  call  about  what

it  believed  was  appropriate  or  not  appropriate  to  occur

If  the  Park  Service  ­­ this  is  a  Park 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Service  regulation  issued  under  the  Organic  Act  and  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  this  code  of  Federal  regulations  and  the  Park 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Service  is  saying,  we  want  fires  here  on  public  lands; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  want  fires  here  not  on  public  lands.  That's  the  type 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  regulation  Section  103(c)  is  talking  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  EPA  says,  look,  we're  concerned  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clean  Air  Act  emissions  from  fire  smoke  and  we  are  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  issue  a  generally  applicable  regulation  across  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  on  when  you  can  burn  wood  and  when  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't,  that  is  not  the  type  of  regulation  that

MR.  FINDLEY:  The  Ninth  Circuit  took  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

strained,  improper  reading  of  the  statute  and  looked  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  103(c)  and  said,  well,  it  only  applies  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alaska­specific  regulations.  And  it  was  a  reading  that

reads  the  statute  out  of  context.  It's  contrary  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text  and  leads  to  an  incredibly  absurd  result  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frankly,  no  ­­ there's  evidence  Congress  thought  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  was  going  to  happen  was  that  these  islands  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­Federal  land  that  were  excluded  from  the  parks, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  Ninth  Circuit's  ruling,  they  cannot  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advantage  of  all  of  the  rules  in  Alaska  that  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  loosened  for  Alaska  parks.  You  can  camp  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alaska  parks.  You  can  hunt.  You  can  fish.  You  can  use 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

snow  machines.  You  can  fly.  The  list  goes  on  and  on. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Right? 

            

Under  the  Ninth  Circuit  ruling,  those 

 

 

 

 

 

relaxed  rules,  they  don't  apply  to  the  non­Federal  land. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instead,  that  non­Federal  land  is  subject  to  the  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictive  nationwide  rules  that  were  not  promulgated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  tailored  to  Alaska.  And  that  simply  makes  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Your  reading  on  a 

  

 

 

 

 

practical  basis  with  respect  to  the  navigable  waters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  almost  no  sense  to  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'm  looking  at  a  map  attached  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

petition  of  the  State  of  Alaska.  It's  attached  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end  of  the  brief.  And  it  seems  like  these  national 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parks  are  spread  along  the  coast  of  Alaska  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haphazard  way,  meaning  the  national  parks  have

jurisdiction  over  a  small  strip  along  the  coast  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alaska. 

            

Presumably  you're  not  arguing  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  controls  the  U.S.  servitude  of  navigable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters  around  those  strips. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  We're  not  claiming  that 

  

 

 

 

 

Section  103(c)  trumps  the  navigable  ­­ navigational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servitude.  What  we're  claiming  is  ANILCA  makes  crystal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  for  submerged  lands  and  navigable  waters  owned  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State,  they  aren't  public  lands;  they  aren't  part  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  park. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  you're  saying  that 

  

 

 

 

 

the  U.S.  can't  control  the  navigable  servitude  in  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  that  coast. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  No.  The  United  States  can. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can. 

  

 

MR.  FINDLEY:  The  Park  Service  hasn't  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

delegated  that  authority.  It  was  expressly  denied  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  by  Section  103(c). 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  so  what  do  you  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  words  in  ­­ in  103(c)  to  mean,  the  boating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception,  when  it  says  "in  the  jurisdiction  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States"?  "Waters  in  the  jurisdiction"? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

You  don't  think  navigable  waters  are  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  in  Federal  lands?

MR.  FINDLEY:  That's  within  the  regulation 

  

 

 

 

 

that  the  Park  Service  promulgated  nationwide,  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  in  ­­ the  hovercraft  is  one  of  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  that  they  assert  to  apply  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  of  the  Park  Service. 

 

 

 

 

            

Section  103(c),  which  is  the  ­­ which  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  park­enabling  statute,  denied  the  Park  Service

navigable  waters. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  if  the  ­­ as  it

and  say,  you  can't  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  Exactly.  Under  whatever  its 

  

  

 

 

 

authorities  are.  I  mean  ­­ and  that's  exactly  what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

ANILCA  was  meant  to  remain  unaffected  by  the  law  was

may  be  an  extension  of  their  authority.  But  certainly. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  ­­ Coast  Guard  has  authority,  EPA,  Corps  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Engineers.  There's  a  laundry  list  of  Federal  agencies 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  have  plenty  of  authority  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  question  is  the  Park  Service  can't  throw 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  hat  in  the  ring  and  in  addition  apply  its  park 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  on  top  of  everything  else. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  it  says  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  ­­ look  at  the  regulation.  It  says,  "The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hovercraft  Regulation  applies  to  waters  subject  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  of  the  United  States."  This  is  water 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  the  jurisdiction.  "Within  the  boundaries  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  National  Park  Service"  ­­ that's  the  tougher  part  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"including  navigable  waters."  That  doesn't  help  us. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  question,  I  would  think,  would  be  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  portion  of  the  river  within  the  boundaries  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

National  Park  Service?  Am  I  right  so  far? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  It  is  within  the  outer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boundaries  of  the  park.  It  is  not  part  of  the  park 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  now,  you  look  at  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  say  about  that,  and  you  get,  when  they're  defining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Yukon­Charley  River's  National  Preserve,  it  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  national  preserve  ­­ which  is  the  whole  thing,

it's  identical  with  the  public  lands. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  in  another  place  it  says,  "Only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  lands  within  the  portion  which  are  public  lands

JUSTICE  BREYER:  We're  going  to  get  into

MR.  FINDLEY:  Yes.

that,  you  have  this  regulation  applying  to  this  portion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  river. 

 

 

            

So  now  we  look  to  the  statute  to  see  if

anything  there  takes  away  what  the  regulations  seem  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give.  And  the  only  part  of  the  statute  ­­ though  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  important  part  ­­ that  supports  you  is  the  second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence.  But  as  I  read  that  second  sentence,  it  says 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  "The  regulations  that  apply  solely  to  public  lands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  such  units,"  you  see,  "are  the  ones  that  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  to  the  private  land  up  in  Yukon­Charley. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I've  just  read  you  a  regulation,  which, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

on  my  reading  of  it,  is  the  Hovercraft  Regulation,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  apply  solely  to  public  lands  within  National 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Park  Service  units,  either  in  Alaska  or  anywhere  else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  therefore,  the  statute  doesn't  stop  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that's  ­­ that's  ­­ and  I  want  to  ­­ I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  if  I  can  do  this  orally;  I  just  tried  to, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  to  put  the  argument  against  you  as  best  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could,  and  I  want  to  hear  the  reply.

Service  did  not  apply  this  regulation  to  navigable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters.  That  was  a  change  they  made  in  1996,  and  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  36  C.F.R.  1.2(b)  where  they  say  now  we're  going  to

Mr.  Sturgeon  is  objecting  to. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

The  whole  point  was  103(c)  says  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  Mr.  Findley,  I  mean  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  FINDLEY:  ­­ you  can't  do  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ whether  or  not  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

true,  agencies  can  change  their  mind  about  things.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  that  the  question  that  Justice  Breyer  is  putting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  you  is  this  question  about  what  this  provision  means: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Shall  be  subject  to  the  regulations  applicable  solely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  public  lands." 

 

 

              

I  mean,  "solely"  is  a  very  purposive  word, 

   

 

 

 

 

you  know?  I  mean,  Congress  drops  lots  of  words,  but  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  "solely"  in  a  sentence  when  you  mean  "solely."  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  does  not  apply  solely  to  public  lands. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  Because  the  regulation  never 

  

 

 

 

 

should  have  been  allowed  to  reach  out  to  the  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

land.  That  is  our  objection  here.  The  Hovercraft 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Regulation,  as  promulgated  in  1983,  was  a  regulation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

promulgated  solely  to  manage  park  land. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  103(c)  says,  it  was  a  permanent  barrier

regulation  solely  enacted  to  manage  park  land.  You  ask

it  ­­ it  talks  about  regulations  applicable  solely  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  lands.  But  is  ­­ is  ­­ is  that  all  Forest

the  same  as  Forest  Service  regulations?  Is  that  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  saying? 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  Forest  Service  regulations  are 

  

 

 

 

 

also  solely  enacted  to  manage  those  public  lands.

word  "solely"  out  of  the  statute,  you've  inadvertently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created  a  statute  which  says  none  of  these  private  lands 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  ANILCA  parks  are  subject  to  any  regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  to  public  lands. 

 

 

 

            

Now  surely,  Congress  is  not  trying  to  exempt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  lands  from  Clean  Water  Act,  Clean  Air  Act  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Maybe  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  FINDLEY:  That's  what  the  word  "solely" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  there  to  do. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  maybe  ­­ maybe  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

can  explain  that  to  me.  But  it  seems  to  me  that  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took  it  out  of  the  statute,  what  you  would  have  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  says  no  private  lands  shall  be  subject  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  regulations  applicable  to  public  lands.  And  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  you  should  want. 

 

 

 

            

If  ­­ if  it  had  said  that,  no  private  lands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall  be  subject  to  the  regulations  applicable  to  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands,  you  wouldn't  be  here.  You  would  have  won  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  already.  But  it  doesn't  say  that.  It  says,  "No 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  lands  shall  be  subject  to  the  regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  solely"  ­­ exclusively,  only  ­­ "to  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands." 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  Right.  And  again,  though, 

  

  

 

 

 

however,  you  take  out  the  word  "solely,"  not  only,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppose,  will  Mr.  Sturgeon  win,  but  you  have  a  lot  of

that  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  you're  saying  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

word  "solely"  distinguishes  between  statutes  like  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clean  Air  Act  and  park  land  statutes? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  Yes.  Absolutely.  That's 

  

  

  

 

what's  there  to  draw  that  line  in  the  sand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Because  I  understand  why 

   

  

 

 

Congress  might  have  wanted  to  distinguish  between,  like, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Clean  Air  Act  and  park  statutes.  But  putting  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word  "solely"  in,  I  got  to  say,  does  not  do  that  for  me. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  It  may  not  have  been  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfect  way  for  Congress  to  go  about  and  do  it,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  ­­

 

            

way. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  tell  me  the  imperfect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FINDLEY:  Well,  "solely." 

  

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  no.  How  does  that  do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that?  No,  seriously.  How  does  that  distinguish  between

one  generally  applicable  in  applying  to  park  lands  and

sense  of  applying  to  both  public  and  private  lands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  parks. 

 

            

MR.  FINDLEY:  Read  that  sentence  in  context 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  both  the  first  sentence  of  Section  103(c)  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third  sentence,  and  then  read  it  in  context  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

            

The  first  sentence  says  these  lands  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  park. 

 

 

 

            

The  second  sentence  is  doing  its  best  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  clear  these  lands  won't  be  regulated  as  though  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were. 

            

And  the  third  sentence  makes  clear  that  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  government  ­­ or  the  Park  Service,  excuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  ­­ wants  to  regulate  these  lands,  wants  them  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  park,  they  have  to  go  out  and  acquire  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  wouldn't  be  any  purpose  for  that  third  sentence  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  government  ­­ or,  excuse  me  ­­ the  Park 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Service  already  had  authority  of  those  nonpublic  lands. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  you  take  a  step  back  and  you  look  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  overall  purpose  of  the  statute  ­­ and  again  101(d) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  statute  makes  clear  that  this  is  a  balancing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  This  is  not  just  a  conservation  statute.  So

AS  AMICUS  CURIAE  FOR  ALASKA, 

 

 

 

 

                

SUPPORTING  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

            

MS.  BOTSTEIN:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  case  is  about  honoring  Congress's 

 

 

 

 

 

mandate  to  protect  Alaska's  sovereignty  in  the  face  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Park  Service's  rapidly­expanding  interpretation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

its  own  jurisdiction  under  ANILCA. 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress  provided  in  ANILCA  that  Alaska 

 

 

 

 

 

would  lose  over  100  million  acres  of  land.  But  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  time,  Congress  provided  concrete  protection  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  encroachments  on  the  lands  and  waters  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alaska  did  retain.  This  Court  should  reject  the  Park

that  Congress  chose. 

 

 

            

We  know  from  ANILCA  that  Congress  intended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  provide  unique  management  rules  for  Alaska,  and  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  good  reasons  for  that.  This  was  the  continuation  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  trilogy  of  legislation  that  began  with  the  Alaska 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Statehood  Act  and  the  Alaska  Native  Claims  Settlement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act,  and  this  piece  of  legislation  furthered  the  goals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  predecessors. 

 

 

            

One  purpose  of  the  statute  was  to  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate  opportunity  for  the  satisfaction  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic  and  social  needs  of  the  State  of  Alaska  and  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  And  Congress  explicitly  balanced  that  goal  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conservation  goals  and  the  goals  of  completing  the  land 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selections  within  the  States.  And  that  means  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

National  Park  Service's  authority  in  other  States  or  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  parks  are  not  the  baseline  here.  The  starting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  the  power  that  Congress  gave  to  the  National 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Park  Service  and  other  Land  Management  agencies  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating  ANILCA  parks. 

 

 

            

And  what  Congress  did  in  Section  103(c)  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  set  aside  the  inholdings  of  the  State,  private,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

native  corporation  lands  that  might  be  surrounded  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parks,  but  should  not  be  regulated  as  though  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact  part  of  the  parks.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right.  Now,  is 

  

  

 

 

 

there  any  basis  for  distinguishing  the  submerged  lands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  ­­ I  don't  know  what  to  call  it  ­­ from  the

understand  the  government's  argument  to  be  that  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated  the  same? 

 

 

            

MS.  BOTSTEIN:  I  understand  the  Park 

    

 

 

 

Service's  argument  to  be  that  the  ­­ the  submerged  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  waters  and  the  submerged  lands  have  somehow  become 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  lands.  I  mean,  I  understand  their  argument  here 

    

   

 

 

 

 

to  say,  well,  Section  103(c)  doesn't  apply  to  the  waters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  those  are,  in  fact,  not  Alaska's  waters.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  completely  wrong,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court's  cases  have  held  that  control 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  lands  and  waters  is  an  unmistakable  and  central 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  a  State  sovereignty. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  does  that  do  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  right  to  control,  whether  it's  titled  or  not, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  navigable  waters? 

 

 

            

MS.  BOTSTEIN:  Congress  possesses  a  right  to 

   

  

 

 

 

control  the  navigational  servitude,  and  that's  not  an

doesn't  delegate  the  authorization  to  control  navigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Park  Service  as  part  of  Park  Service  regulation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  even  the  Park  Service  isn't  asserting  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  has.  So  that  right  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Repeat  what  you  said.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

didn't  quite  hear  it  or  understand  it.  I'm  sorry.  Say 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  again. 

 

            

MS.  BOTSTEIN:  Your  Honor,  Congress  has  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

power  to  control  navigation  in  these  waters  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  of  the  navigational  servitude.  Congress  hasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

given  that  power  to  the  National  Park  Service.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  even  believe  they  are  asserting  that  it  has.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  what's  at  issue  here.

River  and  Harbors  Act  gives  the  Coast  Guard  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicit  delegation.

MS.  BOTSTEIN:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  The  Coast 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Guard  could  do  it.  We're  not  ­­

river  that's  in  the  middle  of  federally  owned  lands, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  cannot  happen  is  that  the  EPA  can't  come  in  and  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  some  terrible  pollution  in  this  river,  and  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  to  address  it.  That  would  be  off  limits?

couple  of  things  there.  I  mean,  first,  the  ­­ the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters  go  with  the  submerged  lands.  If  the  submerged 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands  pass  to  the  State  of  Alaska,  then  there  are  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands  that  are  going  to  be  State  owned  together  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

water  column  itself.  And  what  Section  103(c)  places 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits  on  is  the  Park  Service's  ability  to  regulate  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  same  fashion  it  wants  to  regulate  the  rest  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why?  I  mean  ­­

    

  

 

 

MS.  BOTSTEIN:  The  EPA  is  separate. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  Coast  Guard  can  do  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  EPA  can  do.  It's  only  the  Park  Service  that  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  it? 

 

            

MS.  BOTSTEIN:  Or  another  Land  Management 

  

 

 

 

 

agency  that  is  regulating  ­­ is  attempting  to  regulate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lands  and  waters  that  are  not  part  of  the  park  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  they  were  part  of  the  park.  We're  not  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  are  some  islands  of  lawlessness.  We're  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Park  Service  is  not  the  policeman  here,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  Congress  that  needs  to  give  an  agency  power  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulate  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  I  guess  part  of  my 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question  about  this  is,  I  look  at  that  map,  you  know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  map  of  this  area  has  all  this  green  land,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

green  represents  real  Federal  park  land,  and  there's  a

that  that  river  that  runs  through  the  park  land,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nobody  can  do  anything  on  ­­ or  the  Feds  can't  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  on?  I  mean,  this  isn't  the  inholdings.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  I  can  understand  the  argument  with  respect  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inholdings  and  the  rivers  that  are  running  through  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inholdings.  But  this  is  the  rivers  that  are  running 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  park  land. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  it  seems  to  me  a  very  strange  thing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  would  have  created  Federal  lands  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  park  land  but  said  that  the  Federal  Park  Service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  have  anything  to  do  with  the  rivers.  The  rivers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  like  an  important  part  of  the  park,  aren't  they? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BOTSTEIN:  The  rivers  are  an  important 

  

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  park,  but  the  control  over  the  rivers  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alaska's,  is  Alaska's  by  sovereign  right.  And  the  clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement  cases  of  the  Court  make  clear  that  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  lightly  or  vaguely  take  that  power  away  from  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  that  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  that's  not  true  as  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

navigable  waters.  The  Federal  government  can  regulate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

navigable  waters. 

 

            

MS.  BOTSTEIN:  It  can,  but  it  has  not  done 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  in  this  case.  ANILCA  does  not  talk  about  navigable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters.  It  does  not  talk  about  the  Commerce  Clause  to

agency's  ability  to  regulate  parks.  And  our  position  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  park  ­­ the  park  management  can't  encompass 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  waters  and  lands. 

 

 

 

            

And  there  are  good  reasons  that  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  that  choice.  Alaska's  waters  are  used  in  ways  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  different  from  the  lower  48  in,  for  example,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yukon  Flats  National  Wildlife  Refuge,  there  are  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

villages  of  less  than  one  hundred  people  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundreds  of  miles  from  any  road.  And  this  is  common  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alaska.  So  these  rivers  are  the  way  that  you  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

travel  to  get  medical  care  or  groceries  or  obtain  school 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

books  for  your  children.  And  Alaska's  ability  to  make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choices  about  what  sort  of  conduct  is  permissible  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rivers  furthers  its  ability  to  provide  economic  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­sufficiency  for  its  people,  which  was  one  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's  primary  goals  in  passing  this  legislation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  idea  that  the  creation  of  a  park  somehow 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

transforms  Alaska's  waters  into  Federal  waters,  Alaska 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands  into  Federal  lands  without  a  clear  statement  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dramatically  change  Alaska's  sovereign  ability  to 

 

 

 

 

 

control  its  property  in  a  way  that  this  Court  never  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanctioned  and  should  not  do  so  now. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  As  I  read  it  ­­ as  I  read

public.  You  know,  there's  some  houses  in  Yosemite  owned 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  private  people.  There  are  interior  regs  that  apply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  all  of  Yosemite,  such  as  certain  fireplace  regs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  are  some  that  only  apply  to  the  park  but  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  people.  What  this  statute  says  is  the  latter. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Doesn't  deprive  ­­ apply  to  that  land  that  you  gave  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alaska.  That's  what  the  statute  says. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And  what  the  reg  says  is  that  our  hovercraft 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reg  applies  to  everything  within  Yosemite,  if  this  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yosemite.  This  navigable  waters,  whether  the  land 

  

 

 

 

 

 

around  it  is  owned  by  James  Jones,  the  private  person, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  whether  it's  owned  ­­ whether  it's  part  of  Yosemite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Park.  That's  what  it  seemed  to  say  to  me. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  there  are  two  problems  with  what  I  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

read.  One  is  the  third  sentence  and  the  word  "unit." 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  second  problem  is  the  NPS,  the  National  Park 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Service,  is  it  really  all  of  Yosemite,  you  know,  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  private  thing  or  is  it  just  the  public  part? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that's  at  least  a  sorry.  I  shouldn't

I  don't  actually  think  it's  all  that  complicated,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  Analytically,  the  Court  would  first  look  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enabling  legislation  that  creates  a  specific  park.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  case  of  Yosemite,  there's  actually  a  clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

congressional  indication  that  says  the  Park  Service  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sole  and  exclusive  jurisdiction  over  park  lands. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  not  what  we  have  here.  Here  we  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  to  ANILCA  and  specifically  the  limitations  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  103(c),  which  tell  the  Park  Service,  in  fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  cannot  manage  State  and  private  lands  as  though  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  public  lands.

didn't  simultaneously  strip  the  Park  Service  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preexisting  authorities  to  achieve  those  goals  by

those  preexisting  authorities  are  and  why  they  let  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Park  Service  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  before  you  get  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that,  could  we  begin  with  what  the  Ninth  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided? 

            

You're  entitled  to  defend  the  judgment  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  ground  that  you  like,  but  ­­ that  was  presented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below,  but  the  only  issue  we  have  to  ­­ we  have  to  reach 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  correctness  of  the  Ninth  Circuit's  decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  understand  what  the  Ninth  Circuit  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

have  held,  to  be  this,  that  the  hovercraft  rule  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barred  by  the  second  sentence  of  Section  103(c)  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ANILCA,  because  the  hovercraft  rule  does  not  apply  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Alaska,  because  it  applies  throughout  the  country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  that  ­­ that's  a  correct  understanding  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  held? 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  I  actually  think  they  were 

    

 

 

 

 

saying  two  things.  I  think  you're  right  that  they  were 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  hovercraft  rule  isn't  covered  by  the  second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence.  But  I  think  they  say  this  rule  is  out  for  two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons:  One  is  that  conservation­specific  unit,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  is  ­­ and  I  direct  you  to  24a  and  26a  ­­ they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk  about  whether  the  regulation  is  generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  or  not.  And  I  take  that  to  mean,  essentially

whether  it  applies  only  on  public  lands,  in  which  case

rules  that  the  Park  Service  is  allowed  to  write  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  that  Justice  Breyer  alludes  to,  to  apply  to  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  and  private  lands. 

 

 

 

            

Service's  ­­

 

            

And  so  if  I  could  just  explain  the  Park 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  no.  I  want  to  ­­ I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

understand  the  ­­ the  holding  ­­ and  I  ­­ I  stand  ready 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  corrected  ­­ to  be  what  I  stated:  That  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hovercraft  rule  is  not  barred  because  it  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alaska­specific. 

            

And,  I  mean,  you  filed  a  58­page  brief  and, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

as  I  read  it,  you  didn't  get  to  the  reason  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth  Circuit  based  its  decision  on  until  page  49,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  devoted  exactly  a  paragraph  to  it. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  why  don't  you  concede  that  it's  wrong? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  a  ridiculous  interpretation,  is  it  not? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  We  think  we  have  two  much

I  think  they  start  with  that  Federal  lands, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  defined  under  the  statute,  are  only  lands  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.  has  title  to. 

 

 

 

            

Do  you  take  ­­ do  you  disagree  with  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  so,  why? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  We  think  public  lands  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

slightly  more  expansive  than  that.  Public  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

statute  ­­

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How?  Read  the 

  

  

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ and  ­­ and  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  me  how  ­­

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ in  the  statute  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ you  can  read  it  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadly. 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Sure.  So  the  ­­ in  the

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  going  ­­ I'm  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  section. 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes.  So  we're  on  3a  of  our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix,  and  it  defines  public  lands  to  mean  lands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situated  in  Alaska,  which  are  Federal  lands.  So  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  look  to  the  Federal  lands.  And  Federal  lands

means  lands  which  the  title  is  held  by  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 

            

And  then  "lands"  is  defined  ­­ and  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  critical  portion  for  us.  "Lands"  is  defined  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  not  just  lands  and  waters,  but  also  interests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therein. 

            

And  what  we  get  from  that,  Your  Honor,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  public  lands  includes  interests  in  water  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  holds  title  to. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  in  other 

  

 

 

 

 

words,  the  interests  aren't  the  title.  This  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidiary.  It's  ­­ it's  water  that  the  U.S.  holds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

title  to  and  interests  in  that  water,  even  though  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  reflected  in  the  title? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  We  agree  the  U.S.  has  to  hold 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

title  to  the  interest.  It  has  to  be  a  property  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It  has  to  hold  title 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  interest. 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  That's  right,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  that's  where  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  stumbled  in  your  argument,  because  you're  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claiming  title  to  the  submerged  land.  It's  clear  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  State  ­­

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  That's  right.

You're  ­­ you  ­­ you  rely  on  the  reserved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

water  right. 

 

            

Is  that  ever  expressed  as  "title,"  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed  to  a  ­­ the  words  ­­ "usufructuary  right"? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Usufructuary  right  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

property  interest,  so  it  is  something  you  can  hold  title 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to.  And  one  place  you  see  that  is  in  the  Mohawk 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Power  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Yes,  but  holding  title  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  different  from  holding  title  to  the  water. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  you're  ­­ you're 

  

 

 

 

 

telling  us  that  the  river,  that  the  government  holds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

title  to  the  river.  It  doesn't.  It  has  usufructuary 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights  in  the  river. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  No.  We're  saying,  as  ­­ as 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor  articulated  it  correctly,  that  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  holds  title  to  an  interest  in  the  water. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  different  from 

  

 

 

 

holding  title  to  the  water. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  I  agree.  And  the  question  is, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

if  we  hold  title  to  an  interest  in  the  water,  how  broad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  interest,  and  what  does  it  let  us  regulate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  interest  has  been  defined  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation.  And  ­­ and  consistent  with  the  statements

of  what  this  land  is  being  reserved  for,  it's  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  that  we  hold  over  the  entirety  of  the  water. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  permits  us  to  regulate  the  water. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  I  think  one  way  you  know  that  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  it's  just  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

I'm  sorry  to  pause  ­­ pause  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  understood  with  reserve  water  doctrine  is 

 

 

 

 

 

usually,  you  know,  we  need  water  to  do  this,  so  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  ­­ we  have  a  reserve  right  to  40  percent  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

water,  or  the  initial  flow,  or  whatever.  I've  never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  of  it  as  a  basis  for  general  regulatory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority. 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  So  I  think  that  move  is  made  by 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ANILCA,  the  statute.  It's  ANILCA­specific,  because 

  

 

 

 

 

ANILCA  says  if  you  hold  title  to  an  interest,  like  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserved  water  right  interest,  then  that  is  a  public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

land,  and  it  can  be  regulated  as  public  lands. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  if  ­­ if  there's  questions  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  with  you  so  far. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

That  gets  you  to  regulating  the  waters  in  Federal  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  ­­ in  Federal  units,  because  the  U.S.  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ANILCA  only  controls  lands  within  the  conservation  units 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  public  lands. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes.

that  the  position  you're  taking,  that  you  have  the  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  regulate  that  as  well? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  No.  The  hovercraft  rule  only 

  

  

 

 

 

 

applies  on  public  lands,  and  so  it  doesn't  apply  on

MS.  KOVNER:  So  it's  written  to  apply  in  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

places. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  mean,  it  could  be  the

was  wrong. 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  No.  Your  ­­ Your  Honor,  it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

written  to  apply  in  two  places.  The  first  is  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federally­owned  lands,  and  the  second  is  on  ­­ on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

navigable  waters. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  thought  the  navigable 

    

 

 

 

waters  are  not.  They're  on  John  Jones's  property.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  still  have  the  authority  to  regulate  them,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  regulation  that  does  it  is  not  a  regulation  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  solely  to  public  lands. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  That's  right.  And  Your  Honor, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

so  it's  like  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  that  right?  Because  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

just  seemed  to  say  the  opposite  a  minute  ago. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  No.  So  the  ­­ the  way  that  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  are  written  as  ­­ it's  1.2,  and  it  ­­ it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  they  apply  in  two  places:  Federally­Owned  lands, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  also  on  navigable  waters  that  are  within  the  parks. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  navigable  waters  that 

  

 

 

 

 

are  within  the  boundaries  of  the  National  Park  Service. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  That's  right.  That's  right. 

  

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  like  John  Jones's

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes.

MS.  KOVNER:  Well,  I  think  the  ­­ the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

difficulty  is,  Your  Honor,  we  think  that  the  navigable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters  are  not  like  John  Jones's  house.  We  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  Federal  lands. 

 

 

            

But  if  Your  Honor  is  to  assume  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Either  way,  you  say  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

win.  Either  they  are  Federal  lands  and  this  is  part  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  reg  that  applies  to  Federal  lands;  or  they  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  lands,  in  which  case  this  reg  applies  to  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonfederal  and  ­­ I  mean  nonpublic  lands  and  public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands.  So  it's  not  within  the  second  sentence. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  that  your  argument? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  That  is  right.  And  so  if  we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  talk  about  what  that  sentence  means,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming  ­­

right,  I  mean,  it  ­­ it  ­­ it's  right  because  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  do  these  things  apply  solely  to  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands.  And  you  say,  well,  the  second  sentence  doesn't

That's  not  a  very  significant  protection  for 

   

 

 

 

 

the  inholders. 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  I  ­­ I  think  it  is.  And  the 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

reason  is  that  we  have  very  limited  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulate  things  that  are  inholdings.  And  in  particular, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  are  acting  here  pursuant  to  an  express  grant  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  regulate  waters  within  the  parks.  In

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  you  ­­ you  want  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk  about  waters,  and  ­­ and  after  this  question  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

won't  say  anything  more  on  this,  but  is  the  Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's  holding  limited  to  waters?  The  ­­ the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Alaska  on  page  20  and  21  of  their  brief  cite  a  notice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Federal  Register  by  the  Park  Service  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  defend  the  regulation  of  nonfederal  oil  and  gas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activities  on  the  basis  of  Sturgeon,  on  the  ground  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  103(c)  of  ANILCA  applies  only  to  Alaska­specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations.  And  since  these  are  not  Alaska­specific, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

those  ­­ those  regulations  apply. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  they  understand  it  to  apply  to  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  just  navigable  waters.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It's  solely  to  apply  to

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ within  such  unit? 

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  KOVNER:  We  just  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Solely  to  apply  to  nonpublic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

units  to  lands  in  Alaska. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  That  ­­ if  that's  how  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor  understands  the  Ninth  Circuit's  ruling. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  regulation,  the  20­year  regulation  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

alluding  to,  says  if  it's  a  rule  that  applies  to  both 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  and  private  lands,  then  it's  not  covered  by  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision. 

            

And  just  to  be  clear,  we  have  very  limited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  regulate  private  lands.  So  it's  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plenary  ­­ this  ­­ this  provision  doesn't  grant  us  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability  to  regulate  privately  held  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Let's  ­­ let's  talk  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your  authority.  I  don't  even  get  to  the  second 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence.  I  just  get  to  the  first  sentence.  The

"prescribe  such  regulations  necessary  or  proper  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  and  management  of  system  units,  including  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerning  boating  and  other  activities.  Only  here  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CSU's  are  park  system  units." 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  13.013(c).  As  a  result,  non­Federal 

   

  

 

 

holdings  unambiguously  fall  outside  the  scope  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Secretary's  authority  because  of  the  first  sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Only  those  lands  within  the  boundaries  of  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conservation  system  unit  which  are  public  lands  as  such

included  as  a  portion  of  such  unit." 

   

 

 

 

 

            

If  it's  not  within  the  unit,  it's  not  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  basic  authority  of  the  Park  Service  to  issue

don't  think  you  can  show.  Nobody  holds  title  to  the

I  agree  that  this  is  outside  of  that.  And  as  a  result 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  authority  to  prescribe  rules  for  this  land  is  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  You're  ­­ you're 

  

  

 

 

 

conceding  that  the  waters  are  outside  of  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  I'm  conceding  ­­ well,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  ­­ our  first  argument,  Your  Honor,  is  that  no, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  are  public  lands.  But  if  ­­ I  think  Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Scalia's  premise  is  what  is  our  authority  to  regulate  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  not  public  lands.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  want  to  focus  on  provision  (b),  okay, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  just  the  language  of  provision  (b).  It  has  always 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  understood  to  allow  us  to  regulate  waters  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  boundaries  of  the  parks  regardless  of  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owns  them.  And  who  owns  them  is  always  going  to  be  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  under  Petitioner's  theory  no  matter  where  we  are. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  just  to  focus  on  the  language  of  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  very  specific  express  grant  of  authority  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulate  waters  within  parks.  It  says  we  can  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Park  Service  can  enact  rules,  quote,  "concerning  boating

have  a  valley  that's  a  public  land,  and  that  valley 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

traverses  the  boundary  of  the  unit.  Some  of  it's  inside 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  some  of  it's  outside. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  only  those  lands  within  the  boundaries

public  lands  shall  be  deemed  to  be  included  as  a  portion 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  unit. 

 

 

            

So  the  only  part  of  that  valley  that  it's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portion  of  the  unit  is  that  part  of  the  valley  that's

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  that  what  it  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  it  must  mean  something  like  that.  If  it  doesn't

think  we  look  at  the  text  and  what  does  the  text  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  text  says  you  can't  apply  on  lands  that  were

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  the  subtitle  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes.  And  so  just  ­­ I  think 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy  was  making  this  ­­ this  distinction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  it's  exactly  the  right  distinction.  Is  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  this  authority  one  that  gives  the  Park  Service  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability  to  regulate  lands  whether  they  are  public  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private? 

            

And  if  you  look  at  the  text,  it  does.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  result,  this  is  not  a  regulation  ­­ if  you  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  waters  within  the  parks  are  private  lands,  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  kind  of  regulation  that's  carved  out  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text.  Just  giving  meaning  to  the  word  solely,  that  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  correct. 

 

 

            

And  if  you  also  look  to  other  provisions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute,  it  confirms  it  in  two  ways,  if  I  could  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focuses  on  two  of  them. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  first  is,  if  you  look  at  the  management 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  of  the  statute  of  ANILCA,  it  expressly  contemplates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Park  Service  is  going  to  be  able  to  regulate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  lands  under  some  circumstances.  And  it  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  by  saying,  you  need  your  management  plan  to

describe  the  activities  that  are  occurring  on  private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands  and  to  describe  any  methods  you're  going  to  use  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  methods  you're  going  to  use  to  control  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activities,  including,  quote,  "issuance  or  enforcement 

 

 

 

 

 

of  regulations." 

 

            

            

And  just  the  other  thing  I  think  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  if  I'm  looking  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  section,  I  mean,  I  would  have  thought  that  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

was  key  to  your  argument,  because  it  says  in  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

management  plans  what  you  need  is  a  ­­ is  a  "description 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  privately  owned  areas  which  are  within  such  unit." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  it's  clearly  contemplating  that  there  are  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  areas  that  are  within  the  unit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  as  you  say,  it  goes  on  and  says  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  in  these  plans  some  idea  of  what  regulations  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  applying  on  those  private  lands  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unit. 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  That's  right,  Your  Honor.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

if  I  could  just  focus  on  the  one  other  part  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  that  confirms  that  this  reading  is  correct,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Park  Service  isn't  being  stripped  of  its  preexisting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  regulate  rivers.  It's  if  you  look  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  provisions  of  the  statute  that  very  clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confirm  the  Park  Service  is  going  to  have  the  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  regulate  rivers.  And  let  me  just  give  two  examples

of  those. 

 

            

The  first  is,  when  Congress  is  setting  aside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

land  for  parks  ­­ and  let  me  use  the  park  here  as  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  ­­ it  states  it's  ­­ its  purposes.  So  it  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"We  are  creating  here  the  Yukon­Charley  Rivers  Preserve. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  our  purposes  are  to  ensure  the  protection  of," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote,  "the  entire  Yukon­Charley  basin,  including  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lakes  and  the  streams.  So  that  provision  confirms  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  is  contemplating  by  setting  aside  this  land  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parks,  we're  going  to  have  this  preexisting  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulate  waters  within  the  parks  still  in  place. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  just  one  other  example  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  is  the  Wild  and  Scenic  River  Act  provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  in  the  statute.  And  Congress  sets  aside  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  type  of  conservation  system  unit  wild  and  scenic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rivers.  These  are  entirely  composed  of  rivers.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

says,  Park  Service,  you  are  supposed  to  protect  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to  your  Organic  Act  authority  in  these  wild  and

Park  Service  regulation.  What  ­­ what  are  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

protections? 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes.  So  I  want  to  make  clear, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

our  authority  is  very  narrow,  and  we  can  only  regulate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there  is  some  statute  that  authorizes  us  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulate  inholdings  and  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Do  you  ­­ do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  statute  that  authorizes  you  to  regulate  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  that  says  "the  Secretary  shall  prescribe  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  as  the  Secretary  considers  necessary  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper"?  Would  you  ­­

  

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  We're  principally  relying  on 

  

 

 

 

 

the  one  right  below  that,  (b). 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rely  on  that  one?  Because  if  you  rely  on  that  one,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  see  that  it  provides  any  protections  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  So  let  me  tell  you  how  ­­ how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  first  one  has  been  interpreted  and  why  it  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  protections.  So  that  first  provision  has  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted  to  allow  the  Secretary  to  regulate  private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands  when  doing  so  is  necessary  for  the  protection  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  system  units. 

 

 

            

And  so,  for  example,  if  the  Park  Service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulates  some  activity  on  private  lands  that  is  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  cause  danger  or  harm  to  the  system  units  that's  ­­

that  adjoins  them,  that's  the  only  circumstance  in  which

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  danger  ­­ danger

limited  to  scenic,  environmental,  noise  impacts? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  We  think  it's  clear  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Park  Service  can't  simply  treat  inholdings  as  though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  public  lands.  And  the  only  case  in  which  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Park  Service  has  tried  to  use  its  authority  to  regulate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inholdings  under  that  provision  is  this  case  where  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  going  to  be  some  kind  of  harm  to  the  actual  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lands  that  befalls  the  park's  units.  But  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  is  that  true  even  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  ­­ the  regulation  is  nation  ­­ applicable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide? 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  We  think  that  nationwide,  yes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Park  Service's  authority  to  regulate  inholdings  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  limited. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  ­­ so  if  ­­ because  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  true,  then  I  don't  know  what  ­­ then  you  disagree 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  Ninth  Circuit  on  the  meaning  that  it  gave  ­­

MS.  KOVNER:  I  think  that  we  think  ­­ and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  said  for  20  years  in  a  regulation  that's  entitled

does  is  it  carves  out  the  rules  that  are  applicable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solely  to  public  lands.  And  because  our  authority  is  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited,  that's  most  rules.  It's  only  under  very  narrow 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  that  we  can  write  rules  that  apply  to  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  and  private  lands. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  but  your 

  

 

 

 

 

authority  is  not  limited  if  you  get  Chevron  deference. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  you  get  Chevron  deference  on  determining  what  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  is  necessary  or  proper,  the  idea  that  that's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  circumscription  of  your  authority  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

seem  to  me  to  be  a  valid  one. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  I  don't  think  so.  I  mean, 

    

    

 

 

 

there's  a  ­­ it's  been  a  very  long­standing  limitation 

   

   

 

 

 

 

on  how  this  has  been  construed  that  we're  not  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  the  kinds  of  regulations  I've  described  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pervasive  regulation.  There  might  be,  if  we  tried  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret  our  authority  under  this  section  more  broadly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  might  be  a  clear  statement  problem  then,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  certainly  no  clear  statement  problem  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  More  broadly?  Interpret 

  

  

 

 

necessary  or  proper  ­­ necessary  or  proper  to  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  or  proper?  You  think  it's  beyond  belief  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  going  to  do  that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  I  ­­ I  do.  And  when  the

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Some  might  argue  that 

  

 

 

 

 

your  proposed  regulations  on  oil  contravene  the  intent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  this  provision. 

 

 

            

 

So  assuming  we  do,  how  do  you  deal  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that?  Assuming  some  people  do.  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  know 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes.  I  ­­ I  think  Your  Honor 

    

   

  

 

 

 

is  right,  that  some  people  might  say  that  that's  not  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  regulation,  and  they  will  be  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  it  nationwide  as  not  an  appropriate  exercise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  our  authority. 

 

 

            

But  what's  never  been  disputed  in  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that,  in  general,  under  the  1976  Act,  this  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  authorization  of  the  Park  Service  to  regulate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters  within  units,  we  have  the  authority  to  regulate

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  can  you  do  about  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  provision  that  you  ­­ you  reproduce  on  7a  gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around  the  first  section  of  103(c)?  This  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  allows  regulation  of  waters  within  Service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

units,  but  the  first  section,  as  I  read  it,  says  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonpublic  land  within  the  boundaries  of  ­­ of  a  CSU  is

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes.  So  I  think  the  statutory 

   

  

  

 

 

 

authorization  is  actually  slightly  broader.  And  just  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  the  language,  it's  concerning  boating  or  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activities  on  or  relating  to  waters  located  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  units.  And  that's  always  been  understood  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow  the  regulation  of  all  the  waters  in  system  units, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regardless  of  their  ownership.  And  I  think  it  makes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

sense,  because  you  can't  regulate  or  protect  a  river 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

piecemeal,  stretch  by  stretch. 

 

 

 

            

If  Congress  ­­ when  Congress  set  aside  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rivers  and  said  the  Park  Service  is  going  to  be  able  to

protecting  the  rivers  and  streams  and  basins  that  are

is  limited  by  what  Congress  has  said  about  Alaska.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  sentence  says,  "Only  those  lines  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boundaries  of  any  CSU  which  are  public  lands  shall  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deemed  to  be  included  as  a  portion  of  such  unit." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  if  you  read  that  back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  100751,  it  seems  to  me  the  Park  Service  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  jurisdiction. 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  No.  So  we  agree,  Your  Honor, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  specific  governs  the  general,  and  so  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  give  effect  to  that  first  sentence.  And  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  first  sentence  says  is  they  can't  be  treated  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  not  part  of  the  unit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  then  we  look  to  the  Park  Service's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorities  and  we  say,  does  the  Park  Service's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  depend  on  this  water  being  part  of  the  unit? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  answer  is  no.  If  you  look  at  (b),  it's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  to  impose  rules  concerning  boating  and  ­­

and  100501. 

 

            

So  if  we  ­­ Justice  Scalia's  point  is  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  take  the  private  land,  the  in­holdings,  and  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  not  part  of  the  unit;  only  the  public  lands  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  unit  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  KOVNER:  That's  ­­

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What's  the  response  to

don't  apply  ­­

MS.  KOVNER:  And  I  think  that's  not  correct. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

There's  this  distinction  between  what's  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boundaries  of  the  park  and  what  is  park  lands.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  ­­ Your  Honor,  this  is  established  in  Section  103, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

among  other  places,  where  it  talks  about  whether  land  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  boundaries  of  the  system  unit  ­­

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Ah. 

  

 

MS.  KOVNER:  ­­ versus  being  within  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  you're  saying  it  applies 

  

 

 

 

 

 

within  ­­ it  is  within  the  boundaries  of  the  unit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

although  the  unit  consists  of  just  the  public  land.  Who

Section  103  strips  that  authority. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  Your  Honor,  I  would  just  ask  the  Court

statute,  it  could  limit  or  expand  103  as  it  chose,

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Let's  say  that  part  of  a

question  of  what  is  public  lands,  which  is  a  question

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.  So  what  do

MS.  KOVNER:  So  we  think  there  are  ­­ we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  two  stronger  arguments,  but  we  think  part  of  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Ninth  Circuit  said  was  the  second  sentence  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits  rules  that  are  specific  to  conservation  system 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

units.  And  "conservation  system  units"  is  defined  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  to  be  parks  units  in  Alaska. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  think,  yes,  the  plain  text  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  only  limits  those  kinds  of  rules.  We  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  Court  needs  to  reach  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Do  you  think  the  Ninth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  was  right? 

 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  if  there's  a  rule  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

applies  to  conservation  ­­ it  applies  to  Alaska,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  to  the  National  Mall,  that  would  be  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  have  a  Hovercraft  in  Alaska  or  in  the  tidal  basin. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Under  the  Ninth  Circuit's  ­­ the  Ninth  Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale,  that  would  be  107  ­­ 103  ­­ 103(c)  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buy  that. 

 

            

MS.  KOVNER:  I  don't  think  there's  any 

    

 

 

 

 

dispute  that's  what  the  plain  text  says.  And  the  reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't  think  that's  ridiculous  or  irrational,

was  a  very  well­settled  regulatory  regime  that  didn't

It's  about  to  be  surrounded  by  these  ANILCA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parks.  It's  worth  taking  a  step  back.  What  does  1  ­­

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

Section  103(c)  doing?  It  is  saying  before  ANILCA  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed,  you're  not  part  of  the  park  and  you're  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  Park  Service  regulation.  The  day  after 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ANILCA  was  part  ­­ excuse  me.  The  day  after  ANILCA  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed,  you're  still  not  part  of  the  park  and  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  not  subject  to  Park  Service  regulation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  government's  position  here,  they  keep 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  their  authority  is  limited,  and  Mr.  Chief  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hit  the  nail  on  the  head.  They're  relying  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Organic  Act  which  allows  them  to  enact  any  regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  feel  necessary  at  any  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

They've  already  done  that  with  the  9(b)  oil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  gas  regulations,  seeking  to  apply  those  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­Federal  land  within  Alaska.  And  the  hits  are  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  keep  on  coming  unless  this  Court  stops  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  and  goes  back  to  what  103(c)  was  meant  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do,  which  was  to  prevent  the  Park  Service  from  taking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  lands  that  aren't  owned  by  the  government  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating  them  as  though  they  are  part  of  the  park.

You  will  not  find  the  term  navigable  waters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  statute  once. 

 

 

 

            

Let's  contrast  this  to  other  park­enabling 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation.  This  is  for  Olympic  National  Park,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'll  find  this  at  16  U.S.C.  251(n).  And  here's  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  says:  "The  boundary  of  Olympic  National  Park 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Washington  is"  ­­ if  I  may  just  finish  the  quote  ­­ "is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hereby  revised  to"  ­­ "is  hereby  revised  to  include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  park  all  submerged  lands  and  waters  of  Lake 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ozette,  Washington,  and  the  Ozette  River, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Washington." 

            

There's  your  clear  statement. 

 

 

 

            

Thank  you. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank 
 

  

 

 

you,  counsel. 

 

            

Case  is  submitted. 

 

 

            

(Whereupon,  at  12:21  p.m.,  the 
 

 

 

 

 

case  in  the 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
