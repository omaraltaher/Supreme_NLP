 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

Offshore v. Valladolid. 
 Mr. Clement. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

1

3
4  first this morning in Case 10-507, Pacific Operators 
5

11
 The straightforward question in this case is 
12  whether the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides a 
13  remedy for a worker injured in a forklift mishap on dry 
14  land.  The answer is no.  A worker injured on dry land 
from operations on dry land has a remedy in the State 
15
16  workers' compensation law, but not from OCSLA's 
17  extension of the Longshore Act to the outer continental 
18  shelf.  Indeed, both the Benefits Review Board and the 
19  Ninth Circuit here held that the accident occurred too 
far inland for direct coverage under the Longshore Act. 
20
21
22  land, do you -- where do you put the 3-mile State 
23  offshore limit?  Does that count as land under your 
24  view?
25

 MR. CLEMENT:  No, it wouldn't count as land, 

please the Court: 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you say on

 So, therefore, the counterintuitive 

1  Mr. Chief Justice.  If there were platforms on there 
2  that were themselves treated as land, that might be.  I 
3  think most of the 3 miles from shore is going to be the 
4  navigable waters, and that might be covered, for 
example, directly under the Longshore Act.  But as I 
5
6  say, one of the anomalies here is there was a direct 
7  Longshore Act claim in this case, and the determination 
8  was that the facility here was too far inland for direct 
9  coverage under the Longshore Act.
10
11  proposition on the other side of the table today is that 
12  in extending the Longshore Act to the outer continental 
13  shelf, Congress effectively created a boomerang effect 
14  that caused the Longshore Act to apply further inland 
15
16
17  up on the Chief Justice's question, if there's a 
18  helicopter crash in the water, let's say it occurs 2.5 
19  miles from the shore, is that covered?  And, similarly, 
20
21  shore? 
22
23  the best answer is both of those crashes would be 
24  covered directly by the Longshore Act because the 
25

Longshore Act by its own terms, not extended by OCSLA, 

would it be covered if it occurred 3.5 miles from the 

than it otherwise would. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, just to follow 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, I think

1  covers the navigable waters, and both of those would be 
2  accidents occurring in the navigable waters.  And in the 
3  part of this Court's opinion in the Pacific Operators 
4  case addressing the DOHSA claim, this Court said that a 
helicopter effectively, when it's performing this kind 
5
6  of ferrying function, is a vessel.  So, I would think 
7  that the right answer there is not that OCSLA extends 
8  the Longshore Act, but the Longshore Act applies 
9  directly under those circumstances.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  The curious thing about this 
10
11  case is that the statutory language seems to me to speak 
12  quite clearly to some theory of causation.  Any injury 
13  occurring as the result of operations conducted on the 
14  outer continental shelf.  That's -- that's causation. 
15
16  -- some species of causation.  And yet, nobody wants 
17  this really to be -- neither you nor your adversary nor 
18  the Government wants this to be a -- to be based on 
19  causation.  Everyone wants to smuggle something else 
20
21
22  talk first about the causation and then about the 
23  smuggling, if I can.  As to the causation, I think there 
24  is both causation in this 1333(b) and a situs 
25

Maybe it's but-for, maybe it's proximate, but it's some 

requirement that both sides acknowledge.  At a bare 

into -- into here -- into this. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Alito, let me

beachcombers out there, or what? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Give me an example of a --

 But let me address the smuggling, because I 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think the best example 

1  minimum, there have to be injuries resulting from
 
2  operations conducted on the shelf.  And I think that
 
3  alone, that causation principle alone, if faithfully
 
4  applied, is enough to decide this case in our favor.

5
6  do think --
7
8  of an injury that occurs on the shelf that is not a 
9  consequence of operations conducted.  What -- just 
10
11
12  would be, Your Honor -- is somebody who's on the shelf 
13  but they're not employed in the relevant production 
14  purposes.  And so, you might have an --
15
16 
17
18  accountant out there.  You might just have some 
19  employees who are out there whale watching or something.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many accountants go 
20
21  to platforms? 
22
23  think it's worth recognizing -- I mean, I don't know how 
24  many go.  I doubt very many go.  But Congress passed 
this statute at a time when they didn't know the full 
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What are they doing out 

there? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, you might have an 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

there that are designed for the production of the 

this person one who regularly works on the outer 
continental shelf.  And the -- this worker, we're told, 
was on the outer continental shelf 98 percent of the 
time. 

1  scope of the operations that would take place out on the 
2  shelf.  And so, what they're trying to do is they're 
3  trying to -- at the one point, they're trying to limit 
4  it to employees who are engaged in the operations out 
5
6  mineral wealth of the shelf.  And so, I think that's 
7  what some of the language is directed at. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if that -- if that's 
8
9  what Congress meant, then the emphasis should be on is 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
on the outer continental shelf at the time of this 
15
16  accident, he probably wouldn't have been injured. 
17
 But the one thing I think the statute 
18  clearly speaks to is not status, but it speaks to, as 
19  Justice Alito suggested, at a minimum a relationship 
between the operations that caused the injury and the 
20
21  fact that those operations have to be conducted on the 
22  shelf. 
23
24
25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  And if he was at the --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Mr. --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if -- if you had said 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

rig to the land, to the base of operations that's 

1  status or situs, then it seems to me it would have made 
2  more sense, given the language of the statute.  We will 
3  all have hypotheticals.  We won't have too many, but 
4  it's quite common on oil rigs that the employees bring 
5
6  prepare it, and so that they can bring it back to the 
7  next -- the next shift on the rig.  And some of this 
8  machinery is complicated.  It has springs in it. 
9  Suppose that the worker brings the machine back from the 
10
11  land-based, and is injured in repairing that machine. 
12  Under your view, no coverage? 
13
14  think that --
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
 MR. CLEMENT:  No, I disagree, Your Honor, 
22  respectfully, and I think your way of looking at that 
23  hypothetical doesn't give sufficient import to the 
24  phrase "conducted on the shelf."  It's -- what 
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think that's quite 
difficult to square with the "as a result" language 
because this is a result of the operation.  Let's just 
say the machine got broken because of the -- of the 
operations, and there -- and he's fixing it and he's 
injured. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  No coverage, Your Honor, and I

 And so, that first "on the shelf" I think 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the 

your hypothetical would be that's covered. 

 But the statute very specifically says that 

1  statute as saying as long as there is an injury that 
2  results from operations that have the purpose of 
3  developing the outer continental shelf, that that's 
4  enough.  And if that were enough, I think the answer to 
5
6
7  they have to be injuries as a result of operations 
8  conducted on the shelf for the purpose of extracting the 
9  mineral wealth of the shelf.
10
11  clearly modifies the operations.  Only operations 
12  conducted on the shelf are --
13
14  Government and --
15
16
17  Ninth Circuit take care of that by saying that the 
18  person has to have -- the injured employee has to have 
19  spent substantial amount of time on the -- on the 
20
21
22  Honor, because if there's one thing that is absolutely 
23  clear about this statute it's that it doesn't include a 
24  status test that looks for the predominant place you 
25

MR. CLEMENT:  -- covered by the statute. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The Government and the 

offshore operations.  So, you could add that. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, you can't add that, Your

 MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  I mean, I have two 

of -- place of injury. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, I agree.  I thought 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- in your -- in your 

1
2  your reply brief, said you -- you superimpose a status 
3  test.  You have the situs of the injury, and then you 
4  superimpose status.  So, your test is not simple state 
5
6
7  you had a backup argument --
8
9
10
11
12  arguments, and let me try to address both, which is to 
13  say, on the causation point, if you look at just 
14  causation and you don't have a situs and a status 
15
16  get just a status test.  And the only thing I would 
17  implore you to think about in that is not only is it not 
18  in the statute, but there is a statute that has a 
19  status-based remedy that travels with the worker 
20
21  specifically is written in status terms.  And that was a 
22  model that Congress had before it, but it specifically 
23  rejected the admiralty model for dealing with these 
24  structures and adopted the model that has them treated

requirement, then in that scenario, there's no way to 

wherever they go.  It's the Jones Act, and it 

Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought your brief, 

as --

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  That's their status test, 

exactly. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- but you call that 

Jones Act case.  That just doesn't work.  This was not 
the Jones Act. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you call status --
1
2  if the test is where you spend a substantial amount of 
3  time working, is that what you call status? 
4
5
6
7  status? 
 MR. CLEMENT:  I call that their pure status 
8
9  test, which they themselves cite to Chandris, which is a 
10
11 
12
 Now, there is a test where we say that the 
13  best reading of the statute is status plus situs.  And 
14  if I could try to get this argument out -- it's a little 
15
16  argument, if it has one, is it doesn't leap out directly 
17  from 1333(b), and you have to read 1333(b) in 
18  conjunction with both the rest of 1333 and in 
19  conjunction with 903(a) of the Longshore Workers' Act. 
If you do that, I think you will see there is a situs 
20
21  requirement and a status requirement. 
22
23  you think about this statute, the primary engine for 
24  applying Federal law to the shelf is not 1333(b); it's 
1333(a).  It applies all of Federal law to the shelf. 
25

bit complicated, because I think the defect of this 

 Let me start with the rest of the 1333.  If

 But some statutes, it doesn't work, and the 

 One, it has this language that everyone's 

situs requirement that is limited to the navigable
 

1
2  Longshore Act is one of them.  If you apply the 
3  Longshore Act to the shelf without any modifications, it 
4  won't cover the shelf because it by its terms has a 
5
6  waters and at that point the drydocks.
 
7
 So, Congress has to tailor the longshore
 
8  remedy to the reality of the shelf, and it does it in
 
9  two ways.

10
11  focused on that is something of a status requirement in 
12  that it limits the recovery to employees who are engaged 
13  in certain activities.  But the rest of the language in 
14  1333(b) is important.  It's these definitions (1), (2), 
15
16  Longshore Act to make them work for purposes of 
17  extending it to the shelf. 
18
19  defines the term "United States" when used in a 
20
21  shelf, the artificial islands, and the fixed attachments 
22  thereto.  Now, that's a puzzle if you look at 1333(b) in 
23  isolation, because it's defining the term "United 
24  States" for geographical purposes, and 1333(b) does not 
use the term "United States" for geographical purposes. 
25

geographical sense, and it defines it to include the 

and (3), and they effectively define terms in the

petition appendix.  But that's the situs requirement. 

1  But another statute does; it's 903.  It's the longshore 
2  remedy that's extended. 
3
4  And 903(a), if you want to look at, is at page 96 of the 
5
6  The situs requirement of 903(a) unmodified limits 
7  recovery to the navigable waters and drydocks.  So, if 
8  you take that definition from (b)(3) and essentially 
9  superimpose it on 903(a), you then get a remedy that has 
a situs requirement; there's a recovery, but only if the 
10
11 
injury occurs on the navigable waters, drydocks, the 
12 
shelf, artificial islands, and the attachments thereto. 
13
14  argument, and it doesn't stare you in the face if you 
15
16
17  that -- how does that provide you situs on the adjacent 
18  waters? 
19
Justice Sotomayor, I think you get that without OCSLA, 
20
21  which is to say I think that there's a remedy under the 
22  Longshore Act directly under the adjacent waters because 
23  the adjacent waters are navigable waters. 
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I see.  So, you're 

saying you don't even -- you're not going --

 MR. CLEMENT:  I don't -- with respect, 

 So it's -- as I say, it's a complicated 

look at 1333(b) --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  How does 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. CLEMENT:  Same way, Your Honor, which is 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Instead of saying 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Exactly, and they're not.  And 

them. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, how do you get to 

 MR. CLEMENT:  You don't need those, and that 
1
2  just underscores that Congress in the statute is really 
3  dealing with a very particular problem with the shelf 
4  and the artificial islands and platforms attached to 
5
6
7  the water above the shelf? 
8
9  to say they're navigable waters.
10
11  they're part of the shelf? 
12
13  the statute I think couldn't be clearer about that 
14  because 1332 --
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22 
23 
24

Justice Kennedy was alluding to was the example the 
Ninth Circuit used:  A pitcher on the mound throws a 
baseball and hits the batter.  The situs is not the 
mound, but the injury has occurred as a result of 
pitching.  And so, he's coming up with examples, and I 
think that's what the Ninth Circuit was saying when it 
was creating the test of a substantial nexus between the 
operation and the injury. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I'm --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's the part of 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think the issue that 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. CLEMENT:  And if I could take that --

there's a couple of pieces to that, Justice Sotomayor. 

1  your -- of your definition that gives no credence to 
2  that possibility. 
3
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well -- and I --
4
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You may be arguing that 
as a factual matter what this man was doing on land was 
5
6  not a substantial nexus.  That's a different issue than 
7  providing a test that limits injury to an operation 
8  solely on the shelf. 
9
10
11  First of all, I would say that I think that the 
12  hypothetical, let's say, of, you know, a nut or 
13  something coming off the shelf and hitting somebody 
14  somewhere else is -- illustrates the difference between 
15
16
17  the nut hits somebody in the navigable waters, they 
18  wouldn't recover from OCSLA; they would recover under 
19  the Longshore Act directly because they were on the 
20
21
22  proximate cause test, then I would say, yes, that person 
23  can recover under OCSLA, but that's really a fortuitous 
24  set of circumstances precisely because I wouldn't apply 
25

a substantial nexus test, which seems to me just an 

our primary argument and our backup argument. 

 On our primary argument, somebody who -- if

6  want a proximate cause test. 
7
8  proximate cause test as long as it's a proximate cause 
9  test that's tailored to the statute.  And what I mean by 
10
11 
12 
13
14  case like this, you have to ask yourself not just 
15
16  operations somewhere other than the shelf that were a 
17  more direct proximate cause of the injury?  And if 
18  that's the case, then the remedy lies in the law that 
19  applies to those other operations.

 And I think -- in particular, I think in a

 MR. CLEMENT:  What's that? 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is a new version of 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, you know, it's -- it's 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

for purposes of this statute, that should be right. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Clement, I don't really 
understand proximate cause as applied to a -- a statute 

1  funny because, you know, this Court has on more than one 
2  occasion sort of remarked that "proximate cause" itself 
3  is a weird formulation because "proximate" sounds like 
4  it has a location aspect to it.  And we actually think, 
5
6  It's proximate cause as tailored to this statute and the 
7  policies of this statute, and I think that would want to 
8  really take the geography into account. 
9
10
11  that provides for automatic liability rather than 
12  liability for negligence.  To say that it's a proximate 
13  cause of a particular act of negligence is one thing, 
14  and we have a whole body of law that gives guidance for 
that.  But do you know of any other situation where we 
15
16  talk of proximate cause, something proximately caused by 
17  operations?  Not by a particular act of negligence or --
18  I don't know how to apply proximate cause to an 
19  operation.
20
21  say two things.  One is I do think there's an anomaly 
22  here, but I do think it's -- you know, you're not being 
23  asked to apply proximate cause for purposes of assessing 
24  liability because, as you say, strict liability -- it's 
25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Scalia, I would 

kind of automatic liability. 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But what I would say is you are being asked, 

 That said, I do think that the best way to 

it's so anomalous that you wouldn't do it if you thought 

all of the areas off of the shelf are governed, with the 
exception of seamen under the Jones Act, primarily as a 
matter of geography.  So --

1
2  at least under the backup theory, to apply proximate 
3  cause as a way of determining the geographical scope of 
4  the statute.  And that's anomalous, but I don't think 
5
6  that was the better way to read the statute. 
7
8  read the statute is consistent with all the other 
9  statutes as part of a jurisdictional puzzle.  I mean, 
10
11 
12 
13
14  position is right, then we have a worker who most of the 
time is doing work on a platform, and he will be covered

16  or not depending on whether the injury occurred on the 
17  shelf or on the land.  So, it's -- the other view is to 
18  say what this person does most of the time is what 
19  counts.  Then this worker would always be covered by 
OCSLA.  And if you take your view, then one will be 
20
21  covered by OCSLA; another one who is doing the same job 
22  is covered by a State -- a State -- you have a variety 
23  of State workers' compensation laws as opposed to a 
24  uniform law governing workers of this kind.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Clement, if your 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, two responses, Justice

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  Ginsburg:  First of all, this Court has already 
2  confronted the objection that, well, if -- under OCSLA 
3  workers would move in and out of coverage, and it 
4  rejected it in the Herb's Welding case.  And I don't --
I think it's common ground -- well, maybe not, but it 
5
6  should be common ground that if you had a worker who was 
7  injured on a State platform, that that would not be 
8  covered by -- a State waters platform, that that would 
9  not be covered by OCSLA.
 And, again, that was an anomaly that this 
10
11  Court confronted in Herb's welding and the Court said: 
12  Yes, well, you know, workers are going to move in and 
13  out of coverage, but that's what OCSLA says.  That's 
14  what OCSLA does.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's what brings me --
15
16  I'm looking at petition appendix 96, 903(a) that you 
17  referred us to.  I wasn't quite sure of your argument 
18  with respect to this statute.  This statute is a

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But since Congress didn't

24  looking for and used "as a result," why doesn't that 
25

show that Congress meant something different?  I didn't 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Yes, and it's the Longshore

4  words, how 903 doesn't hurt you more than it helps you.
 MR. CLEMENT:  It helps me because 1333(b) 
5
6  doesn't apply a different model.  It adopts this model. 
7  It adopts and extends the Longshoreman Act to the shelf. 
8  See, it's a mistake to read 1333 --
9
10
11  and that's not what (b) says. 
12
 MR. CLEMENT:  No, it talks about that as 
13  part of extending the Longshore Workers' Act to the 
14  shelf.  It's important that, you know, you can't get --
I mean, 1333(b), like I said, is not a self-contained 
15
16  offshore workers workers' compensation regime.  What it 
17  does is it extends the Longshore Workers' Act to the 
18  shelf, including 903(a). 
19
that you couldn't just extend 903(a) and the rest of the 
20
21  Act to the shelf without modification, because then you 
22  come to this language that says you only get relief if 
23  your injury occurred on the navigable waters or the 
24  drydocks attached thereto.  So, Congress in (b)(3) 
25

changes the definition of the United States for

1  geographical purposes in a way that allows you to 
2  superimpose this provision to the shelf, but instead of 
3  reading it to say you only get a recovery if you're 
4  injured on the navigable waters including the drydocks, 
5
6  waters, including the shelf, the drydocks, the 
7  artificial islands, and the fixtures attached thereto. 
8
9  back to -- you referred to Herb's Welding, but that was 
a case -- it was a claim under the Longshore Act, not an 
10
11 
OCSLA claim, and the Court said it was expressing no 
12 
opinion on whether 1332(b) covered the injury. 
13
14  is not a holding, but at the end of that opinion, the 
Court confronts this argument that isn't it odd that 
15
16  somebody would be moving in and out of coverage?  And 
17  the Court says that that is a product of OCSLA.  And it 
18  doesn't say it's a product of OCSLA generally; it says 
19  particularly that it's a product of OCSLA's extension of 
20
21  about people moving in and out was answered by the Court

25

the Longshore Act.  And I do think that this objection 

 MR. CLEMENT:  That's right.  Herb's Welding 

 I would also say, Justice Ginsburg, the 

earlier question is I understand that it might make

hard about having an admiralty remedy, and presumably 

1  policy sense to have coverage that encapsulates an 
2  individual no matter where they work.  But the problem 
3  is -- I mean, that's not only a different model; that's 
4  the model that Congress rejected.  They thought long and

7  to a vessel or a platform, then you would have coverage 
8  no matter where you went. 
9

10
11  and the Longshore Act always had a situs requirement. 
12  So, when Congress makes a conscious effort to deal with 
13  this unusual geographical problem with -- and solves the 
14  problem with the Longshore Act, which is sitting there 
with a situs requirement, and doesn't adopt the Jones

1  with the experience that this Court ultimately resolved. 
2  But they're living in real time with the experience of 
3  people under the Longshore Act, which at that point, did 
4  carve out and limit the remedy, the Federal remedy, only 
when a State remedy was unavailable.  And they were 
5
6  watching that play out, and it was a mess.  People 
7  didn't know if they should bring a State case or a 
8  Federal case, and at that point they were viewed as 
9  exclusive.  So, Congress had ample reasons to reject the 
idea that we're going to only give a Federal remedy if a 
10
11  State remedy is unavailable. 
12
13  to use the terminology "as a result of" instead of 
14  simply saying that this Act applies only with regard to 
injuries on the platform, which is what other statutes 
15
16  did say?  I mean, other statutes had a geographical 
17  requirement.  What a strange way to say it, "as a result 
18  of operations." 
19
20
21  the other statute that most plainly has a situs 
22  requirement is the Longshore Act, and that's precisely 
23  what they extended to the shelf, as I've argued.  Beyond

the outer continental shelf, when in fact the statute 
5
6  says "any injury occurring as the result of operations 
7  conducted on the outer continental shelf."  And you give 
8  a variety of arguments in your brief about what those 
9  six words are supposed to do.  They're supposed to cover 
latent injuries.  They're supposed to make sure that the

 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Kagan, first of all, 
17  it's interesting.  The only way they can say that those 
18  functions were performed by the statute anyways is to 
19  incorporate provisions of the Longshore Act, because 
1333(b) itself doesn't take care of latent injuries or 
20
21  doesn't take care of, you know, who's in the scope of 
22  their employment.  All of that is taken care of in the 
23  Longshore Act, which is why I think the best way to read

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this goes back to 

 But, beyond that, I would never ask you to

4  that the injury has to result of operations conducted on 
the shelf for certain purposes.  And that precludes an

7  by something that has nothing to do with shelf

 There is a great law review article that

imposing the marine employment test for longshoremen --

 MR. PALMORE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

6  that was used here in 1333(b), and I think the contrast 
7  between the language that Congress used in 1333(b) and 
8  the language it used in other provisions, neighboring 
9  provisions, of 1333 is instructive.
10
11  1333(c), which is on page 3a of the appendix to the 
12  Government's brief.  This is the provision involving the 
13  National Labor Relations Act.  And I think this shows 
14  how Congress went about drafting when it wanted to 
specify legal consequences that would flow from an 
15
16  actual event that took place in a particular place.  So, 
17  Congress extends the National Labor Relations Act to 
18  "any unfair labor practice, as defined in such Act, 
19  occurring upon any artificial island...." And then it 
lists with particularity the particular situses where 
20
21  the National Labor Relations Act would apply.

 Congress didn't do either of those things in 

1  from any injury on the outer continental shelf.  If 
2  Congress wanted to additionally require -- have some 
3  kind of operations nexus, it could have said occurring 
4  on the outer continental shelf as the result of 
5
6
7  section 1333(b), and we think that contrast is -- is 
8  quite instructive here.  It's also not the case --

17 
18
19  Mr. Chief Justice, that I think there's a contrast 
20
21  with which Congress provided for where a particular 
22  event would happen.  There's no question that 1333(b) 
23  has a situs requirement, but it's a situs of operations 
24  requirement.
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Palmore --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it's a 
little -- it's a little different when you're talking 
about a labor practice and an activity that results in 
an injury.  Labor practice by its terms is going to have 
applicability to a particular location.  So, you would 
expect them to use that type of language.  It doesn't 
carry the same negative implication you're suggesting 
under 1333(b). 

between 1333(b) and 1333(c) in terms of the specificity 

 MR. PALMORE:  Well, I think that --

 So, when you're talking about a situs of

1  operations, you're talking about a geographic zone where 
2  operations take place.  It makes sense that Congress 
3  would have used this phrase "on the outer continental 
4  shelf."  Now, the outer continental shelf itself is a 
defined term in the statutes.  In 1331(a), it applies 
5
6  only to the subsoil and seabed.  It doesn't include 
7  artificial installations put on top.  So, we're talking 
8  about a general zone, a general geographic zone where 
9  the operations take place.  And then Congress wanted to

17  his time on land doing what he was supposed to be doing

2  the same in the two situations.  Whether he spends 98

4  on the rig, that makes no difference whatsoever in the 
5
6
7  mistake in the context of a workers' compensation scheme 
8  to look at this as kind of a snapshot in time.  We think 
9  that when you're talking about a workers' compensation 
scheme, the kind of causation that is relevant is the 
10
11 
causation caused by the employment relationship itself. 
So, if someone's spending, like Mr. Valladolid --

spending 98 percent of his time on the shelf, he's 
uniquely exposed to the hazards of work in that

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Palmore, you're asking 
us to look at the relationship between the employment

amount of time on the shelf.  The backup position is

is the substantial connection between the injury and 
operations on the shelf.  It doesn't strike me as that 
different from Mr. Clement's backup position.

23  different.  I don't understand that.

highlighted this.  Proximate cause is a --

 MR. PALMORE:  We think substantial --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A substantial nexus is 

1  some language in the Third Circuit's opinion in Curtis 
2  would support.  We think that that sweeps too broadly.

4  narrowly, and Justice Scalia's exchange with Mr. Clement

8
9  substantial nexus, substantial connection.  We think, 
though, that it would be a mistake to look at only the

Ninth Circuit decision which -- which might suggest 
12 
13 
that.  We think --
14

16  to, given your status test.  Where are you drawing your 
17  status test from?  Meaning, obviously it's not from the 
18  language. 
19

21  we think that the language has to be understood in the 
22  context of workers' compensation.  This is not a 
23  tort-based fault regime.  This is a workers' 
24  compensation scheme.  Workers' compensation schemes are 
based on the relationship between employer and employee,

uniquely exposed to the hazards of work on the shelf. 
15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- but what 
17  if that exposure is not pertinent to what they're doing? 
18  Let's take the same individual, 98 percent of the time

up.  They need a new part, and they say:  Here, go --
20
21  you know, go drive to Reno where they have a new part 
22  and bring it back.  And he skids off the road and is 
23  injured.  Is he really covered by the Offshore Act?

7  that if the platform was floating, he would be a Jones 
8  Act seaman, and under this Court's cases, if he were 
9  injured on land, he would have a Jones Act remedy.  So, 
the only anomaly here is that he happened to be working 
10
11  on a fixed platform 98 percent of the time.  And the 
12  question is whether the permissive workers' compensation 
13  benefits provided under OCSLA carry with him when he 
14  happens to be injured on land as a result of the shelf

17  anomaly.  I mean, you know, if it's a floating platform, 
18  it's a vessel.  The difference between a vessel and a 
19  dock.  Is it an anomaly that you're covered under the

10
11
 MR. FREDERICK:  That -- that's correct, 
12  Justice Ginsburg.  It's the easiest to administer test, 
13  too, because the way workers' compensation insurance 
14  works, the employer will -- based on the payroll of the 
15
16  payroll, will pay workers' compensation premiums, and 
17  under the Department of Labor regulations, it will add

injury came about.  And under those circumstances we

agree with the Government, that if somebody is -- if an 
employee is out on the platform and is injured as a

result of operations, that person is covered.

14  to give us is, instead, a causal test and that the cause 
is whether operations on the outer continental shelf 
15
16  caused the injury in question.  So, what's your best 
17  argument for how operations on the shelf caused the 
18  injury in this case? 
 MR. FREDERICK:  The scrap metal that Mr. 
19
Valladolid was charged with moving at the time of his 
20
21  the death was very likely the same scrap metal that he 
22  personally had taken off the shelf, or someone in his 
23  position would have taken off the shelf.  And to Justice 
24  Kennedy's point, the equipment is heavy, dangerous, 
25

difficult equipment.  Just the fact that it is moved off 

50
 

Alderson Reporting Company

an offshore event is going to be covered under a -- what

 In their reply brief, they concede that an

4  oil spill worker who's cleaning up this oil spill from

6  they call a proximate cause standard -- under any kind 
7  of substantial connection proximate cause.  Proximate 
8  cause is a legal policy that determines how you want to 
9  limit the scope of the injuries that would be covered.
10
11  Justice Scalia, you were completely right it makes no 
12  sense.  And so, if you adopt some kind of substantial 
13  connection, it has to be very loosely related.  As the 
14  Court in the FELA context last term held in CSX v. 
15
16  even more sense to have a very relaxed standard of 
17  causation under workers' compensation.

contractor, a trucker, who carries this heavy -- this

9  my understanding is that the courts have kind of worked 
out the various factors and standards that go into the

nature of the employment standard --

14  relationship to the vessel must be substantial in nature

 MR. FREDERICK:  Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's a real 

1
2  law, Justice Ginsburg, there are a range of factors that 
3  go into the nature of the sea workers' relationship to 
4  the vessel, and they go to -- they go to duration, they 
go to the performance of duties in the completion of the 
5
6  mission of the vessel and the like.  And there are a 
7  range of standards.  Obviously, the facts of each crew 
8  member is difficult to unpack in a hypothetical at this 
9  time.
10
11  -- obviously, it's a real mishmash, and maybe that's 
12  what we're -- we're stuck with.  How does this work as a 
13  practical matter?  I assume the -- the companies get 
14  insurance to cover their risks here.
 MR. FREDERICK:  Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Who decides -- I

18  people spend what percentage of time where?

22  is that, on an annual or a periodic basis, the company 
23  and the insurance company get together through some 
24  auditing process where there's verification of the 
workers who are OCSLA workers and thereby get the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No -- well, they 

MR. FREDERICK:  It's a different form of 

 And so, here what we're talking about is a 

situation where the employer is not liable for the 

1  longshore benefits, and the company and the insurance 
2  company work that out to determine either numbers or 
3  particular individuals or the like. 
4

6  damage.  It's an insured risk, and --
7
8  have to pay higher insurance rates.  To say they're not 
9  liable for it I think is a real --

12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21  employee from the Longshoreman Act?  Which defines an 
22  employee as a maritime worker, and then defines that and 
23  has exceptions and so forth, and this has a couple more. 
24  That's who the employee is; is that right?
25

liability, and it's one that based on the way workers' 
compensation traditionally is developed -- and I would 
direct the Court to the opening chapters of Larson's 
monumental treatise on workers' compensation, where he 
basically says if this is a social compact in which the 
employer doesn't have to face liability for personal 
injuries in tort but gets insurance, and the premiums 
are then passed on to the consuming public of that 
particular entity's goods.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Does it carry over who's an

 So, our submission, Justice Breyer, is that 

1  no; (b)(2), as Justice Sotomayor referenced, it is -- it 
2  is an employer, some of whose employees are engaged in, 
3  quote, "such operations."  And Mr. Valladolid was 
4  exactly the kind of person who was engaged in such 
5
6
7  that is the kind of person that Congress contemplated 
8  when it was focusing on the work force that would be 
9  engaged in development of the outer continental shelf.
 If the Court has --
10
11
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you -- I 
12  don't mean to get back to it all the time, but it's not 
13  -- you have to say that Congress contemplated the person 
14  who spent 30 percent of his time on the outer 
15
16  test.  Maybe your client is an easy case, where it's 98 
17  percent.  But the test you want us to adopt covers the 
18  person who spends 70 percent of his time on land. 
19
could put it this way, the pushback for the but-for test 
20
21  in its broadest sense is that there isn't a natural kind 
22  of a way of confining some restriction to it.  And so, 
23  if you look at the statute in terms of what it naturally 
24  must have meant by Congress, there is a natural limit,

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 Thank you. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

Justice Kennedy, you asked about deference, and I think 
before you give any deference to the Government's 
position, you should look at the other Government's 
position, which is to say the position that the 
Government took in its brief to this Court in Pickett v. 
Petroleum Helicopters in 2002. 

1  are an effort -- there is an effort to try to restrict 
2  the scope of the compensation. 
3

8
9  A few points in rebuttal.  First of all, 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 They have a completely different position 
17  now, and they've never explained the difference other 
18  than to say what they thought was plausible then they 
19  now find persuasive now.  That's not enough for 
20
21  similar to ours.  There has to be status plus situs, 
22  albeit a slightly different situs, but otherwise it's on 
23  all fours with our position. 
24
25

 Second of all, the Government comes up here 
and says that the longshore remedy is an outlier among 

deference.  And in that brief, they took a position very 

57

workers' comp law could go to the navigable waters. 

 Well, that's the exact same backdrop against 

the Longshore Act with that situs requirement. 

1  workers' compensation remedies because it's the only one 
2  with a situs.  Well, the problem with that is of all the 
3  workers' compensation provisions that Congress could 
4  have extended to the outer continental shelf, it picked 
5
6
 And the Government also says, well, you 
7  know, the reason that the Longshore Act had a situs 
8  requirement was because of Jensen, and this Court's 
9  decision in Jensen created a problem about whether State 
10
11
12  which Congress is passing OCSLA.  It doesn't know that 
13  State workers' compensation law can go to the outer 
14  continental shelf.  Jensen is still good law.  Jensen 
15
16  extend their laws to the navigable waters.  What 
17  makes --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why -- why doesn't 
18
19  Congress know?  Because I think States overwhelmingly 
would include outer continental shelf workers in their 
20
21  compensation scheme. 
22
23  What States overwhelming did is say a worker could be 
24  covered in a different State.  But covering them on the 
outer continental shelf was not something that was well 
25

tells Congress that it can't extend -- States can't

3  testimony that questioned the ability of either States 
4  to get their workers' comp law there directly and also 
heard that there might be constitutional problems, 
5
6  because of the Knickerbocker Ice case, of Congress 
7  extending the State law there.  So, that's why they 
8  settled on this remedy of taking this Longshore Act that 
9  solved the Jensen problem on the navigable waters and 
10
11
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It would make sense to 
12  use the Longshore Act because they wanted to have the 
13  same level of compensation.

16
17  the OCSLA worker to have the same benefits as the 
18  longshore worker. 
 MR. CLEMENT:  Sure, when they were on the 
19
shelf.  But they were solving the exact same kind of 
20
21  jurisdictional problem they solved with the Longshore 
22  Act with the shelf -- with the statute. 
23
24  read too much into (b)(2).  All (b)(2) is doing is 
modifying the same definition for the longshores. 
25

 MR. CLEMENT:  As other alternatives like the 

Jones Act? 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No.  No, no. They wanted 

 Justice Sotomayor, I don't think you can

 Mr. Chief Justice, you talked about the 

and creates a situs that makes sense for the shelf:  the 

imprecision without any text.  At least in the Jones 
Act, you have the seamen and you have some other textual 
clues as to where you draw these limits.  Here there's 
nothing in the statute that in any way suggests a 
status-based test.  So, you would be completely 
unmoored, if you will. 

1  You're an employer if you employ a longshoreman or a 
2  longshore worker.  So, they're just updating this for 
3  purposes of extending a longshore remedy to the shelf; 
4  (b)(3) does the same thing, and it modifies the situs 
5
6  navigable waters, drydocks, the shelf, artificial 
7  islands, and everything attached thereto. 
8
9  imprecision of their test.  It's worse than that.  It's 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 The last point I would make is this:  The 
17  answer to the causation test is really -- the kind of 
18  the lie to the other side's position is what they say 
19  when they're dealing with somebody who's not a 98 
20
21  out on the shelf, when are they covered?  Well, when the 
22  injuries operating on the shelf cause them a direct 
23  injury on the shelf.  At that point, even the Government 
24  resorts to a situs-based test.
25

percenter but is a 2 percenter.  When that person goes 

 Well, here's the problem:  That status-based

 This person was injured by operations for 

1  test, it's in the Jones Act; it's not in OCSLA.  And 
2  even when you recognize that and you look at what's left 
3  of the case, what's left of the case is either our 
4  approach that essentially incorporates the Longshore Act 
through (b)(3) or a tight nexus test that would require 
5
6  a geographical focus and give -- give force to the words 
7  "conducted on the shelf."

sure wasn't injured by operations conducted on the shelf 
10

for those purposes.  He was injured by operations on dry 
land.  And under those circumstances, the remedy lies 
12 
13 
with the State workers' comp law, not with OCSLA.
