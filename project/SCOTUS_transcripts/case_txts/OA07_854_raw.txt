 (11:06 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 07-854, Van De Kamp v. 
Goldstein.

 Mr. Coates.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. COATES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case arises from a Ninth Circuit 
opinion that essentially creates an exception to 
absolute prosecutorial immunity for chief advocates and 
supervising advocates.  The court's decision in the 
Ninth Circuit essentially held that prosecutorial 
policies that apply to an entire body of cases in a 
trial office do not qualify for absolute immunity.

 We submit that this is inconsistent with 
this Court's decision in Imbler v. Pachtman and its 
progeny, applying the functional approach to absolute 
immunity.  There is essentially no distinction between a 
chief advocate or supervising prosecutor implementing a 
policy directing that cases be handled in a particular 
manner and that particular chief advocate or supervising 
advocate actually participating in the courtroom.

Because of the size of the prosecutorial 
agencies, it's not feasible that a chief advocate or 
supervisor can be in a courtroom in every single case. 
But they can put their prosecutorial stamp on each case 
through the implementation of policy, through training, 
or through other means.

 Here the policy at issue concerns compliance 
with the obligation to disclose exculpatory information 
under Brady v. Maryland and also Giglio v. United 
States.

 In Imbler versus Pachtman, the Court 

recognized that those obligations are core prosecutorial 
obligations that are part of the prosecution's intimate 
relationship to the fairness of the trial proceedings. 
And we submit that that duty, that function, is the same 
whether it's performed in the courtroom or whether it's 
performed by a chief advocate or supervising advocate in 
terms of formulating policy or when making particular 
policy decisions.

 Imbler recognized that these core decisions 

had to be insulated.  Otherwise, it would spawn 
litigation that would burden the judicial process.  And 
it might cause them to hesitate to produce particular 
exculpatory information.  It might create a burden of 
having them involved in more lawsuits than actually

performing their function and prosecuting the criminal 
law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Was -- was there an 

element in Imbler of the fact that you have to 
make tactical and strategic decisions at -- at the 
moment that are difficult, that call for judgment that 
has to be exercised on the spur of the moment?

 This is somewhat different.  This is -- this 
is a long-term commitment or a long-term policy that the 
Respondents are arguing for.  It seems to me somewhat 
different than the dynamics that inform the Imbler 
decision.

 MR. COATES:  Well, the court in Imbler did 
mention a time frame in which decisions have to be made 
-- quickly made by individual prosecutors.  It also 
noted the sheer number of decisions that are often made 
in the context of a criminal prosecution.

 I would say, with respect to chief advocates 

and -- and supervisors, the number of those types of 
decisions is the same.  They have the same complexity in 
determining what is going to come up in every single 
case as an individual prosecutor does in a -- in a 
single case.

 Moreover, there is a multitude more that 

they have to consider because they are considering the

possibility of its impact on thousands of cases within 
the office.  I will note, though, in Butz v. Economou, 
where the Court extended absolute immunity to 
individuals prosecuting agency actions, that same point 
was raised.  But some of the conduct there was a bit 
more drawn-out in terms of the investigative manner --
not the investigative manner, but the -- the 
prosecutorial process used by the administrative agency. 
And the court didn't find that -- that longer time frame 
to be dispositive.

 Going back to Imbler, it again looked at 

what the basic function was in the administrative agency 
proceeding and found, yes, it is akin to prosecutorial 
conduct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you kind of 

perhaps a farfetched hypothetical question just so I get 
the case law in mind?  Supposing a prosecutor wanted to 
develop a policy which would keep -- which would create 
a bifurcated regime within the office where the people 
who interrogate prisoners are entirely separate from the 
people who prosecute trials, so that they don't have the 
malicious purpose that your adversary says is involved 
in this case.  And supposing the prosecutor then hired 
some expert layman who had no trial experience at all to 
develop such a program, and the program, itself, is

desirable from the prosecution's point of view but --
but presumably unconstitutional.  Would the person who 
developed that program be entitled to immunity --

MR. COATES:  The --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- in my example?
 MR. COATES:  The lay person --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.
 MR. COATES:  The layperson, as a private 
actor, I think would not be.  I think the prosecutor 
that developed the policy would be.  It would be like 
delegating it to a staff member.  It might depend also 
on how close the relationship is.  The Court has noted 
in some of the judicial immunity cases that sometimes 
court clerks can perform functions that are essentially 
judicial functions.

 In that case, though, under the Court's 

jurisprudence with private actors, they might have only 
qualified immunity, the private actors.  But the 
decision to use them would be prosecutorial.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, why -- why is it 

qualified immunity if a separate person does it, but not 
qualified immunity if precisely the same task is 
performed by somebody who happens also to be a 
prosecutor?

 MR. COATES:  Because it's not so much the

physical task of doing it.  It's carrying out the 
obligation of performing that particular function.  The 
function is compliance with Giglio and Brady.  That is 
always a prosecutorial function.  Whether the data is 
kept with a police department or an investigative 
agency, the buck stops with the prosecutor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And in my hypothetical is 

it or is it not a prosecutorial -- does the layperson 
perform or not perform a prosecutorial function?

 MR. COATES:  If he is just collating data, 
then that is -- that's -- that's a task.  Our point is 
that this isn't about just collating data.  It's about 
the policy that data must be collated and used.  That is 
the Brady-Giglio obligation.  You can't divorce the --
the information from the purpose for which, why it's 
supposed to be used.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but I'm trying to 
divorce the information in the particular case from 
developing the program.

 MR. COATES:  Well, I --perhaps I 

misunderstood the question.  It sounds to me that the 
prosecutor has made a decision that he is going to put 
this thing in place, this process in place.  That's 
their way that they satisfy or don't satisfy Giglio or 
Brady.

Maybe they don't satisfy.  Maybe it's a 

terrible decision.  But I think that decision ends up 
being prosecutorial in nature.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Even if it's made by a 

layman?

 MR. COATES:  Setting up the program, no. 

But the -- I think the buck stops with the prosecutor as 
to whether that's a valid process or not.  I mean, the 
person may adequately perform their function, or they 
may not.  But the person at the end of the day who is 
responsible for it ends up being the prosecutor.

 And he may inevitably -- the person may 

inevitably perform something, but at the end of the day 
the prosecutor is the one that -- that has the task 
under Giglio and Brady of ensuring the accuracy of the 
information.

 I think that kind of underscores here the 
approach the Respondent has taken is to kind of say, 
well, this is just a collection of data here, this is 
just bookkeeping.  But it's not.  The core of the 
constitutional claim here is that there is an obligation 
under Brady and Giglio somehow to collect this 
information, to disseminate this information.

 And that's the obligation that we are being 
sued for, and that's the sort of thing that prosecutors

do.  And you can you hire someone to do it, but somebody 
is the gatekeeper.  Someone has to basically decide what 
goes in or what doesn't go in and whether it's 
sufficient or insufficient at the end of the day to 
comply with -- with Brady and Giglio.  And so that can't 
be distinguished from the -- the prosecutorial role, 
whether it's conducted by a -- a chief advocate or by a 
supervising advocate.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I suppose that 

is why the Petitioners seemed to change their theory. 
They -- they -- they were -- they were concerned about 
prosecutorial immunity, so they take it to the higher 
level of policy.

 When -- when they do that, I suppose they 

might have the stronger argument if they could show 
deliberate indifference.  Are there cases that help them 
on the "deliberate indifference"?  What's -- what's the 
best case for them on deliberate indifference?

 MR. COATES:  I couldn't say what the best 

case is for them.  I could not say what the best case is 
for them on -- on "deliberate indifference."  We have 
not pushed on the merits part of this case.  It was not 
briefed down below, and it is not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That is why the case is 
hard, and I -- I almost have to see what the violation

would be before I could determine the qualified immunity 
aspect of the case.

 MR. COATES:  Well, indeed.  I mean, several 

amici has raise the question of whether there is the 
constitutional violation at all, but it has not been 
raised below.  And of course, under this Court's 
decision in Buckley we have to assume the existence of a 
constitutional violation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's what we are 
deciding in sort of in a vacuum.  It's a little 
difficult.

 MR. COATES:  Precisely.  But I think our 

point is that -- that if you buy their theory of a 
constitutional claim, whatever constitutional claim that 
is is a -- a prosecutorial function-related claim, 
because that's the nature of the Giglio and Brady 
obligation.  They are trial obligations.  They don't 
have any meaning outside the context of an actual 
prosecution.

 And so, again we submit that there is really 

no difference to the chief advocate or supervising 
advocate formulating this particular policy for all the 
cases in the office -- this is what we do -- then there 
is the individual actions of a particular trial attorney 
in a given case or even if it were possible for a

supervising attorney or chief advocate to participate in 
everything.  They could accomplish the same thing, I 
suppose, by every time a case is filed sending out an 
e-mail saying:  Comply with our policies.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The Monell case -- does 

the Monell case rest on the assumption that there can be 
instances where a policy makes the policy of those who 
adopted the policy liable?

 MR. COATES:  I think that's right.  Reading 

the Monell allegations of the complaint against the 
County of Los Angeles, I think that that is what it is, 
that the deputy -- that the district attorney rather, 
acts as a county officer and would be the policymaker 
for those policies and customs and practices.

 That obviously is not at issue here. 

Petitioners are being sued as individuals for their acts 
as supervisors and as the chief advocate in formulating 
a particular policy concerning compliance with Brady and 
Giglio.

 These sort of cases, opening this door 

particularly for the broad claim that plaintiffs are now 
trying to assert, which is this kind of notion of 
information management, can spawn all sorts of claims. 
Virtually any time that you can't reach the individual 
trial attorney, all you need do is attribute whatever

you think that person did to the failure to develop a 
policy or provide training or to have adequate data 
management to allow them to do the job.

 This kind of end-run under Imbler will 
create the multitude of litigation and drag chief 
advocates in, as well as supervising advocates, that 
Imbler was designed to avoid.  And it has the worse 
collateral effect that it's also going to end up pulling 
in the individual attorneys, the individual trial 
attorneys in a given case, because maybe they don't have 
individual liability, but they are certainly going to 
come in; they are going to testify as witnesses.

 So, it's the worst of both worlds, which is 
you are burdening the chief advocate with this sort of 
litigation which may impact the way they formulate 
policy, and you are burdening the individual line deputy 
attorney, and that's the attorney that Imbler sought to 
protect as well.

 Those adverse consequences on the judicial 
process are what led this Court in Imbler to recognize 
the importance of absolute immunity for prosecutors.  We 
submit that it's even more important that that immunity 
be logically applied to chief advocates and to 
supervisors.  Otherwise, I think Imbler will be 
eviscerated and we will have the very evils that Imbler

will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 Oh, excuse me.  Sorry about that.
 Mr. Dreeben.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 This Court recognized absolute prosecutorial 

immunity for line prosecutors who are charged with 
violating an obligation that falls uniquely on 
prosecutors, namely the obligation to disclose 
exculpatory evidence.  The Respondents in this case are 
seeking to circumvent that absolute prosecutorial 
immunity by reformulating the claim as one against 
supervisors who allegedly failed to fulfill duties under 
the Constitution to collect information that would 
enable the line prosecutors to comply with the core duty 
under Giglio and Brady.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there such a 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

constitutional obligation?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Not in our view, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  In our view the Brady obligation is 
one that falls on the Government.  Giglio is an 
extension of Brady with respect to impeachment 
information.  It's designed to ensure the fairness of 
the trial.  It is violated only when the Government has 
suppressed material exculpatory evidence, that is, 
evidence that can undermine the fairness of the trial.

 It's intimately linked in a way that really 

nothing else in the adversary system is to preserving 
the fairness of the trial.  It's an obligation on the 
prosecutor to go beyond the normal role of an advocate 
to zealously advocate for his cause, and it puts the 
advocate in the position of supplying the judicial 
system with information needed to be submitted in order 
to have a fair proceeding.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think you have the 
flip side of the same problem your friend has.  In other 
words, the further it is removed from the constitutional 
violation or an allegation of a constitutional 
violation, the less need there is for immunity.  The 
closer it is or the closer we must assume it is to a 
constitutional violation, then the immunity argument is 
stronger.

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, it certainly is true 
that if there were a constitutional obligation under 
Giglio and Brady, it would be one that is intimately 
tied to the judicial process, and it should receive 
absolute prosecutorial immunity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In the broad ethical 
scheme of things, apart from liability under this 
statute, it seems to me that a newly elected district 
attorney would take seriously the obligation to make 
sure that everybody was following Brady.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Absolutely, Justice Kennedy, 
and I think that a formulation of policies to achieve 
that, whether or not required by the Constitution, is 
something that relates directly and intimately to the 
prosecutor's duties to assure --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's the next 

point.  If I were a prosecutor, I would say:  This is my 
constitutional duty to say it, in the broad sense of --
of my ethical obligations of my duties to the public.
 MR. DREEBEN:  Only in the sense, I think, 

that -- that a supervisor who has the power to cause or 
prevent constitutional violations may be under some 
obligation not to cause constitutional violations.  But 
the claim here is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I think it's more

than that.  He can't be indifferent to sloppy practices 
in the office --

MR. DREEBEN:  You certainly should not.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- consistent with his or 

her obligations to perform their duties.

 MR. DREEBEN:  But I think that the 

deliberated indifference question that you raise, 
Justice Kennedy, is really a direct counterpart of the 
absolute immunity argument that we are making here.  We 
are making here the argument that supervisory 
prosecutors should not be subject to suit based on broad 
policies that they have adopted that will directly have 
impact on individual cases in the way that Brady and 
Giglio obligations are fulfilled.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Dreeben, what do you 

do with my hypothetical?  Do you remember it?

 MR. DREEBEN:  I remember it, 

Justice Stevens, and I think that the -- I agree with 
Mr. Coates on this one.  The supervisory prosecutor who 
formulates the policy is the only one who has the unique 
--

JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, I'm -- my hypothetical 

is they hire a layman --

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.

that will keep separate from prosecutors information 
about the way witnesses are developed.  And the policy I 
think is highly unprobable, I agree with you, but the 
policy is designed to avoid the obligation imposed by 
Giglio and Brady.

 MR. DREEBEN:  That's the allegation, of 

course.  And the first thing that I want to say is that 
if you allow suits based on allegations that you think 
are really bad, you open the door to allegations that 
will have to be sorted out throughout the judicial 
system.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But that's true even 

without -- without an immunity.

 MR. DREEBEN:  But I think that the point is 
that the immunity prevents the prosecutors from having 
to fear that they will be subject to those kind of 
suits.

 But to answer your question directly, the 

layperson, if he causes a constitutional violation, 
isn't shielded by the constitutional -- excuse me -- by 
the prosecutorial immunity that attaches only to 
prosecutors.  And that's because if you go back to the 
roots in Imbler, what you see is that prosecutorial 
immunity is really --

question is, if that's true, and if there is -- you can 
compartmentalize the prosecutor's work in the office and 
he develops a separate chapter of his own duty to just 
do that performance, why is that trial-related?
 MR. DREEBEN:  I think the flaw in 

Respondent's theory is the attempt to bifurcate what the 
prosecutor is doing into an administrative function and 
a prosecutorial function.  And that's the same, I think, 
maneuver in your hypothetical, to say that the 
prosecutor is really doing something administrative and 
Imbler said administrative things are non-prosecutorial; 
therefore, we can sue him.

 I think the problem with that is illustrated 

by a hypothetical about judicial immunity.  Suppose --
judges of course have immunity from sitting on cases, 
and if a judge sat on a case that involved a conflict of 
interest he could not be sued or she could not be sued 
for having done so, even if it violated the 
Constitution.  Suppose that the litigant reformulated 
the suit and said:  Well, the judge should have had a 
policy to ensure a check of conflicts in all the cases 
that the judge sat on.  And that would have been an 
administrative duty, set up some notebook that has all 
the judge's investments and direct some underling to 
ensure that no party in any case has an interest where

the judge has an investment.  That was purely 
administrative, so we ought to be able to sue.  The 
judge for that.  And I think that obviously should fail. 
It would end-run all of the policy reasons for being 
able to assert absolute judicial immunity; and I think 
that that is identical in form to what the Respondents 
are trying to do here.  They are trying to divorce the 
role of the office in maintaining some sort of a system 
to ensure that information is available to prosecutors 
to disclose under Giglio from the obligation under 
Giglio to ensure the fairness of the judicial process, 
which is an obligation that falls uniquely on the 
prosecutor and which Imbler makes clear is subject to 
absolute immunity.

 And you just can't do that.  If you do that, 
you end up exposing the supervisory prosecutors to evils 
that cannot occur to the line prosecutor himself.  And 
it produces anomalies.  The line prosecutor, even if he 
intentionally violates Giglio, cannot be sued, but under 
Respondent's theory the supervisory prosecutor, even if 
what he did is no more than deliberately indifferent or 
perhaps even negligent, could be sued.

 The line prosecutor who handles a certain 

number of cases cannot be sued, in part because it would 
ensure a distraction of the duties of the prosecutor and

would divert him from performing his role of enforcing 
the criminal law.  The supervisor, who is responsible 
for far more cases and is subject to far more 
disappointed litigants who would like to sue him, that 
person can be sued.  And it would have an even more 
disruptive effect on an office if supervisory 
prosecutors, who have the responsibility, as 
Justice Kennedy pointed out, of trying to come up with 
policies that will prevent constitutional violations, 
and that will ensure that the office functions in an 
efficient and an effective manner, they will be the ones 
who are most deterred -- most deterred from acting, 
because they will suffer the possibility of thinking of 
their own individual liability rather than focusing on 
what they are supposed to do, the public interest, both 
disclosing information that needs to be disclosed, 
bringing suits that need to be brought, and using 
witnesses regardless of fears that someone later on is 
going to discover information that should have been 
disclosed and sue the supervisor, saying, "We know we 
can't sue the individual prosecutor, but you, 
supervisor, failed to develop effective policies to get 
that information to the court."  That kind of 
circumvention of Imbler plays no role of fulfilling the 
policies that absolute prosecutorial immunity is

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 This case is not about whether a chief D.A. 

can set policies about trial strategy.  We could 
stipulate that this chief D.A. would be immune from 
those sorts of suits and it would not affect our case at 
all.

 This case is about the function of deciding 

on an officewide basis whether to track important 
historical facts and disseminate them internally within 
an office to employees who need to know those facts. 
This case is about gathering and preserving information, 
certain categories of raw data, that may or may not ever 
get into the courtroom, not about how to use those 
specific pieces of data once you actually have a 
prosecution materializing.

 This claim is no different from a claim 

against a chief of police, for example, for

systematically destroying 911 tapes, thereby depriving 
defendants of exculpatory information.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why isn't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is creating -- this 
is creating a database.  And what was the year of this 
prosecution?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  The prosecution, Your 

Honor, was in 1979, it began.  That was the crime; the 
prosecution was in '80.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And back in 1979 we did 

not have the information-gathering electronic capability 
that we now have.  So what are we talking about?  What 
kind of database?  How would it operate?  Would you --

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, so that's 
getting to the merits of the actual claim.  It could be 
as simple as a file cabinet or 3 by 5 cards on which you 
list the name of the informant and his prior record of 
collaboration.

 In the U.S. Attorney's offices that do this, 

completely apart from this enormous FBI database, they 
do it very simply, the ones that I know about.  They 
appoint a Giglio czar in each bureau and they say that 
when there is contact with the prosecutor's office and 
an informant, you make sure you tell this person, "send 
an e-mail," and he keeps it all in a file.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that goes 
to the merits, doesn't it?  I mean, if -- I -- you could 
develop and make the same point, saying U.S. attorneys 
are instructed in complying with Giglio and Brady in 
this way.  But if there is a decision not to -- I mean, 
immunity is only necessary when you assume some -- there 
has been some violation.  And so the fact that somebody 
else avoids a violation, it seems to me, is not a good 
argument to deprive other people of immunity.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, this 

Court has said as clearly as it can possibly say that 
the location of the injury is irrelevant.  I am quoting 
now from Buckley.  In Kalina, the prosecutor executed 
the challenged certification probably the morning before 
the morning she walked into court, and it was held to be 
not immune because that was not the function of a 
prosecutor.  She - with the charging document.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You drew a 

distinction earlier on between a determination by a 
prosecutor not to turn over certain material, which is 
absolutely immune, and said this was different.  But 
what if the purpose of the policy is to not provide 
prosecutors with material so they can't turn it over? 
Why doesn't that go into the same prosecutorial core 
function?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, the 

answer is quite simple.  That is the alleged motive in 
this case, in fact.  It was intentional or with 
deliberate indifference, so the allegation is, the 
intention was to cut the flow of information to the line 
prosecutor.  And the reason that's different is because 
while Petitioners say compliance with Brady, our answer 
is compliance with Brady comprises at least two 
functions.

 There is the front line function of the 
prosecutor, the advocate, making the decision, "Do I 
turn this information over to the defense?"  This case 
has nothing to do with that front line function.  This 
case has to do with the back room function.  The 
function of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why isn't that the 
same as the determination by the supervisor that, don't 
turn this information over.  Here's all -- we are not 
going to share informant information because we don't 
think that should be turned over to comply with Giglio. 
The individual prosecutor they have says I'm not going 
to turn it over.  Why isn't it exactly the same?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, if the 
decree comes from on high, "we don't turn over Giglio 
information here," which has actually happened in some

cases, that would be a different case, because that is 
the chief administrator directing trial tactics.

 Here it's the chief administrator looking 
entirely inward and saying, like any administrator in 
any major agency or business does, how do we get 
information from the people who know it to the people 
who need it at the front line?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is certainly -- you 
know, that's an interesting theory, but it's certainly 
not the theory on which the decision below was based. 
The decision below says "Neither" -- speaking of Imbler 
and prior cases -- "Neither the Supreme Court nor this 
Court has considered whether claims regarding failure to 
train, failure to supervise or failure to develop an 
officewide policy regarding a Constitutional obligation 
like the one set forth in Giglio are subject to absolute 
immunity."

 And I could quote portions of the opinion 

they are.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That's what --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They are talking about 

supervising prosecutors.  They are talking about 
training prosecutors and having an officewide policy 
regarding what you do with -- with Giglio information.

read from was the broad passage that the court was 
referring to when it said this sets up a bunch of hard 
questions.  This case becomes an easy case, the court 
said, because we were not dealing with the prosecutor, 
the chief D.A. setting trial tactics for the line 
prosecutors; we are dealing -- the court says this on 
page 5 of the petition -- excuse me, the petition 
appendix.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Page 5?
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Page 5 of the petition 

appendix at the top.  It lays out the theories.  Number 
one theory is exactly the theory we are presenting here. 
At the very top line, "They violated his constitutional 
rights by purposely or with deliberate indifference 
failing to create a system that would satisfy the Giglio 
obligation."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They are not talking about 

just collecting information.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They are talking about, as 
they clarify later on, a -- a system in which they train 
and supervise and develop an officewide policy regarding 
the Giglio obligations.

supervising and training, about the internal function of 
circulation of information within the D.A.'s office. 
Not --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let's assume that's --

that's what they did mean.  I have to say I read it as 
broadly as Justice Scalia did, but let's -- let's narrow 
down the -- the Court's opinion to -- to -- to the claim 
that you are making right now.

 Let me go back to the Chief Justice's 

hypothetical and add one minor detail.

 Let's assume that in a given department they 
put into effect exactly the policy that you want.  They 
have a fine system of -- of data collection, far more 
sophisticated than three by five cards, and the -- the 
boss D.A. says everybody in this office ought to know 
what kind of deals are being made and offered at all 
times.  And they have such a system.

 And the boss D.A. also says and don't you 

disclose one word of it ever in any case.  We are going 
to defy Giglio.

 If he made that or gave that order so that 
in every case there would be a defiance of Giglio, even 
though the facts were known, would he have absolute 
immunity?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  And he's directing that

order to trial lawyers?

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That's right.
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  The 

answer is I don't know.  I could imagine a theory, a 
very strong one --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you know if in a 
given case, if they had this system, and the lawyer 
comes to him and says, okay, I've consulted our system 
and I realize we that have got a Giglio obligation.  And 
the boss D.A. says:  Forget it.  Don't tell him a word.
 There would be absolute immunity, wouldn't 

there?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  There absolutely would, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  And my point is --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why would the -- why would 
the answer be any different if he says don't bother me 
with particular cases?  I am telling you right now what 
the answer is going to be in every case in which we have 
a Giglio obligation and that is, bury it.

 Presumably there would be absolute immunity, 

wouldn't there?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I can imagine 

an argument on either side.  I can imagine the Plaintiff

making the argument --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What's your answer?
 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I don't have an answer to 

that hypothetical because it's so different from our 
case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  The trouble is if you don't 

have an answer to that hypothetical, then we got to 
leave open the possibilities as far as your case is 
concerned that he would have absolute immunity in that 
case.  And if he would have absolute immunity in that 
case, then the -- the -- the reason for allowing 
anything less than absolute immunity with respect to 
this data collection obligation reduces down to 
something like an almost a silly point.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  If --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  If you can get everything 

you want, and all the prosecutor has got to say is: 
Keep it under your hat and there is going to be absolute 
immunity and nobody gets anything.  What is -- what is 
to be gained by that?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, that may 
well be a consequence of Imbler.  But when Imbler talks 
about the function, Imbler is very clear that there is a 
distinction between trial tactics and strategy on the 
one hand in the cases under Imbler, and the sort of

backroom functions about the flow of information on the 
other --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if the backroom 
function is reduced to an absolute nullity by an 
immunized decision to -- to bury the Giglio information 
in every case, then I don't see the point of saying 
there's no immunity for the supposed backroom function, 
because nothing will be accomplished even if there is no 
absolute immunity.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Sure, Your Honor.  We 

can -- if we imagine a corrupt district attorney who 
wants to make sure that constitutional rights are 
violated and evades the edict of this Court, sure, that 
is the consequence of Imbler.

 But my point in -- in not answering the 

question about the theory under that case, is that the 
argument of the plaintiff in that case is so different 
from the argument that we are making here.  The 
plaintiff in that case would be arguing, well, it is 
removed in time from the -- the actual prosecution which 
is an argument that we, too, can make.  The conduct was 
before the initiation of criminal proceedings.  It's 
not -- you know, you could not say it's not unique to 
prosecutors.

 Here, our argument is that there is nothing

unique to prosecutors or to lawyers about the 
information management function, about the function of 
tracking information.  And by the way, this is not an 
exotic theory.  This is exactly the line that this Court 
has been following in distinguishing between --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Can't you say anything about 

training subordinates in any office.  There is nothing 
unique about training or not training subordinates in a 
prosecutor's office as opposed to any other government 
office or, I would suppose, an office in the private 
sector.  So does your argument extend to any failure to 
provided adequate training or any instance where there 
is a deliberate indifference as to the training that is 
provided?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I can see the plaintiff in 
a case using our argument to advance that point.  But my 
point here is we don't even need to get to that argument 
because --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So a plaintiff could say 

that it could sue a -- a district attorney for failing 
to have adequate training as to subordinates before 
you -- they are sent in to deliver a summation so that 
they know they are not supposed to comment on the 
failure of a defendant to take the stand --

JUSTICE ALITO:  They are not supposed to 
vouch for witnesses, that would be a viable theory in 
your opinion?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I -- I believe that there 

is an argument.  It's not the argument that I am making. 
The argument that I am making it matters what the D.A. 
is training on.  If the D.A. is training on trial 
tactics, that's one thing.  But here the D.A. is 
training on how to use a database, and he's not training 
the lawyers who are going to be using it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rosenkranz, you have, 

it seems to me, a theory of this case that is not the 
theory that the Ninth Circuit went on.  I mean, the 
Ninth Circuit talks about training and supervising 
deputy district attorneys.  And why do we train them? 
Because we want to ensure that they share information.
 Now you are cutting out the training and 
supervision, and you are saying the obligation of the 
supervising attorney is to have this information bank, 
which the deputy attorneys can then -- then consult, 
which, may be a very sound policy.  But is it an element 
of due process that the supervising attorney has to 
devise a system to share information?  Where is there 
anything -- anything that the Court has held that 
suggests that there is a data collection function

required by due process?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So, Your Honor, let me 
ask -- let me answer the first half first, which is 
about what the Ninth Circuit held.  And first, I should 
say what it is that we argued to the Ninth Circuit.

 It's on -- it's in our brief, very clearly 
we've presented on page -- excuse me -- on page 17 of 
our brief, that big paragraph, the only full paragraph, 
we present both what we argued to the Ninth Circuit, 
which was about the creation of a database, and what 
Petitioners argued to the Ninth Circuit, which reflected 
exactly what we were saying.  So petitioners were not 
confused.  They attributed to us the argument that they, 
quote, failed to set up a system to disseminate to 
deputy district attorneys information about plea deals 
and other assistance being offered to informants.

 That was -- and that was directly out of our 
brief.  That was the first line of their brief, and the 
first line of our brief also referred to that.

 I agree, the Ninth Circuit spoke more about 
training than about this information database.  But the 
Ninth Circuit was also speaking only about --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And there is nothing in 

the Ninth Circuit -- there was nothing that was 
presented to the Ninth Circuit by Mr. Goldstein that had

to do with this talk about training?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  There was, Your Honor.  In 

our complaint we had two what might be called 
information management theories.

 One -- and you can see it on page 45 of our 
complaint of the joint appendix, and so while the Court 
is orienting itself -- there were -- there's a theory of 
information management that is the most prominent theory 
in the complaint.  If you look at the bottom of page 45, 
about seven lines up from the bottom, you see two 
distinct kind of subtheories.

 The first is -- so it starts -- the line 
starts purposely or with a deliberate indifference --
theory 1-A, that petitioners failed to create any system 
for the deputy district attorneys handling criminal 
cases to access information, about informants, of 
course.

 Theory B, two lines from the bottom, "that 

they failed to train deputy district attorneys to 
disseminate information pertaining to the benefits 
provided to jailhouse informants."  That's also about 
disseminating it internally.  If one turns to page 69, 
the specific allegations against Petitioners, you see 
paragraph 154, repeatedly talking about this information 
system, this information sharing system, both as a

system to create and as a failure to train.  But, again, 
train on what?  Train on the need, when you don't have 
the system, to inform the other guy that you've just 
made a deal with the informant.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But I would like to follow 

that up a bit by saying, one, I'm not sure what this 
difference between what you are arguing now and what you 
are arguing then matters.  I don't understand it, 
frankly.  I don't actually understand it, because I 
agree, when you were in the Ninth Circuit, with what you 
said:  It's a failure to disseminate information.  And 
then you said:  And it's a failure to train and 
supervise.  You did say that.  Now, why that matters, I 
don't know, because the problem that -- maybe it does 
matter, maybe it doesn't.  So I have to say I don't 
understand it.  Now, help my understanding.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I don't think it does 

matter.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  I know you 
don't, but I'm not worried about that.  I'm worried 
about my understanding of your argument, and that's what 
I am trying to get to.  Answer this question, please, 
because it will help me:  The obvious response is the 
response the Government made.  You can take any -- which 
is what Justice Alito said.  So I would just like to you

elaborate on it.  You can take anything that the D.A. 
does that is wrong in the case, you know, some horrible 
thing he did.  And maybe he shouldn't be immune, but he 
is, okay?  Or maybe he should be.  There we are.

 So, here I know I can't bring this suit, but 

here's what I claim:  You failed to have a system that 
did... and now we fill in the blank.  And whatever that 
blank is, it's going to be something that would have 
stopped him from doing this bad thing.  In your case, it 
happens to be an information dissemination system.  In 
other case, it would be some other kind of system that 
would have the effect of stopping this bad thing.  So, 
their point is that, if you can go ahead with yours, so 
can anybody else go ahead with theirs, and that is the 
end of immunity.  Okay?

 Now, what is your response?  That's what I 

want to know.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, my response to 

that is very simple:  I don't know of any other trial 
right -- prosecutorial misconduct, that can be 
controlled -- excuse me, where you can evade immunity 
under our theory the way you can with a theory that is 
based on the management --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Sure, it's easy.  What the 

prosecutor does is he makes the most horrendous

prejudicial argument you'd ever see.  So we say:  What 
you need in the D.A.'s office, since this happens all 
the time, are classes, or what you need is a special 
section of the library where they have horrible 
arguments underlined, okay?

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And so, I can do that.  So 
can you.  You are very good at it.  And any good lawyer 
can do that.  And that's their point.  So, if your only 
response, that's your response, your point is that a 
good lawyer, while he can do yours, couldn't do others, 
I understand the response.  I'm not sure I agree with 
it.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor, and I was 

beginning to say before that there is nothing at all 
exotic about the theory.  The same lines are being drawn 
by this Court all the time.  For example, in Kalina, a 
very fine line between the prosecutor who is creating 
charging documents on the one hand, writing them, 
submitting them to the Court, and then on the other 
hand, signing them.  Or, in the investigative cases, the 
line between the process of gathering information, the 
raw data, on the one hand; and on the other hand, the 
assessment of that data for trial.

prosecutor and trying to hold the district attorney 
vicariously liable for decisions of a trial lawyer, that 
is just very different from trying to hold the district 
attorney liable for the process of managing data, raw 
information, that may or may not ever make its way into 
a courtroom.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Your theory applies to any 
system of data dissemination.  Is that -- would that be 
correct?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Any one that is 

constitutionally based, Your Honor.  I mean, one where 
you could imagine a prosecution on the other end with a 
constitutional right that is violated.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If the prosecutor has the 
policy of failing to distribute to the line attorneys 
the latest Ninth Circuit decision or the latest 
decisions of this Court on important issues of criminal 
constitutional procedure, because they just don't like 
the way the law is developing in these areas.  So they 
like the law the way it existed at sometime in the past, 
and they are just not going to distribute any of that. 
Would that be a theory?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, you have to imagine a 
world in which the district attorney is depriving people 
of the tools of their trade so that they can't get it

elsewhere.  There is actually a real case that I -- that 
I've heard about where, you know, the district attorney 
decided way back when to stop buying supplements for 
statutory -- for statute books, and so district 
attorneys, line prosecutors were charging under the 
wrong statutes.

 That, to me Your Honor, is a commissary 

function.  It is a function of an administrator trying 
-- making decisions about how to arm the trial lawyer.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Can I ask you this 

question?  I know we have an immunity case, but your 
underlying cause of action, the one you just described, 
the policy there of not filing supplements, or say you 
had a policy of training lawyers how to evade the Batson 
issue.  There are all sorts of troublesome policies that 
might be developed.  Are you aware of any case in which 
the court has held that such a policy can be challenged 
in the abstract, in the -- as, sort of, on its face, 
rather than as applied?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  You are asking whether the 

policy --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The policy when they --

when they deny someone his Giglio rights or so on and so 
on.  Have you had any cases like this one in which a 
court has held that such a cause of action is available

against an office policy?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That such a cause of 

action --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Can be brought under 1983 

for such a general policy?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  In the absence of a 

constitutional injury?

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That it will produce on a 

regular basis constitutional --

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor, I am aware 

of any such case, but I will say --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then it seems to me that 
in this case the absolute immunity question is harder 
than the question that you present on the merits.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, it's actually 
not, and I will tell you why.  Our -- we do not have to 
allege, for a 1983 case, that the conduct complained of 
was unconstitutional.  All we have to allege was that 
the conduct caused a constitutional violation.  So, for 
1983 purposes, this case is a case -- most clearly, most 
prominently our theory would be that this case is a case 
in which the district attorney was aware of this market 
bazaar atmosphere of trading in illegal -- excuse me --
in perjured jailhouse confessions and did nothing to 
intervene.  It's sort of a classic Hanton claim.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the bottom line would 

be, if you are right, that every district attorney in 
the country, large or small office, would have to have a 
data bank that can be shared by all prosecutors, 
informants that are used.  That would be the 
constitutional requirement for every supervising 
prosecutor in the land.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Not necessarily, Your 

Honor.  First of all, Giglio imposes the -- or puts the 
district attorneys on notice as to what they ought to be 
doing.  But the constitutional requirement would be when 
you were aware of strong warnings of this bizarre 
atmosphere in which jailhouse confessions are being used 
in this way, and you are aware that lawyers on one side 
of the office don't know what lawyers on the other side 
of the office are doing, then, yes, you are deliberately 
indifferent to the constitutional violations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was surprised by 

your answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetical, because I 
thought it undermines your case.  You said that you 
don't have to show that the data system is 
unconstitutional.  You just have to show that it caused 
a constitutional violation.  But it would cause a 
constitutional violation as applied in a particular 
case.  And you would object to it in that case, and

perhaps all this data sharing information system would 
be very good evidence in that case.  Look, he didn't 
turn over this document.  The reason he didn't turn it 
over is because they've got a policy of not giving them 
the document.  But your objection would have to be based 
in a particular case.  And we have already held that in 
that case there is absolute immunity.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor, and that 

is true of almost every prosecutorial immunity case. 
The injury almost always happens when the lapse 
materializes in injury in the courtroom.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Exactly.  Now, 
doesn't that just confirm the concern that has been 
expressed that all you're doing is circumventing the 
absolute immunity we recognized at trial.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor, not any 

more --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even though the data 

system, as you've said, doesn't cause a constitutional 
violation.  It's the application of it at trial.  Now, I 
know that's immune.  You say, well, I'm going to get 
around it.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, not any more, Your 

Honor, than Buckley or Burns were circumnavigating 
around Imbler.  I mean in those cases, the

constitutional violations -- excuse me -- the acts that 
were being challenged were fabricating evidence.  Why? 
The only purpose for fabricating the evidence was to 
produce it in the courtroom.  Giving legal advice to 
extract a confession in a particular way.  Why?  The 
only purpose was to use that in the courtroom.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you began this 
dialogue by suggesting that you don't -- I am saying --
you don't have to prove that what you are complaining 
about causes a -- is a constitutional violation.  You 
just have to prove that it causes a Constitutional 
violation.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Right, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In all the examples 
you just gave me, it seems to me the allegation would be 
that --

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, not -- under Cedank, 

Your Honor, it was not -- it would not be a 
constitutional violation to extract a confession from 
someone until that confession is used in the courtroom.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that gets 

-- it seems to me a fundamental tension in your case. 
When you are talking about the conduct, you need to link 
it to a particular constitutional violation.  The data 
system has to be linked.  But when you are talking about

immunity, you want to say, oh, it has got nothing to do 
with the constitutional violation.  It's just shuffling 
paper.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, that's 

exactly right.  It is because the functional approach --
for purposes of a functional approach, you never look at 
the case through the lens of a constitutional violation. 
You look at it through the lens of the conduct that's 
being challenged.  So that's what, for example, this 
Court did in Kalina.  The constitutional violation 
occurred in the courtroom, but the lens that the Court 
looked at it through was the specific conduct where this 
Court said --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But your client's standing 

to challenge this whole policy is the fact that he was 
the victim of the -- of the use of the policy in a 
particular case for which the prosecutor has 
absolute immunity.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor, and that 
is always true in an immunity case.  It is always true 
that the -- that the injury materializes in the 
courtroom.  And this Court said in Buckley and in Burns 
it is utterly irrelevant where the injury materializes. 
What is relevant is whether you have a --

earlier that there are no prior cases in which such -- a 
person who suffered such an injury can bring an 
independent 1983 case challenging the policy at large.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, that's correct, Your 

Honor, but it's a rare event that gets discovered.

 Thank you, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Now, Mr. Coates, you have eight minutes 

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. COATES:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
 I think some of the Court's comments have 

underscored the tension in this case that the nature of 
the constitutional claim here:  That the rights that 
were actually violated are the Giglio and Brady rights. 
But the function we are talking about is the function of 
complying with Brady and Giglio.

 You can do it in various fashions.  Maybe 

it's a data base.  Maybe it's something else.  Maybe in 
some cases it's even foreclosing particular witnesses 
from testifying because you don't trust them.  That is 
essentially what the district attorney's policy is now. 
It -- it forecloses deputy district attorneys from just, 
willy-nilly, using jailhouse informants.  They have

severe restrictions on what they can do.

 It's hard to imagine a -- a policy that is 

more directed to courtroom behavior than something 
that's caveating the discretion of a particular line 
prosecutor as to which witnesses they can use.

 I think what we have here is a 

constitutional claim that the tighter they try and draw 
not just the causation, but the nature of the obligation 
itself is tied to the prosecutorial function.  Because 
it's part of the prosecutorial function to assure the 
disclosure of exculpatory information under Brady and --
and Giglio.

 And so I would submit that under Imbler this 

Court has already held that that conduct by an 
individual prosecutor falls squarely within immunity. 
And I submit that there is -- there is simply no 
distinction for that kind of conduct when it's done in 
the courtroom and that kind of conduct when it's done in 
advance in all cases by a supervising prosecutor or by a 
chief advocate.  If the Court has no further questions 
--

JUSTICE BREYER:  I suppose the distinction 
he's trying to make maybe -- I'm not sure I've got it 
right, but you see there are certain kinds of systems 
that maybe administratively an office ought to have.

And where it turns out that this is really an 
administrative system, a lot of offices do have it, some 
don't, but where it was negligent not to have it and the 
very presence of it would have prevented the -- the 
individual in the courtroom from behaving the way he 
did, well, that's a separate kind of a claim.  That's an 
administrative claim.

 Just as if, for example, suppose you had no 

secretary or assistants.  He says, look, everybody 
should have secretarial assistance.  And if only you had 
secretarial assistance, these people would not have 
misread everything the way they did or would have gotten 
the phone calls or would have done something like that. 
That's the kind of line -- so he's trying to draw a line 
there between something that is pretty purely 
administrative and -- and something that is really 
supervisory and training.  And he is not saying 
supervisory and training.  He is saying that was a 
separate claim.

 MR. COATES:  Well, I think it's hard for him 

to get away from the manner in which he is trying to 
characterize it as being just administrative because 
it's not information just sitting there in a vacuum. 
The key thing is the policy that --

or he wants to say in that day's world, whatever it was. 
They have information systems.  They existed, and every 
office ought to have them.  And now he says I might lose 
on that claim; but, nonetheless, it's not the kind of 
claim that falls within Imbler.  I think that's his 
point.  I'm not positive.  He doesn't have to take my --
MR. COATES:  I think that is -- that is the 

point.  But I think our point is that trying to 
characterize that as an administrative system strips it 
of the -- the meaning for which you are collecting the 
data.  I mean, according to them, the reason we have the 
obligation is because of the prosecutorial obligation 
under Giglio and Brady to make sure that exculpatory 
information gets out there.  So it's -- it's not just 
administrative.

 And I -- I assume if you look at the Ninth 

Circuit decision -- and I -- and one of the main focuses 
of the Ninth Circuit's decision in the case was not so 
much that it was merely administerial.  It kind of 
reached that conclusion on this notion that decisions 
about all cases are different than decisions about a 
particular case.

 And I think our point is that, in looking at 

the -- at the function performed here, you can't make 
that distinction.  That it really -- there really isn't

a distinction.  That if you are making a decision for 
all cases, then you are making a decision for that 
particular case.

 There is no difference from making a policy 
in advance and saying everybody has to follow it.  And 
then, as I mentioned before, the criminal complaint is 
filed, and you send out an e-mail saying comply with 
Brady, or this is how you comply with Brady.  There is 
no real difference there.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
