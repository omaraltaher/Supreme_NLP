CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-7574, David Allen Sattazahn versus


Pennsylvania.


Before we begin the second argument, I would


like to welcome a group of French judges from the Cour --


French Cour de Cassation, France's highest court -- who


are visiting our Court today.


Soir le bienvenue, Monsieurs.


Mr. Dunham, you may proceed.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. DUNHAM


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DUNHAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The double jeopardy question presented in this


case is whether the statutorily mandated judgment of life


that was entered in David Sattazahn's first capital trial


is, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, a judgment


that precludes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from


seeking and obtaining the death penalty in a second


capital trial.  Pennsylvania was afforded one fair


opportunity to sentence Mr. Sattazahn to death, and the


jury in his case decided, in accordance with the trial


court's instructions, in accordance with the verdict slip,

in accordance with the law of Pennsylvania, to report to


the court the presence of circumstances that it knew would


compel the court to impose a life sentence.  That judgment


of life having been imposed after a full and fair


opportunity to try, Pennsylvania could not seek death


against Mr. Sattazahn on retrial.


QUESTION:  But that wasn't the result of the


same sort of factual determination by a jury that took


place in Bullington, was it?


MR. DUNHAM:  No, that's correct, Your Honor. 


The Pennsylvania -- the factual difference between


Pennsylvania and Missouri is the following, Your Honor. 


In Pennsylvania -- actually in both States -- if there's a


unanimous jury verdict, that's the verdict that the court


imposes, that's the sentence the court imposes.  In both


States, if the jury does not reach a unanimous verdict,


then the court is required as a matter of law to impose a


life sentence, so here, when the jury did not -- when the


jury sent its note back saying it was 9 to 3 in favor of


life, the court was required as a matter of Pennsylvania


law to impose a life sentence.


QUESTION:  But in Bullington the verdict was


unanimous, was it not?


MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Well, isn't that quite a significant

difference?  Here the jury did not come to a conclusion


one way or the other.  They -- they hung.


MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, they did not hang


in the traditional sense of a hung jury, and the


distinction between this case and a hung jury case is the


following.  The traditional hung jury case, the lack of --


when there's an absence of unanimity what happens is, the


trial court discontinues the proceedings and jeopardy


never terminates, and the proceedings are sent back to


start over.


Here, as a matter of Pennsylvania law, the


legislature determined in advance, saw the possibility of


a nonunanimous jury as one of the foreseeable outcomes of


the trial and in so doing it said, well, if that happens,


what we're going to do is say, the State only gets one 

chance.  If the State does not meet its burden of proving


to all twelve jurors that aggravating circumstances


outweigh mitigating circumstances, then, well, that's the


only chance they get, and if they don't do that --


QUESTION:  But you agree --


QUESTION:  That assumes the point in issue.  The


State says that's not what we're saying, it's a default


mechanism and that is not the only chance the State gets


if there's a default.  I -- this isn't a State law issue


we're arguing.  I take it that the case comes to us on the

assumption that this is -- that Missouri has done is a


correct interpretation of its law.  I mean, if the State


supreme court says so, so you -- for you to say, oh well,


the State says this is the only chance, that's the whole


issue of the case.


MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, this is like


Smalis versus Pennsylvania, another double jeopardy case


in Pennsylvania that was a decade before, in which


Pennsylvania -- this Court correctly found that


Pennsylvania could say what was necessary for the court to


enter a judgment --


QUESTION:  Yes, but --


MR. DUNHAM:  -- but not say what the


constitutional --


QUESTION: 


-- that was a question of what was --

whether or not there was double jeopardy, whether or not


he, in fact, could be subject to a new trial, but you are


telling us that the State in this case has said that this


is his -- the State's only chance, and that's not the way


the State reads this law.  That's all I would say.


MR. DUNHAM:  This is what the statute says, Your


Honor.  What the statute -- the statute is very clear


when -- when you look at --


QUESTION:  The statute doesn't say anything


about this is the State's only chance.

 MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, what the statute


says -- that's true, the statute does not expressly say


this is your only chance.  What the statute says, it


delineates the two circumstances, and the only two


circumstances in which a death sentence may be imposed,


and then it says, the verdict must be a sentence of life


imprisonment in all other cases.


In so doing, what the Pennsylvania legislature


determined was that unless -- unless the prosecution was


able to prove its case for death, that is, that


aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating


circumstances, and was able to prove its case for death


unanimously, then the outcome would be a life sentence.


QUESTION:  Mr. Dunham, do I understand that


essentially what you are arguing is that we have here, to 

put it in simple terms, claim preclusion but not issue


preclusion?  You agree that this jury found nothing, so


that if the Pennsylvania law had been -- when the jury


comes in 9 to 3 or 7 to 2, whatever -- when it comes in


that way, that the Pennsylvania law had been new trial on


penalty, you would have no double jeopardy claim.  So


you're relying on the entry of a mandatory judgment for


life to effect basically claim preclusion, although you


admit there's no issue preclusion.  That is, no issue has


been found by anyone.

 MR. DUNHAM:  There's no issue preclusion with


respect to aggravating and circumstance -- aggravating and


mitigating circumstances, Your Honor, but what's clear is


that this jury had made a legally binding factual


determination with respect to the issue of life or death,


and --


QUESTION:  But this jury --


QUESTION:  But it --


QUESTION:  -- didn't do anything but say We


can't agree.


QUESTION:  Yes, they just hung.


MR. DUNHAM:  No, Your Honor.  This jury did


split 9 to 3.


QUESTION:  And its verdict had to be unanimous


in order to have any effect, did it not?


MR. DUNHAM:  The verdict had to be unanimous for


the jury verdict to be imposed, but by operation of


Pennsylvania law, when -- the judge is then given the


opportunity to make two predicate factual determinations,


and if those predicate factual determinations are found --


and those are determinations relating to whether or not


the State had proven its case -- then the judge must


impose a life sentence.


QUESTION:  Well, could the judge have imposed a


death sentence here in view of a 9 to 3 verdict of the

jury?


MR. DUNHAM:  No, it could not, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Well, then, it seems to me when you


say Pennsylvania law says this and says that, as Justice


Kennedy just -- that's not what the supreme court of


Pennsylvania said.  You've obviously got a constitutional


argument here, double jeopardy, but I don't think you can


shift it over and say, this is what Pennsylvania law says.


MR. DUNHAM:  The Pennsylvania supreme court --


yes, Your Honor.


The Pennsylvania supreme court can say what the


operative effects of the statute are, and what the


Pennsylvania supreme court has said the operative effects


of the statute are is that when the jury is not unanimous,


then the judge must take a particular step, and that is to 

impose the mandatory life sentence.


QUESTION:  Yes, I do think you can say that in


this case, there was a judgment that could have been final


had there been no appeal, and so therefore it's different


from a hung jury case in some other instances where


there's just no determination at all, because after the


jury's failure to agree, the judge did impose a sentence


that might have become final, that looked final in many


instances, in -- from many perspectives.  It turned out


that there was an appeal, but it could have been final if

there had been no appeal.


MR. DUNHAM:  Well, in fact, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  I mean, I take it that's part of your


case.


MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Justice Kennedy, what


Pennsylvania does is, Pennsylvania forecloses any appeal


of the sentencing determination.  When the defendant


receives a life sentence at the close of this trial-like


capital sentencing proceeding the State does not have


authority to appeal and, of course, the defendant has no


reason to appeal because he has -- he's come out with a


life sentence.


QUESTION:  Can I ask you, do you know from the


record in this -- does the record tell us in this case


whether or not this criminal defendant was advised of the 

risk of taking an appeal?


MR. DUNHAM:  There is nothing in the record that


indicates that he was advised of that risk.  In fact, the


record -- everything that we can see on the record, from


the record there is nothing that says anywhere that David


Sattazahn was told that if he took an appeal, he risked


his life, and in fact --


QUESTION:  Well, do Pennsylvania judges


ordinarily tell potential appellants what the consequences


of an appeal will be?

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Pennsylvania judges tell them


what rights that they are waiving, so --


QUESTION:  By appealing?


MR. DUNHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.  But -- But what


was --


be?


QUESTION:  What sort of a colloquy would that


MR. DUNHAM:  I --


QUESTION:  I mean, you know, I can see where a


defendant's being arraigned, or being advised whether or


not he should have counsel, there's that sort of a


colloquy, but --


MR. DUNHAM:  That's what I was thinking of, Your


Honor.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


Ordinarily a judge, after a 

verdict comes in, there's no colloquy between the judge


and the defendant, is there?


MR. DUNHAM:  No, Your Honor.  There's a colloquy


as to you have a certain number of days to file post


verdict motions, you have the right to be represented by


counsel, and so forth.


QUESTION:  Could you --


QUESTION:  One of the things that we worry about


in enforcing the Double Jeopardy Clause is the possibility


that without its protection, the State, in effect, could

fail in its attempts and try again and again and again and


again.  Is there any risk of that with respect to the


penalty determination here?


On the face of it, it would seem that there


isn't such a risk, because the only circumstance -- or the


only obvious circumstance -- in which the State could see


the -- seek the death penalty again is the one that we


have in this case, in which the defendant takes the appeal


on some underlying issue of guilt or innocence, and it's


only then, if he is successful, that the State would, on


its view and on the Pennsylvania supreme court's view,


have another shot at getting the death penalty.  Is there


any greater risk of the State's being -- bringing


repetitive, making repetitive attempts to get the death


penalty against a given defendant?


MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, if the judgment


is not a final judgment sentence, I don't see as a matter


of double jeopardy jurisprudence what would prevent the


State of Pennsylvania from then saying, for every other


defendant who had received a life sentence solely by


virtue of a split jury, why that would not be subject to


further proceedings.


QUESTION:  Well, that's a question that


ultimately I intended to ask counsel on the other side,


but what's your position on it?

 MR. DUNHAM:  I think that --


QUESTION:  If you lose, is that, in your


judgment, the consequence?


MR. DUNHAM:  I think that's --


QUESTION:  That even in a case in which the


defendant does not appeal the underlying conviction, the


State can say, we'd simply like to try again on penalty? 


Is that your position?


MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, under double jeopardy


law, yes, I think that would be the risk --


QUESTION:  Well, is it a plausible position


under Pennsylvania law, because I -- and here I'm really


at sea, but we've been told that the State has no appeal


from the sentence.  The State cannot go to the State


supreme court and say something was wrong in the 

sentencing proceeding and we should have another


opportunity, so how would the State get its second choice?


Do you think it would be inconsistent under


State law for the State simply to go to the trial judge


and say We'd like you to vacate that judgment insofar --


or the verdict -- insofar as it calls for a life sentence


and let us try again?  Do you think that is open to the


State under State law?


MR. DUNHAM:  I think the suggestion would be --


they certainly cannot appeal.  That would be the manner in

which it would be done if the State -- if the State --


QUESTION:  No, but is there any reason to


believe that they could follow the course that I just


suggested, which would give them a repetitive opportunity?


MR. DUNHAM:  I would say as a matter of double


jeopardy, yes, there would be a reason to fear that.


QUESTION:  No, but I'm just asking a question of


State law.  Do you think the State law can be read in a


way that would allow them to do that?


MR. DUNHAM:  Yes, Your Honor, I do.


QUESTION:  But how?


QUESTION:  I can't believe you would take that


position, that as a matter of State law the State can go


in afterwards and seek a redetermination of the death


penalty under Pennsylvania law. 


You've already told us 

the State can't appeal.


MR. DUNHAM:  I'm -- that's --


QUESTION:  Under what provision of State law


could the State go in and ask for it to be done in some


other fashion?  I'm startled by your answer, really.


MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, I mean, I think


it's unlikely that the State would do that, but I'm saying


that --


QUESTION:  We're just asking, as a matter of


State law, how could it?

 QUESTION:  The whole premise of your case is, as


I understand it, is as a matter of Pennsylvania law, a


split verdict has the same effect as a unanimous verdict


for life.


MR. DUNHAM:  That's right, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So, let's -- let's --


QUESTION:  If that's true, then they certainly


can't go in and -- and ask for another trial.


QUESTION:  Let's go back for a second, can --


QUESTION:  So, you misspoke on that.


MR. DUNHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Could we go back to where we started


this whole discussion?  I mean, I would like to suggest to


you that we're dealing with a kind of analogy, that the


law in this entire area is a matter of analogy.  We're


analogizing the penalty phrase of a death trial as if it


were a second trial.


MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  So I take it your problem is that


working with analogy, there's quite a lot here that


suggests a hung jury, and there are some things that


don't, so if it's like a hung jury, of course, the Double


Jeopardy Clause doesn't bar it.  If it's not like a hung


jury, then it does, so I'd like to ask you to say as


concisely as you can in terms of the purposes of this

25

whole area of law, why is it not like a hung jury?


MR. DUNHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.


Justice Breyer, it's not like a hung jury first


because in the hung jury cases, the jury fails to reach a


decision and, as a result, the trial court then


discontinues the proceedings.  A hung jury does not result


in the entry of a judgment.  In a hung jury situation, the


case gets sent back and the prosecution then has the


opportunity to decide whether it's going to proceed with a


retrial.


This is not a hung jury.  It's not a hung jury


because 1) it does not produce a mistrial, it produces as


a matter of law an entry of judgment, and that judgment is


a -- what we would say is a -- a judgment of acquittal. 


The reason it's a judgment of acquittal is because this 

Court has made clear in the context of Bullington, it's


made clear in the context of Rumsey, and even in Monje v.


California and Casperri that there is something


fundamentally different about a capital sentencing


proceeding that has all the hallmarks of a trial of guilt


or innocence.


There's something fundamentally different about


those proceedings from any other sentencing proceeding


and, because of that, because a capital sentencing


proceeding is the functional equivalent of a trial on the


16

24

25

issue of life or death, and because the State has


additional burdens of proof, additional evidentiary


requirements, the sentencing phase is, in effect, the


functional equivalent of a greater offense.


Because of these factors, when a defendant


emerges from a capital sentencing proceeding, tried to


completion, submitted to a jury and, after the


deliberations are done and the law operates, comes out of


this with a sentence of life, that life sentence is an


acquittal of the death penalty.


Now, because of that --


QUESTION:  You really are arguing for claim


preclusion, because in the two juries -- the jury in a


State that says, Okay, we do a retrial on sentence, and


Pennsylvania -- the two juries are doing an identical 

thing.  You're giving it a different label because


Pennsylvania law precludes the claim, but the two juries


have done precisely the same thing, so -- and the


difference between this case and Bullington, of course, is


that there was a determination, a fact determination by


the fact-finder for life rather than death.


MR. DUNHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And so you can't equate those two


cases, so you have to be relying on claim preclusion


because a judgment has been entered.

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, but Your Honor, I think it's


important to know what it is that the jury knew at the


time that it made its statement to the judge that it was


going to -- that it was intractably split 9 to 3 in favor


of life.


What that jury knew, because it was told in the


jury instructions, was that there were certain


circumstances in which it could impose a death penalty. 


There were two limited circumstances -- aggravating


circumstances and no mitigation, or aggravation that


outweighed mitigation -- and in all other circumstances a


life sentence would be returned, so the jury is told that


up front.


Then the judge instructed the jury to take a


look at the verdict slip in the case, and the verdict 

slip -- which contained language in bold capital letters


that were mandated by the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal


Procedure -- the verdict slip also told the story the same


things, and told the jury that if it could not reach a


unanimous verdict, it was to report that to the court, and


if the court found two facts, 1) that they were not


unanimous and 2) that they were not going to be unanimous,


the court would have the duty to impose a life sentence.


QUESTION:  And that would go even if it had been


1 for life and 11 for death, so you've repeated a few

times the 9 to 3 for life, but it wouldn't make any


difference if it was lopsided the other way?


MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct.  That's correct,


Your Honor.  But what's clear from this is that this jury


knew when it was reporting back that a life sentence would


result, and what's also clear is the way the statute is


written, the legislature has determined -- the legislature


has placed on the State the burden of persuading all 12


jurors that death is the appropriate punishment, that


aggravation outweighs mitigation.  When the jury splits,


that is a fact finding that the State has not proven its


case to all 12.


QUESTION:  But it's not a fact finding by the


whole jury.


MR. DUNHAM: 


Well, it's a fact finding by all of 

the jurors that the State has not been able to persuade


everybody.


QUESTION:  Yes, that's true, but it's 9 out


of 12, or 11 out of 1, whatever the case may be.  It's not


the whole jury.


MR. DUNHAM:  Yes, Your Honor, but then again,


Your Honor, as a matter of double jeopardy -- as a matter


of constitutional law -- there's nothing magical about the


jury having to be unanimous.  In fact --


QUESTION:  No, but there is something magical

about a jury, a unanimous jury making a determination, as


was the case in Bullington, where you don't just have a


split in the jury, the whole jury comes back and says Yes,


it's only life.


MR. DUNHAM:  But here the sentencer came back


and said Because the State has failed to prove its case


for death, then the answer is life.


The Pennsylvania law sets for the circumstances


in which the State has either proven or failed to prove


its case for death, and --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dunham, maybe I'm


misunderstanding the Pennsylvania law, but I thought that


this position, we enter judgment of life, it favors


defendants.  That is, the State is saying If nothing


further happens we're not going to subject this defendant 

to the chance of getting death on a resentencing hearing.


We're going to give him life.


On the other hand, if he chooses to appeal from


the guilt part on, say, a charge error, as was the case


here, then we're no longer going to give him that benefit. 


We did it on the notion that the thing would be over.  He


wouldn't be subject to death, but now he's taking, in


effect, advantage of something we did to benefit him.


MR. DUNHAM:  Essentially, Your Honor, what


you're stating is the clean slate doctrine, and what --

22

23

24

25

and I think it's critical, when we're categorizing the


cases, to figure out which box this case goes in.


The clean slate doctrine applies when the


defendant has been convicted, and has been convicted of


the relevant charge.  If it's true, as this Court has said


in Bullington, and as this court has said in Rumsey, and I


would suggest, Your Honors, as it said in both Casperri


and Monje, that there is this categorical distinction


between capital sentencing proceedings and noncapital


proceedings, and that what happens in a trial-like capital


sentencing proceeding is that you have a separate trial on


the issue of the death penalty, then when you are


appealing from your guilt stage conviction, you're


essentially appealing from a lesser offense, and so, using


as the analogy Green versus United States, you would not 

be appealing -- you would not be placing the sentence at


issue.  You have won on the issue of sentence, so you're


appealing a lesser offense.


QUESTION:  But apparently Pennsylvania has


interpreted its law differently on this point. 


Pennsylvania would say, I gather, that if the defendant


does appeal in these circumstances from his conviction,


that it's all open to the State to seek the death penalty


again.  That's what Pennsylvania would say.


MR. DUNHAM:  But Pennsylvania can't --

 QUESTION:  But you don't want us to hold that it


can say that.  You want to say that the Federal rule


should come into play and prevent Pennsylvania from saying


that.


MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question about --


actually, two questions about Bullington?  Is it not -- am


I correct in recalling that in Bullington, the State had


the same -- the jury had the same two options, it either


could have found unanimously for the death penalty, or


either unanimously or by a split verdict, it could have


refused to find the death penalty and the consequence


under Missouri law would have been the life sentence?


MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct.


QUESTION: 


So it's exactly like this case in 

that respect.


MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  And is it also not true that in that


case, we can't tell whether the jury verdict was finding


no aggravating circumstances, or a finding that no matter


what the aggravating circumstances are, we're not going to


impose the death penalty?


MR. DUNHAM:  In Bullington?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. DUNHAM:  Justice Stevens, in Bullington we

can take it one step further.  In Bullington, we know that


the jury found at least one aggravating circumstance.


QUESTION:  And they -- so that their -- the


double jeopardy did not rest on the fact there was a


finding of fact, but rather, there was an ultimate


judgment that death is the inappropriate penalty?


MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. DUNHAM:  Now, Your Honors, I'd like to make


a -- I'd like to just talk very briefly about the second


issue and then reserve time for rebuttal.  The


Commonwealth has agreed that this statute -- the


Pennsylvania statute -- has created a liberty interest, a


life and liberty interest in the life sentence that was


the product of the nonunanimous jury.


What we would like to -- the dispute between the


parties is whether that life and liberty interest that the


State concedes exists survives an appeal, and for all the


reasons that we've talked about in the briefs, we would


say it does, because there is a special interest in


finality.


This Court has recognized in Bullington and in


Rumsey that capital sentencing proceedings -- and also in


the other, the noncapital cases we mentioned -- that one


of the hallmark differences between a capital sentencing


23

phase and a noncapital sentencing is precisely the


expectation in finality in the capital sentencing, and so


the defendant has a legitimate and substantial expectation


going in that when he gets this life sentence, it is going


to be a sentence that will remain with him.


We would say that Pennsylvania arbitrarily


deprives a defendant of this life and liberty interest if


it conditions his appeal -- if it conditions the


enforcement of that right -- upon giving up the right to


appeal a lesser and distinctly different offense.  It's


conditioning the enforcement of his life sentence for --


in this case -- upon his not appealing the lesser first


degree murder charge, and that's where we say it's


arbitrary.


If the Court has no further questions, I'd like 

to reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Dunham.


Ms. Dougherty, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF IVA C. DOUGHERTY


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In Bullington, this Court examined its holding


that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to


sentencing proceedings, and carved out a limited exception


24

which was based on the findings made by a sentencer in a


capital sentencing proceeding.  The exception does not


arise out of the proceeding itself.  It arises out of


these findings, which distinguish it from a traditional


sentencing procedure.  This is the only conclusion which


is consistent with existing double jeopardy jurisprudence. 


The Court has never applied double jeopardy protections to


traditional sentencing procedures, because --


QUESTION:  It does seem a little odd that -- if


you have case 1, where there are no errors and the


defendant is not in any way prejudiced, and there is a


life sentence, that's final.  But in this case, there was


a flawed trial, the defendant was prejudiced, but at this


point he now faces a greater sentence for having -- for


having established the -- that prejudice. 


Now, obviously, 

if we're going to give him the option, we'd say That's a


risk he takes, but it's a little troubling about your --


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Well, double jeopardy -- the


Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't preclude a defendant having


to make choices in making a decision, and there's nothing


final about the life sentence that's imposed by a default


judgment under the Pennsylvania statute.  It's no


different than any other sentence imposed at the end of a


traditional sentencing proceeding.


QUESTION:  Well, is it final if he does not

appeal?  I mean, just to clear up that issue upon which we


got an answer that surprised us from counsel on the other


side, if he does not appeal, under Pennsylvania law, can


the State go, in effect, before the judge again and say We


would like to have another attempt to get the death


penalty?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Okay.


QUESTION:  Well, this is like -- it seems like


Bullington in one respect, and not like it in another. 


It's not like it in the sense that there's a hung jury. 


It's like it, however, in the sense that the person is


faced with a terrible choice.  If he doesn't appeal, he'll


live.  If he does appeal, he may die.


Now, if that terrible choice is embodied in the 

reasons for an exception to the ordinary blank slate rule,


that exists here, so do you think that terrible choice has


nothing to do with the exception whatsoever, or does it


have something to do with it?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Under double jeopardy analysis,


I don't believe it has anything to do with it.  The


defendant also, upon appeal --


QUESTION:  Well, if it has nothing to do with


it, why did the court create the exception?  For, after


all, ordinarily, as you pointed out, when a person a

person appeals his trial, he makes of his sentence a blank


slate.  It can be reopened.  So why did the court say


originally that death sentences are different?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Because the proceeding itself


requires a finding.  It leads to a finding.  It leads to


an acquittal in a way that other traditional sentencing


proceedings do not, and when someone has been acquitted of


the death penalty, then the State -- that would be


precluded by double jeopardy purposes for going back,


because of the finality that attaches to an acquittal, not


to the final judgment, not to a sentence that's imposed as


the result of -- that terminates a proceeding, certainly,


but it doesn't have that same finality that the court has


always accorded to an acquittal, and --


QUESTION: 


Well, from the dynamics of what the 

defendant faces when he's sitting at the table and he


hears the verdict come in, he hears the verdict come in,


no liability for the death penalty, the judge then


sentences him to prison, and I had thought he would


breathe a sigh of relief.  Under your position, no.  In


other words, he's faced the ordeal of -- of the trial,


et cetera.


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Exactly, and if he stops and is


satisfied with a life sentence instead of trying to get an


acquittal, which is the result of possibly seeking another

trial, is that he could walk out of the courtroom an


innocent man on second trial.  And that is a choice, but I


believe under Chaffin this Court has not ruled out the


defendant having to make choices like that.  No matter how


serious, how tough the choice is --


QUESTION:  Can you -- can I interrupt with just


one question?  Are there any other double jeopardy -- I


mean, I don't -- are there any other hung jury situations,


other than this very narrow category, in which the


prosecutor does not have the option to go ahead and seek a


second trial?


See, here you -- unless the defendant appeals, a


prosecutor can't do anything about it here.  Is there any


other hung jury situation in which the prosecutor's hands


are tied in that way?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  I believe the answer is no.


QUESTION:  I think that's --


MS. DOUGHERTY:  However, I think it's comparable


to the guilty plea situation, where the Government could


forego seeking death in order to -- for an agreement to


life, and the Commonwealth -- the State would not be able


to appeal that imposition of the life sentence.


However, if the defendant appeals and gets his


sentence, gets his guilty plea withdrawn, the State would


not be precluded in that case from seeking death at the


28

trial.  So I think the situation is along those lines.


QUESTION:  Well, but a hung jury is not quite


like a plea bargain, though.  And that's what you're


talking about, isn't it?  If the agreement is set aside,


then of course everybody starts from scratch, but not --


but when you've got a hung jury, normally the prosecutor


has the choice of whether to go ahead and retry or not.


MS. DOUGHERTY:  That's correct, Your Honor.


However, the situation in this case, and the


situation for the exception in Bullington, revolved around


the findings by the jury, and it revolved around the idea


of an acquittal, not a sentence, and that was pointed out


further in Rumsey, where the Court talked about, the


sentence was based on findings which entitled the


defendant to a life sentence, and again in Poland --

QUESTION:  Just -- let me ask just one more


question, then I'll be through.  I did not remember --


your opponent said that there was actually a finding of an


aggravating circumstance in Bullington.  Was he correct on


that?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  I don't believe so, Your Honor. 


There may have been a finding, but it may have been


outweighed.  I'm sorry, I don't remember that, but it may


have been outweighed by the mitigating --


QUESTION:  So there would have been eligibility

for the death penalty there.


MS. DOUGHERTY:  But the ultimate finding of the


jury was that they were -- that they acquitted the


defendant based on their weighing situation.


And Poland further limited Bullington and


specifically talked about when there is not an acquittal,


then Bullington -- the Bullington exception does not


apply, and --


QUESTION:  Suppose we had a State with a system


that said, if any -- and I think some do have this


system -- if any one juror votes for life, then the


sentence shall be life.  Suppose we had that system, and


the jury comes in and says, we're 11 to 1 for death.  The


judge enters judgment for life.  In that case, if the


guilt -- if it's an appeal from the guilt determination, 

and it's successful, then there wouldn't be -- there would


be no possibility of reopening the death-life decision,


would there?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't


know that that would qualify as an acquittal.  That may be


a decision made by the State legislature, but the fact


that one person would hold out for life -- an acquittal


is, traditionally has been looked at as a finding of


innocence, and a finding -- the court has generally


recognized it as finding innocence based on the evidence

in the record, and it's based on -- the whole point of the


jury system is to reach a collective agreement, a


collective judgment by the community, and one person


holding out for life does not possibly affect the


conscience of the community on that sentence.


QUESTION:  So, you say it would make no


difference if, instead of in this case, where the legal


consequence following -- follows a jury disagreement, a


State that says we make, in effect, each juror the


decisionmaker on the life-death question.


MS. DOUGHERTY:  I don't think that would still


have the finality of an acquittal under this Court's


double jeopardy jurisprudence, and of course, the


hypothetical doesn't apply in this situation, because


that's not what Pennsylvania said, but I don't believe 

that one juror holding out for life could possibly garner


that finality that an acquittal has, and if -- I believe


there are certainly -- there might be -- there would be an


argument in that case that if the defendant appealed,


that --


QUESTION:  Why not?  If the State law sets up


that single juror in the same way that it sets up a single


judge, if the trial is before the judge -- if the


sentencing trial is before the judge?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  A State could do that.  I just

24

25

don't believe that that legislative decision would have


the same finality as -- as an acquittal, because an


acquittal is based upon a collective judgment of the


community on the ultimate question of --


QUESTION:  Well, do you think that that case


that I gave you, where the State law says one juror for


life is enough, and Pennsylvania, do you think there's any


significant distinction between those two laws?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  I -- well, I'm sorry.  I'm a


little -- I'm not quite sure I understand your question. 


There's a definite different in that Pennsylvania requires


a unanimous jury to reach a verdict, and therefore,


Pennsylvania is saying unless the jury -- all of the jury


agrees -- then there is no verdict.  There's no acquittal. 


There's no conviction.  It's a hung jury.


I don't feel that I answered your question, but


I'm not sure how to better answer it.  I do believe that


there --


QUESTION:  I take it you do believe that there


is a difference between those two situations.


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Well, there's a difference in


language.  I don't know that there's a difference in


effect, in the double jeopardy concept of acquittal, the


finality that should be accorded that judgment.


The -- Pennsylvania's position, of course, is


32

20

21

22

23

24

25

that without these findings made by a jury, that under


Bullington analysis, then double jeopardy would not bar


retrial for the maximum sentence.  You're right back at


the results obtained from the traditional sentencing


proceeding.  The imposition of a particular sentence, in


this case life, is not an acquittal of any more serious


sentence that could have been imposed and, as this Court


has recognized in DiFrancesco as one example, the


pronouncement of sentence simply does not have the


qualities of constitutional finality that attend an


acquittal.


QUESTION:  May I ask -- I said I wouldn't ask


another question.  I would like to ask one more.  If the


jury in this case had been unanimous and said life rather


than death, would the judgment entered by the trial court 

have been any different than the judgment it actually did


enter?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Life would have been imposed,


but it would have been imposed for a different reason. 


The jury --


QUESTION:  Well, no, I'm asking, would the form


of the judgment, the language used by the trial judge in


entering judgment, would it have been any different from


the language it did use in this case?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Well, it would have been based

on the unanimous verdict of the jury.


QUESTION:  That's not my question.  My question


is, the language of the judgment would have been any


different within the two cases?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  It would have been a life


sentence in both cases.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  But you're saying that the Poland


analysis should make the result different.


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Yes, Your Honor.  If there's no


acquittal --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. DOUGHERTY:  -- then Bullington doesn't


apply, and that's what would be different in the sentence. 


There would be no acquittal.


QUESTION:  What happens, in your view, which --


I'll be rather imaginary.  I mean, there isn't a real


situation like this, but given the rulings of this Court,


I think you could have a State -- at least not in my


views, but other's views, you could have a State which on


sentencing left every question of fact to a jury, so they


decide every possible question of fact, but the ultimate


decision about what to do after those facts are found


would lie in the hands of a judge, and in a system like


that, where the judge then said life, would your argument

still apply, double jeopardy or not?  Could they reopen


it, or not?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Well, the facts that need to be


found in a capital sentencing proceeding --


QUESTION:  Are very complex, but we have special


forms and they go do it all.  What I'm trying to say is, I


want a State still that turns over to the judge the power


of life or death, and what the judge in such a State


decides is life, and now there is an appeal on the guilt


and innocence phase.  On -- in your opinion, can the State


reopen that ultimate judgment which it put in the hands of


the judge?  And you see, of course, why -- what my next


question will be is, Why isn't this that State?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  My problem in answering the


question, Justice Breyer, is I'm not sure what facts the 

jury is --


QUESTION:  Everything you want. 

I mean, you


know, I'm just trying to avoid that question, so have


everything you want, everything the Constitution requires,


everything the opinions of this Court requires.  What I'm


interested in is not that, but I'm interested in the State


putting the sentencing decision in the hands of the judge.


QUESTION:  Well, here the judge who enters the


verdict in this particular case does not do so because he


concludes that the circumstances -- he simply does it

because the jury has come in 9 to 3, doesn't he?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  He comes in because -- that's


right.  He has no discretion.


QUESTION:  He doesn't exercise independent


judgment.


MS. DOUGHERTY:  He has --


QUESTION:  No, but does that -- that's exactly


what I'm trying to get at, exactly the question.  I mean,


is that what makes the difference?  Because the State has


told the judge what to enter?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Well --


QUESTION:  Rather than being discretionary, does


that make a difference for double jeopardy purposes?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Well, I think it -- I think it


does, and to go back to your hypothetical, my problem in 

answering that question, if the jury, in fact, has found


as fact that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the


aggravating circumstances, then I believe that would be an


acquittal.  If the jury's findings were made in that way,


and the judge was -- the judge had to rely on those


findings in order to impose that sentence, then I believe


that that would be an acquittal, which would distinguish


it from the case we have here.


QUESTION:  Why is that important?  Why is it


important for drawing a double jeopardy line that in the

Poland situation a jury makes a unanimous determination,


or in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, a judge that has the


power makes the ultimate determination himself?  If the


judgment can otherwise be attacked on the underlying


conviction, why should it make a difference for double


jeopardy on sentence that the judgment of life rests upon


these kinds of determinations rather than the operation of


law which we have?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  Because an acquittal has


always -- the definition of acquittal has always been


based on a finding of innocence, on a finding that the


State hasn't proved its case, and if there are no such


findings -- and that's why double jeopardy hasn't been


applied to traditional sentencing proceedings, and if you


don't have those findings, then there's no basis to 

justify the acquittal, which would bar it under double


jeopardy.


QUESTION:  Were you going to comment in the time


remaining on the second argument -- which I call just a


due process argument -- that it's just unfair to condition


the appeal on the possibility of a death sentence?  Surely

court of Pennsylvania?


MS. DOUGHERTY:  It was raised.  It was never --


it was raised.  It was not specifically addressed in this


fashion by the supreme court of Pennsylvania, but it was


before the court to address.


The argument seems to be that somehow the


sentence can be separated from the conviction, and I don't


believe that's the case.  Due process -- procedural due


process requires notice and a meaningful opportunity to be


heard.  Mr. Sattazahn had that throughout these


proceedings.  Substantive due process, as this Court


stated in Albright versus Oliver, it's reluctant to expand


this generalized notion of substantive due process, and


therefore, if there's a specific amendment that applies to


the States that addresses the issue, that's what should --

that's how the claim should be reviewed.


In this case, double jeopardy definitely applies


to the States, and it seems that double jeopardy covers


all the concerns that are raised in the defendant's due


process and in petitioner's due process argument. 


Therefore, the only way that the defendant should not face


a clean slate on resentencing on retrial is the Bullington


double jeopardy exception, not any due process claim.


If the Court has no further questions --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Dougherty.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,


and may it please the Court:


The question in this case is whether


Pennsylvania's imposition of a default sentence of life


imprisonment by operation of law when the jury in a


capital sentencing proceeding is unable to reach a


unanimous verdict constitutes an acquittal within the


meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  We think the


answer to that question lies in the settled rule that a


hung jury is not an acquittal for double jeopardy


purposes.


Double jeopardy law has always drawn a clear


distinction between hung juries, where the jury fails to


reach a resolution of the case, and acquittals, where a


unanimous jury makes a factual determination that the


facts in evidence fail to establish the defendant's guilt,


or in this --


QUESTION:  May I ask how you would respond to my


question about the State that has a system, any one juror


who votes for life, if there's any one juror, it's a life


sentence, and this case?  Is there a distinction between

those two for double jeopardy purposes?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Ginsburg, we think


there is a distinction between those two.  In the


hypothetical statute that you posit, if the jury's


resolution in favor of a life sentence were not considered


to have final effect, that would strike at the heart of a


value central to the Double Jeopardy Clause in that the


State could then continue to reprosecute the defendant


repeatedly, so we think that in that hypothetical statute,


when the jury comes back for a life sentence, I don't know


if it's fair to call it an acquittal because an acquittal


has a settled meaning under the Double Jeopardy Clause,


but we think that determination would be accorded finality


for double jeopardy purposes.


But this case is different in a significant 

respect.  Here, Pennsylvania gave the defendant the same


opportunity to obtain a final acquittal in his favor that


defendants traditionally enjoy on the underlying question


of guilt or innocence, and that is that he could have


obtained a unanimous verdict in his favor, and we think


that distinction is critical for double jeopardy purposes.


QUESTION:  Why should that distinction be more


critical than the so-called judgment distinction?  In


other words, in your -- I understand you to be arguing, as


Pennsylvania argued, that the line traditionally is drawn

based on whether there was an acquittal or wasn't an


acquittal -- an acquittal versus a hung jury, but that


line historically also is drawn, in fact, depending on


whether the jury's determination results in a judgment or


not.  Here, we have a judgment.  Why should we draw the


line based on acquittal rather than drawing the line based


on judgment?  There is a tradition for each.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Souter, it's true that


the sentencing proceeding in this case culminated


ultimately in the entry of a judgment, but the fact of a


judgment we think is not dispositive for double jeopardy


purposes, and that's because the core premise of the clean


slate rule is that the entry of a sentencing judgment is


not a double jeopardy disposition that bars the State from


resentencing in the event of a retrial. 


It's not the 

event of a judgment that makes the difference.  It's


whether that judgment manifests the qualities of an


acquittal.  That's what Bullington holds.


So the question is whether the entry of a life


sentence in this case manifests the quality of a factual


acquittal, and we think it does not, because a hung jury


has never been thought to constitute an acquittal within


the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.


QUESTION:  Well, but it does constitute an


acquittal of the death penalty if there's no appeal.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  I don't think so, Justice


Kennedy, because the State can resentence in the event of


a retrial.  It's true that the State has decided that it


won't appeal, but the operation of the clean slate rule


works such that when the defendant occasions a retrial by


successfully appealing his conviction and sentence, at


that point the State is free to conduct a resentencing and


impose a harsher sentence.


QUESTION:  If you win.


QUESTION:  That assumes the issue.


QUESTION:  I mean, that's the issue.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  If -- I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  I mean, you're right if you win, but


you're wrong if you lose.


MR. SRINIVASAN: 


That's correct, but -- of 

course that's correct, Justice Breyer, but I think the


reason we should win is because the judgment that was


entered in this case is not a factual acquittal of the


nature that was considered --


QUESTION:  But, counsel, supposing the State law


had a provision in it that the votes of the jurors shall


remain secret, and the only thing that shall become public


is the judgment, what would you do in that case?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think in that case --


it would depend on how the jury were instructed.

 QUESTION:  Well, they're instructed just as they


were in this case.  As a matter of protecting the privacy


of the jurors, we're just not going to let the public know


how they voted, and that we just have a judgment out


there.  What do you do in that case?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, I think if the jury is


required to make a unanimous verdict in either direction,


and the judge imposes a sentence of life imprisonment


because the jury has made a unanimous verdict, that would


have --


QUESTION:  No, it doesn't -- the "because"


doesn't follow, because you don't know on the record I'm


hypothesizing.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think in that situation


it would present some of the same difficulties that I was 

discussing in reference to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical


in that it's unclear whether the defendant would have --


QUESTION:  Well, I take it the judge probably


knows in Justice Stevens' hypothetical what the jury did.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Right, and if the judge


articulated it in his judgment in a way that distinguished


between a judgment of a life sentence based on a unanimous


jury verdict and judgment of a life sentence based on --


QUESTION:  No, in my hypothesis he enters


exactly the same judgment he entered here, and he just

says I'm -- let's close the files on this case so the


public won't know how the jury voted.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think in that situation


we'd have the same answer that we would to Justice


Ginsburg's hypothetical, which is that because the


defendant has not been afforded an opportunity to obtain


finality, then the double jeopardy law would treat that


judgment as final, and the State would not be permitted in


that situation to revisit the sentencing judgment.


But this case is different in a significant


respect, because here, Pennsylvania law draws a


distinction between a unanimous jury verdict and a hung


jury that results in the imposition of a life sentence,


and petitioner had the opportunity to obtain a unanimous


jury verdict, and, in fact, when the jury initially past 

its note to the judge indicating that it had reached an


impasse, petitioner immediately moved for declaration of a


mistrial and discharge of the jury.  And in that situation


it's clear under double jeopardy law that when the


defendant invites the declaration of a mistrial and the


discharge of a jury, there's no double jeopardy


prohibition against the State's conducting a retrial or,


in this case, the State's conducting a new sentencing


proceeding.


QUESTION:  But isn't the -- isn't the only

distinction in Justice Stevens' hypothetical between that


case -- the case that he posits -- and this one, the


secrecy.  And I don't know why the secrecy should make a


difference, and I don't know why you don't answer by


saying, Look, what is necessary in order to implicate


double jeopardy is the unanimous acquittal by the fact-


finder, and if the record does not manifest that unanimous


acquittal, then, in fact, there would be no double


jeopardy bar to trying him on the sentence again.  Why


hasn't that got to be your answer?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Souter, because it


depends on whether State law makes unanimity the deciding


criterion.  If State law does --


QUESTION:  Well, but on Justice Stevens'


hypothetical, it does not. 


His hypothetical was, it's 

just like this case except that there's a secrecy


requirement, so we don't know.  And -- and all we know is


that yes, there ultimately was one or the other condition


necessary and sufficient -- sufficient, rather -- to


support the judgment of life, but we don't know which one


it was, and I would have thought that on your position you


would say unless it affirmatively appears that there was


an acquittal by the unanimous jury, there would be no


double jeopardy bar.  Make it just like this case.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Our position is that if a State

has a unanimity requirement, the Double Jeopardy Clause


does not preclude the State from enforcing that unanimity


requirement, but if a State draws no distinction between a


unanimous jury verdict of acquittal and a one-juror vote


for the life sentence, then the Double Jeopardy Clause


requires the State to honor the finality of the judgment


in favor of a defendant.  That's our position in this


case.


QUESTION:  Is it fair to take into account,


assuming competing analogies of equal weight, choosing the


one that would least discourage appeals?  I mean, the real


problem here, I think, is the problem of a person having a


meritorious appeal, but being afraid to make it.  So


can -- am I free to take that into account, at least, in


trying to choose between the analogies?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Breyer, we think the


due process question in terms of undue burden was --


was --


QUESTION:  I'm not saying that -- due -- is that


not a factor that I can take into account in trying to


choose among competing analogies?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  It's -- I think it's fair to


say that it's a factor, but I think it's important to note


that there are important reasons why a State would draw


the distinction drawn by Pennsylvania in this case.  There

are three reasons why a State might choose not to conduct


a resentencing in the initial round of proceedings, but


nonetheless to resentence in the event of a retrial.


First, as an interesting closure, the State


might determine that after a capital trial and a capital


sentencing hearing, at that point, it makes sense to


accept what is still a substantial punishment, the


imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment, but if the


defendant occasions a new trial by successfully appealing


his conviction, at that point the balance of


considerations changes.


And in particular, in terms of the second


reason, if a State were to conduct a new sentencing


proceeding immediately after a hung jury in the initial


round of proceedings, the sentencing jury would come to 

the new sentencing proceeding without having had the


benefit of standing through -- of sitting through the


capital trial, and the State might reasonably conclude


that at that point, it would have to retry much of the


underlying case on guilt or innocence.


By contrast, when the defendant occasions a new


trial by successfully appealing his conviction, the State


will have selected a capital jury to conduct the trial,


and the new capital jury will come to the sentencing


proceeding entirely familiar with the facts and

circumstances of the case.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.


Mr. Dunham, you have three minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. DUNHAM


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honors, I would just like to


make a couple of points in rebuttal.


The first issue I'd like to address is the


question of the State's interest in closure, and the


policies, the way the double jeopardy policies work out in


this statute in this case.  What Pennsylvania --


Pennsylvania's statute as it's written recognizes several


different interests.  One of the interests it recognizes


is the interest in economy, the interests in finality, the


interest in giving the State a single opportunity to try 

and obtain a death penalty.


On the other hand, it balances this against what


this Court has in the past said is a desirable goal of


trying to achieve jury unanimity.  So it has a preference


for a unanimous jury, and it balances that against the


finality of the sentence.  And that's why the judge is


required, when the jury comes back and says that it is not


unanimous, why that judge is then required to see if


further deliberations are going to be fruitful.


When the judge determines that the jury is not


48

unanimous, and determines that the jury is not going to


become unanimous, that represents a decision at that point


that the interest in finality, imposing the life sentence


now and ending it, outweighs the interest in obtaining a


unanimous jury.  And that is -- and that triggers, that


ties into this Court's long-term double jeopardy


jurisprudence that one of the primary interests is against


subjecting a defendant to multiple trials, forcing him to


run the gamut of a second capital sentencing proceeding


after the first has been tried to completion.


On another issues, Your Honors, one of the


things that I would suggest as a possible structural way


of looking at capital sentencing cases to see whether


there is a sensible way of determining whether or not what


you have is an acquittal is this. 


In Bullington, this 

Court talked about the binary choice between life or


death, and the significance of that when you have a trial-


like proceeding, in distinguishing between whether it's an


acquittal or a conviction, so there's a binary choice.


What the Pennsylvania statute has done is create


a second binary choice, only it's a procedural one.  If


this were a hung jury like what you see at trial, the jury


has three options.  They can acquit, they can convict, or


there's limbo.  The hung jury in the case goes back.


The Pennsylvania legislature has determined that


49 

there is a second binary choice -- a procedural choice --


and that is, unless there is a conviction, a life sentence


is entered, and by eliminating that third category, it has


made the determination that any failure by the State to


prove its case to a unanimous jury constitutes an


acquittal, so I would say that the second binary choice,


the procedural choice, is a bright line way of saying


whether or not there is an acquittal.  And a bright line,


I think, is what Bullington and Rumsey stand for --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you.  Thank you,


Mr. Dunham.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
