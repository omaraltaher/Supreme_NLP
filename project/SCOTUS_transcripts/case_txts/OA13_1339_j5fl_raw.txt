CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  today  in  Case  13­1339,  Spokeo  v.  Robins. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Pincus. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MR.  ANDREW  J.  PINCUS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  has  said  that  the  irreducible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  minimum  for  standing  is  injury  in  fact; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  plaintiff  suffered  actual  or  imminent,  tangible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm. 

            

In  Lujan,  the  Court  said  that  Congress  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elevate  to  the  status  of  legally­cognizable  injuries, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concrete,  de  facto  injuries  that  were  previously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inadequate  in  law. 

 

 

            

Here,  the  Ninth  Circuit  held  that  there's  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  for  any  de  facto  injury.  A  statutory  violation 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  some  general  sense  relates  to  the  plaintiff  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  that's  necessary,  even  though  it  has  no  tangible  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Why  is  it  you  think  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  PINCUS:  ­­ consequences  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Let's  say  I  agree  with  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  there  needs  to  be  a  concrete  injury;  that  Congress

needs  to  have  recognized  something  that  looks  like  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concrete  injury.  But  why  isn't  that  exactly  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  did  here?  So  let  me  just  frame  it  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical. 

            

Suppose  that  there's  just  a  statute  ­­ it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

a  little  bit  of  a  simpler  statute,  and  you  can  argue 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  me  or  tell  me  why  it  might  or  might  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different,  but  I  just  want  to  understand  your  position. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Suppose  that  there  is  a  statute  that  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

says  that  one  of  these  credit  reporting  agencies  shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  disseminate  inaccurate  information  about  people,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall  ­­ shall  not  do  it  willfully  or  negligently  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  have  you,  but  shall  not  disseminate  inaccurate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  about  people.  And  then  there's  a  cause  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

action  that  says  if  they  disseminate  inaccurate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  in  a  credit  report  about  you,  you  can  sue. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All  right? 

 

            

Is  that  enough  of  a  concrete  injury  for  you? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  No,  it's  not,  for  ­­ for  three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

            

And  let  me  preface  my  response  by  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  of  course,  that  isn't  the  case  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  of  the  claims  in  this  case,  which  don't  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  to  do  with  inaccuracy. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  But  let  me  focus  on

what  seems  to  be  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

claim. 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  I'm  happy  to  focus  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ the  gravamen  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And  why  isn't  the  dissemination  of  false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  about  you  in  a  credit  report,  why  isn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ why  isn't  it  ­­ it  perfectly  sufficient  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  says  that's  a  concrete  injury? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well,  I  ­­ I  guess  as  a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

threshold  matter,  I  think  what  the  Court  has  said  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  contexts  is  that  Congress  should  clearly  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  going  beyond  the  tangible  injuries  that  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  defined.  The  Court  has  had  a  clear  statement  rule. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  another  difference  between  your 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  ­­ I'm  not  sure  whether  your  hypothetical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

casts  Congress  clearly  saying,  and  by  the  way,  we  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creating  a  cause  of  action  for  people  who  otherwise 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  get  into  court. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Let  me  start  ­­ well,  maybe  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  answer  your  question  this  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You  said  that  there  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  why  that  was  not  a  concrete  injury  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Yes.

false  information  about  a  particular  person. 

   

 

 

 

            

Why?  Because  to  me,  I'll  just  say,  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  a  concrete  injury  to  me. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well,  first  ­­ first  of  all  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You  know?  If  ­­ I  mean,  if 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

somebody  did  it  to  me  I'd  feel  harmed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  that  if  you  went  out  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

street  and  you  did  a  survey,  most  people  would  feel 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmed.  Most  people  would  feel  as  though  they  had  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  that  had  been  invaded.  And  Congress  recognized 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  thought  it  was  a  significant  problem,  passed  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  to  deal  with  that  problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  First  of  all,  the  ­­ the  common 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  tradition,  which  the  Court  has  looked  to,  did  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  the  dissemination  of  any  false  statement  was  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury. 

            

            

To  prove  defamation  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That's  quite  right.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

not  ­­ it's  not  completely  in  the  common  law  tradition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  we've  said  many  times  that  Congress  gets  to  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  the  common  law  tradition  and  gets  to  identify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  world  problems  out  there  in  the  world,  harming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  in  real­world  ways.  And  that,  it  seems,  is  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  did  here. 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well,  let  me  answer  your

question  in  two  ways.  I  ­­ I  want  to  explain  why  ­­ why 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  isn't,  and  then  I  also  want  to  explain  why  it's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Congress  did  here. 

 

 

 

            

So  why  it  isn't:  There  are  places  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  looked  for  guides.  One  is  the  common  law, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  ­­ other  kinds  of  torts,  for  example. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

In  ­­ in  the  restatement  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  ­­ can  you  explain, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

then,  the  common  law  versus  the  legislature?  So  if  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  some  historic  practice  where  damages  are  awarded  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  who  has  no  out­of­pocket  loss,  if  the  common  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  so  it's  okay  but  if  Congress  says  so  it's  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  very  strange. 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  I  don't  think  so,  Your  Honor. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  ­­ well,  this  question  takes  me  a  little  afield 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  ­­ from  Justice  Kagan's  question.  But  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law  had  some  very  specific  areas  where  it  defined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  harm;  for  example,  any  intrusion  on  a  property 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  is  actual  harm,  but  there  has  to  be  a  property 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  for  that  to  be  so. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  Congress  could  create  a  property 

   

   

 

 

 

right.  And  if  it  did  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  You're 

  

  

 

 

saying  ­­ contrary  to  one  citation,  you're  actually  ­­

has  given  you? 

 

 

              

I  ­­

            

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Your  Honor,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  mean,  most  of  the 

    

 

 

 

 

common  law  rights,  like  property  rights,  are  ­­ are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  to  you  by  statute.  They're  not  given  to  you  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  common  law.  Most  people  are  coming  in  to  sue  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  of  a  statute. 

   

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  And  ­­ and  the  question  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  several  ways  that  they  can  establish  standing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One  is  to  have  the  tangible  harm,  to  meet  the  general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tangible  harm  test  that  this  Court  applies,  generally, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  standing  context.  And  that  can  be  economic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury,  it  can  be  other  kinds  of  injury.  And  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  applied  that  in  a  ­­ in  a  wide  variety  of  contexts. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Court  has  also  ­­ it  is  also  clear  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  property  rights  context,  when  Congress  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  create  ­­ or  the  common  law  doesn't  just  create 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  right  to  sue  but  confers  a  property  right,  the  right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  exclude,  generally,  as  the  Court  has  put  it,  that  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intrusion  on  that  property  right,  on  that  right  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclude,  is  tangible  harm. 

 

 

 

            

            

And  the  Court  has  made  clear  in  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  if  I  have  a  dozen  or 

   

   

  

 

 

 

more  cases  that  didn't  involve  property  rights,  where  we

didn't  require  economic  harm,  those  would  mean  nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  you? 

 

            

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Your  Honor,  I  ­­

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Those  legal  rights,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

just  decided  through  the  centuries,  all  those  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong? 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well,  I  don't  think  ­­ there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

certainly  aren't  any  cases  that  my  friends  cite  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  meet  that  test.  It's  not  just  economic  harm.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  be  psychic  harm.  There  are  other  ­­ it  can  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination.

MR.  PINCUS:  Okay.  I  ­­

    

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  said  it  could  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

psychic  harm,  there  could  be  economic  harm,  there  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  all  different  kinds  of  harm.  And  that  being  so,  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  what  she  said  right,  that  one  kind  of  harm  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  the  harm  suffered  when  somebody  tells  a  lie  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you,  or  gives  false  information? 

 

 

 

 

            

What's  different? 

 

            

            

MR.  PINCUS:  It  could  be. 

  

 

 

 

If  I  can  just  finish  my  answer  to  ­­ to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor,  because  I  just  want  to  make  clear, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  think  the  College  Savings  case  is  a  perfect

analogy  here,  that  every  cause  of  action  does  not  confer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  property  right.  The  Court  there  made  that  clear,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why  the  property  right  rationale  doesn't  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

Now,  turning  back  to  Justice  Kagan's 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  I  think  there  are  other  areas,  other  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defamation  where  there's  some  guidance  about  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutes  tangible  harm. 

 

 

            

For  example,  in  the  False  Light  cases,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restatement  has  a  comment  that  I  think  ­­ this  is  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  652E,  comment  (c)  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  on  point. 

 

 

            

It  says,  "Complete  and  perfect  accuracy  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

published  reports  concerning  any  individual  is  seldom 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attainable  by  any  reasonable  effort.  And  minor  errors, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  as  a  wrong  address  or  a  mistake  in  the  date  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment,  or  similar  unimportant  details,  would 

 

 

 

 

 

not"  ­­

these  are  not  unimportant  details.  This  is  a  ­­ they

wrong,  they  got  his  education  wrong.  They  basically

hypothetical,  though,  is  any  false  statement.  And  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  respond  why  a  ruling  by  ­­ a  rule  by  Congress 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  any  false  statement  wouldn't  qualify. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

us  ­­

 

            

So  there  is  some  legal  precedents  that  tells 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Here's  the  thing, 

  

 

 

 

Mr.  Pincus.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  ­­ the  one  thing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  have  to  say  Congress  is  better  at  than  we  are  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identifying  concrete  harms.  I  mean,  it's  perfectly 

    

 

 

 

 

fine,  and  I  agree  with  very  large  portions  of  your  brief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  say  they  have  to  have  identified  a  concrete 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm.  It's  like,  fine,  yes,  they  do. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  now  the  question  is,  did  they  identify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one?  And  it  seems  pretty  clear  what  they  wanted  to  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here;  that  this  statute  is  entirely  about  preventing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissemination  of  inaccurate  information  in  credit 

 

 

 

 

 

reports  which  they  seem  to  think  is  both  something  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harms  the  individual  personally  and  also  harms  larger 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

systemic  issues.  And  then  they  gave  the  cause  of  action 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  people  it  harmed  personally. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  guess  ­­ I  mean,  don't  we  owe  them  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  bit  of  respect  that  they've  actually  identified  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real­world  harm  that  it  ­­ that's  out  there? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well,  I  think  there's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

threshold  assumption  in  your  question  that  Congress

actually  identified  that  as  a  real­world  harm.  And  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  there  are  two  problems  with  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  the  structure  of  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicates  that  that's  not  so.  The  willfulness  cause  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  that  provides  for  statutory  damages  applies  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  violation  of  the  statute  that's  willful,  including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  that  don't  involve  false  statements. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  by  enacting  ­­ if  the  argument  is  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacting  the  willfulness  cause  of  action,  Congress  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inaccuracy  is  so  clearly  harmful  that  it  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actionable  in  any  case,  it  couldn't  ­­ it's  just  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible  to  look  at  the  ­­ the  way  the  statute  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructed  and  say  that  that  was  so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  how  much  more  do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  plaintiff  in  this  case  would  have  to  allege  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove  in  order  to  show  injury  in  fact? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  I  think  if  the  plaintiff  could 

    

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  ­­ that  there  was  some  ­­ some  consequence  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him,  some  ­­ from  the  false  information:  Something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  to  his  credit.  Something  happened  to  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment  ­­

that's  so.  I  mean,  I  think  defamation  claims  are 

    

   

 

 

 

 

exactly  the  same  situation.  People  don't  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily.  If  ­­ if  the  ­­ if  the  statement  is  not

Does  a  credit  agency  have  less  latitude  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  defending  on  the  ground  of  no  concrete  injury  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  entities? 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well,  I  think  there's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

threshold  question,  Your  Honor,  of  whether  Congress  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  determination  that  there  should  be  a  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

treatment  for  ­­ for  credit  agencies.  And  I  think  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  that  I  gave  about  how  the  willfulness  claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came  into  the  statute,  it's  hard  to  say. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But  I  think  also  ­­

   

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  does  the  statute  apply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just  to  crediting?  That's  what  ­­ that's  what  I  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking. 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  It  does.  Although,  one  of  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

real­world  litigation  problems  with  this  statute  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lots  of  the  claims  are  asserted  against  entities  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  they're  not  credit  agencies.  And  that  sort  of,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  real­world  of  litigation,  falls  out,  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  often  gets  decided  before  the  class  gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certified.

Justice  Kennedy's  question,  I  think  what  Congress  did

requirements  that  are  imposed  on  credit  reporting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies.  And  all  of  those  regulatory  requirements 

  

 

 

 

 

 

together  were  supposed  to  produce  accuracy. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  ­­ I  think  there  can't  be  a  ­­ it's  not

the  injury  here  because  this  is  the  quintessential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

            

He's  saying  they  don't  have  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures  to  check  their  accuracy.  We  know  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  section  of  the  statute  that  that's  what  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted,  reasonable  procedures.  He's  going  to  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove  that. 

 

            

 

Number  two,  he  says,  the  information  about 

 

 

 

 

 

me  is  false.  I'm  going  to  assume,  for  purposes  of  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  because  we  have  to,  that  ­­ and  so  does  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  below  with  respect  to  standing  ­­ that  much  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  information  is  inaccurate. 

 

 

 

              

I  will  tell  you  that  I  know  plenty  of  single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  look  at  whether  someone  who's  proposed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

date  is  married  or  not.  So  if  you're  not  married  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  report  out  there  saying  you  are,  that's  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential  injury. 

 

            

Now,  I  know  the  court  below  said  it  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

speculative,  but  that's  what  Congress  was  worried  about: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  creditworthiness,  and  ­­ and  your  stature  as  a

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  I  guess  my  question 

   

  

 

 

 

is,  we've  now  taken  a  word,  "concreteness,"  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  in  recent  years  has  applied  to  injuries  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens  and  when  they  can  bring  actions  or  not.  A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generalized  grievance,  we  said,  of  a  taxpayer  is  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

concrete  enough. 

 

            

We've  taken  this  doctrine,  and  you're  trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  superimpose  the  word  "concrete"  into  legally­created 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights.  But  for  ­­ for  two  decades  ­­ on,  I  mean,  two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

centuries,  we've  always  said  in  our  case  law  that  injury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact  is  the  breach  of  a  legally­recognized  right. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Where  do  we  have  a  right?  I  think  that's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan's  question. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's  a  requirement. 

   

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  don't  you  answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor's  question  first? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Respectfully,  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

that  the  cases  say  that.  We  discuss  them  in  detail  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  ­­ in  our  blue  brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  what  the  Court  said  in  Warth  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Linda  R.S.  was  about  what  the  Court  said  in  Lujan,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  de  facto  injuries,  as  to  which  there's  no  cause  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action,  can  be  made  actionable  when  Congress  creates  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  of  action.  That's  quite  different  from  saying

that  something  that  doesn't  qualify  under  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury­in­fact  standard  as  tangible  harm  can  be  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actionable,  which  is  what  the  Ninth  Circuit  decided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

            

And  I  also  ­­ I  want  to  also  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  I  agree  with  you 

   

  

 

 

 

entirely  on  that. 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Okay.  Can  I  just  ­­

   

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Go  ahead. 

  

 

 

MR.  PINCUS:  I  ­­ I  just  want  to  also  sort 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  distinguish  ­­ in  responding  to  your  question,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  there  are  two  questions.  One  ­­ one  question  is: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is  a  false  statement  ­­ does  a  false  statement  by  itself 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

inflict  tangible  harm  within  the  meaning  of  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally­applicable  injury­in­fact  standard?  If  it 

  

 

 

 

does,  it  does.  The  Court  has  never  said  that,  and  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argue  that  it  doesn't. 

 

 

 

            

The  second  question  is:  Can  Congress  expand 

  

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  where  the  Court  has  gone  in  defining  things  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  qualify  a  sufficient  injury  to  trigger 

   

 

 

 

 

Article  III  jurisdiction? 

 

 

            

And  we  think  there  are  two  questions  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One  is:  Has  Congress,  in  fact,  done  that?  And  there's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  question  whether  Congress  has  done  that  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  Justice  Kennedy,  in  his

concurrence  in  Lujan,  said  if  Congress  is  going  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  it  should  say  clearly  because  that  obviously  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  in  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Federal  courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  so  Congress  might  be  taken  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Congress  does  it  by  doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it,  you  know?  Congress  doesn't  announce  exactly  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well,  I'm  not  sure  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ here  we  are,  we're  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  beyond  the  common  law.  It  just  does  it.  And  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  does  it  ­­ and  it  did  it  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  said,  you  know,  what  are  we  concerned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about?  We're  concerned  about  following  the  kinds  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures  that  will  make  sure  that  there  are  accurate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit  reports.  And  then  Congress  told  you  exactly  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  purposes  section  of  the  statute.  And  my  gosh, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  all  over  the  legislative  history. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  most  serious  problem  in  the  credit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reporting  industry,  Congress  says,  is  the  problem  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inaccurate  and  misleading  information. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  ­­ and  so  Congress  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  done  that  here. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  guess  I  ­­ if  you  want  to  just  explain 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me  why  it  is  that  Congress  can't  do  ­­ I  think  we've

law,  and  certainly  can  go  beyond  anything  that  we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ever  said  is  a  concrete  harm  as  long  as  they've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  a  concrete  harm. 

   

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well,  a  couple  of  responses  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that.  If  it's  a  concrete  harm  in  the  first  place,  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  then  they  haven't  really  gone  beyond  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  test. 

 

              

I  ­­ I  think  ­­ Let  me  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Of  course,  harms  can  arise 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  world,  and  can  be  identified  in  the  world  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  they  haven't  arisen  before,  or  been  identified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before. 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  But  the  ­­ but  the  Court's  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  question  ­­ and  I  take  the  burden  of  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend's  argument  to  be  that  Congress  can  define  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  sufficient  to  satisfy  standing,  even  if  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't,  if  they  just  were  asserted  at  a  court, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied  the  tangible  harm  requirement. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  ­­ I  guess,  to  respond  to  your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

question  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  you're  saying  that,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

agree  with  you. 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Okay.  Well,  then  ­­ well,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  then  the  district  court  here  held  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tangible  harm  requirement  wasn't  satisfied.

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Mr.  Pincus,  I  would  have 

   

  

 

 

 

thought  that  your  answer  to  Justice  Kagan  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  Congress  did  not  identify,  as  the  harm  for  which  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  suit  to  be  brought,  misinformation.  It  did  not. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  identified  as  the  harm  the  failure  to  follow  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  procedures  that  it  imposed  upon  credit  reporting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies. 

            

It  said  nothing  about  people  who  ­­ who  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  hurt  by  misinformation  being  able  to  sue.  It  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody  can  sue  who's  been  reported  on  if  the  agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failed  to  use  the  procedures. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  fact,  Congress  has  not  identified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misinformation  as  a  suable  harm.  That's  not  what  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute  does. 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  And  I  apologize  if  I  haven't 

   

   

  

 

 

been  clear.  That  is  exactly  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Isn't  that  your  answer?

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  ­­ that  Congress  here  created  a

many,  many  ­­

We  are  not  ­­ it's  a  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

industry­friendly  act  that  Congress  did.  It  said  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  going  to  punish  any  old  inaccuracy.  We're  giving 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  a  safe  harbor.  If  ­­ as  long  as  you  followed  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  set  of  procedures,  don't  worry  about  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  did  that  procedural  requirement  ­­ this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ this  is  exactly  what  Lujan  says,  "It's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  requirement,  the  disregard  of  which  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impair  a  concrete  interest  of  the  plaintiff." 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  distinguished  that  from  procedural 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  in  vacuo. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  that's  what  this  is. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

It's  a  procedural  requirement,  the  disregard  of  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

can  impair  your  interest  in  being  represented  accurately

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No. 

  

 

MR.  PINCUS:  If  I  may,  Your  Honor. 

   

  

 

 

 

Most  of  the  statutory  and  regulatory 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

requirements  have  nothing  to  do  with  falsity.  They  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  with  not  following  rules.  There's  nothing  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  of  action  that  says  you  can  only  sue  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willfulness  if  you  ­­ if  the  statement  is  false.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  any  willful  violation  of  this  entire  regulatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

            

So  the  idea  that  Congress  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  "Any  person  who 

  

 

 

 

willfully  fails  to  comply  with  any  requirement  imposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  this  subjecter  with  respect  to  any  consumer  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable  to  that  consumer." 

 

 

 

            

So  it's  not  the  whole  world;  it's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumer  that  you  dealt  with  ­­

MR.  PINCUS:  But,  Your  Honor,  if  the

identify  as  a  harm  false  statements,  there's  nothing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  requires  proof  of  a  false  or  inaccurate  statement

inaccuracy.  Well,  that  person  does  not  have  standing.

I  think,  first  of  all,  to  respond  to  one  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan's  earlier  questions,  I  don't  think  it's

think  the  most  likely  interpretation  of  this  provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  it  was  enacted  against  the  background  of  this

And  it  ­­ what  Congress  was  most  likely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  was,  we  know  that  quantifying,  monetizing  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tangible  harm  in  this  context  is  hard.  So  if  there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willful  violation,  we're  going  to  give  you  a  minimum 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

recovery. 

              

I  think  the  reason  why  it  makes  sense  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  Congress  to  speak  clearly,  if  it  is  going  beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  this  Court  has  required  for  tangible  harm,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely  because  it  is  necessary  to  identify  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  actually  intends  to  give  access  to  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  beyond  that  which  would  be  true  under  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  otherwise  applicable  jurisdiction  ­­ rule.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  didn't  do  that  here  because  of  the  willfulness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

layered  on  top  of  all  of  the  statutory  violations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  also,  the  fair  way  of  looking  at

this  statute  is  as  a  complex  of  regulations  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  thought,  taken  together,  would  improve 

 

 

 

 

 

accuracy. 

              

I  don't  think  you  can  say  that  any  single 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  them  ­­ the  violation  of  any  single  one  of  them, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  thought,  was  going  to  so  likely  to  inflict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  on  some  person  that  they  should  be  entitled  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Do  all  of  them  go  to

MR.  PINCUS:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ do  some  of  them  go  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privacy  and  other  matters? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Most  of  ­­ one  is  about  having 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  800  number  available.  One  has  to  do  with  notice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  people  who  look  at  information  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  that  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

violation,  right,  if  ­­ if  you  didn't  provide  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Under  ­­ under  ­­

whose  information  is  not  accurate  can  sue  to  get  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  damages  for  failure  to  provide  an  800  number. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well,  I  think  Respondents  would 

   

  

 

 

 

say  even  if  the  information  was  accurate,  you  could  sue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  the  statutory  damages.  I  think  Justice  Kagan

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Counsel,  I  ­­ when 

   

  

 

 

 

we  normally  have  a  standing  inquiry,  you  ­­ there  can  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  people  who  have  standing  under  a  particular  statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  some  who  don't. 

 

 

 

            

Is  ­­ is  your  position  simply  that  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  look  at  whether  the  plaintiffs  have  been  injured  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  and  that  some  plaintiffs  will  be  able  to  proceed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  can  make  that  showing  and  others  may  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Absolutely,  Mr.  Chief  Justice; 

  

 

 

 

 

that's  our  position.  That's  ­­ and  the  district  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held  in  this  case,  looking  at  the  allegations  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint,  that  the  Court's  injury­in­fact  standard 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  satisfied  by  the  Ninth  Circuit  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  was  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  By  the  particular 

  

 

 

 

violation?  Injured  in  fact  by  the  particular  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Not  by  failure  to  have  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

800  number,  you're  saying? 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No.  But  would  this  man  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

able?  I  mean,  this  is  very  much  in  line  with  the  Chief 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice's. 

            

Would  he  be  able  to  sue  based  on  the  fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  was  inaccurate  information  about  him?

arguments  about  why  there  was  any  tangible  harm  to  him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  speculative  and  flunked  this  Court's  standard.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  ­­ I  guess  what  I  ­­

    

   

   

 

 

 

that's  okay. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Before  you  sit  down, 

  

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  brief  suggests  that  the  real  danger  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowing  this  kind  of  action  is  that  it  ­­ it  will  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  on  behalf  of  a  class,  and  you  could  get  millions 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  plaintiffs  and  billions  of  dollars. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  we  should  hold  that  Congress  can  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumers  a  right  to  redress  for  false  credit  reporting, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  we  held  that,  would  you  have  grounds  to  oppose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification  of  a  class. 

   

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well,  I  think  the  problem  here, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  is  if  you  accept  the  broad  theory  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  and  the  government  espouse,  which  is  all  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  show  is  a  statutory  violation,  it's  a  pretty 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

clear  pathway  to  class  certification  because  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  common  issues.  And  that's  what  has  happened  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  after  case. 

 

 

            

Now,  if  falsity  has  to  be  proven,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  that  is  an  individualized  issue  that  might

I'd  like  to  reserve  the  balance  of  my  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  Counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Consovoy. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  WILLIAM  S.  CONSOVOY 

 

 

 

 

 

               

 

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Mr.  Robins  has  Article  III  standing  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  independent  reasons. 

 

 

            

First,  the  violation  of  the  statutory  rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act  constitutes  injury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact. 

 

            

Second,  even  if  not,  his  entitlement  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monetary  relief  as  a  consequence  of  that  violation  shows 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  has  the  personal  stake  that  Article  III  requires. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  third,  the  fact  that  his  claim  follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  common  law  of  defamation  conclusively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establishes  that  it  is  a  case  or  controversy  within  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  of  Article  III. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  ­­ your  ­­ your  number 

    

 

 

 

 

 

two  ­­ I  mean,  we  can  ­­ it  sounds  to  me  quite  circular. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  say  ­­ you  say  he  ­­ he  has  a  personal  stake  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  has  a  ­­ because  Congress  said  he  has  a  personal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

stake.

Is  ­­ do  I  understand  your  argument? 

   

 

 

 

 

MR.  CONSOVOY:  I  view  it  just  like  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

contract  case.  So  if  this  were  a  contract  instead  of  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  and  the  same  duties  and  liabilities  came  to  be, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  was  a  liquidated  damages  clause,  he  had  a  duty 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  violated;  he  had  an  entitlement  to  money. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  one  thing  the  Court  would  not  do  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  is  look  behind  the  entitlement  to  see  whether  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  was  harmed  in  some  other  way  than  other  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise  being  owed  the  money. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  All  Congress  has  to  do  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  for  damages,  right? 

 

 

 

            

than  that. 

 

            

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  No.  It  has  to  do  much  more 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  CONSOVOY:  It  has  to  still  create  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest,  a  discrete,  legal  interest  that's  personal  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

him;  that  only  ­­ that  is  not  a  generalized  grievance; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  not  undifferentiated  harm.  It  has  to  do  all  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  same  things. 

 

 

            

            

The  ­­ the  point  where  we  get  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  ­­ but  that  is  a  harm. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

It  is  a  harm.  And  you  said  it's  a  harm  because  he  ­­ he 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  get  the  money  that  he  was  provided.  But  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circular.

violation  of  a  legally­vested  interest  at  common  law  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  decisions  throughout  has  always  been  deemed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  concrete  harm. 

 

 

            

 

 

Going  back  to  Tennessee  Electric  where  the 

 

 

 

 

Court  narrowly  used  to  say  that  a  legal  right  was  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury.  Then,  in  Camp,  the  Court  expanded  beyond  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  say  no,  practical  injuries  too  can  be  legal  injuries. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  it  never  negated  the  earlier,  more  difficult  test. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  about  a  law 

   

  

 

 

 

that  says  you  get  a  ­­ $10,000  statutory  damages  if  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company  publishes  inaccurate  information  about  you? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  want  ­­ you  have  an  unlisted  phone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number.  You  don't  want  people  calling  you.  The  company 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

publishes  your  phone  number,  but  it's  wrong.  That  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inaccurate  information  about  you,  but  you  have  no  injury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever. 

            

Can  that  person  bring  an  action  for  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  damage? 

 

            

do  there.

interest  of  you  receiving  a  phone  call,  and  that's  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury,  and  you  don't  receive  the  phone  call,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  suffered  the  injury  Congress  identified.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  no,  no,  no.  I'm

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  injury  they 

  

 

 

 

 

identify  is  we  don't  think  companies  should  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

false  ­­ publish  false  information  about  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  it  the  end  of  the  standing  inquiry  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  published  false  information  about  me,  or  do  you

injury  in  law.  A  legally­vested  interest,  whether  it's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

created  by  Congress  or  created  by  the  common  law,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  a  concrete  injury.

always  said  actual  injury  in  fact.  And  I  thought  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant  that  that  was  different  than  actual  injury  in  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You're  saying  when  we  say  injury  in  fact,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  mean  injury  in  fact  or  injury  in  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  No.  I  ­­ I  don't  really 

    

   

  

 

 

think  there  is  a  term  "injury  in  law."  I  ­­ I've  not 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seen  it  in  the  cases. 

 

 

 

 

            

What  I  do  see,  going  back  to  Camp,  which  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  case  that  uses  the  phrase  "injury  in  fact," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  concept  was  designed  to  get  at  two  really  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things: 

            

One,  that  the  harm  is  not  speculative.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  to  play  word  games,  but  I  think  it  means  that  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are,  in  fact,  injured,  as  opposed  to  that  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  been  injured. 

 

 

            

grievance. 

And  the  second,  that  it's  not  a  generalized

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  but  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That's  a  very 

   

  

 

 

different  question.  I  understand  generalized  grievance. 

    

 

 

 

You  can't  just  say  ­­ even  I  think  you  gather  ­­ any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen  in  the  United  States  can  sue  about  this.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  particularize  it  to  some  extent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  that's  a  different  question  as  to 

   

 

 

 

 

whether  there's  actual  injury. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  So  I  think  the  ­­ the  Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

uses  the  phrase  "concrete  and  particularized."  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

two  companion  words,  I  think,  getting  at  these  same 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

concepts. 

            

Now,  two  things  have  to  happen:  One,  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  it's  a  differentiated  claim,  that  it's  not  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generalized  grievance,  you  have  to  identify  a  subclass 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  people  who  are  distinctly  harmed  other  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  population.  That's  the  concrete  part.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

what  Schlesinger  says. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  I  would  think  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

the  particularized  part. 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  The  particularized  part  is 

  

 

 

 

 

that  you're  among  those  people.  You  need  both  things. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  how  in  the

nothing  to  do  with  particularized.  It  means  it  is  ­­ it

existing  in  fact,  having  effect,  even  though  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formally  or  legally  recognized. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  So  ­­ yes.  And  then  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

concurring  opinion  explained  that  it  didn't  ­­ your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurring  opinion,  Your  Honor,  said  that  it  ­­ Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  also  play  a  role  in  that  in  identifying  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injuries.  And  here  it  did. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes,  but  this  is  my  own 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

view  of  this,  maybe  no  one  else's.  But  you  sound  as  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  describing  a  forum  of  what  used  to  be  called  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"public  action,"  of  which  there  were  no  such  examples  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law.  Most  states  have  them.  And  because  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  people  who  aren't  hurt  in  fact  to  be  able  to  sue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  example  here  is  not  just  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice's,  which  is  one,  but  the  more  immediate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  which  seems  to  be  in  this  case  ­­ I  didn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  was  but  it  now  seems  to  be  ­­ are  people  ­­

procedures  leading  to  false  information.  And  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  were  not  injured  bring  a  lawsuit,  and  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  they're  following  bad  information.  That's  it.  Bad 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

procedure.  And  Congress  gave  me  a  hundred  dollars,  so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

give  it  to  me. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that's  the  person  I  didn't  know  was  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  because  this  plaintiff  seems  to  argue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  discrepancies  in  fact  that,  in  all  likelihood, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hurt  him.  Okay?  But  we're  leaving  him  out  of  it. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  want  to  know  what  the  government 

   

 

 

 

 

 

thinks  of  the  case  I've  just  put. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Do  ­­ does  the  government  think  a  person  who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

admits  nobody  said  anything  wrong  about  me,  they  did  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  about  me,  it  was  all  correct,  but  they  are

no? 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  I'll  be  responding  to  you: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

He  does  not. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Fine.  If  you  say  he  does 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

not,  then  we  are  limiting  this  case  to  the  case  of

that  quintessential  speculative  harm? 

 

 

 

            

In  my  understanding  ­­ you  ­­ correct  me  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  wrong  ­­ you  don't  have  files  someplace  for  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  in  the  United  States  or  ­­ you  have  databases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  will  do  a  search  if  somebody  asks  you  to  do  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search. 

              

I  assume  you  wouldn't  say  that  somebody  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  whom  there  never  had  been  a  search  would  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing,  right?  Even  if  ­­ you  know,  even  if  it  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  the  case  that  if  there  was  a  search  it  would  come  up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  a  lot  of  false  information. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  So  for  it  to  be  a  consumer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

report,  there  must  be  communication  to  a  third  party. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  we  have  alleged  communication  to  third  parties.  At 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  pleadings  stage,  that  must  be  accepted  as  true  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  point. 

 

            

But  Spokeo,  I  believe,  on  their  website, 

   

 

 

 

 

does  not  share  that  information  who  searched  for  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  this  ­­ this  is  really  important.  It  is  almost 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible  to  know. 

 

 

            

If  he  applied  for  a  job  with  a  major

bidder  for  the  toilet  seat,  and  he  sues  under  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  And  he  said,  oh,  yes,  the  statute  didn't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  just  say  the  disappointed  bidders  can  sue,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  anybody  who's  proximally  affected  can  sue.  It  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  everybody  can  sue.  But  I,  in  fact,  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximally  injured,  and  therefore,  I  ought  to  be  able  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue. 

            

            

Do  you  think  that  would  be  true? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Likely  not.  Likely  not,  and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

here's  why  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  why  is  this  case  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different?  You're  ­­ you're  saying  only  people  who  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  injured,  assuming  that  ­­ that  false  information  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  ­­ only  they  can  sue.  But  the  statute  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  only  they  can  sue.  It  says  that  everybody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  whom  Spokeo  did  ­­ did  a  report  can  sue. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  So  it  says  ­­ this  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  things  that  the  hypothetical  statute  does  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  statute  says,  starting  with  the  cause  of  action,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  done  something  that  violates  a  statute  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  a  specific  consumer,  that  consumer  can  sue

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Right. 

  

 

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Then  second  ­­ then  you  look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you. 

            

            

in  the  provision  that  we  are  basing  the  claim  on  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reasonable  procedures  provision. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

So  that  provision  in  particular,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

the  only  one  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  fine. 

  

 

 

MR.  CONSOVOY:  ­­ before  the  Court  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Where  do  you  get  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessity  of  injury  in  fact? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  So  why  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Where  do  you  get  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

necessity  that  there  has  been  false  information  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  assert  is  there? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  So  it  says,  "reasonable 

  

 

 

 

 

procedures  to  ensure  maximum  possible  accuracy.  " 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Procedures  to  ensure 

  

 

 

 

maximum.  That  doesn't  mean  there  has  to  be  accuracy. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  No.  Congress  actually  did 

  

  

 

 

 

something  better  for  the  industry.  They  gave  them  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitation  on  liability.  So  Congress  thought  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

giving  strict  liability  here. 

 

 

 

            

And  keep  in  mind,  Justice  Scalia,  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted  almost  all  State  law  claims  here.  They

preempted  State  law  defamation.  So  the  notion  that  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  about  defamation  when  they  preempted  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defamation  strikes  me  as  a  very  different  argument. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  you're  only  in  Federal  court,  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  said  we  could  impose  strict  liability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  have  to  say,  don't  you, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  answer  to  Justice  Scalia,  that  the  words,  "follow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  procedures  to  assure  maximum  possible 

 

 

 

 

 

accuracy  in  respect  to  any  consumer,"  the  one  who  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue,  means  that  the  ­­ when  you  fail  to  do  it  in  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  consumer,  you  say  something  false  about  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumer.  It  doesn't  use  those  words,  and  we  would  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  so  construe  it  in  order  to  save  the  constitutionality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  statute. 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  And  every  lower  court  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reach  this  question  has  held  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  that  wouldn't  be  true. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

You  could  fail  to  ­­ to  follow  the  procedures  and  still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  up  with  accurate  information,  like  you  could  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  an  800  number. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Correct,  and  that  person 

  

 

 

 

 

would  not  have  standing. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It's  impossible  to  read  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  way  because  it's  simply  not  true. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  So,  Justice  Scalia  ­­

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  ­­ every  lower  court  to  reach 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  question  has  held  that  this  particular  provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  falsity  as  an  allegation.  Multiple  Courts  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appeals. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  I  want  to  ­­ as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  understand  ­­ I  take  the  falsity  out  of  the  ­­ the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypotheticals  to  get  exactly  what  your  position  is  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  breadth  of  Congress'  power. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  let's  say  the  statute  says  anybody  who's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

publishing  information  about  you  has  to  pay  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  $10  a  year.  They  think  that's  a  good  way  to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

regulate  it.  It's  information  about  you,  good,  bad,  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indifferent,  pay  them  $10  a  year,  no  more,  no  less. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Spokeo,  or  whatever  that  business  is,  pays  you  $20  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year. 

            

Now  you've  been  ­­ the  statute  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated  with  respect  to  you,  a  particular  individual. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Can  that  ­­ and  there's  statutory  damages  of  $10,000. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Can  that  individual  sue? 

 

 

 

MR.  CONSOVOY:  So  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Now,  does  that 

  

 

 

 

 

individual  have  injury  in  fact  because  the  statute  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  violated  with  respect  to  him? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  That,  I  think  no,  because

that  statute  would  apply  to  everybody  in  the  country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  would  be  no  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Oh,  no,  no,  no.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  have  published  information  about  an  individual. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Every  individual  who  you  publish  information  about  gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10  a  year. 

   

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Right.  So  I  think  that  would 

   

  

  

 

 

 

make  it  particularized  but  not  concrete. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  there'd  be  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

standing  ­­ that  person  would  have  no  standing,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  Congress  gave  him  standing? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Congress  can  confer 

  

 

 

 

substantive  rights  that  lead  to  standing. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yes. 

  

 

 

MR.  CONSOVOY:  But  not  everything  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

does  will  convey  a  substantive  right  that  differentiates 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you  from  the  general  population. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  if  the  statute  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CONSOVOY:  This  one  does. 

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ says  $10,  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

more,  no  less,  he  gets  $20,  does  he  have  standing  to  sue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  that  statute? 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  I  don't  think  so,  because  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

would  apply  so  broadly  to  everybody  ­­

don't  have  to  pay  you  anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Right.  And  my  ­­ my  answer 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  that  would  make  it  particularized  but  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concrete. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't  there  always  a 

  

 

 

 

 

materiality  question? 

 

            

In  every  violation  there's  always  a 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality  question:  What  is  the  falsehood?  Is  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

material  to  anything?  It  could  be  a  transposition  of  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

telephone  number. 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  That's  right.  There  is  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

de  minimis  aspect  to  the  statute  as  well.  But  even  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  that  is  right,  and  even  innocuous  things  can  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Consovoy,  can  I  just 

   

  

 

 

 

make  sure  I  understand? 

   

 

            

You  said  you  ­­ you  need  for  the  information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  inaccurate  to  have  standing  here.  That  is  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  mean  that  the  class,  as  you've  defined  it,  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  certified.  And  I  think  that  that's  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  answer,  but  I  just  want  to  make  sure  that  we're  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ we're  on  the  same  page  here.

this  is  going  to  come  up  later  this  term  in  the  Tyson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  But  the  class  has  to  be  defined  as  broadly  as  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  because  of  what's  called  a  failsafe  problem. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  can't  identify  a  class  by  an  element  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  cause  of  action,  and  that's  because  it  harms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants'  rights.  So  if  we  had  alleged  the  class  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  everybody  who  had  inaccurate  information,  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  trick  against  them,  because  if  they  defeated  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim,  the  class  would  be  empty,  and  they  would  get  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

res  judicata. 

 

            

So  at  certification,  we're  going  to  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrow  the  class,  and  we're  going  to  have  to  come  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  common  proof  because  we  can't  identify  the  class  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  allegation. 

 

            

So  what  happens  is,  take  the  algorithm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue.  So  we  will  have  to  allege  under  (b)(3), 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23(b)(3),  that  a  common  algorithm  led  to  all  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

inaccuracies.  But  if  they  do,  that  is  a  certifiable 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

class. 

            

            

And  just  ­­

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  one  very  quick  thing. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

You  said  in  your  brief  you're  really  only  suing  under

that  you're  waiving  all  claims  of  other  things? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  No.  I  think  ­­ and  let  me 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

explain.  We  read  the  statute  this  way:  There's  A 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  procedures  requirement.  That  is  a  general 

   

  

 

 

 

framework.  Some  of  that  is  discussed  in  the  regulatory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commentary,  explains  what  that  is.  But  the  specific 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  mentioned  in  Count  I,  Count  II,  and  Count  III, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  furnisher  notices,  the  user  notices,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

toll­free  number  are  specific  examples  of  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures  they  failed  to  follow. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

They  support  ­­

MR.  CONSOVOY:  ­­ the  general  claim.

the  statutory  damages  for  the  four  claims  that  you

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  are  you  asking  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

four  times  the  statutory  damages,  or  are  you  saying,  no,

And  ­­

 

            

            

            

this  case  can  be  resolved  on  a  much  narrower  issue. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  has  always  held  that  if  the  cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  action  you  allege  can  be  found  in  the  common  law,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  developed  from  the  common  law  as  in  Stevens,  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  standing.  This  claim  for  false  information  follows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  from  the  common  law  defamation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  Ninth  Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

didn't  address  that  question,  did  it?  I  mean,  as  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  it,  I'm  looking  at  the  footnote,  you  know,  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  9A,  it  says  it  doesn't  matter  because  you  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  injury  in  law  is  enough. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Right.  No.  Well,  but  the 

  

  

  

 

 

 

statute  follows  from  defamation.  Just  as  in  Stevens,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  about  the  statute,  it  wasn't  about  the  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual.  They  said  the  qui  tam  statute  followed  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  common  law  there,  just  like  this  statute  follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  common  law  defamation. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  remember  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Excuse  me.  How  does  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

follow  from  the  common  law  of  defamation?  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ you  could  not  bring  a  defamation  action  because

said  injury  in  fact  is,  quote,  "an  invasion  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legally­protected  interest  which  is,  A,  concrete  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularized,  and,  B,  actual  or  imminent,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conjectural  or  hypothetical." 

 

 

            

 

 

 

And  so  the  injury  part  of  it  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

invasion  of  a  legally­protected  injury  ­­ interest.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

I  think  it's  clear  what  work  the  words  "in  fact"  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  in  that  description.

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  ­­ what  happened  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"concrete  and  particularized"? 

 

 

            

            

MR.  STEWART:  Well,  particularized  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  We  ­­ we  say  that  in  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in,  gee,  a  whole  lot  of  cases.  And  ­­ and  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  appear  in  that  quote  you  gave? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  STEWART:  It  did.  It's  ­­

MR.  STEWART:  ­­ "actual  or  eminent"  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

well,  "concrete  and  particularized"  and  "actual  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imminent,  not  conjectural  or  hypothetical." 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  Court  has  explained  both  the  terms

plaintiff,  not  that  it  be  done  to  the  community  as  a

And  the  Court  used  the  terms  that  way  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Schlesinger.  I  don't  ­­

    

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Mr.  Stewart,  let's 

  

 

 

 

 

say  your  ­­ your  ­­ Congress  thinks  that  the  president 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  doing  enough  to  stop  illegal  immigration.  So  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passes  a  law  that  says,  anyone  in  a  border  state  ­­ so 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  particularized  ­­ who  is  unemployed  may  bring  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  against  an  illegal  immigrant  who  has  a  job.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  get  damages,  maybe  they  get  an  injunction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Can  Congress  do  that? 

 

 

 

MR.  STEWART:  Well,  I  think  there  would  be  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

couple  of  different  problems  with  that.  The  first  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  that  there  may  be  some  ­­ there  may  be  some  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues  that  Congress  can't  simply  delegate  to  private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  that  are  ­­ like  the  ­­ the  criminal  law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  instance.  There  would  be  constitutional  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

potential  constitutional  ­­

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  think  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

kind  of  avoiding  the  hypothetical.  I  mean,  let's  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  presumably  you

amicus  defending  the  action. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  I  mean,  I  think  that  would  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

typically  when  Congress  has  done  this,  and  in  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law  analogues  that  we've  cited,  the  ­­ the  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  people  who  could  file  suit  would  be  people  whom  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibited  conduct  had  a  natural  tendency  to  harm. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yes,  we're  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

about  Congress  says,  Well,  these  people  who  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unemployed,  illegal  immigrants  have  jobs,  they  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  sue  to  stop  that  because  the  ­­ you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  ­­ Congress  thinks  the  president  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  enough. 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  I  mean,  I  think  it  would  be  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  that  would  stretch  the  limits  of  Congress's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  to  ­­ to  treat  those  ­­ that  broad  class  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals  as  victims  of  all  acts  of  illegal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration.  And  obviously  the  statute  in  ­­ that  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing  with  here  doesn't  come  anywhere  close  to  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  I  understand  the  Court's  concerns 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  implications  of  our  position,  but  I  think  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  worth  pointing  out,  this  is  a  mode  of  enforcement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  has  been  using  since  1790.

MR.  STEWART:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Which  is  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

can  say,  basically,  to  a  group  of  citizens,  you  get  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce  one  of  our  laws  because  we're  giving  you  a  cause 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  action.  It  doesn't  matter  whether  you've  actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  injured  or  not;  we  just  have  to  particularize  it  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  extent. 

 

            

And  I  would  have  thought  that  the  ­­ the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

president  would  be  concerned  about  Congress  being  able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  create  its  own  enforcement  mechanism.  I  thought  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  would  be  concerned  that  that  would  interfere  with

hypotheticals,  but  you  could  do  the  same  thing  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rational­basis  review  of  substantive  legislation.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

could  come  up  with  endless  hypotheticals  about  statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  just  at  the  border  between  really  stupid  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  stupid  as  to  be  actually  irrational. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  How  ­­ how  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  is  that  this  is  dealing  with  the  requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  case  or  controversy  which  has  always  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  as  at  the  core  of  Article  III  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  we  have  a  legion  of  cases  that  say  you  have  to  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  injury. 

 

            

That's  what  makes  it  a  decision  appropriate 

   

 

 

 

 

for  resolution  by  the  judicial  branch.  And  it  seems  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  bit  more  important  than  saying  you  can  challenge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  statutes. 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Well,  the  point  is  ­­ I  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  make  was  that  Congress  has  been  doing  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  1790,  and  nobody's  pointed  to  a  statute  that  comes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close  to  the  hypotheticals. 

 

 

 

            

But  to  ­­ to  return  to  the  point  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  in  fact,  the  Court  has  said  there  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  injury.  But  it  has  defined  "injury"  as  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invasion  of  a  legal  ­­ legally­protected  interest,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  a  legal  right.

Dictionary  gives,  as  its  first  definition  of  "injury," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"the  violation  of  another's  legal  rights  for  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  provides  a  remedy." 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  ­­ we've  also  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  violation  of  a  procedure,  even  if  you  are  given  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  the  procedure,  that  alone  does  not  suffice  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing.  That  is  a  procedure  ­­ that  ­­ that  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  in  vacuo  that  leads  to  nothing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Well,  what  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  We  ­­ we  said  that,  so  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  be  something  more  than  just  the  violation  of  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ what  Congress  says  is  a  legal  right.  That  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  not  enough. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  And  at  ­­ the  Court  has  also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  Congress  can't  give  every  citizen  an  ­­ an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitlement  to  sue  simply  by  calling  it  a  legal  right. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  with  respect  to  procedures,  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  said  you  can  sue  to  complain  about  the  deprivation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  lawfully­required  procedures  if  those  procedures  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended  to  protect  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Right  ­­ right  here  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  complaint,  I  guess,  there  were  certain  errors:  A 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

photograph  of  the  wrong  person;  a  statement  that  he's  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  50s;  he  isn't.  That  he's  married;  he  isn't.  He's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employed  in  a  professional  or  technical  field;  he  isn't.

That  he  has  children;  he  doesn't.  That  he  has  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

graduate  degree;  he  doesn't.  That  his  economic  health 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  very  strong;  it  isn't.  And  his  wealth  level  is  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  top  10  percent;  it  isn't.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  that,  I  gather,  is  what  he  is  complaining 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about.  Something  like  that. 

  

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  STEWART:  Exactly. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Fine. 

  

 

Now,  for  purposes  of  deciding  this  case,  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  simply  to  refer  to  this  and  say,  this  is  a  case  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  person  who's  complaining  this?  And  is  this,  which  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  listed,  a  sufficiently­concrete  injury? 

   

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  STEWART:  Yes.  Absolutely.  And  I  ­­

   

  

  

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Was  it  ­­ then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  what  the  Ninth  Circuit  based  its  decision  on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Ninth  Circuit  says  he  had  standing  by  virtue  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged  violations  of  his  statutory  rights,  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  whether  there  was  harm  to  his  employment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  or  related  anxiety. 

 

 

 

            

So  I  would  suppose,  if  we're  going  to  decide 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  on  that  basis,  we  have  to  determine  that  the  Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's  rationale  was  in  ­­ was  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  I'm  sorry  I  don't  have  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

exact  wording  in  front  of  me,  but  if  you  look  at  the

very  first  sentence  of  the  Ninth  Circuit's  opinion,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth  Circuit  says,  "the  question  we  confront  is  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  person  has  injury  in  fact  when  false  information  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him  is  disseminated." 

 

 

            

Now,  the  ­­ the  Court  said  we  don't  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  what  is  added  to  the  complaint  by  the  allegations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  employment  prospects  were  actually  harmed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

And  it's  ­­ and  it's  also  true  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth  Circuit  didn't  analyze  the  question  that  it  framed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  quite  the  way  we  would  have. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  didn't  rely  on  the  defamation  analogy;  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relied  on  the  statutory  right.  But  it  still  described 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  before  it  as  whether  a  person  has  injury  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complain  about  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  ­­ and  Mr.  Stewart,  if  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  just  ­­ I  mean,  the  ­­ maybe  this  is  the  sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you're  talking  about. 

 

 

 

            

At  one  point  the  Court  says,  "the  interests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected  by  the  statutory  rights  at  issue  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently  concrete  and  particularized." 

 

 

 

            

Now,  look,  it's  not  a  good  opinion,  and  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  doesn't  tell  you  why  it  is  that  they're  sufficiently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concrete.  But  they  clearly  held  that  they  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently  concrete.  They  understood  that  as  part  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  test.

MR.  STEWART:  The  ­­ the  other  point  I  would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

make  ­­ I  ­­ I  agree  with  that. 

   

   

 

 

 

            

And  the  other  point  I  would  make  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Defenders  of  Wildlife  is  the  statute  at  issue  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  said  any  person  can  sue  to  complain  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  types  of  Endangered  Species  Act  violations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  Court  said,  that's  just  too  broad.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  do  that. 

 

 

            

But  it  didn't  say,  therefore,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  to  sue  is  a  nullity,  and  we  don't  have  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worry  about  whether  this  plaintiff  has  standing  to  sue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  analyzed  in  depth  the  allegations  and  the  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  particular  plaintiffs  in  Defenders  of  Wildlife 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  put  forward  and  said  this  is  insufficient. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  later,  in  Bennett  v.  Spear,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  applied  the  same  Endangered  Species  Act  provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  behest  of  a  plaintiff  who  did  have  standing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  it  isn't  the  case  that,  if  Congress  fails 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  draw  exactly  the  right  line,  people  who  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  within  the  right  line  are  out  of  luck.  I  think  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations  of  the  complaint  are  ­­ are  the  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  to  focus  on. 

 

 

 

            

With  ­­ with  respect  to  the  defamation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogy,  I'd  say  Congress,  in  one  sense,  is  broader  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law,  and  in  another  sense  it's  narrower.

MR.  PINCUS:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan  asked  the  question  earlier 

 

 

 

 

 

about  how  could  people  find  this? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  know,  our  legal  system  is  people  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  allegations  that  they're  harmed.  And  I'd  urge  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  to  look  at  the  public  justice  amicus  brief  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  side  of  the  case  for  a  whole  series  of  claims 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  ­­ that  people  filed  and  they  were  able  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations  of  actual  harm. 

 

 

 

            

The  argument  that  the  Ninth  Circuit  relied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  falsity  is  a  fiction.  The  first  sentence,  the

allegation  of  falsity.  There  is  not  a  word  in  its 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing  analysis  that  refers  at  all  to  falsity.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relied  on  statutory  violations,  period,  including  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations  that  say  nothing  about  falsity. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  are  we  ruling  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome  or  are  we  ruling  on  the  reasoning? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I  think, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

as  the  Court  comes  ­­ the  ­­ the  question  presented  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  the  Ninth  Circuit's  rule  that  a  mere  statutory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  unaccompanied  by  any  harm  is  sufficient  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy  Article  III? 

 

 

              

I  think  the  Court  has  to  address  that  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  next  issue  is:  Did  Congress  elevate  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  ­­ did  Congress  say  that  false  statements  inflict  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  kind  of  harm,  and  therefore,  we're  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single  them  out? 

 

 

            

And  I  think,  to  rely  on  Congress,  Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

actually  has  to  have  made  that  determination.  And  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  nothing  in  the  statute  that  says  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  Justice  Breyer  said,  you  have  to  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  falsity  into  the  statute  in  order  to  find  falsity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress  didn't  say  anything  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  harm  inflicted  by  false  statements.

MR.  PINCUS:  If  it  wanted  to  do  that,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  See,  I  look  at  this  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

should  ­­

 

            

slightly  differently.  I  think  the  breach  of  any  legal 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  you're  given  is  ­­ gives  Article  III  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  a  difference  between  that  and 

   

 

 

 

 

whether  you're  within  the  zone  of  interest  of  a  statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  what  you're  saying  ­­ I  ­­ I  guess  that's  why  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits  below  have  said  you  have  to  be  able  to  allege 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  falsity  in  the  credit  report  to  get  recovery  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  because  those  are  the  people  the  statute  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

targeted  to. 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Your  Honor,  that's  not  right. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The  ­­ all  of  the  decisions  that  my  friends  refer  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  decisions,  not  where  there  were  willfulness  claims, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  where  there  were  actual  damages  claims.  No  surprise 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  courts  have  said  to  prove  actual  damages  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  at  least  show  falsity. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  has  been  no  decision  interpreting  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  in  the  context  of  a  willfulness  claim  to  say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it  does. 

 

 

            

And  I  think  the  problem  with  the  position  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  side  is  they  want  to  say  Congress  made  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  that  anything  inaccurate  is  ­­ is  harmful,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  nothing  in  the  statute  to  say  that.  Congress

MR.  PINCUS:  ­­ the  class  of  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

inaccuracies  can't  possibly  be  a  class  of  people,  most 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  whom  are  going  to  suffer  one  harm. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  We  have  one  brief,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

brief  of  the  restitution  scholars  who  say  if  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  that  you  have  to  show  ­­ how  can  ­­ some  harm,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens  to  all  the  restitution  cases  where  you  measure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  relief  by  the  gain  to  the  defendant?  There  has  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  loss  to  the  plaintiff. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PINCUS:  Your  Honor,  restitution  is  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about  a  measure  of  damages.  And  all  those  cases  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

often  they're  breach  of  contract  cases  ­­ there's  harm.

the  right  to  exclude  the  property  interest  created  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  common  law.  And  this  statute  doesn't  create  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  interest,  so  it  can't  be  upheld  on  this  basis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon,  at  12:07  p.m.,  the 
 

 

 

 

 

case  in  the
 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
