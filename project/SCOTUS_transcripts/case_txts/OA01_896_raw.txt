(11:04 a.m.)


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-896, the Ford Motor Company and Citibank v.


John B. McCauley.


Mr. Waxman.  The Court would appreciate hearing


argument on, I'm sure, not just on the question presented


in the petition for certiorari, but on the question posed


in the supplemental briefing about whether there is


appellate jurisdiction where a nominally prevailing party


in the district court can -- can appeal, and also about


whether the question of -- under 1447(d), if this was an


order of remand, whether the -- the thing was appealable


to the Ninth Circuit at all. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Perhaps with that observation, I would -- it


would behoove me to address the quest -- the appellate


jurisdiction of this Court first, as much as I would like


to rush into why there clearly is subject matter


jurisdiction in this case, regardless of whether the


plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief are viewed as


separate and distinct or common and then divide it.

 So let me first address why I think the Ninth


Circuit and this Court had appellate jurisdiction, and it


is straightforward.  That is, there is an appeal in this


case from the dismissal with prejudice of a consolidated


complaint which was filed voluntarily by the plaintiffs in


this case seeking -- as against plaintiffs that are


different than any -- than the constituent State court


actions, including different plaintiffs seeking different


causes of action and seeking a different form of relief,


that is, specific performance of the Ford rebate program.


And it is very clear, both from the cont -- the


--the four corners of the consolidated complaint and from


an express representation that my friend, Mr. Berman, made


at the oral argument in the class certification stage,


that the consolidated complaint was filed for the purpose


of obtaining, in front of Judge Dwyer in the Northern Dis


-- the Western District of Washington, a judgment on the


merits in the case.  That is, it was different than the


treatment, the maximum treatment, that he would have been


permitted to provide under the multi-district litigation


panel's reference.  That is --


QUESTION:  What's sort of unusual, though, is


that you didn't suffer the dismissal.  I mean, yes, a


dismissal is -- is usually a final -- a final action, and


it's usually the person whose suit was dismissed who

appeals --


MR. WAXMAN:  That is --


QUESTION:  -- not -- not the person who


benefitted by the dismissal and that --


MR. WAXMAN:  Indeed, and that, Justice Scalia,


is the -- is the question I believe, the specific


question, that the Court directed the parties' attention


to in its request for supplemental briefs. 


Now, it is clear that a prevailing party


normally cannot appeal, but the operative word that this


Court has recognized, at least since the Electrical


Fittings case, is normally.  And this Court and the lower


courts have applied a rather particular test to determine


when normally doesn't apply, and that is, is the nominally


prevailing party sufficiently aggrieved by a decision in


its favor that it retains a, quote, stake in the appeal? 


And that's -- that test was articulated by this Court in


Guaranty Trust v. Roper --


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman. 


MR. WAXMAN:  -- and in Forney v. Apfel.


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, a defendant who removes a


case and then is remanded is surely aggrieved but,


nonetheless, cannot appeal.  And the problem I have with


an answer that you went by too fast for me is this case is


in -- was in the Washington district court for pretrial

purposes only under 1407.  The transfer from the several


district courts to which these cases were initially


removed -- that transfer under the statute was for


pretrial purposes only, not for trial.  And after the


pretrial, under the statute, the cases, unless all the


parties consent, would go back to the district courts from


whence they came. 


So I don't understand how the Western District


which is dealing with a complaint for pretrial purposes


only -- I mean, the -- the request that a complaint --


consolidated complaint be filed was for pretrial


processing.  How do you get from that an action that


displaces all of the other actions that had been removed


from the State court?


MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, the appealability


of the dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated


complaint does not depend on whether the consolidated


complaint, quote, did away with the other actions.  The


reason -- we would, of course, readily concede that under


1447(d), if all that had happened was a removal of the six


State court actions, a transfer for pretrial purposes to a


multi-district litigation court and a determination by


that court that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over


the complaints, there would be no appeal because the


remand of removed State court actions for lack of subject

matter jurisdiction, Congress has decided, is not a


determination that may be reviewed by Federal appellate


courts. 


But here -- and this, I think, is the salient


point.  Here, the judge did not require the plaintiffs'


lawyers in the six cases to file some sort of concordance


or a consolidating document that often is ordered so as to


facilitate pretrial proceedings.  What the judge said is


if anybody wants to file a consolidated complaint, they


may.


The consolidated complaint that was filed in


this case avowedly invoked this Court's 13 -- the Federal


court's 1332 jurisdiction and sought not just pretrial


consolidated proceedings on discovery and motions, they


wanted a full trial or a full resolution on the merits. 


In other words, it's -- it's as if the judge,


having had the six cases transferred, said expressly,


look, I'm going to deal with all of the pretrial matters


that are the subject of this transfer order, but if you


all like me --


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, may I stop you at that


point?  Because the pretrial consolidated -- the order --


this is -- I'm looking at the appendix, page 35.  It says,


by order of the multi-district panel, the cases have been


consolidated for pretrial purposes only.

 Now, you're saying that there is something --


something that I don't see in the written orders that says


they -- no, it's going to be now for trial purposes.


MR. WAXMAN:  No, no, no.  I'm -- I'm not


explaining myself correctly.  The -- the order doesn't say


these six removed cases are here for trial purposes, and


if it did, it would exceed the court's authority under


1407 and this Court's specific holding in Lexecon.


On page 41 of the joint appendix, the court


under a heading say -- entitled consolidated complaint


says, should plaintiffs in all or some of the consolidated


actions decide to file a consolidated complaint, you have


to do so within a certain period of time. 


Now, that raises the question, since they did it


voluntarily, whether what they were filing was something


that, in essence, sort to -- as I said, to be a


concordance, to consolidate in one document all of the


various parties and all the various claims and all various


theories so that a court can meaningful and --


meaningfully and efficiency -- efficiently manage the


pretrial proceedings. 


QUESTION:  But ordinarily you wouldn't go -- go


about it that way.  You'd have a memorandum, not a


consolidated complaint.


MR. WAXMAN:  That -- that's true, Mr. Chief

Justice, although there are instances where the court --


where the transferee court has ordered the filing of


something called a consolidated complaint. 


But here, there are two salient -- at least two


salient differences.  One is this complaint has different


parties.  It has different causes of action.  It seeks a


different type of relief.  And at the motion -- and -- and


it seeks quite clearly, based on the conduct of the


parties and the representations, this is, in essence,


saying thank you very much for having -- having us here


for consolidated proceedings on our underlying state court


actions, but we have decided we like you, Judge Dwyer, and


we want you to try a case, and we're going to file a brand


new Federal action that is docketed in the Western


District. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, things like that,


juris -- basic jurisdictional thing, agreeing -- this


would be a consent to have a court that has no authority


to adjudicate a case to adjudicate it.  Usually such a


major step is done not by inference, not by implication. 


This is saying, court, even though you have no authority


under the Federal statutes to proceed without our consent,


we are consenting, so go ahead.  We're waiving any


questions of venue or anything else. 


The fact that this is labeled consolidated

complaint is simply what the multi-district statute says. 


It says that the actions may be transferred for


consolidated pretrial proceedings.  So why couldn't this


consolidated complaint be simply for pretrial proceedings,


the only thing that the multi-district panel transferred


the case to Western District of Washington for? 


MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, it certainly


could have been, and if it were ordered by the court, that


is the most that it could have been. 


But in this case, that's not what it was.  There


are parties, claims, and requests for relief, and


particularly the -- what is really the object of the


litigation, the request for specific performance of the


Ford rebate program --


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, can I interrupt you with


a question?  It seems to me you're, in effect, arguing


that the Federal consolidated complaint was kind of a


brand new lawsuit, and we forget about everything else


that happened before. 


Now, if that were the case and you just had that


complaint filed against you and you filed a motion to


dismiss and you prevailed and they dismissed the


complaint, it clearly would not be appealable.  In order


for you to find reasons to appeal, you got to go back and


say, well, now we're going to have to face a lot of other

lawsuits. 


MR. WAXMAN:  That -- I think your premise -- the


premise of your question, Justice Stevens, with respect,


is incorrect, which is if we had asked for a dismissal on


subject matter jurisdiction grounds and prevailed -- that


is, we would have --


QUESTION:  No.  They asked for dismissal on


subject matter jurisdiction.  No.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 


You're right.  You're right. 


MR. WAXMAN:  If we had asked for it, then we


would have gotten all that we could possibly have


expected.  What we asked for -- what happened in this case


was they voluntarily filed it.  They asked for trial and


judgment on the merits.  The court sua sponte said, I


don't think I have subject matter jurisdiction, and we


have the right to appeal that because we are sufficiently


aggrieved that we have a stake in the case.  And the --


QUESTION:  Why did the district court say it had


no subject matter?  Because of the amount in controversy?


MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, because of the amount in


controversy.  It refused to apply -- it followed prior


Ninth Circuit precedent and refused to apply the


defendants' viewpoint in a class action seeking


injunctive --


QUESTION:  Or you have a brand new --

 QUESTION:  You would not have been aggrieved --


if -- if that was the only case pending and so -- and if


it was dismissed, how would you have been aggrieved?


MR. WAXMAN:  We would have been aggrieved in the


same way -- because what we sought was -- what we wanted


was litigation in a single forum, in a forum which had


already conducted substantial pretrial proceedings and a


Federal forum.  We sought judgment in our favor on the


merits.  What we -- which would have produced a dismissal


or a judgment with prejudice.  What we received, but did


not ask for, was a result that permits the -- either these


plaintiffs or anybody else in the country to continue this


litigation in State court.  And -- and their -- the lower


courts in the cases that we've cited are --


QUESTION:  Do you -- do you argue that in just


an ordinary case if a -- you file -- a defendant files a


motion to dismiss both on the grounds of no cause of


action and so forth and so on and also no jurisdiction,


you win on no jurisdiction, you can appeal that? 


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I think, this Court's


decision in Forney v. Apfel stands for that proposition. 


But it would -- this is an easier case because we did not


seek to dismiss this for subject matter jurisdiction


grounds.  We wanted to be in Federal court.  We were the


ones who removed the underlying State court actions here.

As it turns out, they decided they wanted to be in Federal


court too. 


But there are a long line of cases, and really


an uninterrupted line of cases, in the lower courts that


have interpreted this Court's jurisprudence in Forney and


Guaranty Trust and Electrical Fittings to mean that where


there is a dismissal on -- of State law claims, not on the


merits, but for lack of jurisdiction, defendants are


aggrieved in a practical sense.  And we've discussed a --


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, I think the problem is


those six State court actions that haven't vanished. 


Nobody ever dismissed them.  And as aggrieved as you are


-- and I agree that you're aggrieved -- you could not


appeal from the remand.  It seems to me these two, the


dismissal of the consolidated complaint, the return of the


actions from which this consolidation originated, that


those two are inextricably tied together.  And you would


like to cut them off and say, Court, just look at the


consolidated complaint.  Forgot about those separate


actions.  Somehow they vanished. 


MR. WAXMAN:  Not -- with respect, Justice


Ginsburg, maybe I -- perhaps I'm not understanding you.  I


-- there's an interesting epistemological question in this


case whether the underlying State court actions continue


to exist or whether they had been, in fact, superseded but

the --


QUESTION:  Let -- let me ask you about one


solution to the epistemological question.  Let's assume --


let's assume that on the remand the State courts think


they are still alive.  Are you going to the State courts,


let's try them now?  Hear us immediately.  We want a


trial.


MR. WAXMAN:  You mean --


QUESTION:  You're not going to do that.  What


you're going to say is, defer any action here, if you win


on this -- on your point here.  You're going to say, defer


any action so we can try the Federal case.


MR. WAXMAN:  Well --


QUESTION:  And -- and that it seems to me,


unless I am missing the point of what you are necessarily


going to do, it follows that -- that the -- that the


Federal case is, in fact, simply the alter ego of the


State cases, and if you win here, you are functionally


doing nothing but eliminating subsection (d).


MR. WAXMAN:  I -- with respect, Justice Souter,


if -- there are plaintiffs in two of the State cases who


are not even named plaintiffs in the Federal case.  There


are defendants.  There is a defendant. 


QUESTION:  Are they within the class?


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, the -- all of the cases seek

a nationwide class. 


QUESTION:  Sure, and don't you think those non-


named plaintiffs would be happy to let somebody else carry


the ball for them in -- in the Federal action?


MR. WAXMAN:  Well --


QUESTION:  They're -- they're not going to fight


you when you say to the State courts, just let them sit


here until we get the Federal case taken care of.


MR. WAXMAN:  There are -- I'll go to door number


two.  There are claims.  There are causes of action in the


underlying State cases that are not included in the


consolidated complaint and vice versa.  In short, the --


the -- from a case management perspective, whether both a


Federal case and a State case that are both in existence


can go forward simultaneously or whether one should follow


the other is something that happens all the time, and it


has never been understood to divest one court or the other


of jurisdiction.  And our submission here is that we have


something that is distinctly new.  It was --


QUESTION:  The consolidated complaint?


MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  No, but I mean, you -- but our point


is if functionally you are going to treat this as the alt


-- the equivalent, the alternative to all of these State


actions -- and you have told me nothing to suggest that

you're not going to do that -- then it seems to me that


the -- the -- the argument has got to prevail that


functionally this in -- in fact is nothing but an end run


around the non-appealability of the remand.


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, in point of fact, Justice


Souter, if this Court reverses the Ninth Circuit for the


-- for -- for one of the two errors of law that it


committed, and on remand, the conclusion is made that


there is subject matter jurisdiction and the case can


proceed, we will be in precisely the same posture that we


were in at the time that the plaintiffs filed the


consolidated complaint.


QUESTION:  No, because at that time the --


the -- the State cases had been remanded.


MR. WAXMAN:  And -- well, the State cases have


not yet been remanded, but if the State --


QUESTION:  I -- I mean -- I'm sorry.  They had


been -- they had been removed.  I misspoke.


MR. WAXMAN:  They had been removed. 


QUESTION:  They had been removed. 


MR. WAXMAN:  And they will remain removed if


this -- if a Federal court concludes that there is subject


matter jurisdiction. 


QUESTION:  I thought that the order of the


Western District of Washington was that the State cases

are remanded. 


QUESTION:  That's what I thought. 


QUESTION:  And that the Ninth Circuit did not


touch that, that the Ninth Circuit dealt only with the


consolidated complaint.


MR. WAXMAN:  There is a single order in the case


that says there is no jurisdiction.  And it's in the -- in


the joint appendix.  There is no subject matter


jurisdiction over the consolidated complaint or over the


six removed actions.  And therefore, the consolidated


complaint is dismissed, and the clerk is directed to


remand the underlying State actions back to the States. 


Now, that order was stayed by the Ninth Circuit at our


request pending the outcome of this case.  That is, if --


QUESTION:  Well, but stayed by the Ninth Circuit


prior to argument there?


MR. WAXMAN:  No.  After -- yes, it was stayed


prior to argument there and --


QUESTION:  Well, didn't that stay expire with


the decision of the court of appeals?


MR. WAXMAN:  It would have except that we moved


for a stay of the mandate.  The mandate issued before the


court ruled on it, and the court then recalled the mandate


and directed that the remand of the underlying State


actions not proceed until this Court -- at least until

this Court -- has resolved the question.  But


ultimately --


QUESTION:  But I still think -- I still think


you're in trouble because even if we accept your -- your


reading of what the -- the court ordered and what it's


likely to do if you prevail here, it simply changes the


characterization of what's going on.  You're -- you're


saying that the -- that if the -- if the consolidated case


stays in the Federal court, it does not die, and in fact,


because of that, there is no remand.  Then it simply


follows that the consolidated course is a trump to the


remand and you're excluding the operation of subsection


(d) in a slightly different way. 


MR. WAXMAN:  Not true, Justice Souter, for two


reasons.  I'll give the broader one first. 


If we had filed as all parties in the case and


the Solicitor General as well agree is the complete


functional equivalent of the consolidated complaint -- if


Ford and Citi had filed a declaratory judgment action in


Federal court, even after the State cases had been filed,


before or after they had been removed, and we asked for a


declaration that we can terminate the Ford rebate program,


there would be no question that --


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, give me an example of any


case in which a defendant in a product liability suit, in

a credit suit like this one, a defendant has said I want


to preempt the class action and so I am going to bring


this declaratory suit against all the credit card holders


of this plan all over America in the forum that I choose,


and that's going to be where the class action is going to


proceed.  Can you give me any precedent for a defendant


being able to take over what would have ordinarily been


the plaintiff's product liability claim, credit card


claim?  I -- I don't know of any such case where a


defendant has been allowed to make such a case its show


rather than the plaintiff's show. 


MR. WAXMAN:  I -- as I'm standing here, Justice


Ginsburg, I -- I can't bring any cases to mind.  I'll --


I'll -- I'll -- I'll try and bring one to mind prior to my


rebuttal. 


But I don't understand what the objection would


be if, before terminating the program, we said, we're


going to terminate this program --


QUESTION:  Because you have --


MR. WAXMAN:  -- and we want a declaration


that --


QUESTION:  Because, Mr. Waxman, you have


potential plaintiffs from all over the country.  Normally


a lawsuit is begun by a plaintiff and the plaintiff's


choice of forum is respected.  Here you are saying a

defendant, not dealing with one plaintiff, but dealing


with hundreds, maybe thousands -- I don't know how many


credit card holders there are -- across the country can


start the lawsuit and a Federal court would listen to


that, would, at the defendant's urging, somehow certify


the plaintiff class.  I don't know of any such action.  I


don't know of any district judge who has done that at the


urging of a defendant. 


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, if we were


to have filed such a case -- and my submission is it would


be the functional equivalent of a consolidated complaint


-- it would not disempower plaintiffs or plaintiffs'


representatives from filing their own class actions in


State or Federal court.  And if that were the case, there


would then -- there would be -- thereafter be a


determination made by the courts involved --


QUESTION:  Well, in any case you said it --


MR. WAXMAN:  -- as to whether it makes sense --


QUESTION:  It doesn't occur to you that there is


such a case, but --


MR. WAXMAN:  I am -- I am sure that there are


many such cases.  I can't cite you one as I'm standing


here.


QUESTION:  Where defendant starts the action as


a declaratory action and a class gets certified on the

plaintiff's side. 


MR. WAXMAN:  That's correct.  I -- I know that


our brief and the red brief and the Solicitor's General


brief all address this scenario, but I can't bring to mind


the cases. 


But just to get back to Justice Souter's


question again, let me give you the ex -- in terms of


whether, if we proceed here, a State case could go forward


and -- and would go forward,  If you take, for example,


the Alabama case where there's no Alabama plaintiff here,


they have not only not sought specific performance, they


have disavowed any specific performance and brought


separate claims on different theories.  Since they haven't


sought specific performance, there is no subject matter


jurisdiction over the claim because we are -- and this


Court basing subject matter jurisdiction on the cost of


providing that performance -- the Alabama case can and


presumably will go forward. 


QUESTION:  Will it go forward without your


objection?  Are you representing that -- that you will


walk into the Alabama court and say, sure, we're ready to


go ahead? 


MR. WAXMAN:  Under this -- yes.  Under this


Court's -- under the Court's current jurisprudence, yes,


we would.  The only -- it would only be if this Court were

to resolve the question it left open in Free v. Abbott


Labs that we would then have some argument, or that the


Court determined that punitive damages could be


accumulated.  But since they aren't asking for a specific


performance -- and neither, by the way, are I think four


other of the six cases.  Since they're not asking for a


specific performance, we don't have an argument under this


Court's existing case law for keeping the cases there. 


And they could --


QUESTION:  How many -- how many -- I'm sorry,


but how many other cases like the Alabama case are there? 


In other words, you -- you say, okay, we'll litigate in


Alabama.  Any others? 


MR. WAXMAN:  I -- I don't know that I have the


-- all of the details of the underlying cases in mind. 


But if they are simply a claim for damages and punitive


damages in which the amount in controversy is not $75,000,


and they aren't asking for specific performance, I don't


think, consistent with the law of this case, we would have


any basis for objecting to them going forward. 


QUESTION:  They all ask for compensation.  There


are none of them that ask just for specific performance,


and -- and even in this consolidated complaint, the first


thing that they ask for is compensatory damages.


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, it's -- it is clear, Justice

Ginsburg -- and if it isn't clear from the complaint, it


is utterly clear from the -- from the plaintiffs' red


brief in this case at page 45 that what they -- the object


of this litigation is reinstatement of the national Ford


credit rebate program under which they can earn credits


toward the purchase of a Ford vehicle. 


They -- they're -- they don't -- none of these


plaintiffs have a liquidated claim for damages because


they're not asking that they be paid rebates that they


earned and weren't paid.  Those were credited to them. 


They are all asking for reinstatement of a program, which


doesn't exist, that will allow them to earn credits, based


on purchases, toward the purchase of a vehicle. 


And on the -- on the question of subject matter


jurisdiction, the court below made two errors of law. 


First, it held incorrectly that class actions joining


separate and distinct claims for injunctive relief cannot


be viewed from the defendants' -- cannot be valued from


the defendants' viewpoint.  And secondly, it erred in


concluding that the plaintiffs' interest in specific


performance cannot be viewed as common and undivided. 


And if the Court has no questions at this time,


I'd like to reserve the balance of my time and perhaps


address the merits on rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Waxman.

 Mr. Berman, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE W. BERMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. BERMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


I will turn to the question that's taken the


balance of the argument so far and that is whether this


Court has jurisdiction.  And I do so with the same


reluctance that Mr. Waxman did because the underlying


question is an important question that has troubled courts


dealing with class actions for some time now.


But despite the fact that I'd like the Court to


answer that question, I don't think there was jurisdiction


on appeal or -- or before this Court because it's quite


clear that no matter how you artfully look at this, this


is a simple situation that's subject to 1407(c) and (d)


which this Court has said commands -- and that's in the


Grauded case -- unmistakably commands that where there is


a remand, based on the lack of subject matter


jurisdiction, that that's not reviewable.


QUESTION:  I -- it was your clients, Mr. Berman,


who filed the consolidated complaint in the Western


District, I take it. 


MR. BERMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And who was it that moved to dismiss

that complaint? 


MR. BERMAN:  No one moved to dismiss that


complaint.  The court, after consideration of class


certification, wrestling with -- I think with the laws of


the various different States that were invoked by that


motion, said to us, I'm issuing an order to show cause why


I shouldn't, on my own motion, dismiss this case for lack


of jurisdiction. 


QUESTION:  And did he -- on the subject matter


ground that there's not -- not $75,000 in controversy?


MR. BERMAN:  That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MR. BERMAN:  And then we briefed that issue and


the judge dismissed the case in response to the briefing


on the order to show cause.


QUESTION:  And that was before there was any


certification.  You didn't get up to any certification of


any class, did you? 


MR. BERMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, that was -- the


answer is yes.  It was before.  We were in the midst of


the class certification hearings.  We had two or three


hearings.  No class had been certified, and I think, as I


said earlier, that in the process of wrestling with the


various State laws, the district court scratched his head


and said, why is this case before me?

 QUESTION:  Now, as I understand Mr. Waxman's


position, it is that the consolidated complaint is a new


Federal action.  To be sure, the effect of the district


court's order being appealed here and being reversed may


affect -- may control the remand of the cases that were


being held.  But this action must be looked at on its own


as a Federal action.  True, one of the proximate causes of


our retaining the action by saying that there is


jurisdiction may defer the remand of those other cases. 


True, that looks like something of an end around the no


appealability for remand, which is the express command of


the Congress.  But we have here a separate case and we


have to look just at that separate case.


Number one, am I understanding his argument


correctly?  And number two, what is your response? 


MR. BERMAN:  I think you are understanding his


argument correctly, but I submit that he's incorrect. 


It's not a new case.  As one of the Justices pointed out,


there's no authority under the MDL rules for us to just


say this is a whole new case. 


QUESTION:  Well, who filed the -- the


consolidated complaint?  Your -- presumably you did.


MR. BERMAN:  I did, Your Honor, and if you read


Judge --


QUESTION:  And it had different parties and

different complaints than -- than the separate State


actions. 


MR. BERMAN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Why did you file that consolidated


complaint in that fashion?  It was before the district


court as part of a pretrial situation in a multi-court


jurisdiction problem. 


MR. BERMAN:  It is not uncommon in MDL practice


for pretrial purposes to try to organize the pleadings for


the district judge in a consolidated complaint.  In fact,


I -- I can't think of any MDL case I handle --


QUESTION:  But didn't it do more than just


organize the pleadings?  Didn't it change parties and


causes of action and look like a whole new ball of wax?


MR. BERMAN:  Well, there were some


representative changes because after all the lawyers


across the country got together for the first time,


because we were thrown together, some of those lawyers


said, if you're going to move for class certification of a


nationwide class in one of these State court cases, maybe


my representative doesn't need to be there because there's


five other representatives.  So for consolidation purposes


and for organizational purposes, we streamline and we try


to be as organized as we can.  That doesn't mean we've


abandoned the cases underlying below.  We -- we did not.

 QUESTION:  It's not a question of abandonment. 


It's a question of which one takes precedence.  There's


now a Federal case which Mr. Waxman's argument is takes


precedent.  We just hold everything else until this one is


done. 


MR. BERMAN:  Well, there's a Federal case for


pretrial purposes, and the judge, Judge Dwyer of the lower


court, found he had no jurisdiction anymore over that case


which is proceeding in Federal court.  But it's a


diversity case asserting State law claims.  So it's not,


quote, a Federal case.  It's been removed, and once a


court determines that there's no jurisdiction, it's no


longer a Federal case. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Berman, Mr. Waxman points out


that you have submitted an entire complaint.  It doesn't


look like a pretrial-only complaint.  It's a -- it's a


complete complaint that has a prayer for relief.  So it


looks like a different action.  And he said by filing such


a complaint, you in effect waived any objection to the --


to the multi-district forum going on to dispose of the


whole case, not just pretrial.


MR. BERMAN:  Well, to answer that, Justice


Ginsburg, the pretrial order that Mr. Waxman cited to and


I think that you cited to as well said that the


consolidated complaint was to be filed for pretrial

purposes only.  There was no waiver in the record that we


filed.  The judge didn't order that we submit such a


waiver.  And I don't know that I have the authority as a


lawyer to alter the MDL rules.  The MDL rules don't


provide that I can decide on my own that the case will


proceed for all purposes forever in front of Judge Dwyer.


And -- and yes, the complaint --


QUESTION:  Where does it say that?  For pretrial


purposes only. 


MR. BERMAN:  It's in the --


QUESTION:  I mean, the judge says on page 41,


should plaintiffs in all or some actions decide to file a


consolidated complaint, that complaint shall be filed


within 15 days.  And then the complaint itself doesn't say


it's for pretrial purposes only.


MR. BERMAN:  No, it does not, Your Honor, and


the judge didn't mandate that we do it.  He said, should


you. 


QUESTION:  But in Lexecon, we said that the


judge who -- to whom it was referred for pretrial --


couldn't try the case unless both parties consented,


didn't we? 


MR. BERMAN:  Yes, you did.  And there's --


there's nothing in this record other than the complaint. 


If you read from the complaint consent, that's the only

thing in the record that you could draw that we consented


to Judge Dwyer trying this case for all purposes.


QUESTION:  Could -- could you come back to my


question?  Where -- you -- you say that the complaint was


only filed for pretrial purposes.  On -- on what do you


base that?


MR. BERMAN:  I base that on my understanding of


MDL practice.  I mean, we didn't say we're filing this for


trial purposes.  We didn't say we're filing it for


pretrial purposes. 


QUESTION:  You filed a complaint.  I mean, you


file a complaint --


MR. BERMAN:  In MDL practice, I submit, Justice


Scalia, that you do file a complaint of some form that


brings all these plaintiffs from all over the country


together.  I can't think of an -- an MDL case, whether it


Brand Name Prescription Drugs or the various cases that


are pending involving the pharmaceutical industry, for


example, where a consolidated complaint of -- of removed


State court cases is not put together in some fashion.


QUESTION:  That's true, but does it normally --


is it normally just look like an ord -- your complaint


looks like an ordinary complaint.  It names four people. 


It says we're bringing a case.  It's diversity


jurisdiction.  It's quite clear, I think, there's venue.

And -- and that's it.  It looks like a normal complaint.


So is it ordinary MDL practice that what happens


when you transfer things for pretrial proceedings, the


lawyers get together and file what to the naked eye looks


exactly like a normal complaint, as if they marched into


Federal court on day one and filed a complaint?  Is that


normal MDL practice?


MR. BERMAN:  I think it is very typical --


QUESTION:  How do I verify that? 


MR. BERMAN:  I could submit my supplemental


record --


QUESTION:  No, no.  Not your -- I mean, is there


some -- I guess I could look it up in a book on MDL


practice. 


Now, on MDL practice, when you finish, as I read


the rules, it says the transferee judge can reach a


judgment.  But if he doesn't get to a judgment that


finishes the case, he's supposed to send it back to the


transferor districts, not the State court, but back to


several transferor districts.  Is that what happened here?


MR. BERMAN:  It never got there because --


QUESTION:  Why? 


MR. BERMAN:  -- that -- the order of remand,


both by the district judge and the Ninth Circuit, was


stayed.

 QUESTION:  No, but was the order of remand the

MR. BERMAN:  Actually I think the language of


the order is that the cases are remanded back to the State


courts.


QUESTION:  To the State courts.


MR. BERMAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That must be wrong, mustn't it?


MR. BERMAN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  It should go to the transferor


districts.


MR. BERMAN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  And there also -- it says


specifically and that is pursuant to the MDL order, which


we can review, can we not? 


MR. BERMAN:  Yes, you can. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  So we would have the power in


this case to review what should have been the Ninth


Circuit's order remanding the case to the transferor


districts, even though they said it wrong. 


MR. BERMAN:  If you -- if you took jurisdiction


under that scenario --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. BERMAN:  -- in all due respect, you would be

violating both the spirit and the intent --


QUESTION:  Not at all.  After all --

QUESTION:  Not at all.  Not at all.  If, after


all, an order of the MDL panel were to have an underlying


theory that there wasn't jurisdiction in some court or


other under 1447, I don't see why we couldn't by writ, as


provided, review it.  And our reason for doing it would be


to solve an important and serious problem of jurisdiction


that is plaguing the lower courts.  In other words --


QUESTION:  Mr. Berman, you don't want us to


review an order that never existed, do you? 


MR. BERMAN:  I'm not sure --


QUESTION:  You wouldn't want us to -- to review


an order that should have issued but didn't issue.  How


could we review an order that never issued? 


QUESTION:  No, it did issue. 


MR. BERMAN:  There was -- there was an erroneous

QUESTION:  I think we can review -- the -- the


erroneous order is nonreviewable. 


MR. BERMAN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  No.  There is an order dismissing.


There is an order that says remand it to the courts.

 QUESTION:  To the State courts.  But that --


that isn't what they meant.


MR. BERMAN:  That is -- that is not what he


meant.


QUESTION:  All right.  That is a problem.  I see


that as a problem, but I don't know if it's an insuperable


problem --


(Laughter.) 


MR. BERMAN:  And the problem I have, Justice


Breyer, is that I would like to agree with your argument


because, as you pointed out, this is something that's


plaguing the courts.


QUESTION:  All right.  The way it would have


worked if they had gotten -- hadn't said remand to State


courts, is they would have sent it back to transferor


districts.  Some transferor districts would have agreed


with this judge, some would have come to other


conclusions, and we plainly could have reviewed the ones


that came to other conclusions so we could have decided


the issue.  So is that what you think should happen?  What


should happen? 


MR. BERMAN:  Well, I would like the Court to


review the underlying merits, but to do so, I think you


have to do some gamesmanship and do injustice to 1407.


QUESTION:  Isn't, Mr. Berman, what --

 QUESTION:  Justice Breyer told you that -- said


that it would have to go back to the State courts.  But


the question is what is the it.  You have to first dispose


of the action that was instituted by the consolidated


complaint.


MR. BERMAN:  That was disposed of.


QUESTION:  But that's the only thing we're


arguing about here, and the arg -- and the contention is


it was improperly disposed of and that it was disposed of


on a basis that injures the defendants and that they can


appeal that because they're aggrieved under the cases that


Mr. Waxman cites.  And that's all we're talking about. 


MR. BERMAN:  And I understand that, Justice


Kennedy, but the case that Mr. Waxman cites and the cases


he cites for the proposition that an aggrieved party can


appeal, I don't quarrel with that.


The problem with that authority in this case is


that none of those cases that he cites are cases where


there's been a dismissal, which there was in this case, of


the consolidated complaint on the grounds of a lack of


subject matter jurisdiction.  And --


QUESTION:  Mr. Berman, I think something needs


clarification here.  When a district judge in a multi-


district case like this makes a pretrial order,


determination, decision, and on the basis of that, those

cases go back to the district courts from whence they


came, that ruling is not up for grabs in the individual


district courts.  That is the law of the case that they


all must follow.  And as I understand the Western District


of Washington decision, that there was no subject matter


jurisdiction, that would not be open for contest in the


district courts. 


MR. BERMAN:  I -- I agree with that.  It would


go to the district courts pursuant to proper MDL practice. 


We would move for enforcement of the judge's order


remanding the case, but we couldn't fight that issue of


subject matter jurisdiction because it would have been


decided --


QUESTION:  Okay.  So -- so that if that had


happened -- going back to an answer you gave earlier, if


that had happened, and -- and the -- the missing step had


been included and it said, back to the transferor court,


the only thing that could have happened with the


transferor court, the jurisdictional issue having been


decided in the Western District of Washington, would be to


remand.


MR. BERMAN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Yeah, okay. 


MR. BERMAN:  And -- and because of that --


QUESTION:  May -- may I ask?  Mr. Waxman pointed

out to us that this order was actually stayed by the


district court and by the Ninth Circuit, and I don't find


the stay order in the appendix.  I'm sure it's in the


record, as he points out.  But in connection with getting


that stay and the -- the both -- in both the district


court and the court of appeals, did anyone point out to


either of those courts that the order was defective for --


for failing to -- to include the transferor court rather


than going direct to the State court? 


MR. BERMAN:  No.


QUESTION:  So that just surfaced today. 


MR. BERMAN:  It just surfaced today.  And -- and


the jurisdictional issue just surfaced in response to your


question.  No one raised the 1407 issue in any of the


courts below. 


I had originally had come to talk about the


important issue. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BERMAN:  And I -- I don't know that Mr. --


QUESTION:  Us too. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BERMAN:  Mr. Waxman hasn't had time to


address that issue.  I don't know if the Court wants me to


go into that.  I have some time remaining. 


QUESTION:  I think the Court would like to.

 MR. BERMAN:  Very briefly then.  This Court has,


since the Judiciary Act of 1789 was passed, consistently


construed diversity jurisdiction so as to avoid expanding


the Federal caseload.  That's the teaching of Snyder v.


Harris.  The proposition that's asserted here today by the


petitioners that you can use administrative costs in


satisfying the amount in controversy would vastly expand


the Federal caseload in two ways. 


QUESTION:  Is your objection just to the concept


of administrative costs, Mr. Berman, or to the idea that


it can be compute -- the amount in controversy can be


computed at all from the defendants' point of view?


MR. BERMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, my answer to


that is I think that the Court could adopt a rule allowing


the amount in controversy to be determined from either


viewpoint, both from the plaintiffs' viewpoint or from the


defendants' viewpoint.  But that doesn't answer the


question. 


The -- the question really presented then is how


do we value that amount.  And this Court's teachings I


think have answered that question, and that is in the Hunt


case, the Court has ruled and has consistently followed


this proposition, that it is well established that the


amount in controversy is measured by the value of the


object of the litigation.  And so, another way the Court

has put it is what right does the plaintiff seek to have


enforced here.  The --


QUESTION:  In a -- in a couple of those quotes,


you know, taken out of context, they seem to support your


position.  They certainly don't controvert your position. 


But the Court wasn't really faced with the issue here.


MR. BERMAN:  I -- I think the Court has never


squarely been faced with the issue of should the


plaintiff's rule be adopted or not.  There is suggestions


that it should be, but I think what the Court has been


consistent on is looking at the value of the object of


litigation from the point of view, what is it that the


plaintiff wants, not what are the incidental costs to the


defendant.  In fact, there is a case -- and I -- I know


it's an old case, but the Ross case and the Elliott case


squarely hold that jurisdiction does not depend upon any


contingent injuries or damage to a defendant in a case.


And if the rule is otherwise -- and by the way,


I think there's a big difference, for the purposes of this


Court's review, of an administrative cost versus


injunctive relief.  So let me first focus on


administrative cost.


The mischief, I think, of allowing


administrative cost to be considered is illustrated by an


earlier Ninth Circuit decision in Snow v. Ford.  And there

the plaintiff sought an injunction because Ford had sold a


trailer package without an $11 wiring kit.  And Ford


argued then, as it does now, that because it would have to


incur substantial costs in supplying this $11 kit, that


there was Federal jurisdiction.


Well, the value of the object of litigation from


the plaintiffs' point of view, if you can't aggregate,


which under Snyder v. Harris you can't, is $11.  If the


Court is going to allow administrative cost to be


considered, then this Court is going to have hundreds --


Federal courts are going to have hundreds of $11 cases in


front of them. 


And I think Judge Posner hit the nail right on


the head in the Brand Name Prescription Drug case, in


which he said that if the costs of compliance were


considered, then every case, virtually every case, quote,


however trivial would cross the threshold.


QUESTION:  Why shouldn't they have it if in fact


it really does cost the defendant the $75,000, however you


categorize it?  Why shouldn't the Federal courts hear


those cases? 


MR. BERMAN:  Because consistently this Court has


looked at the value of the right to be protected and


excluded such incidental costs.  The value of the right


there --

 QUESTION:  There might be a legal argument


there, but I thought you were making a policy argument


that it was a bad thing.


MR. BERMAN:  Well, I do -- I do --


QUESTION:  And I don't see why that's so if in


fact in most cases I think that if it's going to cost


$75,000 for an $11 claim, if it's really just one claim,


the defendant will settle it.  And, of course, if it's not


really just one claim, but really involves class actions


involving many hundreds of claims, that's just what's


supposed to be in the Federal court. 


MR. BERMAN:  Well, then you'd have to overrule


Snyder and the non-aggregation --


QUESTION:  There's a legal -- you're making a


purely legal argument then.


MR. BERMAN:  Yes, which -- which they're not


advocating.  But from a policy argument, my argument is


that you would suddenly thrust the Federal courts in


determination of what basically are State -- routine State


law matters. 


QUESTION:  But that's what -- that's what this


Class Action Fairness Act, which has considerable support,


that's pending in Congress -- it's still pending, isn't


it?


MR. BERMAN:  That's correct.

 QUESTION:  That's what it would do.  It would


allow -- if -- if the price tag of all these small claims


for the defendant was more than the amount in controversy


-- well, I think it puts a much higher price tag than


$75,000.  But anyway, that -- that's the idea of the class


action bill that's pending in Congress, to put all these


cases, to aggregate them if the total dollar amount for


the defendant is very high. 


MR. BERMAN:  That's correct.  That -- it's $2


million, the new proposed limit, and it would allow


aggregation, which this Court so far has not allowed.  So


Congress realizes under existing precedent that what the


-- Ford wants to do here is not permitted. 


QUESTION:  Well, is -- is -- is there a -- is


there a distinction to be made along these lines?  And I


-- I may not be able to -- to state what I'm trying to


work out in my mind, but here -- here's -- here's the


distinction I'm trying to -- to get at. 


Let's assume that the -- that the only issue is


-- is an issue in one case.  They didn't give the $11


taillight or whatever it was.  And because of the


bureaucracy of a big company, in order to provide the one


$11 tail light, it's going to cost $100,000 to galvanize


everybody into action and get the tail light.  I see your


argument in that case.

 There's a difference, though, in this case


because what they're saying in this case is they promised


that they would have a kind of administrative system in


place that would take account of all these various credit


charge card -- credit card charges and -- and would --


would ultimately result in -- in this -- this credit of up


to $3,500 for our benefit.  The various people who are


aggrieved by their failure to do it aren't all claiming


$3,500.  You know, they may be claiming everything from $5


to $3,500.  The only way to satisfy our -- our -- the


claims of all these people who are in the class is to put


the system in place. 


If that's the essence of their claim, they're


not saying we want you to incur a lot of administrative


costs in order to get to a particular result, which is


jurisdictionally insufficient.  They're saying, we want


you to put the system in the place -- in place that you


agreed you would do.  The system is not an administrative


cost.  It's what you promised in the first place.  The


system is the tail light. 


Is that a fair distinction, and does -- does


that count against you? 


MR. BERMAN:  That's their argument, and I don't


think it counts against my position for two reasons.  In


order to make that argument, what they're really doing is

aggregating what it would cost to reinstitute the system


as if they were going to pay all 6 million class --


QUESTION:  But the system is not an aggregated


system.  There's either a system or there isn't a system. 


If there is a system, it produces different results


depending on the kind of business that individuals do. 


But the system is not a separate system for all of the


members of the class which is being aggregated.  It's a


system to fulfill one promise which was made in common


form to the entire class.  And isn't that a distinction


which removes it from this notion simply of administrative


cost? 


MR. BERMAN:  No, because right now there are


just six plaintiffs.  This is not a class.  And those six


plaintiffs may have a total of $20,000 at stake.  All Ford


has to do to satisfy their claim in this case is to give


those six people the rebates. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. BERMAN:  And the only way to get around that


is to aggregate this case, which they can't do.  And so


the danger --


QUESTION:  There is -- there is no claim for


specific performance? 


MR. BERMAN:  There is as to each plaintiff. 


QUESTION:  But not as to a class.

 MR. BERMAN:  That's right, because what we have


here and the --


QUESTION:  So they -- so they could multiply


3,500 by 6 and that would be the end of the case.


MR. BERMAN:  That's right, because prior to this


litigation -- this gets to the common and undivided


interest.  Prior to this litigation, these plaintiffs,


these 6 million people, were completely unrelated.  They


had no common interest in this issue, and therefore, you


can't follow -- you can't aggregate.  They have to be


treated --


QUESTION:  Let me ask you a philosophical


question.  Mr. Waxman got into epistemology a minute ago. 


Let me ask you a contrary-to-fact question. 


If in fact the Federal action were a class


action and it included everybody who had been included in


the State class actions and specific performance had been


requested in the form that I suggested, would that not


take it out of the aggregation problem and -- and --


and -- and satisfy the jurisdictional amount, even on your


own theory?


MR. BERMAN:  No, because under the analysis of


-- of this Court and the Gilman court in the Second


Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, again because each person


had a separate right, as they've admitted.  They've

admitted that for damage purposes each person had a


separate and distinct claim. 


QUESTION:  Yeah, but that's not the same as for


specific performance purposes. 


MR. BERMAN:  It is.  If -- if I -- if one of my


plaintiffs decides he no longer wants to be in this


litigation, they have don't have to up the specific


performance to someone else.  Each person only has the


right to the rebates they were entitled to.  So they're


separate and distinct no matter what the relief is. 


QUESTION:  Were these class actions -- were


these actions certified as class actions in the State


court before they were removed? 


MR. BERMAN:  No.  They -- they were removed


before anything happened. 


QUESTION:  So we have -- you need the


aggregation of the class action.


MR. BERMAN:  That's correct.  You have an -- you


have an uncertified class here. 


The other danger I'll touch on in my last minute


of allowing the injunctive -- amount it would cost the


defendant, either by way of injunction or administrative


cost, is that plaintiffs could use this new theory to


invoke Federal court jurisdiction.  The amicus seem to


suggest that plaintiffs never want to be in Federal court.

That's not correct.  If you adopt the petitioners' rule,


anytime I have a case where I want to be in Federal court,


where I normally could not be in Federal court -- and I


have many such cases right now -- I would just simply have


to say in my prayer for relief that the -- the injunction


would cost the defendant more than $75,000.  And bingo, I


have a whole new rule and there's a whole new group of


Federal cases that suddenly would arise. 


So in closing, unless there's any questions, the


problem with the defendants' -- the petitioners' position


in this case is that it would open up the flood gates of


litigation to the Federal court system.  We cited a RAND


Institute study that about 65 percent of the country's


class actions are in State courts, and to adopt their rule


would mean that many of those, probably thousands of


cases, that are now residing in State courts would


suddenly find their way into Federal courts.  That I think


is not consistent with this Court's policy of strictly


construing the diversity statute and giving deference to


State courts and State governments with respect to laws


that they have the power to enact and to have those cases


heard in State courts.


Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I'll use 1


minute on appellate jurisdiction and I hope 2 minutes on


subject matter jurisdiction. 


On appellate jurisdiction, there is no doubt


whatsoever that what was intended here was a new complaint


about new things to proceed to judgment at trial.  At page


11 of the transcript of oral argument before the district


judge on the class certification issue, the court says,


"if a nationwide class were to be certified" -- he's


talking about the consolidated complaint -- "would there


be any need for further MDL proceedings, or would the


whole litigation just be there in this one case for trial


or other disposition? 


"Mr. Berman: That is my understanding.  There


would be no further -- everyone has consented.  All the


plaintiffs' counsel and defendants have consented to have


this case here." 


Justice Ginsburg, in response to your question


about cases in which a declaratory judgment action was


filed where it -- the case could have been litigated by a


plaintiff class in a consumer case, that was the case in


the Greenwood Trust case filed by a bank in the First


Circuit that ultimately produced this Court's decision in


48

Smiley which was a consumer class action that came up out


of California. 


Now, with respect to specific performance,


specific performance is the object of this complaint.  It


is what they want.  It is the thing they need in order for


any of them to be able to realize the benefits.  And as


this Court said in Mississippi & Missouri River Bridge v.


Ward -- in that case, it involved removing a bridge


obstruction -- the removal of the obstruction is the


matter of the controversy and the value of the object must


govern. 


The complaint itself says they want specific


performance of the national rebate program, and if there


were any clarification needed, you look at page 45 of the


red brief and they explain that that's just what they


want.  If there were any --


QUESTION:  They don't -- they don't need that


for their relief.  And wouldn't that be a frivolous


complaint?  Wouldn't that be conferring jurisdiction by --


by making an assertion that goes way beyond what anybody


would consider reasonable? 


MR. WAXMAN:  It's -- it would not if -- the


Court may or may not grant specific performance of the


national program in response to a particular plaintiff,


but it would certainly not be a frivolous claim.  Cases


49 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

like that are brought all the time.


QUESTION:  Why -- Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, if you --


if the test is one plaintiff -- if it's Judge Posner's


test, you assume there's one plaintiff, what will it cost


the defendant.  Injunctive relief for one plaintiff would


only involve tracking that particular plaintiff's


purchases, and that wouldn't add up to $75,000.


MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, first, the cost


is -- the test is the cost of supplying the relief


requested in the complaint to any one plaintiff, and that


is class-wide relief.  It would also cost a sufficient


amount even if it were only one plaintiff.
