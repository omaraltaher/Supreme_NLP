CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-455, Franconia Associates v. the United


States, and the Grass Valley Terrace v. United States. 


Mr. Eckland.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF H. ECKLAND


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ECKLAND:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This Court has held that statutes of limitations


involve fundamental considerations of fairness. 


Petitioners submit that the cases before Your Honors this


morning involve precisely that. 


In these two civil actions, petitioners seek


fair compensation for continuing to be bound to the


Section 515 housing program and continuing to house low-


income tenants for up to 50 years.  Petitioners can


succeed in obtaining that fair compensation only if this


Court continues to apply the same ordinary principles of


law to the United States Government that it applies to


United States citizens. 


The ordinary principles of law and their


continuing application to the United States Government


that are at issue here are, first, that a breach of

contract claim does not accrue until the date of breach;


that is, until the time for performance by the defendant


arrives and the defendant fails to perform.


QUESTION:  Mr. Eckland, you -- you began by


saying you're seeking fair compensation for something. 


Which is it?  Are you seeking fair compensation for the


Government's violation of the Constitution by impairing


the obligation of contracts, or are you simply seeking


your contractual rights?  Are you seeking a contract


claim?  Which -- what do we have before us? 


MR. ECKLAND:  We are -- Justice Scalia, we are


seeking compensation for the breach of contract.


QUESTION:  Okay.  So, it's a -- it's a simple


contract case.


MR. ECKLAND:  Very much so, Your Honor.  I mean,


included in the compensation that the petitioners are


seeking, it was not merely the lost income because of


their lost right to opt out, but given the situation,


petitioners are not receiving really sufficient income to


even cover the costs of maintaining the housing for their


current tenants.


QUESTION:  Do you think you have a separate


cause of action for the Government's violation of the


Constitution, assuming that -- that you're correct that


that's what it's done?

 MR. ECKLAND:  Under the takings claim, Justice


Scalia? 


QUESTION:  Well, no, not the takings.  But --


but impairing the obligation of contracts.


MR. ECKLAND:  Oh, quite so, Your Honor, yes.  We


believe that although it's for purposes --


QUESTION:  This is a -- this is a Federal


contract?


MR. ECKLAND:  It is with the Department of


Agriculture, Your Honor, through the Farmers Home


Administration. 


QUESTION:  So, the impairment clause doesn't


apply. 


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, it -- it comes -- no.  That


only applies to the States.


QUESTION:  My difficulty with your argument is


that if you have -- your whole property claim here rests


upon the contract.  And if you have a contract claim, then


your contract will be enforceable.  If you don't have a


contract claim, then I'm not sure what the source of your


property taking is on the -- on the unconstitutionality


claim. 


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, petitioners pled, Justice


Souter, the takings claim in the alternative to the breach


of contract claim.  And in fact, the lower courts have

held that there is no enforceable contract here.


QUESTION:  Well, if -- if they are correct, then


I don't see how you've got a taking because your -- your


whole property interest -- the only property interest


you're asserting is an interest under that contract.  And


if you haven't got the -- if you have no breach of


contract, then I don't see what's being taken from you.


MR. ECKLAND:  What's being taken, Justice


Souter, is the expected use of the petitioners'


properties.  What happened is they volunteered to a


certain period of time --


QUESTION:  If you don't have a contract for it,


you have no right to expect it.


MR. ECKLAND:  But there were representations by


the Government that created a reasonable investment-backed


expectation on the part of --


QUESTION:  Why did the lower courts find that


there was no contract claim?  Because of the statute.


MR. ECKLAND:  Because of the -- one judge, in


particular, because of the unmistakability doctrine.


QUESTION:  Because of the --


MR. ECKLAND:  In other words, the contract was


not clear enough to constitute an enforceable contract


with the Government. 


QUESTION:  I thought the Federal Circuit went on

the statute of limitations.  Isn't that what you're


opposing, that the statute of limitations didn't expire?


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes, Your Honor.  The lower court


opinions were denying our motion for summary judgment, so


we've not been able to get to trial on the existence of


the contract.  Assuming for the purposes of our case that


there is a contract, the Federal Circuit did affirm the


dismissal on the basis of the statute of limitations.


QUESTION:  Yes.  The question you presented is


whether a breach of contract claim accrues for purposes of


section -- when Congress enacts a statute alleged to


abridge a contractual right to freedom from regulatory


covenants upon prepayment of Government mortgage loans. 


Basically the -- the court held that your -- the statute


of limitations barred your contract claim, didn't it?


MR. ECKLAND:  That is true, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And that's the case we have here.


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, in -- yes.  Yes, it is,


Judge, a statute of limitations case. 


In our case, the petitioners alleged that their


claims accrued when they tried to prepay and when the


Farmers Home Administration failed to accept their


prepayment requests and refused to release them from the


regulatory covenants imposed by the Section 515 program. 


Petitioners all commenced suit within 6 years of that

date, and therefore they maintain here that their claims


are timely.


Now, the Government maintains that the


petitioners' claims accrued not on the date dictated by


the ordinary principles of law, breach of contract and


takings, but rather automatically in the enactment of the


1988 legislation.  But if you look at -- closely at the


1988 legislation, it's clear that it has no immediate


impact whatsoever on the owners.  All of its commands,


directives, requirements, and authorizations are directed


solely at the agency. 


QUESTION:  Didn't the Federal Circuit rely on


anticipatory breach?


MR. ECKLAND:  No, Your Honor.  They maintained


that the actual passage of the -- of the statute


constituted an automatic breach.  They did not rely on the


anticipatory breach.


QUESTION:  You were relying on anticipatory


breach, as I understand it. 


MR. ECKLAND:  We do not either, Your Honor,


although the petitioners here have the option of suing --


assuming -- suing before the breach, assuming that they


had the ability to perform at that time -- and there's


nothing in the record --


QUESTION:  You rely on the notion that before

they went to pay it off, it was an anticipatory breach.


MR. ECKLAND:  No, Judge.  We are relying on the


actual breach.  All petitioners --


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  Then I'm confused.  I


thought that your argument was that the reason the statute


of limitations doesn't arise, doesn't start to run prior


to the time that they paid it off, is because prior to


that time, there was no actual breach.  There was only an


anticipatory breach. 


MR. ECKLAND:  Correct, yes.


QUESTION:  All right.  That's what I thought


Justice Ginsburg was asking.


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Now, but you take the position that


your clients could have filed suit soon after the passage


of ELIHPA.


MR. ECKLAND:  Justice O'Connor, not necessarily. 


Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, they did


have a option to sue before.  But as we pointed out in


footnote --


QUESTION:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. 


You take the position -- let's be clear about your --


please -- that after the enactment of the statute, your


clients could have filed suit for breach of contract on an


anticipatory breach theory?

 MR. ECKLAND:  Yes, but only if they had the


ability to prepay at that time.  One of the requirements


of -- of the contract is that the petitioners had the


requisite funds to prepay before submitting a prepayment


request. 


QUESTION:  Well, no, no, no, no, no.


MR. ECKLAND:  That is --


QUESTION:  You -- you don't -- you don't -- no. 


You have to -- you say for anticipatory breach you have to


show that you're ready to --


MR. ECKLAND:  Ready, willing, and able, Judge.


QUESTION:  -- to perform when -- when the


obligation to perform comes.  You -- you don't have to


show that you're ready for immediate performance.


MR. ECKLAND:  You do have to show that you're --


but for the repudiation, you do have to show that you are


able to perform.


QUESTION:  But performance here -- what you're


talking about here in performance means the ability to


prepay.  And I take it your argument is we couldn't have


prepaid because we didn't have the money, and therefore we


couldn't have proved damages.  Is -- is that it?


MR. ECKLAND:  Essentially so, Your Honor.  We


don't rely on --


QUESTION:  I have a contract to deliver 100,000

widgets 3 years from now.  The party who -- the party who


is committed to buy those widgets announces I am not going


to buy those widgets, and you say there is no anticipatory


breach unless I have on hand the 100,000 widgets, which I


have no obligation to deliver until 3 years from now. 


That's -- that's how you envision the -- the law of


anticipatory breach?  I'm sure that's wrong. 


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, no.  Well, footnote 23.  We


address this in our reply brief, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  The whole purpose of anticipatory


breach -- most people use it not to get damages but to


relieve themselves of the obligation of -- of remaining in


-- in the status of being able to perform the contract. 


The person who would sue in the case that I gave you would


be suing so that he wouldn't have to go and acquire the


100,000 -- the 100,000 widgets.  It's never the case that


he's ready -- or almost never the case that he's ready


here and now to perform.


MR. ECKLAND:  But, Your Honor, if the person who


had the obligation to accept the delivery did not have the


funds, for example, even to purchase them, then that would


be sort of almost a fraudulent --


QUESTION:  He didn't need the funds until 3


years from now.  He has no obligation to purchase until 3


years from now.

 QUESTION:  Could we agree to this? 


Could we agree to this, that so far as the element of an


anticipatory breach claim involves the act of the


Government, you had that element, and at least to that


extent, you could have brought an anticipatory breach


claim when the statute was passed?  Maybe you didn't have


other elements.  That's what we're arguing about, but you


had the -- you had the -- the Government's fault element. 


Is that correct?  Do you agree?


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, certainly, Justice Souter,


the --


QUESTION:  But you're saying, whether I could


have sued then or not, I certainly can sue at the point at


which I would claim my right to redeem without these


various conditions, and they refused to honor it.  You're


saying, even if I could have sued when the statute was


passed, I can also under contract principles sue when the


moment comes that I want to exercise my right to prepay.


MR. ECKLAND:  Correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. ECKLAND:  And -- and the doctrine does not


require you to sue until that date.  It's merely an option


to sue prior to that date. 


QUESTION:  So, you're arguing for total control


then over timing because your client could say, we're not

ready after 5 years, we're not ready after 7 years, we're


not ready after 10 years.  So, the statute would -- would


never run.  In other words, you're asking for any time


from the earliest, which is when the law is passed, until,


say, 20 years later. 


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes, Your Honor, we are.


QUESTION:  So, you could --


MR. ECKLAND:  Because the Government negotiated


option terms up to 50 years. 


QUESTION:  That was the deal. 


MR. ECKLAND:  That was the deal.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. ECKLAND:  And the owners relied on that when


they signed up, and they had, you know, a clear


expectation that at some point in time they would be able


to prepay, opt out, and convert their markets --


QUESTION:  May -- may I interrupt you?


MR. ECKLAND:  -- to market rate -- yes.


QUESTION:  Did they have a right to assume right


after the -- the day after the statute was passed, did


they continue to have a right to prepay --


MR. ECKLAND:  The right --


QUESTION:  -- without any objection?


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, the right still existed,


Your Honor, but it wasn't -- it was repudiated at the time

of the statute. 


QUESTION:  Well, it wasn't just -- it's not like


a private citizen saying, I don't intend to perform 3


years from now.  You have a law passed that takes away a


certain contract right.  Was there a breach when the law


was passed? 


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, Your Honor, petitioners


maintain that the right was not eliminated.  It was, if


you will, conditioned --


QUESTION:  Do you maintain there was no breach


at the time the law was passed? 


MR. ECKLAND:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


That's merely repudiation.  The breach did not occur


unless and until the prepayment request was submitted and


denied. 


QUESTION:  But you would concede that the


statute changed your rights.


MR. ECKLAND:  The statute did condition them,


and that conditioning, or fettering as the Government


says, is a repudiation, but like any other situation in


the private sector, when you repudiate a right, the breach


doesn't occur until the time for performance comes due.


QUESTION:  The repudiation --


QUESTION:  Well, that's because a private party


has the right to change his mind.

 MR. ECKLAND:  Correct.  Right, the defendant


could change their mind or the petitioner here could, in


fact, be able to --


QUESTION:  Doesn't the Government have the right


to change its mind?  Couldn't the Government pass another


statute going back to what the situation was before this


one?


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  In fact, it did that at one point,


didn't it?


MR. ECKLAND:  They could and they did. 


QUESTION:  They did at one point, didn't they?


MR. ECKLAND:  In 1979 they initially conditioned


the right, and in 1980 they repealed it, retracted it. 


Now, under the Government's proposed rule, if -- if the


statute of limitations began to run immediately upon the


enactment of the statute, all of the petitioners here


would have been compelled to file their suit within 6


years of 1979, i.e., by 1985. 


QUESTION:  So, we're arguing about whether a


statute itself, without any action from the agency, can be


a repudiation.


MR. ECKLAND:  We believe it can be a


repudiation, yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  But the breach does


not ripen, if you will, unless and until the prepayment

request is denied. 


QUESTION:  Does the repudiation give you the


right to the same damages that you would receive for a


total breach of the contract?


MR. ECKLAND:  In our case, no.  The petitioners


maintain that since the housing is within a restricted


program, it really has no market value unless and until a


petitioner actually attempts to prepay.  But even


assuming, Your Honor, that there was some type of damage


caused by the enactment of the statute, still the


limitations period would not commence to run until the


time for performance came and was not rendered. 


QUESTION:  I think it's usually the case, is it


not, that when there's an anticipatory repudiation, it's


-- it's very difficult for the -- the other party to


determine what his damages are going to be.


MR. ECKLAND:  Very difficult. 


QUESTION:  Which is why he uses the doctrine to


get out of the contract rather than to seek damages.  In


the widget case I gave you, who knows?  Who knows what 3


years from now the price of widgets will be?  So -- so you


use it to get out of the contract.


MR. ECKLAND:  Petitioners here, being in the


Court of Federal Claims, have as their only remedy the


monetary judgment.  And -- and they are seeking damages

starting only as of the date that their prepayment request


was denied by the agency.  So --


QUESTION:  So are you -- you're saying that


there was a claim, or you're saying that -- that your


claim really doesn't accrue until you -- until you have


the -- the wherewithal to prepay.  So, you don't really


have a ripe claim until then? 


MR. ECKLAND:  We're saying the petitioners would


at least have to have the money to prepay.  They would


have to have the ability to perform.  You couldn't have a


situation, for example, where someone was unable to


prepay, they experienced repudiation and a breach, a later


breach, and then say, well, we would have performed if you


hadn't repudiated. 


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. ECKLAND:  They have to have the honest


intent to perform and have the ability to perform.


QUESTION:  I have a problem with that. 


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  But let's get -- if we can get -- for


the same reason Justice Scalia mentioned.  But let's


assume you had cash in the bank that would allow you to


prepay, and then there's a repudiation.


MR. ECKLAND:  Sure. 


QUESTION:  At that point, can't you show your

damages?  You don't want to prepay, but can't you say --


have an expert in and say, this property has a certain


value and part of the value is the right at any time to


prepay the -- the loan and use it for another use?  And


this can be valued in the real estate market.  It's worth


more if I can prepay than if -- if I can't, and you have


some expert come in and tell you the difference in the


values.  And you do that at the moment the repudiation


occurs. 


MR. ECKLAND:  But here, Justice Kennedy, a 50-


year option exists.  Petitioners don't know, frankly --


they didn't know in 1979 and many didn't know in 1988 what


the value of their properties would be, given interest


rate structures and other market conditions at any given


point in time --


QUESTION:  Well, you mean 50-year options are


not subject to valuation?  Experts do this all the time.


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, but even so, even if you


could come up with a damage theory to cover this, still


it's clear that under the law, the breach would not be


deemed to accrue for limitations purposes until the time


for performance has arrived and performance failed.


I mean, if you take a hypo of the GSA leasing


some space in a building --


QUESTION:  You're -- you're just getting me

confused again.  I thought we established that you thought


a suit could have been filed for anticipatory breach of


some kind after the statute was enacted. 


MR. ECKLAND:  If they're able to perform, yes,


Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And now you're saying no.  It's just


very confusing.  I don't know what in the world you're


arguing. 


MR. ECKLAND:  Justice O'Connor, no.  If the


petitioners had the ability to pay, they could have


brought an anticipatory breach claim --


QUESTION:  Only if they had the ability to pay,


you say.


MR. ECKLAND:  According to Corbin and the case


law that we cite at footnote 23 of our brief, yes.  But if


we get beyond that, okay --


QUESTION:  Footnote 23 just says that ordinary


contract law applies to this kind of case.  We still --


but we still -- we still have to figure out what ordinary


contract law is.  Footnote 23 doesn't shed any light on


that that I saw. 


MR. ECKLAND:  But in this case --


QUESTION:  And -- and I might add that on page


27 of the blue brief, you say that the law constituted an


anticipatory repudiation and petitioners had the option of

suing immediately.


MR. ECKLAND:  In general, yes, that's true, Your


Honor.  But here the petitioners sued within 6 years of


the actual breach.


QUESTION:  And in fact, you did not sue until


after the passage of 6 years. 


MR. ECKLAND:  From the statute, yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  From the enactment of the statute.


MR. ECKLAND:  But -- but all petitioners


commenced suit within 6 years of the date of the actual


breach, which is the date that the prepayment requests


were denied.


QUESTION:  So, what apparently the Government's


arguing -- does it matter if we call this anticipatory


repudiation or anticipatory breach?  I guess


technically --


MR. ECKLAND:  Technically --


QUESTION:  -- we should say anticipatory


repudiation?


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Fine.  And so, what they say, in


part, which I'd like to hear your response, is if you're


right that where there is anticipatory repudiation of a


contract, the other side, if it's a private contract, has


a choice.  They can either sue immediately if conditions

X, Y, and Z are fulfilled, or they wait until the contract


is actually breached.  But we are the Government and we


have to interpret this statute strictly, and therefore we


interpret it to mean that even if where you're dealing


with a private person, you'd have your choice; here


there's no choice. 


Now, your response is what? 


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, here, Your Honor, although,


yes, we need to construe the statute strictly, we cannot


do so in such a manner, however, to narrow the waiver of


sovereign immunity that has already occurred under the


Tucker Act.  As this Court held in Irwin and in Bowen


against New York, the tolling -- equitable tolling


principles at issue in those cases, which applied to the


private sector, were nonetheless deemed to apply to the


Government, despite the strict construction of the statute


of limitations involved in those cases.  Here there is --


although there's a conditioning of the right at the point


of the repudiation, no breach occurs until the performance


comes due and is not rendered. 


If -- again, if you look at the statute, under


ELIHPA, page 74 of our appendix 4a, all of its directives


are towards the Secretary.  For example, the Secretary


shall make reasonable efforts to enter into an agreement


with the borrower to extend the term of the -- of the

contract.  It's the Secretary that needs to make those


reasonable efforts.  There's no directive directly to the


owner that the owner participate in that process.


QUESTION:  If -- if that's the -- I mean, I


really do think that your takings claim, which is the


reason you're going into this thing -- well, it was just a


conditioning of the right; it wasn't an elimination of the


right; it just reduced it -- you do all of that to -- to


support your takings claim.  But -- but it just -- it


confuses your -- your primary claim, which is the contract


claim.  I don't see why there -- if it's only a


conditional reduction and if it's only a direction to the


agency, I don't see why there was an anticipatory breach


then.  It seems to me that what you need for a taking, you


need for an anticipatory breach.  I don't see how you can


say it was enough for an anticipatory breach, but it


wasn't enough for a taking.


MR. ECKLAND:  You are correct, Your Honor.  It


does not have to be repudiation.  We maintain that that's


the most that it can be.  If it's not a repudiation, the


breach here then occurs on the adverse agency action, and


all petitioners maintain --


QUESTION:  And that's why you were confusing


Justice O'Connor, because you're not really ready to say


there was an anticipatory breach, because in order to

sustain your takings claim, you don't really want to say


there was an anticipatory breach because they didn't


really, absolutely break the contract.  They just gave a


direction to the agency and it didn't entirely eliminate


the right, it just conditioned it.


MR. ECKLAND:  Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  You're carrying water on both


shoulders, it seems to me, and you're spilling a lot.


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, Your -- Your Honor, no.  At


the point of the denial of the prepayment request, there


is a definite breach and that's where the damages occur. 


But the takings --


QUESTION:  And you say in every breach there's


also a taking?


MR. ECKLAND:  Oh, no, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  I don't understand that.  Why weren't


you satisfied with a breach of contract claim?


MR. ECKLAND:  Well --


QUESTION:  What -- what are you adding with this


so-called takings claim? 


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, in the event that the lower


courts do not rule in the petitioners' favor on the


contract claim, they have their wholly independent takings


claim, which is based not -- it's not predicated on the


existence of a contract.  It's simply the unilateral

^Fextension by the Government of restrictions on the use


of the petitioners' property.  They -- they --


QUESTION:  The property being buildings?


MR. ECKLAND:  The buildings and their land. 


Before they entered into the program voluntarily, they had


the full use of their buildings and land.  And they


voluntarily --


QUESTION:  Suppose you win on the first claim.


Suppose you win on the contract claim.  Then do you want


us to go and answer the other question which, as far as I


can see, is going to take me into outer space? 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  But -- and I'd worry about what I'd


write on that.  What's your view on that? 


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, there are differences


between the claims, Your Honor.  There are potential


differences --


QUESTION:  I know there are differences.  I


asked you a specific question.  If you win on the contract


claim, do you want us, nonetheless, to go on and answer


the second question?  It's either yes or no.


MR. ECKLAND:  Petitioners do, Your Honor, yes,


because damages are different.  In fact, the dates could


be different.  The taking could take place, for example,


at the end of the for sale procedure that's involved in --

in the prepayment process, which would be 6 months, at

QUESTION:  May I --


QUESTION:  You've gotten the full benefit of


your contract, which is what would happen if you win on


your contract's claim.  What possible taking could there


have been?


MR. ECKLAND:  If -- in practical terms, Justice


Scalia, if we do prevail on the contract claim at trial, I


don't see that we would pursue the takings.


QUESTION:  That's fine, except what you're


asking us to do then is to write a little essay on a


matter that affects millions of other people in a very


serious way, in a case which doesn't seem completely to


present the issue.  If that's what you want us to do, and


I guess you have a right to do it.

mean, we would not abandon --


QUESTION:  Well, we have a right to dismiss it


too, I suppose. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes, you do.

precisely -- forget the contract claim for a minute.  All

we've got before us is the takings claim.  What is it that


was taken and when?


MR. ECKLAND:  Prior to the time that the owners


entered into this program, they owned their land.  Many


owned the buildings. 


QUESTION:  I understand, and then they --


MR. ECKLAND:  Then they voluntarily agreed to


these restrictions on the use, only a certain level of


rent, only a certain income of tenants.  The


representations by the Government, even though they may


not have arisen to a contract, nonetheless stated that --


or gave the owners the expectation that at some point in


time they could prepay and opt out of the program. 


QUESTION:  Well, would you tell me what you


think was taken?  Is it the right to prepay that was


taken?


MR. ECKLAND:  If there is no contract right,


then no, that was not taken, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  What -- what --


MR. ECKLAND:  What was taken is their -- is --


is the permitted use of the property under their


reasonable investment-backed expectation.  It's clearly --


it's -- it's a regulatory taking where the properties


experience a diminution in value because they can no


longer be used once the owner decides to -- to leave the

program in the manner in which they had been used prior to


their voluntary entry into the program. 


QUESTION:  It's a regulatory taking of the right


to make use of the property the way you wanted.  Which


occurred when? 


MR. ECKLAND:  Which occurred prior to the time


that they voluntarily agreed to participate in the


program. 


QUESTION:  You mean before -- even before they


signed the contract? 


MR. ECKLAND:  Well, at or about the same time. 


I mean, if it's a contract, yes, but we -- you know, it


was pled in the alternative.  So far, the courts have held


there are no contracts.  So, what we have is just a


written representation --


QUESTION:  I've been trying to ask the question


that's --


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Assume you never made a contract


claim.  What -- I'm trying to find out what your taking


claim would be, and I frankly don't understand. 


MR. ECKLAND:  It's just their inability to go


back to using their property the way they were because of


the passage of ELIHPA and the regulations that compelled


them to continue charging only a certain level of rent.

They could not raise their rent.


QUESTION:  Now, can we go back a little?  Did


your clients borrow some money from the Federal Government


at low interest rates?


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes.  Well --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. ECKLAND:  The construction loan, Your Honor,


in many cases was initially from a private mortgage


lender.  Then that would be taken out upon the entry into


the contract by the Farmers Home Administration.  And that


was a low interest rate loan effectively --


QUESTION:  To develop the property.


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes, Your Honor.  Yes.  And that


was a low interest loan, but it devolved to the benefit of


the tenants in the form of low rents.  It didn't go into


the pockets of the owners.  They were able to charge


low --


QUESTION:  Well, to get the loan, the borrower,


your clients, had to execute a loan agreement and a


promissory note --


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  -- and enter into a mortgage.


MR. ECKLAND:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And was the right of prepayment


spelled out in any of those agreements?

Mr. Chief Justice, I see that most of my time is


spent.  If I may reserve the rest for rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Eckland.


Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. ROBERTS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Petitioners' claims are barred because they


weren't filed within 6 years of when they first accrued,


on the enactment of ELIHPA.  Petitioners allege that their


contracts gave them the option to prepay their mortgages


at any time subject to only those legal restrictions in


place when the contracts were made.  They're, thus,


alleging that the Government promised not to impose


additional legal restrictions on their option to prepay


and ELIHPA itself breached any such promise because ELIHPA


itself imposed additional legal restrictions on


prepayment.  Petitioners' contracts claims accrued at the


time of that present breach.


QUESTION:  Well, was -- do you -- do you concede


or should we take this case on the assumption that there


was a contract?  Do -- do we --

 MR. ROBERTS:  We're -- for --


QUESTION:  -- do we assume it for purposes of


deciding this case? 


MR. ROBERTS:  For the purposes of deciding the


statute of limitations question, yes.


QUESTION:  And that the contract included a


right of prepayment.


MR. ROBERTS:  Included a right of prepayment and


not only a right of prepayment, because if the contract


just said you can prepay at any time, it like all


contracts would be presumed to be subject to subsequent


legislation.  So, the -- that right to prepayment had to


also include a promise that the Government wouldn't change


the rules and impose additional legal restrictions on --


QUESTION:  When I have my contract to pay a


million dollars when my ship -- when the ships with grain


come in, I say, a year in advance, ha-ha, I'll never pay. 


I'll never pay.  And therefore, I then have breached the


contract to carry out what I promised.


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  In that circumstance, it


would be anticipatory repudiation.  But -- but here you


have legislation, not a statement by a private party.


QUESTION:  So -- so what? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, two things.  One,


legislation itself alters the legal rights, and two --

MR. ROBERTS:  No.  The Government --


QUESTION:  The Government can always act by


legislation, can't it?


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor, and the


Government --


QUESTION:  So, the Government --


MR. ROBERTS:  -- can breach the contract and --


and be responsible for damages.  And we're not arguing


that -- that they can't. 


QUESTION:  So long as it does it by legislation,


it's okay.


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  No, no, Your Honor.  The


Government --


QUESTION:  I thought that was your point, that


this -- this breach is different because it was done by


legislation. 


MR. ROBERTS:  That doesn't mean -- that -- that


doesn't mean that it's not a breach, but what it means is


that the breach is occurring at the time the legislation


is passed.


QUESTION:  So, fine.  The legislation says, ha-


ha, we won't pay.  You know, I just want the legislation


to say precisely what the private person said.  Now, you

say we reach a different result because it's in the form


of legislation? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, one thing -- I'm just


curious to get into that a little bit -- is, I don't


understand why the Government is taking the position it


does, as well as what the position is.  That is to say,


wouldn't you, if you win -- and this will help me


understand it -- have millions of people who have entered


into contracts with the Government poring over every law


that is passed, and probably every regulation, to decide


whether or not that law and that regulation will somehow


10 or 15 years from now impact on a real estate contract


they have with the Government?  A whole industry of


anticipatory breach, not really, lawyers will develop in 

order to bring those claims immediately in the Court of


Claims because we might lose them later even though


everything would have been worked out. 


Now, if you can explain that to me, I suspect


I'll have a better time understanding your argument. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Okay.  What -- what we're -- what


we're asking for is that people who believe that their


contractual rights have been injured -- have been


infringed by a statute give the Government reasonably


prompt notice, in accordance with the statute of

limitations, of their claims.  And the benefit of the


ability to have a prompt accounting outweighs, in the


Government's view, any additional lawsuits that may


result. 


And we don't think that there will be a


significant number of additional lawsuits because, as the


Court was explaining before, there's an ability to sue


immediately on the anticipatory repudiation theory.  So,


it isn't that the petitioners -- or that the Government is


not going to be subject to suit or --


QUESTION:  But what would the damages be when I


haven't got the wherewithal to pay? 


MR. ROBERTS:  The -- the damages are that


petitioners had a loan that they allege gave them an


unfettered option to prepay at any time.  And after ELIHPA


was passed, that loan no longer had that unfettered option


to prepay.  And a loan that has an -- has an absolute


prepayment option is worth more than a loan with a


severely restricted prepayment option.  The difference in


the value of the loan is reflected in the difference of


the value of the property that's encumbered by the loan,


and it's -- it's easy to measure by comparing the --


QUESTION:  Easy to measure?  You -- you'd bet


your life on that?  I mean, the -- the reason -- the


reason contract law has developed the option of suing for

anticipatory breach as just an option is precisely because


it is often so difficult to anticipate what your damages


will be.  And so, it leaves it up to the innocent party


who hasn't broken the contract to either sue immediately,


if he can calculate his damages and get them, or to wait


until the -- the time for performance comes. 


And what the Government is doing with this


theory is forcing everybody who has a contract with the


Government to come in with -- with speculative damages and


hoping that some court will find a difference between the


value of this contract now and what it would be 50 years


from now.  I -- I think it's a -- I don't know why you


would want to impose this kind of a regime upon


contractors with the Government. 


MR. ROBERTS:  The damages, first of all, can be


measured, as I said.  Second of all, the -- the


Government, as reflected in the statute of limitations,


has a -- has a prompt -- has an interest in prompt


resolution of the claims. 


QUESTION:  Well, I'm not --


QUESTION:  I mean, anything can be measured.  I


mean, you know, my life expectancy can be measured, but I


wouldn't bet a whole lot of money on it. 


MR. ROBERTS:  That -- that's right --


QUESTION:  You know, you -- you can come up with

a guess for -- for anything.  But -- but the reason we


give the option to the innocent party is precisely because


it's a guess.  It may be, you know, an educated guess, but


it's a guess. 


MR. ROBERTS:  With -- with due respect, Your


Honor, I -- I don't think that's the reason why the law


gives the -- the option to the innocent party.  The law


gives the option to the innocent party so that the -- the


party has the ability -- the opportunity to convince the


defendant to retract its wrongful repudiation.


QUESTION:  But if -- if it is an option, why


should the innocent party be penalized by having the


statute of limitations start to run then?


MR. ROBERTS:  It's not an option here because


the statute is a present breach.  And -- and to understand


that --


QUESTION:  Well, are you --


MR. ROBERTS:  -- it's important to understand


the nature of the promise that's -- that's at issue here,


I think, and if -- if I could try to go back to -- to do


that.


QUESTION:  Yes.  I was going to ask -- I -- I


think it's consistent with the Chief Justice's inquiry. 


Are you saying that there's only one cause of action here,


or do you concede that there are two causes of action, one

for repudiation or anticipatory breach and the other for


the actual breach?


MR. ROBERTS:  Our position is that there is an


actual breach at the time that the statute is passed, and


it's a breach of -- of the promise that the Government


made that it wouldn't impose additional legal restrictions


on prepayment.


QUESTION:  Even though --


MR. ROBERTS:  It's different from --


QUESTION:  Even though performance is not yet


due.


MR. ROBERTS:  Performance on that promise is


due, Your Honor.  Performance on that promise is -- is due


throughout the life of the loan.


QUESTION:  No.  But you can make that argument


with respect to any contract that is ever made.  You're


saying there is always an implicit term that they won't


monkey around with the terms of the contract, and whenever


in anticipation they do so, there's an immediate breach. 


And if you follow that analysis, then in fact the


distinction between repudiation and anticipatory breach on


the one hand and actual breach on the other will disappear


in every contract, public or private. 


MR. ROBERTS:  No, Your Honor, because -- because


the -- the difference is between legislation and the --

and the role that legislation has under background


principles of contract law and other actions. 


QUESTION:  The background principle of contract


law is that we try to treat the Government and a private 


contracting party together. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And you're saying the fact that the


Government can speak through legislation, whereas a


private party cannot, alters that rule.  If so, then that


rule is going to have a remarkably short life because the


Government can do anything it wants to across the street


and displace the rule.


MR. ROBERTS:  The -- the distinction, Your


Honor, is that -- is -- is twofold.  The legislation


changes the legal rights and so there isn't an ability


anymore to perform. 


QUESTION:  Why does it change the legal rights


if the contract exists?  It may -- it may convert one


right into a -- a right to damages as opposed to a right


to performance, but the theory of contract is that by


repudiation you can't just change the legal rights.


MR. ROBERTS:  It does -- it does exactly that. 


That's what I mean by changing the legal rights, that it


changes -- there's no longer a -- a right to performance. 


There's only a right to the damages.  If it was a contract

 QUESTION:  All right.  If that is so, then


exactly the same thing is true in a private contract when


there has been an anticipatory breach.


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  No, Your Honor, there might


be a right to specific performance if it was the kind of


contract that you could specific performance, but we would


submit that you couldn't get specific performance once the


Government --


QUESTION:  How does the fact that you cannot --


MR. ROBERTS:  -- precluded the performance by


law.  You could only get damages. 


QUESTION:  Let's assume you're right.  How does


the fact that you may not get specific performance against


the Government affect the right to damages, which you 


perfectly can get against the Government, as -- as against


any other private contract?


MR. ROBERTS:  The -- what it does is show that


there's -- that there's a change and an -- an injury right


at the time that the legislation is passed. 


QUESTION:  Then that gets back to the original


point.  If that's so, then the same argument is going to


apply in every contract, public or private.


MR. ROBERTS:  It -- it's not going to apply in a


private context because there isn't going to be a breach

by virtue of -- of legislation unless there's a promise by


the private party that --


QUESTION:  You -- you have invented --


MR. ROBERTS:  -- that the laws aren't going to


change. 


QUESTION:  I understand.  You have invented a


promise that I won't change the laws.  You can invent in


-- in private contracts an implicit promise that I will


not repudiate, and therefore, when you repudiate


anticipatorily, you have broken the contract and, bingo,


there is a breach of contract and you must sue at once.


MR. ROBERTS:  You -- you have --


QUESTION:  You no longer have the option.


MR. ROBERTS:  You have --


QUESTION:  You could do it.  I mean, it's just


-- you know. 


MR. ROBERTS:  You have no need to invent that. 


You have no need to -- to have that additional promise in


the private contract because -- because there isn't the


presumption.  There -- there isn't the presumption in that


circumstance that the contract is subject to legislation


even though the Government is -- has the ability to


legislate. 


QUESTION:  I see your point. 


QUESTION:  Well, what is -- what is your

authority for the proposition that the -- an -- an


anticipatory breach not accepted by the other party starts


the statute of limitations running?  I mean, what case?


MR. ROBERTS:  My -- my argument is not that this


is an anticipatory breach.  The -- our -- our principal


submission is that this is a present breach, but -- but


it's a present breach of a promise that the Government --


QUESTION:  What --


MR. ROBERTS:  -- that has to be there in a


contract with the Government because of the


Government's --


QUESTION:  What if we disagree with you that


it's a present breach?  Do you still say that an


anticipatory breach starts the statute running?


MR. ROBERTS:  That -- that's not our principal


submission.  We -- but you could read the statute -- you


could read the statute that providing first accrues to


mean that the first -- that when a plaintiff can first


bring suit, that that's when the statute of limitations


starts to run --


QUESTION:  Even though that's not the law as


between private parties. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, given the principles of


sovereign immunity and the principle that the statute


should be narrowly construed.  But -- but --

 QUESTION:  But that -- that narrow construction


notion, or construed strictly notion, applies to deciding


whether there's a waiver by the Government of any


privilege of sovereign immunity.  And once we've decided


yes, the Government did waive it, the Government has said


it can be sued, we don't continue to look at every issue


and say, oh, it's the Government, we're going to strictly


construe it somehow. 


MR. ROBERTS:  The Court -- the Court has held


several times that statutes of limitations, as conditions


on the Government's waiver of its sovereign immunity,


should themselves be -- be narrowly construed and has


applied it in -- in cases, for instance, involving a


situation where a private party claimed that the


limitations period didn't run until an administration --


administrative determination had been made that there


wouldn't be -- that there was a -- was a loss and --


QUESTION:  Well, in this sense -- in this sense,


the Government actually needs less protection than the


private party because the Government at least is in the


position where it can always pass a statute of


limitations --


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, the Government --


QUESTION:  -- which -- and if you're -- you're


concerned about your liability 50 years out or something,

I suppose you could pass a statute of limitations.


MR. ROBERTS:  The Government can do that and has


done it here, and the statute of limitations provides that


when the action first accrues, there are 6 years to sue.


And if -- if --


QUESTION:  Well, but again, I'm back to the


problem.  It -- it seems to me that on contract law there


are two causes of action, anticipatory repudiation,


anticipatory breach, and breach.  And you're conflating


the two.


MR. ROBERTS:  In the -- in the ordinary


situation, if a private party -- let's -- if -- if I may,


let's -- can I pose a hypothetical?  If -- if a -- if a


private party had promised that you could prepay, that the


other party could prepay at any time, and Congress passed


a statute that imposed restrictions on prepayment, that


statute would be neither an anticipatory repudiation or a


breach, but would provide a discharge. 


And -- but if the private party had promised,


subsidiary to the promise that it would be prepaid at any


time, that there -- that notwithstanding passage of


legislation, that if -- if there was legislation passed


that -- that -- excuse me -- that the private party had


promised that legislation wouldn't be passed or had


promised to indemnify, notwithstanding the passage of

legislation, then there would be a breach at the time the


legislation is passed. 


And the Government has to make that promise, and


petitioners have alleged that the Government made that


promise here.  That's what -- that's what they lost on the


summary judgment motion in the -- in the lower court about


on the merits --


QUESTION:  I see that.  I think I understand


your argument.  It doesn't work with the private party. 


Your analogy isn't so great because it's not the private


party who can pass the law. 


But I think your argument is that unlike private


contracts, many, many, many Government contracts have the


following problem in them which was in Mobil.  Are the


parties here saying that if Congress passes a law, that


that -- all bets are off?  Are they saying the Government


promises to do this, Congress's law to the contrary in the


future notwithstanding?  What's the promise? 


And here you're saying the promise was in their


view we will do this irrespective of Congress's new law


and their -- your view is, no, it was conditioned on


Congress not passing a law.  Is that right?  Or maybe I


have it backwards.  But you're -- you're saying that in


Government contracts, there is a promise and there is an


issue whether the Government means that promise

irrespective of what Congress does in the future.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  That --


QUESTION:  That's an issue.


MR. ROBERTS:  That's an issue, and then there's


a separate --


QUESTION:  And therefore, they're saying what


the Government meant was irrespective of what Congress


does, and you're saying no, it meant only if Congress


doesn't do to the contrary. 


MR. ROBERTS:  On -- on the merits -- on the


merits, yes.  But -- but --


QUESTION:  On the merits.  And you're saying


that kind of a contract issue is breached when Congress


passes the law to the contrary. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.  And that's special for


Government. 


And now all I would like on that is:  A, does


that apply to administrative regulations too; and B,


what's the authority for that? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Okay.  It would apply to


administrative regulations if -- if that was the -- the


issue whether the promise -- if -- if the issue was there


wouldn't be regulations -- different regulations that


imposed restrictions on prepayment.  It would apply to

that and it would be breached at the time the regulations


were promulgated.  They have the effect of law.


The authority for that is the -- is the


background principle that's -- that's recognized in the


Winstar case, that's recognized in Bowen v. Posse, that's


recognized in --


QUESTION:  All right.  But if it's just a


background principle, I would worry about the practical


consequence being of people, particularly in real estate


contracts, having to study every regulation, every statute


in order to tell their clients what to do.  Real estate


investors are nervous people sometimes.  And -- and they


would say, my God, I better bring a lawsuit and the lawyer


would say, don't worry about it.  This condition is never


going to arise anyway.  Who cares?  And if it does, sue


then. 


Now, that -- that's the practical thing I brought up


at the beginning, and if we're trying to say what's the


right legal principle, I think that practical problem is


relevant.


MR. ROBERTS:  Okay.  And then to return to the


-- to practical considerations that -- that we think argue


in our favor on that side, that's because the Government


has a prompt interest in -- has a -- has a strong interest


in a prompt accounting of the costs of legislative action.

And it's particularly important that -- it's -- it's


important that, one, that -- that a Congress close to the


Congress that enacts a statute be able to address the


consequences of the enactment.  And it's also important


that Congress --


QUESTION:  Which it could enact by repealing --


MR. ROBERTS:  -- be able to cause a --


QUESTION:  It could enact -- the -- the Congress


that's close to the first one could say, okay, we'll


repeal it.  And that's, Mr. Roberts, one of the major


problems I have with your argument.  You seem to say that


legislation is magic, and you can't have an anticipatory


repudiation because when Congress has spoken, that's it. 


But in this very case, Congress goes back and forth a


couple of times. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  Congress can repeal the


legislation, but it doesn't change the fact that during


the -- the period the legislation was in effect that


there's an alteration of legal rights, and there's also,


if there was a promise that -- that the -- that the rights


wouldn't be changed, a breach during that time. 


And although Congress did -- although Congress


did repeal the statute here, it -- it's far less likely in


the ordinary situation that Congress is going to repeal


statutes than it is that a private party is going to

change its mind about its intention to repudiate a -- a


contract, and --


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. -- Mr. Roberts, in the case


in which the Government, we'll assume, doesn't change its


mind, your argument in -- in response to Justice Breyer's


question seems to boil down to something like this.  Pity


the poor Government as the contract breaker because it may


not know just how much damage it's causing.  Therefore,


put a burden on the people harmed by the Government's


breach of contract to run in in a hurry and let the


Government know early on just how much damage it has


caused. 


Why should the burden of the Government's breach


of contract be shifted entirely for limitations purposes


to the victims of the breach? 


MR. ROBERTS:  When -- when there's a present --


when there's a breach, the general principle is the


statute of limitations starts to run at the time of the


breach.  It doesn't wait to run until --


QUESTION:  No, but your -- no, but your


argument, as I understand it, is that because of the


Government's peculiar power to pass legislation, the


Government should not be in the position of the usual


contract breaker who may be subject to an anticipatory


breach claim or an actual breach claim later.  You're

saying the Government should be subject only to one claim


at the first moment that an anticipatory breach claim


should be brought.  And your argument for saying that is


the Government ought to have a right to make its victims


come in and tell it as early as possible how much damage


it has caused.  Why does the Government, simply because it


has a legislative power, have that kind of a moral claim


that the private contract breaker does not have?


MR. ROBERTS:  There's this -- there's a -- a


very strong interest in permitting the Government to -- in


permitting Congress to decide it wants to wrap up the


costs of improvident Federal contracts that they have --


QUESTION:  Then why don't we let Congress -- why


don't we let Congress survey through the departments of


the Government how many contracts it has entered into or


guaranteed and tote up the damages in advance?  The


Government has access to this information if it wants to


get it.


MR. ROBERTS:  The -- the Government doesn't know


who's going to sue, for one.  And so -- so it -- what this


rule does is --


QUESTION:  In other words, the Government may


get off a little cheaper if it puts the burden on the


victims. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well -- well, it -- there's a

dispute here as to whether the contract made this promise


or not, and the Government doesn't -- doesn't know how


that dispute is going to be resolved.  We don't believe


that -- that there was a promise that prepayment would not


be subject to subsequent legislation. 


QUESTION:  Well, certainly general contract law


is not -- you know, you could say it from the point of


view of general contract law, it's important that people


who breach contracts know as soon as possible how much


damage they've done, but obviously that doctrine has not


commended itself in the area of general contract law.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, when they breach a contract


and it's a breach, the statute of limits does start to run


and the rule is that even if the damages can't be fully


ascertained, that -- that the statute of limitations run. 


And that's true with -- if -- if there was a contract


between one party to -- to employ another party for the


other party's life and that contract was breached, the


statute of limitations would run at the date of breach


even though it wouldn't be possible with certainty to know


the length of the damages.  A -- a contract for a breach


of warranty of merchantability --


QUESTION:  I think it's so hard to look at this


as an actual breach if we take it on the assumption there


was a contractual right of prepayment on demand by the

borrower.  I would think normally you would wait and see


if and when there was a request for repayment -- or early


payment, and you wouldn't really know that, of course,


with a -- the owner of real estate who goes out and he


gets a low interest loan from the Government to develop


it.  Now, if interest rates decline below that low rate in


the future within the 20-year period, then he might well


want to go have early payment so he can get an even better


deal.  But if interest rates are going higher, there's no


incentive for him to.  I wouldn't think you'd treat it as


an immediate breach because the Congress attached new


conditions to the circumstances of the prepayment.


MR. ROBERTS:  Even under the scenario you posed


that -- that there wasn't an incentive to prepay right at


the moment, there's still a -- a change in what -- in --


in the loan that petitioners have, and it's a loan where


they no longer have that option to prepay with unfettered


--

QUESTION:  No.  As I read the legislation, there


still is consideration of the possibility of prepayment,


but there are some new conditions imposed whereby the


Government tries to assure itself that there will still be


a certain number of low-income housing units out there on


the market.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, Your Honor, but petitioners

here aren't complaining about the fact that they're


ultimately not able to prepay.  They're really complaining


about the -- about the restriction in the circumstances


under which they prepaid, and -- and that's revealed by


their complaint where not all -- even -- petitioners have


-- have submitted requests for prepayment.  And some of


them have accepted incentives with -- and withdrawn their


requests.  So, if they were complaining about not being


able to prepay, they would have gone through the whole


ELIHPA process to see whether they -- they could prepay.


QUESTION:  Well, apparently at some point there


was a request to prepay.  Right?


MR. ROBERTS:  Some petitioners have made


requests to prepay.  Not all petitioners have made


requests to prepay.


QUESTION:  The -- but -- but petitioners -- some


of the petitioners in this case. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Some have but not all petitioners.


QUESTION:  Have made a request to prepay and


it's been refused.  Now, at that point, presumably, we can


see a breach.


MR. ROBERTS:  At that point, there's an


exacerbation in our view of the -- of the previous breach


because it's an application of the restrictions that were


imposed and that were imposed, according to petitioners'

allegations, in violation of the Government's promise not


to impose them.  But --


QUESTION:  Could you seek declaratory relief to


determine your liability?


MR. ROBERTS:  At the time of the --


QUESTION:  The legislation is passed.  You're


concerned that it might cause some monetary liability some


years hence.  You seek declaratory relief that this is not


a breach of the contract.


MR. ROBERTS:  I suppose that the Government


could -- could do that.  I'm not -- I -- you know, I don't


know for sure, but I don't know any reason why -- why --


QUESTION:  Let's see if this is a quick analogy,


and you may not know the answer.  I promise you in a


contract to give you an option to lease my beach house


every year for the next 15 years, and I also promise not


to make a contract disabling myself from carrying that


out.  I enter into a contract with him that does disable


myself from carrying that out.  Is that an immediate


breach or is it anticipatory?


MR. ROBERTS:  An immediate breach, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  It is immediate?


MR. ROBERTS:  It's an immediate breach.  Do I


have something that -- that says --


QUESTION:  Yes.  I mean, that's pretty

MR. ROBERTS:  No.


QUESTION:  That's pretty analogous to the


case --


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  I don't --


QUESTION:  -- that you were bringing up.


MR. ROBERTS:  I don't think that -- that the


case -- I don't have a case one way or the other on that


proposition. 


QUESTION:  I think you'll find it's an


anticipatory breach.


MR. ROBERTS:  But -- but ordinarily --


QUESTION:  If that is an anticipatory breach --


MR. ROBERTS:  If you didn't make any -- any


other promise at all, it would be an anticipatory breach. 


I agree with you.  But you wouldn't have need to make that


other promise because the -- because it would be presumed


that you wouldn't take action that would -- you wouldn't


be excused by taking action that makes it impossible for


you to perform.  But -- but that presumption doesn't apply


in the case of the Government and legislation because of


the --


QUESTION:  And your whole case hinges on that,


that the Government --

 QUESTION:  -- is really different because of


this.  Now, if I believed that the Government -- and I'm


not -- I'm not saying I do -- that the Government was


really different for that reason, then this is a unique


kind of case and maybe we should have a different rule as


to when you have to sue.  I mean, if it's unique for that


purpose, maybe it ought to be unique as to whether these


people who don't know what their damages are at this point


have to sue right away or it can wait until -- until they


-- they submit their request for prepayment. 


If it's unique, we'll adopt a unique rule for


it.  Would that make you happy? 


MR. ROBERTS:  All -- all I can say to that, Your


Honor, is that -- that there are many situations in which


damages cannot be ascertained fully.  In fact, there are


situations in which courts have confronted situations


where the damages can't -- no measurable damages could be


found at all at the time of breach, and they hold that it


-- it runs from the breach. 


And the -- the policy arguments on our side are


the -- the Government's interest in a prompt accounting,


in being able to wrap things up and in not having --


QUESTION:  Well, but the Government has --


MR. ROBERTS:  -- to wait for 50 years to know --


QUESTION:  But the Government should want to

have some rules out there that would encourage it to be


able to deal with people on a commercial basis in some


areas.  You might want to be able to buy certain things


from the private sector or to engage in loan agreements. 


And to adopt the kind of proposal you're making


discourages anyone from dealing with the Government.  It's


a very peculiar rule. 


MR. ROBERTS:  I -- I don't think it discourages


them, Your Honor, because they -- they can sue and their


damages are measurable, and they can get the damages.  The


likelihood that interest rates are going to go up or that


interest rates are going to go down and -- and other


possibilities are -- are reflected in the -- in the change


in the value of the loans and they're measurable at that


time. 


And -- and if petitioners think they might be


able to prepay later, subject to the restrictions, so they


wouldn't be injured in that way, they can sue, get their


damages and then they'll be subject to the restrictions in


the program. 


And if they prepay and -- and the restrictions


don't prevent them in any way from prepaying or don't


impose any limitations on them, then they've gotten the


damages for what they've lost and they also get the


ability to prepay.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Roberts. 


Mr. Eckland, you have 2 minutes remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF H. ECKLAND


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ECKLAND:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  May


it please the Court:


The Government has not been able to cite to one


case in which a congressional statute has been treated


differently, in other words, that it constitutes an


immediate breach of a contract. 


In the petitioners' briefs, we have a total of


six cases that make the distinction between a


congressional statute as being merely a repudiation and


the breach not occurring until there has been some adverse


agency action.  In the Court of Federal Claims, we've got


Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases, Bank of America, and


Conoco.  The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Far West,


Schism, and Stone Forrest.  And two of those cases,


Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases and Bank of America,


dealt with the statute of limitations and have ruled in


favor of the petitioners' position advocated here.


Congress makes policy.  It directs agencies what


to do, and petitioners maintain that in that sense it is


no real different than a board of directors of a


corporation.  A board of directors can direct the CEO or a


Page 56

program manager not to perform a contract, but that


directive or that change in bylaw by a board of directors


does not constitute a breach.  It's merely a repudiatory


act.  The -- the breach does not ripen unless and until


the program manager or CEO actually fails to perform at


the time that performance comes due. 


Here it's clear that since the petitioners can


reach their central right of opting out of this program


upon prepayment -- and the statistics show that -- it


can't be that the statute is an immediate breach.  A


breach occurs only if and when the agency acts and denies


a prepayment request.


In closing, Your Honors, petitioners here


understand that as U.S. citizens they have an obligation


to follow the law and to know the law.  But here the


Government enticed the petitioners into this program by


holding out a 50-year option term, only to withdraw it


upon the time that the petitioners built the properties.


If the Government is not willing to give the


petitioners the benefit of their bargain, fundamental


considerations of fairness at least require that they get


the benefit of the doubt and that these ordinary


principles of law regarding the accrual of breach of


contract and takings claims should be able to be invoked


by the petitioners such that they do not need to file suit
