CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-94, William Overton v. Michelle Bazzetta. 


Mr. Casey.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. CASEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court, the lower courts in this case were wrong for


two reasons.  First, because the Constitution does not


give prison inmates a right to receive in-person visits


since that activity is inherently inconsistent with the


status as a prisoner and with legitimate penological


objectives and second, because the Michigan visitation


rules are rational and reasonably related to legitimate 

penological interest. 


The Court has recognized the right of intimate


association with certain people in certain circumstances


outside of the prison context in cases such as Roberts v.


United States Jaycees. 


In Turner v. Safley, the Court examined the


question of how to evaluate a right which is recognized


outside of the prison context and determine whether it


applies inside the prison. 


The right there was the right to marry.  The

Court said you should look at the elements or incidents of


the rights to determine whether it is affected by


incarceration or the pursuit of legitimate corrections


goals.  In Roberts, the Court also identified several


attributes of the right of intimate association which


respondents assert. 


These rights include a high degree of


selectivity and decisions regarding the affiliation,


seclusion from others, relative smallness of the group. 


Our contention is that all of the these


attributes are significantly affected by incarceration and


they are inherently inconsistent with incarceration.  And


so the --


QUESTION:  Well, does the right to association


while in prison survive in some form, do you think? 

MR. CASEY:  In -- the right to have the


relationship which is what was actually at issue in Safley


with marriage and in the Jones case with prisoner -- with


the union membership.  That status can survive.  There's


no effect on the relationship here.  What this case is


about is activity --


QUESTION:  Noncontact visits, aren't we talking


about here? 


MR. CASEY:  Noncontact visits but it involves


activities inside the secure prison walls in furtherance

of the relationship.  There's no impact on the


relationship itself, the question is, can prison officials


-- do the necessities of prison have an impact on the


right of association.


QUESTION:  What would exist outside -- what


relationship are you talking about? 


MR. CASEY:  The relationships that the prisoners


are asserting are family members beyond the definition of


the Michigan prison system -- has adopted particularly


minor nieces and nephews.  One of the problems with --


QUESTION:  Well, presumably children of the


prisoner are included, are they not? 


MR. CASEY:  Children of the prisoner are


included within the definition --


QUESTION: 


There are limited -- they have to be 

accompanied by, what is it, a legal guardian? 


MR. CASEY:  By a family member within the


definition or a legal guardian, that's the Michigan


regulation. 


QUESTION:  As I understand it, the regs


originally would have prohibited visits from minor


siblings of the prisoner and that has been changed by


statute; is that correct?


MR. CASEY:  There was a statute passed, right at


the close of the district court opinion that permitted the

Department to permit visits by siblings, the Department


changed the regulation to include siblings, minor sibling


visits, so that issue is no longer before the courts. 


QUESTION:  Excuse me. I'm sorry.


MR. CASEY:  Pardon. 


QUESTION:  On the class of visitor eligibility


then, what we're arguing about is nieces and nephew, minor


nieces and nephews? 


MR. CASEY:  That is the class with respect to


minor children, they also have a contention about former


inmates and --


QUESTION:  That's, that's what I meant.  What is


the State's interest in -- in restricting visits from


minor nieces and nephews of the prisoner? 


MR. CASEY: 


The prison officials testified 

uniformly that there were serious overcrowding problems,


prison management problems, concerns about safety, so the


overriding interest was to reduce the volume of visitors.


QUESTION:  So it's simply a means of reducing


volume?  There's nothing peculiar to the niece/nephew


relationship?


MR. CASEY:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  You just want to keep the numbers 


down and this is one way to do it. 


MR. CASEY:  To keep the numbers down, the

Department is permitted to draw lines.  And that is to


draw a line --


QUESTION:  Is it also of some concern with the


activities of children within the prison as opposed to


adults? 


MR. CASEY:  Oh, absolutely.  That -- there was


-- there is extensive testimony that not only was there a


problem with overcrowding and management, just because of


the volume in general, but particularly, because of


children. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Casey, I would like to back up to


go where you were when you were responding to Justice


O'Connor's question.  Do I take it that your position is


whatever rights there may be to have a relationship, for


example, by telephone call, correspondence, there is 

absolutely no right to any visitation, even noncontact, so


that whatever you permit is a matter of administrative


grace?  Is that your starting position? 


MR. CASEY:  Yes.  In response to --


QUESTION:  There is no right to visitation,


noncontact visitation at all? 


MR. CASEY:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  So everything that we're arguing


about -- you -- in your view of this is a matter of


administrative grace?

 MR. CASEY:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Do you have a fallback position from


that?  And if so, what is it? 


MR. CASEY:  The Court specified three issues and


the first issue is whether there is a right to visitation


at all.  Our position on that question is there is no


constitutional right.  It's a privilege.  It's not a


right. 


The second question was whether assuming there


is some limited right, are the Michigan regulations


rational and reasonably related to legitimate 


correctional goals. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Casey, would you explain -- you


have been very clear of what is your position about --


round one of this case in the lower courts, when you 

clarified that your regulations went only to contact


visits and then you came around and said it applies to all


visits. 


MR. CASEY:  The way the case evolved -- the 


regulations on their face apply to all visitation.  The


restrictions apply to both contact and noncontact.  When


the case was initially filed, there were motions for


summary judgment.  There was a 3-day hearing on that


motion and most of the testimony that was introduced


related to contact visitation.  So when the case first

went to the court of appeals, the court of appeals


mistakenly viewed the case as relating only to contact


visitation. 


QUESTION:  Well, I got the impression that the


State had represented that they -- that they covered only


contact visitation? 


MR. CASEY:  There were statements in the brief


referring to contact visitation, largely because that was


the evidence that was adduced at the summary judgment


proceeding.  But the complaint challenged the regulations


in their entirety.  And the parties, I believe, understood


that it applied to both contact and noncontact. 


QUESTION:  But the Court thought it only applied


to contact visitation --


MR. CASEY: 


In the court of appeals' first 

opinion it held that it applied only to contact.  Then it


went back to the district court and then we had longer


trial, more elaborative evidentiary proceeding. 


QUESTION:  In the district court the first time


around the district court didn't think it was limited to


contact? 


MR. CASEY:  The district court dismissed the


complaint in its entirety on our motion.  There was no


misrepresentation.  There may have been some unintentional


statements which led the court of appeals to conclude in

the first view --


QUESTION:  But the district court understood


that it was dismissing the complaint with respect to any


visitation, contact and noncontact, or we just don't know?


MR. CASEY:  The first order of the district


court dismissed the complaint in its entirety.  And the


complaint, the initial complaint, did not say we are


challenging only contact.  The -- as I say, because of the


way the summary judgment evidence went in, it evolved that


the -- the court of appeals thought it was related only to


contact.  But the rules on their face don't make a


distinction between contact and noncontact. 


QUESTION:  May I ask this question? The rules as


I understand are at page 174 of the appendix of the cert


petition and they don't tell us anything, at least I 

couldn't find anything, about the number of visits a


person can have or how often.  Do the rules regulate that


the number of times a particular visitor may visit an


inmate? 


MR. CASEY:  Yes.  At page 111 of the joint


appendix, there's a memorandum that was issued in April of


1995, which sets out hours of visitation for different


institutions -- it varies between institutions. 


QUESTION:  111 of the joint appendix? 


MR. CASEY:  Of the joint appendix.

 QUESTION:  I see. 


MR. CASEY:  Yes.  And it varies -- excuse me,


Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  It limits the number at any one time. 


But does it limit, you know, you can only have so many


visitors a month? 


MR. CASEY:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Why isn't that sufficient to solve


the problem of overcrowding and too many -- too many


people?  If -- if you have too many people, an easy way to


solve it is just to reduce the number of visits each one


of the inmates is allowed to have per month. 


MR. CASEY:  That would have been one solution.


The Department chose a solution where they evaluated the


visitors and concluded that it would be best to make 

quality visits for close family members following


essentially --


QUESTION:  Is there any evidence they found out


how many nephews and nieces would be excluded by the rules


and, therefore, worked that into the quantity


determination, that's a strange way to regulate quantity.


MR. CASEY:  They did not know in advance how


many nieces and nephews.  We simply don't keep that kind


of record. 


QUESTION:  Is there a specific anti-niece -- I

didn't understand this case, I guess.  I thought there's a


simple determination by the prison authorities, we don't


want children in the room, period.  Now, we'll make an


exception for that if they're your children. 


MR. CASEY:  That's essentially what they did. 


QUESTION:  And the reason had nothing to do --


it had something to do with a lot of people, but basically


they think children are more dangerous to the child or


more disruptive, because they're younger, harder to


discipline, they might run around in the room.  They might


learn things that -- that they don't want children exposed


to the language or behavior of the prisoners, et cetera.


So I just thought it was -- now maybe you're telling me,


no no, that's not the reason it was totally different. 


MR. CASEY:  No. That's --


QUESTION:  This is quite interesting to me. 


MR. CASEY:  No, that's one of the bases, it 


would possible to prohibit all children in prisons. 


QUESTION:  No, they don't prohibit all children.


They say generally children are more of a problem than


adults to have in visits. 


MR. CASEY:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  So we draw a line.  We say no


children except for your own children.


MR. CASEY:  That's correct.

 QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. CASEY:  That's our position. 


QUESTION:  So why don't you defend it on that


basis, if that's what it is? 


MR. CASEY:  Well, I thought I was, I'm sorry if


I didn't make that clear, Your Honor.  The Department made


decisions on who is to visit.  And they said we are going


to permit visits with close family members, children,


grandchildren, at some point they have to draw a line, as


you've said, Justice Kennedy -- and they drew a line to


eliminate certain extended family members. 


One of the problems is -- is -- if the Court


finds that there is a right to visitation, the -- there


will be -- I suspect a great deal of additional litigation


on where those lines can appropriately be drawn. 

Michigan, for example, has very generous rules


concerning times of visitation, they permit visits on


evenings, on weekends and holidays, some States don't do


that.  If there's a right to visitation, I suspect there


will be litigation on --


QUESTION:  Is there any limit on the number of


times the same person can come in a given month? 


MR. CASEY:  No.  There -- inmates, for example,


in the lowest security level are entitled to eight visits


per month.  And the time is -- is not regulated either. It

depends on overcrowding and situations like that. 


QUESTION:  What adults are permitted? Suppose I


don't have any children, I don't have any spouse, I don't


even have any siblings. 


MR. CASEY:  The rule permits an inmate to


designate immediate family members as defined by the


Department and 10 other individuals. 


QUESTION:  Ten others, okay.


MR. CASEY:  Now, there are certain prohibitions,


former prisoners are prohibited, I think, unless they're a


family member and receive the warden's permission.  That


is being challenged here as well, but --


QUESTION:  In relation to the family, this one


last question, a child must be accompanied by an adult and


you cut that back from any adult on the filing of the 

affidavit to only an immediate family member.  Does an


immediate family member include an unwed father? 


MR. CASEY:  No, it includes spouses, but it


would include, it would include --


QUESTION:  But an unwed father would not be a


spouse?  This is the child -- the mother is incarcerated,


the child is brought to visit her.  Can the person who


brings the child be that child's biological father, maybe


even care-giving father? 


MR. CASEY:  The child can visit if the child,

you know, is the biological child, but the child has to be


brought by a member of the immediate family. 


QUESTION:  But the unwed father would be a


member of the child's immediate family. 


MR. CASEY:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Although not of the mother's


immediate family? 


MR. CASEY:  That's correct.  Someone other than


the unwed mother would have to bring that child under the


rules. 


QUESTION:  The mother is in prison? 


MR. CASEY:  But someone other than the unwed


father would have to bring --


QUESTION:  The unwed father would not qualify? 


MR. CASEY: 


He is not qualified --

QUESTION:  Unless he's the guardian?  Unless


he's the guardian? 


MR. CASEY:  If he is the legal guardian, yes. 


QUESTION:  If he's the legal guardian, he would?


MR. CASEY:  Yes.  If the mother, the custodial


parent, has gone through legal guardianship. 


QUESTION:  That's enough family relationship


despite the lack of the wedding bond, he would probably be


the guardian, I would guess, wouldn't he? 


MR. CASEY:  The guardian in fact, perhaps, but

the Department is permitted to insist on enough evidence

case is about drawing lines, and the prison officials here


drew reasonable lines based on a perception that they


observed in --


QUESTION:  This is a facial challenge not as an


as-applied?  Would an as-applied challenge be possible,


assuming we recognize some right of visitation? 


MR. CASEY:  These rules could be challenged as


an -- on an as-applied basis but we did go through a


complete trial on the merits here.  There is evidence.


Our position is we submitted evidence to


demonstrate the reasonable relationship under Turner v.


Safley.  So if there is a right, then we satisfied the


requirements of -- of permitting our rules to take -- to 

take a --


QUESTION:  A particular person brought this


action, did they not? Michelle Bazzetta? 


MR. CASEY:  Yes.  It's a class action.  Inmates


and --


QUESTION:  And she was an inmate somewhere? 


MR. CASEY:  She was an inmate.  So -- I have not


addressed the Court's third question, the cruel and


unusual punishment.  If there are no questions on that,


I'll rely on the briefs.

Mr. Lamken. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS


MR. LAMKEN:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it


please the Court.  The right asserted here for inmates to


receive in-person visits other than those permitted by


Corrections Department rules is consistent neither with


inmate status nor with the legitimate penological


interests underlying Michigan's rules. 


QUESTION:  But, Mr. Lamken, you are then


agreeing with Mr. Casey that there is no right of -- no


right to any visitation, contact, noncontact, that what 

right -- what privilege is extended is a matter of


administrative grace? 


MR. LAMKEN:  That is our initial position, yes. 


And we also have two backup positions. 


QUESTION:  On your initial position, in your


view, under a scheme like this could complete discretion


be given to the warden to determine who gets the


visitation and who does not?  He said, you know, you


didn't really -- you've been looking sloppy for a couple


of days so I'm going to take away your visiting

privileges? 


MR. LAMKEN:  Not necessarily.  The fact that the


Federal Constitution itself does not create a liberty or a


property interest in visitation, does not preclude the


possibility that State prison regulations or State law


might create that type of interest.  It could not be taken


away under --


QUESTION:  I know it isn't an issue here.  But


one of the reasons I'm asking is because if the warden


doesn't have complete discretion, then that indicates that


maybe there's some right that's either conferred by the


statute or by the Constitution.  You say the warden has


complete discretion? 


MR. LAMKEN:  The answer is not necessarily.  And


that is the Court would have to examine under the 

standards established by -- in Sandin v. Conner, whether


or not State law provides a property or a liberty interest


that can't be taken away without sufficient process. 


And that --


QUESTION:  As you read these regulations, does


the warden have the complete discretion? 


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, it's not a question of what


the content of the regulations are.  That was -- Sandin v.


Conner got rid of that inquiry.  Instead, the question is


whether it is a grievous deprivation or an adverse -- or

excuse me, an atypical hardship that is contrary to the


typical norms of incarceration. 


QUESTION:  And under that standard, do you think


the warden should have complete discretion to deny anybody


for any reason visiting privileges? 


MR. LAMKEN:  We think that's a very difficult


question.  If push came to shove, our answer would be the


warden should have that discretion but I should point out


that Bureau of Prison regulations and the State of


Michigan both provide extensive hearing procedures before


such rights are withdrawn.  And such that the type of --


for example, in Michigan, you can challenge the underlying


finding of misconduct if your rights are going to be taken


away for the minimum 2-year period ban that's at issue


here. 


And you get not only an investigation, you get a 

hearing, you get administrative review, you get judicial


review.  And we believe that those types of procedures are


certainly sufficient in terms of due process. 


The answer to our question would be if push came


to shove, we would say no, it could be a matter of --


QUESTION:  Then how would you distinguish the


holding in Turner against Safley pertaining to the right


to marry? 


MR. LAMKEN:  On two bases, Justice Stevens. 


First, marriage has or can have a religious, that is free

exercise element, and it also has an effect on property


rights and the rights to certain benefits outside the


prison context.  Neither is true of the right to -- of


visitation. 


Second, incarceration as a form of punishment


necessarily places a barrier between the prisoner and


those with whom he would otherwise associate.  The very


essence of the punishment is that separation and the


vesting of control over exceptions to that separation, in


the State and corrections authority. 


Marital status in contrast, such as free


exercise of religion, doesn't have the necessary


relationship to incarceration as a form of punishment. 


QUESTION:  But if you say there's --


QUESTION: 


Do all prisons allow some form of 

visitation for prisoners?  Isn't that a pretty universally


accepted practice? 


MR. LAMKEN:  It is a universally accepted


practice, that for certain prisoners under proper


conditions, certain visits, will aid in rehabilitation and


that is the accepted view and one that the Bureau of


Prisons firmly supports. 


QUESTION:  Right.  If you're going to release


somebody back into society, you don't want to cut off all


contact with family members or friends who might help that

person on release, do you? 


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, that, Justice O'Connor, is a


matter of penological philosophy, but not a matter of


constitutional right.  And as a matter of sound


penological philosophy, the Bureau of Prisons, for


example, does allow visits.  But it will restrict those


visits rather severely if the -- if the circumstances


provide.  And we believe that one --


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't the Turner/Safley


rule quite adequate here to deal with this? 


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, Your Honor, you could decide


it -- actually Turner v. Safley, as we read it has two


components.  On page 95 in particular, it says that an


inmate retains those rights that are not inconsistent with


incarceration or with the penological interests of the 

corrections system.  And so we believe that this Court


could resolve it under either of the inconsistent-with-


inmate status problem, which is to say that there is no


right.  Or it could go into the Turner v. Safley balancing


and determine that, in fact, Michigan's rules do have the


requisite relationship to legitimate penological


objectives. 


QUESTION:  But as to the first, if you're right


on the first point, which is what is disturbing about the


first point, a prisoner would have no right whatsoever to

any kind of visit or communication or association with


outside people, even if there were virtually no


penological reason for doing that?  And that's -- why do


you have to go that far? 


MR. LAMKEN:  Justice Breyer, I think part --when


you say communication, I wouldn't go that far.  We are


saying that --


QUESTION:  You say that because that's what's


that the cases seem to say.  Communication, association. 


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, in fact, what incarceration


cuts off and what the punishment of incarceration is is


the physical separation of the inmate from the rest of


society.  The inmate, for example, it's not inconsistent,


for example, for a corrections official to have authority


to give an inmate a furlough to go outside to work for 

example.  But it is inconsistent, for an inmate to say you


must give me a furlough to go outside because your failure


to do so interferes with my in-person associational


rights.  The very essence --


QUESTION:  You're thinking of cases where that's


justified what the prison is doing.  And if you win on


your first point, you better think of cases where the


prison is unjustified, but it still wins. 


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, I think the answer is, the


very essence of the punishment of incarceration is

separation from society and the vesting of exceptions


thereto in corrections officials.  That is the punishment


and that is the difference between, for example, a broader


right to communicate, which wouldn't necessarily be cut


off.  A broader right --


QUESTION:  You would say that even if -- even if


the prison -- even if the prison administration is


unjustified in refusing to allow the prisoner a furlough


out into society, even if a thoroughly trustworthy


prisoner, you'd still say he has no right to that? 


MR. LAMKEN:  Absolutely.  That is the nature of


incarceration as punishment, Justice Scalia. 


Turning to the Turner balance argument --


QUESTION:  So you say there can be solitary


confinement for life, if that's what the State wants? 

MR. LAMKEN:  Justice Kennedy, solitary


confinement should be distinguished from merely cutting


off visitors from outside.  And the answer to your


question is, yes, under certain circumstances, solitary


confinement for life would be permissible, but one would,


as the Court has pointed out in various cases, have to --


QUESTION:  Well, then under all circumstances


under your view? 


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, the barrier for solitary


confinement for life would be whether or not that's cruel

and unusual punishment.  But the reality of prison life is


that prisoners don't get to choose who their cellmates


are.  They don't get to choose who they bunk with.  They


don't get to choose who they dine with.  They don't get


to choose the institution in which they're incarcerated. 


Even though each of those personal choices may be


protected outside. 


QUESTION:  Well, presumably, the prison allows


prisoners to send mail? 


MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, that's correct. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  How about phone calls? 


MR. LAMKEN:  In this case the prison does allow


phone calls for outside, which are other means by which


general First Amendment community rights --


QUESTION: 


So a prisoner who doesn't know how to 

read and write and who has -- whose family has no


telephone, what are they supposed to do without a contact


visit? 


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, the Court --


QUESTION:  Or a noncontact visit? 


MR. LAMKEN:  The Court actually addressed that


in Pell, which is to say that that's not a problem unless


the State precludes the prisoner from getting aid in


writing letters.  And Pell actually addressed the specific


claim that the prisoners were unable to write.  And

there's no evidence in this case that the State precludes


prisoners from getting aid in writing or reading letters


so that they may communicate with the outside world.  But


the --


QUESTION:  Are you saying that there is a right


to communicate to that extent, or you've been candid and


upfront and said there's no right to visitation. 


MR. LAMKEN:  That's exactly the line we draw,


Justice. 


QUESTION:  Do you extend that as well to


telephone calls and writing letters? 


MR. LAMKEN:  No.  There may be -- there may or


is a distinct First Amendment and societal interest in


allowing general communications between inmates and the


outside world. 


In that sense it's important to 

distinguish between the two rights at issue.  One is a


substantive due process in-person associational right, and


the other is a more general First Amendment right to


communicate or like a more general First Amendment right


to free exercise of religion.  The former is what


incarceration cuts off.  The latter is something that


incarceration may limit but generally only to --


QUESTION:  But you would agree that the inmate


could be -- have a visit from his lawyer? 


MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  The inmate would

have a visit from the lawyer and potentially clergy as an


exception as well.  And that's because of the distinct and


hybrid nature of the right.  It's not merely an


associational right, but the right to a fair trial may be


at issue, the right to petition for redress of grievances,


the right to free exercise of religion may also be at


issue in the case of clergy.  That's why almost all of


these limits, except clergy and lawyers. 


Turning to the Turner balance, the Court below


invalidated the -- these rules as applied to noncontact


visits based on the principle that noncontact visits do


not raise the penological concerns that contact visits do. 


That was incorrect for three reasons.  First, many prisons


including Federal Bureau of Prisons' facilities, lack


noncontact facilities. 


The construction of new facilities 

is not the type of de minimis or ready alternative this


Court contemplated in Turner. 


Second, the portable noncontact booths used by


the State of Michigan separate the visitor from the --


QUESTION:  Are there any high-security prisons


that don't have noncontact facilities?  I know there's


some --


MR. LAMKEN:  No. 


QUESTION:  -- low security. 


MR. LAMKEN:  No.  No.  In fact, the Federal

Bureau of Prisons' facilities, if they are high security


or pretrial detention centers, they will have noncontact


facilities.  If they are lower security --


QUESTION:  Well, shouldn't we decide the case on


the assumption that we're dealing with facilities that can


have noncontact visits? 


MR. LAMKEN:  The facilities in these cases --


may I answer the question, Chief Justice?  I see I'm out


of time.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Yes, you can. 


MR. LAMKEN:  Okay.  The facilities at issue in


these cases are portable booths, which separate the inmate


from its visitor but not the visitor from all the inmates


who are having contact visits so they do not address the


problems of the child visitors having contact with 

inmates. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you Mr. Lamken. 


Ms. LaBelle, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH LaBELLE


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MS. LABELLE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and if it


please the Court.  The Court -- I would like to clarify


quickly the administrative proceedings before we got to


trial in this Court, because the Court asked an inquiry. 


We did have a 3-day trial and a preliminary injunction

hearing and at that time the Corrections Department


represented that the rules were only as to contact visits


and the Court, recognizing that there were some smuggling


and contraband issues, thereafter denied a preliminary


injunction and followed with the summary judgment, summary


disposition based solely on the understanding that it was


limiting -- these rules only limited contact visits.  And


that's how it went to the Sixth Circuit. 


QUESTION:  So there's nothing in the district --


in the district court's opinion or order that clarifies


that? 


MS. LABELLE:  No.  The district court ruled only


with regard to thinking it was contact and the Sixth


Circuit accepted it that way, when it became clear, when


it was sent down, that the visits were being applied to 

ban all visits for certain categories of people, we asked


for a rehearing in the Sixth Circuit, they used a


clarifying opinion and then said that, no, the


justification is given for limiting contact visits,


smuggling and contraband did not suffice for limiting all


visits for these categories of visitors. 


QUESTION:  Did the case go to the Sixth Circuit


twice? 


MS. LABELLE:  Yes, Your Honor. 


It went to the Sixth Circuit after a whole --

first on the initial preliminary injunction, then it went


back down, it was tried on the issue of noncontact visits


and the permanent ban.  The permanent ban, Mr. Chief


Justice, was not tried in the first go-around, because


they indicated that they had not yet implemented it in any


form, so it was not yet right. 


QUESTION:  Is that particular procedural history


significant in what we decide on the issues before us? 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that it is not


significant, only to clarify one point, the issue of


whether the siblings are before this Court.  It was after


the district court's decision that the Department chose to


pass -- that a rule was passed voluntarily allowing the


Department to allow siblings in, which they have, but they


have put a position throughout the case and up through the 

Sixth Circuit that they had the right, at any time, to


withdraw that voluntary choice to allow siblings.  So I


think the siblings issue is still very much before this


Court. 


QUESTION:  But their position is they have the


right to say no to all children? 


MS. LABELLE:  That's correct, Your Honor,


including siblings, children, that it is all a matter of


discretion. 


QUESTION:  So their position is not different

with respect to a child, a grandchild, a sibling.  They


say whatever we want to do, it's up to us to do in our


judgment and you have no right at all, whatever you get is


a privilege. 


MS. LABELLE:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


And I think that that is why the case has gotten


so far.  It is because that the insistence that families


and prisoners do not retain the rights of intimate


association past the prison door. 


QUESTION:  Is it unconstitutional then, and this


is why I'm reluctant to get this Court into a whole new


line of constitutional law -- is it unconstitutional to


send a prisoner from the East Coast to a prison far


removed from his family and friends? 


MS. LABELLE: 


Certainly not, Justice Scalia. 

QUESTION:  Why not? 


MS. LABELLE:  Because that is a collateral


consequence of something that happens to prisoners.  They


get moved.  They get transferred.  This Court addressed


that in Olim.  That's not what happened. 


QUESTION:  Suppose they do it for the purpose of


denying the prisoner the contact? 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that if they are targeting


the intimate associational rights at issue, if that is the


purpose that we are going to target the intimate

associational rights, then a fundamental right has arisen


and then it's a Turner question. 


QUESTION:  You're not targeting the rights. 


Their object is not to cut off those rights.  Their object


is to reduce the number of children in the room, to reduce


the number of visitors, just as in the other case, their


object is to use prison facilities that are more -- that


are cheaper, that are -- that are more readily available,


so they send the inmates somewhere else. 


But if you have a constitutional right to the --


to the visitations you're talking about, it doesn't seem


right to me that you should be able to be removed from the


people who could possibly visit you. 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that, Your Honor, what's


going on here is that the decision to slice deeply into 

the family and to make that decision as to who gets to


visit and who doesn't goes directly to, and that's exactly


what they did, they said, here are minors and we're going


to select out certain intimate associations, we're going


to slice --


QUESTION:  We're going to have to pass on one by


one nieces, nephews, grandchildren, illegitimate children,


children of -- one by one, all of these are constitutional


questions, on the theory, I suppose, that what is truly


stupid must be unconstitutional.

 MS. LABELLE:  I think you don't have to for two


reasons, Your Honor.  One I think if this Court affirms


that the intimate associational rights that are at issue


here do pass through the doors for the families, that you


will have Departments of Corrections exercising their


discretion and their expertise under Turner, which they're


allowed to do, something that is clearly not evident here. 


They didn't -- there is no expertise in their


decision. 


QUESTION:  What -- what is the basis of the --


is this some kind of a facial challenge to the whole


scheme of regulating noncontact visits? 


MS. LABELLE:  No, Your Honor.  I think that --


QUESTION:  What is it?  Is it an as-applied


challenge, of some kind? 


MS. LABELLE:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


With regard to the categorical restrictions,


they are challenged as both facially and as-applied under


Turner, because I think Turner is a very fact-intensive


question. 


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what happened to Mrs.


Bazzetta who wrote this -- who brought this action?  Did


she ask for all these things and was denied them? 


MS. LABELLE:  The -- Your Honor, the -- it was a


class action.  And she represented --

that she -- her sister wanted to bring in her newborn


child to visit Ms. Bazzetta and that would have been the


nieces and nephews which were precluded.  There were other


class representatives --


QUESTION:  But her sister wanted to.  I mean


shouldn't her sister have brought the action, then? 


MS. LABELLE:  The -- Ms. Bazzetta was denied the


visit with her niece and nephew.  Her sister was also a


class representative. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Bazzetta is the inmate? 


MS. LABELLE:  Is the inmate.  There were --the


class representatives were both the prisoners on the


inside and the family members on the outside who joined 

together to bring this action. 


QUESTION:  And what else did Ms. Bazzetta


challenge that had happened to her, besides the visit from


her sister? 


MS. LABELLE:  Ms. Bazzetta challenged only the


denial of her ability to see her nieces and nephew.  Ms.


Bunton challenged the ability to see her children.  Ms.


Barker challenged --


QUESTION:  Well, how -- how can one of them

challenging something different? 


MS. LABELLE:  We had class representatives, Your


Honor, that were certified as adequate to represent each


of the interests in which we presented to the Court. 


QUESTION:  Is the claim a First Amendment claim or what? 


What -- what is -- what provisions of the Constitution


specifically are you looking to? 


MS. LABELLE:  With regard to the categorical


restrictions on the minor siblings, children, nieces and


nephews, it is both a First and Fourteenth Amendment claim


of intimate association, and family association.  And what


we have said here is that the Department can make its


decisions to limit people.  They can do it either


neutrally by volume, they can say we're going to say


neutrally that you can only have so many minors, just as 

they do adults.  You can only have so many minors come to


visit at any time and we are not going to slice into who


-- who is your most intimate family member.  Or we can do


it with regard to the further-out reaches, which is they


can say cousins, I suppose, or even further, but they


can't go into --


QUESTION:  What, where -- where --


MS. LABELLE:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.

has already said that --


QUESTION:  Well, Roberts was a case involving


whether you can get into the Jaycees or not, not whether


you could get out of prison. 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that you're correct,Your


Honor, in that the Roberts edicta, which everyone has


relied upon in this case, is what I'm referring to.  But


Moore directly says that you have to protect certain


intimate family relationships and by anyone's


understanding of what it means to be family --


QUESTION:  Well, Moore was a zoning case.  I


mean, it had nothing to do with prisons. 


MS. LABELLE: 


It had nothing to do with prisons, 

Your Honor, but it did identify that there are intimate


associational rights involved in families choosing --


QUESTION:  But -- but when in the prison


context, we've had specific cases and have tried to


articulate some governing principles outlined largely in


Turner v. Safley about what the prison can do and not do. 


Should we just look to that case and analyzing this rather


than the -- some zoning cases and other things?

if -- further that if these rules, if this is not affirmed


it would be -- do great damage to the Turner case, because


what Turner says is when you have these fundamental


rights, that then you look to extreme deference to the


Corrections Department. 


QUESTION:  But Turner assumes the question that


we've been immediately discussing, that there is a


fundamental right.  Before you get to the Turner


questions, you have to establish that there is a -- a


right to -- to -- to visitation in prison.  If you talk


about intimate -- the right to intimate family


association, I suppose there is no more stronger right to


intimate family association than the right of -- of -- of


a man and wife to cohabit, and that's -- that's eliminated


in prison, unless you think that conjugal visits are 

constitutionally required. 


Do think that they're constitutionally required?


MS. LABELLE:  No, I don't think --


QUESTION:  It's a pretty intimate family


association that you're cutting off there, isn't it? 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that although some States


certainly allow it, it's not constitutionally required,


because there is two prongs of Turner.  One is whether it


-- it is inconsistent with incarceration and certainly you


can argue that people going outside the prison, the

conjugal visits puts certain burdens and may be


inconsistent with the general incarceration. 


QUESTION:  You can arrange for it. 


MS. LABELLE:  If every --


QUESTION:  You can arrange for it. 


MS. LABELLE:  You can arrange for it.  And I


think that you would not win under a Turner test with that


limit on that associational right.  But here where they


have impinged on the associational and intimate


associational right in such a way but if --


QUESTION:  Well, that's where we have --Mr. 


Lamken clarified that -- that there is a right of


expression, and that's why he said you couldn't cut off


letters.  But he maintains that there is not this right of


intimate association, that the right doesn't exist at all. 

So you never get into Turner v. Safley balancing.  And I


think your first job is to establish that -- that just as


a prisoner retains a right of expression, which can be


curtailed drastically given incarceration, just as there


is that interest and expression, so there is a retained


interest in intimate association, which can be shrunk, but


not totally eliminated. 


MS. LABELLE:  Yes, I think that's correct,


Justice Ginsburg.

recognized that we have intimate association rights, we


have companionship rights.  And although they may -- there


may be attributes of that right, that are necessarily


diminished by -- by having one member of your family in


prison, the many attributes of what it means to be a


family is not gone.  The ability to see your -- your


wife's face, the ability to see your child and assure that


you're --


QUESTION:  Well, all that is true, but I thought


-- I thought that this case -- it's much more complicated


than I thought.  I thought it was fairly simple, at least


in my mind.  I assume with you that Turner is the law and


there's some kind of constitutional right here.  But I


thought we had basically four regulations, one says no


children can visit unless they're your own children.  The


second one says no prisoners can visit unless they're in


your family.  The third one says that you lose those


rights if you're on drugs, you lose them for two years if


you have two drug problems.  And there was one other,


which -- if the children come in, they have to be


accompanied by an adult, okay?  And I thought that's what


the regs say and, in addition, there's another reg which


says, warden, if you feel you need to make an exception


for a particular visit, you can do it.  Okay? 


Now, that's what the regs were, the district

court said those are unconstitutional.  The court of


appeals said that's right and I would like to know,


assuming with you, that Turner is the law, what's


unconstitutional about them?  It strikes me as the most


reasonable thing to say that you can't have children in a


prison environment unless they're your own children. 


What's wrong with that? 


MS. LABELLE:  And I think, Justice Breyer,


what's wrong with that is that it's not the business of


the Department of Corrections to start making decisions


once you decide that family members and children can come


in, that to make decisions as to which family members are


close -- which -- for those people who are 18, 17, 16, who


have no children but wanted to see their only family


member, which was their brother or sister, the questions 

-- 

QUESTION:  They've now dealt with that, I take


it.  And you're saying that -- that we should decide what


is a totally hypothetical thing, whether a regulation in


-- are they seeking damages?  I take it they're seeking --


MS. LABELLE:  No. 


QUESTION:  -- an injunction.  The law is now


that they will let the family members in, if you have a


brother who's 2 years old, they can bring the brother.  So


-- so I would think that's pretty hypothetical, but any

way, I'll consider that.  What about the rest of it? 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that the question is


whether it's reasonable to slice off certain family


members and there's a penological --


QUESTION:  They say, sure, it's reasonable? 


MS. LABELLE:  -- interest in doing it. 


QUESTION:  Sure it's reasonable.  The reasonable


thing is we want as few children as possible.  But we're


not prepared to say, if they're your own children, you can


never see them.  That tome sounds like a reasonable thing. 


Why isn't it? 


MS. LABELLE:  Because it is total discretion on


what constitutes the family and who comes in and it


interferes with the fundamental right at issue here which


is --


QUESTION:  Can't they -- can't they regulate


categorically rather than just tuning it to each


particular family to say that your own children are in a


different class than siblings or nieces or nephews and say


one can -- I mean, the whole thing is line-drawn.  You're


going to draw lines or slice somewhere as you put it. 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that's true that you can


draw lines, and you can draw lines that are content-


neutral with regard to the family, because that's what the


concern was here, volume.  So you can say, you can only

have two minors, or you can only -- on your list, or you


can only have five minors visit or we're going to limit


the number or they can say, we are only going to protect


the recognized intimate associations which include your


children, your grandchildren, your siblings and your


nieces and nephews. 


QUESTION:  Well, of course. 


QUESTION:  You say nieces and nephews are the


same as a child, that I guess, that's a matter of


judgment.  And I take it I can imagine a case where a


person and who is a prisoner would have the same


relationship with let's say a foster step-child or


something that he's raised that I might have or you might


have with a natural child.  But that's why I thought there


is a reg here that permits the warden to make exceptions 

in unusual cases. 


Now, why isn't that good enough?  So that if the


warden turns a person down, where that is the


relationship, then that person could complain about it and


bring a lawsuit rather than striking down the whole reg. 


MS.re LABELLE:  The -- the record in this case


is that the warden had neither discretion or at least the


wardens that testified felt they had neither discretion to


allow minor siblings in and -- or do they have any


discretion whatsoever with regard to the permanent ban.

 QUESTION:  Of course, Ms. LaBelle, once you leap


over the -- the prior constitutional question, as Justice


Breyer has and go immediately to Turner v. Safley, we are


in the line-drawing business.  And it becomes a


constitutional question, whether it is unreasonable to


exclude an nephew or a niece or somebody who has this, is


as close to the prisoner as a child might be. 


Why do we want to get in this line-drawing?  Why


-- what is the problem here?  Is there any real risk that


prisons are going to arbitrarily and unreasonably limit


visitation?  Would -- would any prison -- or any person


trying to manage a prison without -- without a revolt


arbitrarily cut off visitation?  It seems to me a problem


in search of a solution. 


MS. LABELLE: 


I think that, Your Honor, they did 

arbitrarily here, they denied all minor siblings --


QUESTION:  Solution in search of a problem.  I'm


sorry.


MS. LABELLE:  They denied -- excuse me, Your


Honor.  They denied all minor siblings coming in.  They


restricted who can bring the child in to such an extent


that there were -- that children were no longer allowed to


come in to visit their parents.  They denied all


biological children. 


QUESTION:  What do you mean they couldn't?  The

children couldn't visit -- I'm now confused about the


facts.  I have a reg in front of me, by the way, which


says the warden may, quote, allow a single visit between a


person and a prisoner and a person not on the approved


visitor's list as long as it's in the best interests of


the prisoner and there's no threat to order and security. 


Now, why is it that that reg doesn't give the warden the


power to deal with unusual cases? 


MS. LABELLE:  The testimony of the warden was if


you were not on the -- the visiting list, Your Honor, you


could come in during the time that you were waiting to get


cleared.  But if by policy you were prohibited from coming


in, if you were a minor sibling --


QUESTION:  I don't understand. 


MS. LABELLE: 


The testimony of the warden was 

that if by policy you were prohibited, then there could be


no exception to policy.  There could be --


QUESTION:  He said there's no exception, if, in


fact, a prisoner has raised a 6-year old child just as


it's his own child, but, in fact, there's no formal


adoption paper.  So there's testimony that he would never


let that child in? 


MS. LABELLE:  There's testimony that -- that


there was no ability for wardens to make exceptions with


regard to policy decisions.  If, in fact, the person had

not yet been able to clear and be put on the visiting


list, but they were allowed, those exceptions could be


made, but, for example, the -- the prisoner whose younger


brother was begging to come in after their mother had died


and this was his only relative, the warden testified she


could not make an exception to that. 


QUESTION:  I'm not concerned -- although I


believe you also said that there were -- their own


children weren't allowed in.  What's the example of that?


MS. LABELLE:  The example of that was actually


that there was -- some testimony with regard to Justice


Ginsburg's example with regard to the -- the father of the


child who was unwed could not -- and who had custody of


the child but was not the legal guardian could not bring


the child in to visit. 


There are many --


QUESTION:  No -- so, in other words, you have to


be the legal guardian of the child if it's not your child,


in order to have a visit? 


MS. LABELLE:  If you were not -- no.  Even if it


is your child, your biological child, you must be the


legal guardian, if you are not married.  So that if you're


not married, you cannot bring -- the parent can't bring


the child in to visit the other parent, unless you go


through the full legal guardianship proceedings.  And --

 QUESTION:  The relationship that counts is the


relationship to the prisoner, not to the child? 


MS. LABELLE:  Correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And the unwed parent would not be


related to the prisoner, but you have on that list, let's


assume we're past the basic question and there is some


constitutional right, you have on the list a person whose


parental rights have been terminated, and you would allow


that person a right that doesn't exist outside the prison,


in other words, once a parental relationship has been


terminated, there is no visitation right, according in the


larger society, but you would say that it's arbitrary in


the prison setting to deny that?


MS. LABELLE:  I think -- yes, Your Honor.  I


think because it's not a right to visit, you do have a 

right on the outside to that intimate association.  If --


and here, I mean you're not precluded from intimate


association with your biological child and the parent, the


legal parent, can make a decision can make a decision as


to whether --


QUESTION:  Well, then it's no right of yours, if


-- if you -- if the legal parent wants to allow someone


with no parental rights, but you've -- as far as the law


is concerned, as far as any right is concerned, a person


who has -- whose parental rights have been terminated is a

stranger to the child.  And it's one thing to talk about


what would be reasonable for a prison to do.  But I don't


know how you get any right with respect to someone who has


no right outside the prison? 


MS. LABELLE:  I think the protection for


intimate association on the outside is not limited to


legal relationships.  In here are legal parents on the


outside who are members of this class, and who were class


representatives saying, listen, the adoption here was an


open adoption. 


We all agreed that this child, in the best


interests of this child, that it should see it -- his or


her natural parent.  And I'm making a decision that it's


in the best interests of this child to come in and visit. 


And it's the prison saying -- and I have to say the prison 

didn't say there's some reason for us to do this.  They


said we never thought about it.  We really --


QUESTION:  So this case -- this case, in other


words, it sounds to me from having listened to it and


looked at it a little bit, it's a kind of litigation


problem, I mean, there's a long litigation history here of


contention.  And perhaps extreme positions. 


But given that, is it up to us to say, could we


say, look, on their face, these regs are okay, under


Turner?  If they're not -- if they're being applied in a

way that makes really very little sense, let the


individual who has this unusual situation of the, you


know, adopted child or something like that, let him ask


for the visit, let him ask for an exception to be made, if


necessary, and then if that doesn't happen, and I would


imagine normally, if calm prevails, it would happen, but


if it didn't happen, then he could bring his case.  Or if


there is such a person in this case, you could proceed


with that person. 


MS. LABELLE:  Your Honor, assuming the right


that exists and we go to Turner --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MS. LABELLE:  -- I think there has to be some


reasonable justification for infringing on the right.  In


the case of, for example, the biological children, the 

guardianship -- which is not just one, Your Honor, but 20


percent of the women in prison have their kids in foster


care or people who cannot bring them.  We're not talking


about one or two.  We're talking about hundreds of people


here. 


To the extent that they have any reason, but


what they said is we just didn't think about it.  They


didn't exercise their expertise. 


QUESTION:  Ms. LaBelle, are you asking them to


exercise their expertise on a subcategory of children

basis?  Or are you saying as -- is your real point


something you mentioned a moment ago, that once they make


a decision to allow child visitation, they've got to


restrict it?  If they restrict it at all on what you call


-- I think you called a content-neutral basis.  And I


believe you meant by that they can put a number on it,


only X number of children in Y period of time or something


like that, but they cannot -- I thought you were saying --


determine subcategories of children who will be privileged


and others that will not be. 


That would be one answer to Justice Breyer and


one answer I guess to the problem that we've all got about


how are we going to manage this litigation if -- if we've


got to do it on a case-by-case basis.  Is -- is your basic


position the so-called content-neutral position?  All you


can regulate is number once you allow any in? 


MS. LABELLE:  Yes, because that was the concern


articulated.  If, in fact -- I suppose there could be one


exception.  If in fact, there was some evidence of a -- of


a wild minor sibling smuggling ring and there was some


basis to target certain individuals, they could do it. 


But what they said --


QUESTION:  Well, then you would say the burden


would be on the -- on the prison to say despite the number


regulation, this one can't get in as opposed to the burden

on the prisoner saying despite your regulation, an


exception ought to be made for me?  You're switching the


burden? 


MS. LABELLE:  Correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, so --


QUESTION:  What is your authority for -- in


cases from this Court, say, for the content neutral


principle? 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that the -- the authority


is -- is Turner itself, because what they said --


QUESTION:  Does it say something about being


content-neutral? 


MS. LABELLE:  No, but it did say what you have


to do is compare the rationale for the regulation that


infringes, you have to see if there's a reasonable 

penological purpose, are there alternatives and look at


the balancing. 


QUESTION:  Well, do you think that's fair?  You


think that's fair?  I have children that want to visit me. 


They are my children in -- in a stable wedlock situation,


they can't visit, because we've adopted an absolute number


of children and and some of my coprisoners whose nieces


and nephews want to visit, they have been visiting, so I


can't see my kids?  Does that seem fair to you? 


MS. LABELLE:  The -- the rules themselves, the

time, place and manner restriction. 


QUESTION:  Well, you want an absolute number. 


Kids are kids.  So since some of my coprisoners are seeing


nieces and nephews, I can't see my children.  There are


just too many. 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that that wouldn't occur,


Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  It wouldn't occur? 


MS. LABELLE:  Because, first if, in fact, you


limited the number of children down to such a minuscule


amount of minors that had no relationship with their


concerns with --


QUESTION:  Well, it would be anything under nine


just on --


QUESTION: 


You put me in prison, you got big 

troubles. 


MS. LABELLE:  But they allow that amount, Your


Honor.  What they said was we need to reduce volume by 10


to 15 percent.  And we had absolutely no problem with the


time, place and manner restrictions it did so.  What they


did by this sort of overbreadth and basically because they


felt there were no rights at issue here, they reduced it


over 50 percent. 


There's -- I think that you have to look to see


if there's a reasonable relationship here.

QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you


off.  Finish your --


MS. LABELLE:  No, Your Honor.  Go ahead. 


QUESTION:  How do you square your argument on


content-neutral with respect to child visitation?  With


other visitation that might be an issue, for example, one


of the things that's an issue here is the possible


visitation of other prisoners.  Would you say that the


answer to that is that once the prison allows any adult


visitation, the only limitation it can place as a general


matter is numbers, and, therefore, the prison would have


to object on a specific basis with the burden to establish


on a specific basis that the visitation of any prior 

prisoner would be deleterious? 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that the -- what they do


is, for adults, there's a 10 limit there. 


QUESTION:  No, no, just as a threshold question,


are you going to apply your -- your content neutral-


theory across the board to adults, as well as children? 


MS. LABELLE:  Yes, absent there being a


rationale or a specific security concern, which is --


QUESTION:  And it would be the burden of the


prison to show that in a given case?

categorical restriction, it is their burden.  If they're


doing --


QUESTION:  I thought you were saying the only


categorical restriction you can make is visitors,


nonvisitors.  When you say you can have visitors, the only


further restriction is one of numbers given at least this


prison's rationale?  Is that correct? 


MS. LABELLE:  No, I think that you can have


individual requirements as many States do with regard to a


rational basis to say someone who has been out of this


prison for 6 months, we're not going to allow you to come


in, because it's -- there's a rational basis. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  If you're going to accept that


kind of categorization as legitimate, what's your basis 

for saying that in the case of child visitation, it's got


to be content-neutral? 


MS. LABELLE:  I think because --


QUESTION:  Or are you merely quantifying? 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that because there was


absolutely no basis, the only concerns -- I think because


it was a different -- a deference to the different


concerns articulated, the concern with regard to minors


was simply volume.  There was no articulation that any


particular group of minors raised any specific concern.

 QUESTION:  So you're -- so you're saying, look


we will take their rationale at their word, and if we take


it, this is the only limitation that they could put on? 


MS. LABELLE:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  And the limitation by the way


in --


QUESTION:  But if you -- but if you spread to


other prisoners, then you're going beyond the


constitutional right that you've identified as intimate


association.  I understand that for family.  But just a


friend who is an ex-prisoner.  How does that come with


intimate association? 


MS. LABELLE:  May I answer the question, Your


Honor? 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: 


You may answer the 

question briefly. 


MS. LABELLE:  I think that the general right


there was both a general associational right that you have


to companionships with loved ones as well as an equal


protection argument. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms.


LaBelle. 


MS. LABELLE:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Mr. Casey, you have 4


minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. CASEY:  I would just like to clear up a


couple of points initially.  This case is not about visits


from lawyers or clergy.  It's not about custody level. 


Persons can be or prisoners can be in minimum custody


level and still have these visitor restrictions.  So when


Justice Kennedy referred to solitary confinement, Justice


Breyer, excuse me, we're not talking about that.  We're


just talking about visitation. 


And Justice Ginsburg, I stand by my earlier


statements about the nature of the arguments in the


initial district court proceeding as it proceeded in the


first court of appeals.  The issue of a distinction


between noncontact and contact visits simply didn't come 

up in that -- -- in the -- in those district court


proceedings. 


QUESTION:  And do I understand your position


that you don't get to any Turner against Safley question,


because there's simply no right to beginning with, no


right that can be shown? 


MR. CASEY:  That's our initial position, yes. 


The limitation to contact -- or to noncontact


visits is not a panacea.  Children still present problems


of the -- they have unique risks and burdens.  When a

guard and a visitationer is watching a child, they're


distracted from watching some other visitation.  The


Michigan prison system, most facilities with multicustody


levels have one large room for visitation.  They have


tables and chairs for the contact, along one wall, there


will be vending machines and along another wall, there


will be one or two of these temporary booths.  And


noncontact prisoners are brought through the contact room


to that booth.  Visitors for the noncontact prisoner are


brought through the contact room.  There's ample


opportunity for exchange of contraband and visibility of


other activity that's going on in this one room. 


With respect to the argument about content-


neutral regulations regarding children, prison officials


are entitled to make categorical decisions.  The decision


here is that it's better to permit the quality close


visits based on a parent-child relationship, partly


because of limitations on time as Justice Scalia alluded


to, there were overcrowding problems before the


regulations were put into effect.  All of the wardens


testified after the regulations were put into effect, the


conditions were noticeably better. 


In closing, I would just like to emphasize, that


the -- the judgment of the corrections officials here was


a valid exercise of their informed discretion regarding

the conditions of confinements.  The courts should have


deferred to that, this Court has recognized deferral to,


deference to prison officials as an important factor. 


And in summary the court of appeals should be


reversed. 


QUESTION:  If you have a minute, I have one


factual question? 


MR. CASEY:  I would be happy to. 


QUESTION:  From the brief from the respondents,


I just want this clarified, there are a certain number of


prisoners who have families and they have children, but


they aren't legally married.  Now from the briefs, I had


the impression that visits are allowed by those children,


even though they're not legally married, unless parental


rights have been terminated. 


But from respondents' 

argument, I had the impression that you could not have a


visit from such a child, period, unless you went through


some formal adoption procedure.  Which is it? 


MR. CASEY:  The -- a child of a prisoner is


entitled to visit if they're brought by a member of the


immediate family or a legal guardian. 


QUESTION:  Whether they're married or not


married? 


MR. CASEY:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Thank you.
