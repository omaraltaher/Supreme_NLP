CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-954, the Office of Independent Counsel v.


Allan J. Favish.


Ms. Millett.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA MILLETT


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In the course of their investigative work,


Federal law enforcement officials, of necessity, routinely


come into possession of substantial amounts of highly


sensitive and highly personal information.  Sometimes that


information includes graphic death scene and autopsy


photographs.  Those photographs are taken for the limited


and restricted use of law enforcement and public safety


officials.  They are not freely available to the general


public as a matter of law, custom, or practice.


The question presented in this case is whether


death scene photographs should be broadly disclosed to the


general public under the Freedom of Information Act.  They


should not.  The Freedom of Information Act's purpose is


not maximum disclosure, but responsible disclosure, and


the publication of death scene photographs goes beyond the

bounds of responsible disclosure, because in the terms of


exemption 7(C), production could reasonably be expected to


constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy


of surviving family members.


In ordering the release of four photographs in


this case, the court of appeals recognized that that


substantial intrusion on privacy would occur, but it then


committed three errors in assessing the countervailing


public interest in disclosure.


QUESTION: Must there be identifiable family


members to suffer this invasion of privacy?  Would it just


be automatic instead?  The - a scene like this, you would


assume that there was someone?


MS. MILLETT: No, the - the practice of the 

Federal Government is that we need to identify the


existence of a survivor.  There was a case in the D.C. -


excuse me - District Court, named Outlaw, that I believe


was cited in respondent's brief, where the Department of


Defense had asserted survivor privacy without having first


identified a survivor, and that was held to be


impermissible, and as a matter of practice, because this


is sort of specialized application of privacy interest,


the Government identifies a survivor before invoking it. 


But that is often not a difficult job because the types of


records that bring the photos to us, law enforcement

records, military records when it's a military service


member who's been autopsied, will often contain, or allow


the identification, of family members.


QUESTION: And if you're so unfortunate as not to


have survivors, or to have survivors who don't like you,


the most embarrassing and gory photographs of your body


can be released?


MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Scalia, that has been


the practice after the Outlaw decision of the Federal


Government.  It - it's not inconceivable to me that


because you're talking about an objective test, at least


under 7(C) - some of these photographs are held - upheld


under - or withheld under exemption 6, which doesn't have


the same objective test language.  It's not inconceivable


that the Government could justify withholding, in a


situation like after the collapse of the World Trade


Center towers, and their substantial amounts of - sorry,


but, for the graphic nature - but partial remains that


can't be matched with particular individuals. 


But we know that for some significant percentage


of those people, there are a significant percentage of


survivors on a match for match.  In that case, I think we


would argue should not be required and that withholding


could be done because we -


QUESTION: But only on the assumption that there

are survivors?


MS. MILLETT: On the assumption that there - a


reasonable - obviously, a reasonable assumption -


QUESTION: I don't know why that's necessary.  I


don't know why you - you can't say, and I think some


courts have held, have they not, that - that there is a


privacy interest in the - in the person who's died?


MS. MILLETT: For the most part, courts have said


that privacy dies with the individual, but again, the


problem in this case is the Ninth Circuit didn't think we


were withholding too little.  It rule - it ruled that we


were withholding too much that - and that, in fact, when


there are known survivors, these - these disturbing


photographs still have to be released. 


And in doing that, 

they committed three errors.


QUESTION: Before we get to that though, on the


question that was asked, if there are no survivors, given


that the main rule of FOIA is disclosed, unless you fall


under an exemption, and exemptions are to be narrowly


construed, I don't think the - the Government could


suppose, could hypothesize an interest that may or may not


have existed in the decedent when there are no survivors.


MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that has


been the Government's practice, is to identify a survivor,


but again, I think our position is, because the nature of

our world has changed and we now have to deal with


situations involving mass deaths, that we aren't going to


insist when you have a large collection of remains and we


know that for some percentage of those there - there are


survivors, that withholding would still be permissible.


QUESTION: But why is that any less of a leap


than saying the deceased - the deceased's privacy is being


invaded?  Why is it less of a leap to say that the privacy


- the privacy of the survivors is being invaded?  It


doesn't seem to me that it's - it's their privacy that's


being invaded.  It's - it's their - their sensitivity,


various other things, but - but it seems to me strange to


speak of their having a privacy interest.  Surely they


have an interest in not having their - their - their 

relative displayed this way, but I - I wouldn't normally


call that a privacy interest.


MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Scalia, the common


law - a number of common law courts did, and they did -


and we cite - one of the very first common law courts ever


to recognize the right to privacy, in 1895, the Schuler v.


Curtis case, which is cited in our reply brief, found


exactly a privacy interest in the survivors, and it said


it is not the privacy interest of the deceased, because


under the common law tradition, privacy dies with the


individual.

 But what's being protected here is the


survivors.  It sort of takes three forms, first of all,


their - their memory of the deceased, their ability to


provide a dignified disposition of the body, and the


ability to have seclusion in their grief and repose and


closure.  And those concepts packaged together have been


recognized as a privacy right, both at tort law by a


number of courts, and more broadly, by custom and practice


in this country.  These types of photographs are not


freely available virtually anywhere.  A large number of


states, as we've cited in our brief, prevent their


disclosure or have restrictions on their disclosure.


QUESTION: Well, I guess we're, in this case,


asked to apply FOIA's exemption 7(C) to interpret it 

anyway.


MS. MILLETT: Yes.


QUESTION: Right?


MS. MILLETT: Yes.


QUESTION: So that's what we're focused on.


MS. MILLETT: Yes.


QUESTION: And what do you propose as the test?


MS. MILLETT: The test - the test is, as this


Court has - to decide whether a - a invasion of privacy is


clearly unwarranted, you have to weigh and balance the


intrusion on privacy against the extent to which the

information disclosed would, in this Court's Reporters


Committees decision, contribute significantly to public


understanding of the operations or activities of the


Federal Government.  And in this case, on one side of the


balance is a substantial intrusion on privacy, requiring -


exposing this sort of information out where family


members will see it, encounter it, where they will know


that their - that their loved one has not been buried in


any sense.


QUESTION: Is that the test that the CADC used in


the Accuracy in Media case involving these same photos?


MS. MILLETT: They used a - the same balancing. 


They recognized the -


QUESTION: So whatever you're proposing, you 

think the CADC correctly employed in that case?


MS. MILLETT: The - there - with - with one


qualification, which I don't think is a distinction -


don't think it's a distinction that makes a difference. 


Certainly on the privacy interest side, they agreed with


us that there's a survivor privacy interest and that that


has to be balanced under this Court's Reporters Committee


standard. 


Now, the D.C. Circuit has said with - when the


public interest that's asserted is substantial allegation,


or is unsubstantiated allegations of governmental

misconduct, that's not enough.  They require compelling


evidence of governmental misconduct to overcome the


presumption of regularity.  We've articulated the test is


clear as evidence.  I don't think in practice there's any


difference.  We've employed the clear evidence standard


because that's the standard this Court has adopted for


overcoming a presumption of regularity.


QUESTION: I'm - I'm - I'm glad you backed off


from compelling evidence.  It seems to me if there were


compelling evidence of Government's misdoing, you wouldn't


need the photographs.  If it was already compelling, the


photographs would - would not prove anything additional


and you would - you would reject it for that reason,


right?


MS. MILLETT: That may - that may well be.  The


compelling - the way the compelling evidence standard


works, as we understand it, and the way the clear evidence


standard works that we propose is not that that means you


get the photographs.  It just means that you have


something of weight on your side of the balance.  We think


the unsubstantiated allegations of governmental misconduct


are worth virtually none, if no weight -


QUESTION: But are the - does the term compelling


interest refer to the allegations that the person seeking


the photographs makes, or the evidence he has supporting

his position?


MS. MILLETT: It has to be the - the evidence of


governmental misconduct.  Empty allegations -


QUESTION: Independently of what the - the


photographs themselves would show?


MS. MILLETT: That - I mean, that presumably will


not be the evidence, right, you can't just come say that -


that would be sort of boot-strapping to say that the


evidence is the - I have to see that so that I will have


my evidence of your governmental misconduct, which


essentially -


QUESTION: Okay, tell me again what - what the


test is as you - you understand it.


MS. MILLETT: The - the test - you mean with 

respect to unsubstantiated allegations of governmental


misconduct?


QUESTION: Yes.


MS. MILLETT: That is that the FOIA requester


must come forward with clear evidence of governmental


misconduct on their own, independent evidence on their


own, to have a cognizable public interest to weigh against


the intrusion on privacy that has occurred in this case. 


And that is the standard that this - the clear evidence


standard comes from this Court's decisions, which say that


is the quantum of evidence needed to overcome the

presumption of regularity and legitimacy that attaches in


this case to law enforcement investigations.


QUESTION: Does the Government - does the


Government - as I understand FOIA, the Government has the


burden of proof, the Government presents an exemption and


it is the Government's burden to show that the exemption


applies, not the requester, because going in, am I right


to say, the requester can ask for this information for any


reason or no reason?


MS. MILLETT: That - that's - with respect -


until an exemption is triggered, there's no need to have


any reason for your FOIA.  You can have a good reason, a


bad reason, or no reason to ask for information, but -


QUESTION: So what is the Government's burden 

that it has, at least the initial burden is on the


Government to show what?


MS. MILLETT: The - the initial burden on the


Government is once an exemption - we have to show that an


exemption is triggered.  We have to, in this situation,


identify a cognizable privacy interest which -


QUESTION: Now, after you point to which number,


7, you point to 7(C) and that - that - the burden must be


more than just, say -


MS. MILLETT: No, that - that's right, in fact,


we get the written steps.  We have to identify a

cognizable privacy interest and then, before we make a


decision to withhold, we ourselves must make the - must


balance.  It's our job to do this balancing before we


invoke an exemption, so we ourselves will then try to


identify if we can from the requester's papers or on our


own what public interest would be served by the disclosure


of these documents. 


Now, it's not the particular interest of the


requester, but it's the relationship between this document


and serving the public interest that was identified in


Reporters Committee of revealing the operations or


activities of the Government.  So in this case, we looked,


we found a substantial privacy interest here, and then we


looked at photographs of a deceased body at a death scene 

and in our judgement, these reveal nothing about the


operations or activities of the Office of Independent


Counsel and - and -


QUESTION: Ms. Millett, you - you - you say that


you have to show clear evidence of - have clear evidence


of government misconduct.  What do you mean by misconduct? 


What - what has been brought forward here, at least, are


some disparities in - in various governmental reports,


which suggest that at least there was negligence or


sloppiness in some of the reports.  Is that enough to


establish what you mean by governmental misconduct?  Or

does it have to be some willful cover-up?


MS. MILLETT: Justice Scalia, first of all, I


don't think there's any evidence of negligence or


sloppiness here, but if we adopt that -


QUESTION: All right, well, we - we'll get to


that, I assume, right?  Okay.


MS. MILLETT: If we adopt that characterization,


the fact that someone cannot - can identify something more


that they should have been done, or the fact that - that


they disagree with the ultimate result, is not


governmental misconduct.  The type of thing that might


rise - that - that might count, is something that was - if


you had evidence that, you know, governmental


investigators had suborned perjury, and you had evidence 

in the form of -


QUESTION: Willful?  Has to be willful?


MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry?


QUESTION: Has to be willful?  It cannot be just


a sloppy job?  Why - why isn't that of interest to the


public?


MS. MILLETT: I don't - I - I don't think - well,


if - if they've got evidence of a sloppy job, then FOIA


has already worked.  They can - the purpose of FOIA is not


- it's not a 60(b) motion to reopen an investigation or to


make us investigate more.  It's to see - learn what the

Government did and then critique it as much as you like.


QUESTION: Okay.  Why - why then do you take the


- I'm sorry - why - why do you take the position that to


satisfy the - the - the condition of revealing the


operation of the Government, it's necessarily got to


reveal something to the discredit of the Government?  What


if someone came along and said, I think this was a superb


investigation, and the Government is far too modest about


what it has done, and I - I want the country to know? 


Would - would that support a claim?


MS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Souter, let me be


very clear.  We're talking here about the allegations of


misconduct because that is the public interest that is


asserted.  One might be able to -


QUESTION: Right, but if misconduct - my - the


reason I'm raising the question is, if misconduct does not


have to be shown, I suppose that would have a bearing on


the degree of misconduct in a case like this that would -


that would suffice.


MS. MILLETT: Well, a public interest has to be


identified at some point, and the problem with this case


is, or the problem -


QUESTION: No, but what about my question for a


minute?


MS. MILLETT: Right.

 QUESTION: Why is - why is it an illegitimate


public interest for somebody to come along and say, I want


to make the Government look good.  They are hiding their


light under a bushel.  I - I want the people to know how -


how fine they've done.  Why is that not a - a possible


legitimate objective under the statute?


MS. MILLETT: Well, I think that - that - that is


sort of nothing more than - than a desire to show what the


Government did in this investigation, transparency in


government interest, which is the point of FOIA.  But once


you've come to an - applying an exemption, you're going to


need something more on your side than just serving the


general interests that FOIA itself advances, because


otherwise, the exemption doesn't work as an exemption. 

You have to want - want something more than transparency


in government.


Now, it may not be that you have to show


misconduct.  You might be able to do it because there's


some other sort of acute public interest that's going to


outweigh it, but I think in the end, the public interest


in making the Government look good or telling the


Government - tell the public more about what the


Government did is never going to be enough to outweigh the


privacy interests of individuals.  You can do that with


the substantial amounts of disclosures that have already

QUESTION: Very well, Ms. Millett.


We'll hear from you, Mr. Hamilton.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES HAMILTON


FOR RESPONDENTS ANTHONY AND MOODY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. HAMILTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court: 


There are five basic reasons why the privacy


interest at issue in this case should be protected. 


First, the Foster family seeks to protect their own,


wholly legitimate privacy interests. 


The privacy 

interests here of the family are to be free from seeing


these photographs on television and in grocery store


tabloids, to be free from the knowledge that these


photographs are displayed in virtual perpetuity on


ghoulish Web sites that show death and carnage, to be free


from the harassment by the media that inevitably will


follow if these photographs are released.


Second, while FOIA privacy protection is


broader, there is significant common law authority that a


survivor's right of privacy is violated by showing


photographs of deceased loved ones.  The Restatement of

Torts recognizes this, so does Reid v. Pierce County, a


1998 decision by the Supreme Court of Washington, en banc,


which allowed a cause of action for displaying the autopsy


photographs of former Governor, Washington Governor, Dixie


Lee Ray, at cocktail parties.


Third, every FOIA case that has examined the


issue has found that in appropriate circumstances,


survivors have a proper - a privacy interest.  The Ninth


Circuit and the D.C. Circuit did so in the cases involving


these photographs.  There is a 1987 opinion in the D.C.


Circuit of Badhwar v. Air Force that does so regarding


autopsy reports, and Justice Ginsburg joined in that


opinion.


QUESTION: Mr. Hamilton, assume we agree with you 

on all of that.  We haven't heard anything about the other


- the other half of the inquiry, and that is what the


public interest is in - that might overcome that - that -


that privacy interest.  I'm sure the other side is going


to - is going to talk about that, the - the alleged


discrepancies in the reports and whatnot.  Can - can you


shed some light on that?


MR. HAMILTON: Well, Justice Scalia, we think


that there is no public interest on the other side.  We


think as - as counsel for the Solicitor General has said,


that there's a strong evidence test for showing that there

is government - government misconduct where that is the


allegation of the public interest, which is the situation


here.  A - a number of courts have said that the test


should be compelling evidence.  The D.C. Circuit has done


that in several cases.  The Fourth Circuit has done it. 


Other circuits have come to other standards in - in terms


of what the public interest should be, but it must be


something that is strong, that is not insubstantial.


Secondly, in determining what the public


interest is, the Court must be aware that there have been


five investigations, five investigations of Mr. Foster's


death, and all of them have found that he died by suicide. 


These investigations have released over 3,000 documents


over -


QUESTION: Yes, but it seems to me that the -


arguably, the interest in disclosure might not challenge


the ultimate conclusion, but rather they might contend -


want to show that one of the team of investigators was


totally incompetent, and it was necessary to have three or


four other investigations to reach the correct result.  I


don't think the ultimate conclusion necessarily answers


the - the claim that there may be some public interest in


how the investigation was conducted.


MR. HAMILTON: Well, Justice Stevens, the - 7(C)


requires a balancing, and when you have this balance, you

have to weigh whatever the public interest is against the


privacy interest.  And here, where there have been five


investigations, where the reports are voluminous, where


the documents released and the photographs already


released are voluminous, it is very difficult to see what


the public interest is in getting these photographs, which


would grossly invade the privacy of the family.  The other


point on the public -


QUESTION: Well, let - let's take a particular


item of evidence, I mean, like the - the autopsy report


that Mr. Favish claims was - was - was altered, that the


word neck was white - whitened out and head was written in


instead to - to cover the fact that the bullet exited the


neck rather than the head. 


Now, you know, what - what he 

and other conspiracy theorists would say is, the fact that


five investigations came up with the same conclusion just


shows the extent of this - this conspiracy, you know. 


They're not going to be satisfied by the mere fact that -


that you had five separate groups.  They're going to say,


oh, all the worse, all the worse, this - this conspiracy


is so widespread.  Well, how do you respond to that?


MR. HAMILTON: Well, I think the first response I


would make is that it is a difficult argument to make that


Judge Starr conspired with members of the Clinton


administration to protect that administration.

MR. HAMILTON: Judge Starr - Judge Starr's report


was quite thorough, it was over 110 pages.  He answered


this question about the - the - the medical report.  The


medical report was somewhat inconsistent, but certainly,


when you look at the autopsy reports, when you look at the


- the - the photographs themselves, it is clear that the -


there - there was a - an exit wound in the back of the


head.  There was no -


QUESTION: He might have been protecting Newt


Gingrich.  Did you ever think of that?

Newt Gingrich. 
 We really - we really don't know.

QUESTION: May - may I ask -


MR. HAMILTON: Justice -


QUESTION: - the - I wanted to ask this question


of the Government, didn't have the opportunity.  The


Government says there were three errors made by the Ninth


Circuit.  I assume the district court, under the


Government's test, does have substantial discretion even


if we - if we adopt the test the Government wants us to


adopt.  And my question is whether or not, rather than


simply reverse and remand - and reverse, we have to remand

for the district court to do this under the proper test?


MR. HAMILTON: Well, I would hope - I would hope,


given the full record here, that this Court would not


remand, that this Court would decide this issue.  It has


been, Justice Kennedy, 10 years since -


QUESTION: I - I understand, but as a - as a


legal matter, if the Ninth Circuit didn't apply the proper


test and if the district judge has to exercise discretion


in the first entrance - instance - whether or not we have


to remand even if we adopt the Government's argument?


MR. HAMILTON: I - I believe that on the record


before the Court, the Court can decide that there is no


valid public interest here, and that the interest of - the


privacy interest of the Foster family greatly outweighs -

QUESTION: So you want us to do that weighing?


MR. HAMILTON: I - I certainly do.  I want this


case to end at this Court, Justice Kennedy.  It has been


10 years and it is time to give this family some peace.


QUESTION: That was the initial position of the


district court, wasn't it?  In the - in the first round,


didn't the district court uphold the exemption?


MR. HAMILTON: The - yes, Justice Ginsburg.


QUESTION: So the district judge - what - I don't


recall what standard the district court applied in the


first instance, but it was the Ninth Circuit that - that

said, district court, you have to look at these and


disclose the ones that aren't, whatever that series of


adjectives is.


QUESTION: Yes.  That - that's my concern.  Is


there evidence that the district court used the standard


that the Government now argues for in the first - when he


- when the - Judge Keller first looked at this case, did


he adopt basically what the Government is asking us to


adopt?


MR. HAMILTON: Not - not exactly.  No, he did not


adopt a - a clear evidence test, but the district court in


the first instance, in his first decision, did weigh the


public interest against the privacy interest and found


that as to all of the photographs, the privacy interest 

prevailed.


I would like to - I would like to return to the


- the family's privacy interest and make one more point,


which is that law and tradition treat the moment


surrounding death as special, private family matters.  A


family generally has the right to decide how to conduct


its leave-taking and how to dispose of the body of a loved


one with dignity.  At a funeral, a family may choose


whether a coffin is open or is shut, and they have that


choice even if the deceased person was a public official. 


Here, the Foster family decided that the coffin be shut,

and to effectively open it now by disclosing the


photographs would be an unconscionable invasion of the


family's privacy interest.


In the Reporters Committee brief, the contention


was made that the invasion of sorts here would be minimal


and would impose no meaningful additional harm.  That


assertion is just simply wrong, and those claims ignore


the potent and the moving declarations submitted in this


case by Ms. Anthony and Ms. Moody.  These declarations


express what any family in the circumstance would feel,


and they show why law and tradition treat death as a


private, family matter.


Mr. Foster's sister, Ms. Anthony, in her


declaration, recounted her nightmares and heart-pounding 

insomnia each time she has seen the leaked photograph of -

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FAVISH


MR. FAVISH: Yes, Chief Justice, thank you.

phrase, personal privacy, as Congress used it in exemption


7(C) than what this Court said about that phrase in the

Reporters Committee case when it cited the work of former


Solicitor General Charles Fried and other noted scholars


on what the definition of privacy is: the right to control


information about yourself.  That's what I base this case


on.  I want you to stick with what you said on that point


in 1989.


QUESTION: The issue wasn't before the Court. 


There were no family members.  It was an individual, so it


was natural for the Court to address it.


MR. FAVISH: Justice Ginsburg, the definition of


privacy as intended by Congress in exemption 7(C) was


before the Court in Reporters Committee, and this Court -


QUESTION: But the - the Court didn't have a case


that involved, say, for example, what was presented in the 

Challenger case.  It didn't come here, but it did go to


the district court and the D.C. Circuit.


MR. FAVISH: I agree -


QUESTION: Are - are you saying that Reporters


Committee showed that that decision was wrong?


MR. FAVISH: No.  I - I agree with you that


Reporters Committee did not involve death-related


documents, if that's what you're saying.  I agree on that


point.  But Reporters Committee gave only one definition


of privacy as intended by Congress, and that definition


should apply to all circumstances in which FOIA requests

QUESTION: There's a tradition going back


thousands of years in human life.  You can go back to


Antigone, Euripides, every major religion, respect for the


dead, respect for survivors, and that runs through every


religion, through Greek myth, tragedy, and why isn't that


important enough to human life to believe that Congress


also intended to encompass that?


MR. FAVISH: I believe it is an important


interest, but Congress left no indication that it intended


for that interest to be protected by the privacy language


in exemption 7(C).


QUESTION: Well, if the history is totally


silent, why wouldn't we assume that Congress intended to 

recognize something so deep in human nature?


MR. FAVISH: Well, the - the legislative history


isn't totally silent.


QUESTION: No, I mean if they said, no, no, we do


not intend to respect this sacred tradition, fine.  But I


bet they didn't say that, and for good reason.


MR. FAVISH: They did not say that, but they did


talk about personally identifying details and government


agencies where person -

history?

 MR. FAVISH: From the legislative history, which


is at page -


QUESTION: Why don't you use the text of the


statute?


MR. FAVISH: Yes.


QUESTION: I would - I would think that your


response to - to Justice Breyer would be that the - that


the word privacy is not a - the normal way of - of


expressing those concerns for respect for the dead.


MR. FAVISH: I agree, I agree, and that's why I


cited what this Court did in Reporters Committee, and


those concerns are valid and those concerns should be made


to Congress in an attempt to get them to add another


exemption to the FOIA, if that's what the Government and 

the Foster respondents want.  We know that -


QUESTION: You've heard - you've heard Mr.


Hamilton mention aspects of how the revelation of


documents, pictures of the dead, can injure a survivor. 


Why isn't the word privacy broad enough at least to cover


that?


MR. FAVISH: That's not the way this Court


defined it in Reporters Committee.  That's not the way


I've seen it defined anywhere else except a few


aberrational cases, which by the way -


QUESTION: Well, one - one of the - one of the

definitions that I think we instinctively assume is the


very simple one that Justice Brandeis used, the right to


be let alone.  That is at the - at the heart of a lot of


privacy thinking in our law, and the right to be let


alone, I suppose, would encompass at least two things


relevant in this case.  One is the right not to be


assaulted by these photographs, which will be very


upsetting.  That is - that's certainly not being left


alone when - when you have to go through that.


And the second consequence, I would suppose, of


publication is simply even in the narrowest definition of


privacy, even apart from the Brandesian sense.  If these


things are going to be published, the family is going to


be subject to intrusive inquiries again. 


People are going 

to ask them for comments on it.  They're going to go to


their house again and take a picture of the front of the


house.  Why aren't these interests, which at this time in


our history I think do tend to fall with - within the


concept of privacy, easily encompassed by the - the sense


of privacy in the exemption?


MR. FAVISH: The right to be let alone was not


the sole expression of the definition of privacy in that


article.  In fact, in Reporters Committee -


QUESTION: Well, nothing it - I - I'm not


suggesting - your - I mean, your argument is based upon

the fact that there has to be one narrow definition of


privacy encompassed by this word, and no other.  You've


gone back to a case in which we were talking about the


interests of the living, and you say it can't be anything


more than that.  Why do you make the assumption that


privacy is such a circumscribed concept in the exemption?


MR. FAVISH: Well, the word privacy, if it's


going to be meaning the right to be let alone in its


broadest sense, I suppose anything that could be


considered a tort then would be considered a violation of


somebody's privacy right.


QUESTION: Mr. Favish, do - do we have any case


law that suggests that the exemptions to the Freedom of


Information Act are to be narrowly construed? 

MR. FAVISH: Well, sure, this Court's decision in


Rose, Department of Air Force, there are many cases -


QUESTION: Isn't that your - isn't that your


response to why you should not think that privacy means


the right to be let alone?


MR. FAVISH: Exactly.


QUESTION: Or anything beyond its narrowest


meaning?


MR. FAVISH: I - I -


QUESTION: I assume that that's your argument?


MR. FAVISH: Yes, absolutely.  That's established

that these are to be narrowly construed, and that was a


part of the legislative intent of Congress to have the


exemptions clearly delineated, specific, so that there


would be clear standards.  In fact, that was the - the


reason for the Freedom of Information Act being enacted in


1966, because the prior enactment was allowing the


Government to take ambiguous language and cover every


document with it.


So if you are going to come up with another


definition of privacy, it has to fit within that


legislative intent.


QUESTION: Are you saying that this Court,


because of the definition in Reporters Committee, has


already recognized that it's got to be the individual that 

is in the photograph and families are out of it?  That it


- that - that's - so you would - you would say the D.C.


Circuit was wrong, the district court in the Challenger


case, which involved the voices of the people?


MR. FAVISH: Okay.  Two - two parts to your


question.  First, as to your first part, based on what


this Court did in Reporters Committee, I'd say privacy in


this context is the right to control information about


yourself.  If the survivors have no information in that


photograph or document, they have no privacy interest


here.  With regard to the Challenger case, the D.C.

Circuit in Challenger did not reach this issue.  The sole


issue they decided was whether or not the threshold had


been met in this exemption (C) case, which was whether the


file was a personnel, medical, or similar file.


QUESTION: Yeah, but it went back to the district


court.


MR. FAVISH: The district court made the decision


that there was a privacy interest, but it wasn't the D.C.


Circuit that made that decision, and the D.C. -


QUESTION: But in - in any event, you would say


that district court decision was off-limits because this


was a case of survivor grief, no information about the


survivors?


MR. FAVISH: Yes, I would. 


And I'd like to point 

to two cases, one of which has already been cited to you


in the brief by the Silha Center, one of the amicus, and


that's Cordell v. Detective Publications.  It's a Sixth


Circuit opinion from 1969.  And also, a case that hasn't


been cited to you yet is a Federal district court case


called Young v. That Was The Week That Was, and that's at


312 F. Supp. 1337.  The beauty of these two Federal cases,


they're both from 1969, which is just three years after


Congress first enacted FOIA, just a few years before they


put the privacy phrase in exemption 7(C).  They talk about


the common law definition of privacy and -

 QUESTION: Well, if - if they were decided in

MR. FAVISH: Well, I didn't - I filled up my 50


pages and I didn't address this specific issue, other than


citing Reporters Committee.


QUESTION: Well, on - on - on Reporters


Committee, maybe you'll disagree, but what I think is - is


- is the key language is in roman IV, where the Court


says, to begin with, both the common law and the literal


understandings of privacy encompass the individual's


control of information concerning his or her person.  It


doesn't say consists of or is defined, it says encompass. 


The Court couldn't have been more careful to use a word to


say that this is - that it includes. 


It doesn't say it's 

exclusively confined to.


MR. FAVISH: I - I -


QUESTION: I - I just think that's a very unfair


reading of that sentence.  Now, if you have something


else.


MR. FAVISH: No, well, then I look at - well,


first of all, I generally agree with what you just said.


QUESTION: I - you - you agree that that is -


that's the key sentence that we're talking about.


MR. FAVISH: Yes, and - but I don't - I disagree


that it's unfair, because then I look at what was cited by

the Court, and all these scholarly articles talk about the


right to control information about yourself.  And I see


nothing else in the word privacy from the common law,


other than a minority of aberrational cases, and certainly


nothing in the legislative history that would come up with


this relational tort, this survivor privacy -


QUESTION: Well, but that's what we were involved


with.  It - it's not our style to say, now we have before


us the question of whether there is this - privacy


includes control of the individual's information about


himself.  Now, of course, there are many other


definitions, but we - we don't write opinions that way.


MR. FAVISH: Right.  I agree, but if you look at


the scholarly articles that you cited, none of them 

endorse this survivor privacy theory.  They talk about


privacy as the right to control information about yourself


exclusively.


QUESTION: Well, Mr. Favish, now, the court below


didn't really rest on that ground, did it?  I mean, you -


you didn't - the court below didn't think that privacy


was limited to this - to the deceased?


MR. FAVISH: Neither the district court nor the


Ninth Circuit -


QUESTION: No.


MR. FAVISH: - accepted that.

address the other arguments in the case.


MR. FAVISH: Certainly.  If you do -


QUESTION: Do you defend the approach taken


otherwise by the courts below?


MR. FAVISH: No, I don't.  And if you do get to a


second step where you are going to be balancing whatever


privacy interest you might find here against the public's


interest, then you have an overwhelming - an overwhelming


case that's been established showing that there was


government misconduct here, at least negligence.  And I


talk about the government conduct on two separate levels. 


One, there was government conduct in investigating Mr.


Foster's death, finding out what happened to him.  Second,


there was government conduct in reporting about that death


and the investigation to the public.  The primary


reporting agencies here were the Fiske and Starr OICs. 


Now, with regard to the first area of government


conduct, the investigation as to finding out what


happened, it's just educated guesses that the public can


make about whether there was any negligence here.  But


with regard to the second area of whether or not the


reporting conduct by the Government was at least


negligent, we know to a 100 percent certainty that there


was at least negligence, because we know that - let me

talk about what Justice Scalia talked about, the autopsy


report.


To be more correct, Your Honor, it was a - a


report by the only doctor to view Mr. Foster's body at the


park.  It was not the autopsy report.  It was a two-page


document.  Page 2 talked about the death-shot being mouth


to neck.  Mr. Hamilton stated that Mr. Starr dealt with


that in his report.  That's not true.  Mr. Starr ignored


page 2 of the Haut report.  That's one of the problems


here.  We talk about these different investigations. 


Well, nobody investigated that language on the Haut


report.  Nobody investigated the FBI -


QUESTION: Explain how the - the four documents


that we're concerned with don't talk about - none of them


show head and neck, so I don't - we - we hear only about


those four documents, right?  Because the district court


and the Ninth Circuit said, right, not all ten but only


those four?  And none of those four have anything to do


with head and neck.


MR. FAVISH: I - I - I'm - I'm not sure I follow


your question.  I - I understand that all 10 photos are at


play here because -


QUESTION: Well, that - that's what I'd like


clarified, because I thought that we are reviewing a


decision that the Government has asked us to review, which

said, Government, disclose four photographs.


MR. FAVISH: My understanding is that the


petition that was granted by the Government had, as its


question presented, was the Office of Independent Counsel


correct in withholding all of these photographs?  And


under the -


QUESTION: But the court below said yes with


respect to six of them.  So how do we get to review that?


MR. FAVISH: Yeah, the -


QUESTION: Didn't you cross-petition on the six? 


I thought you cross-petitioned.


MR. FAVISH: Yes, I did, and that's being held


over.


QUESTION: That's the answer.


QUESTION: Right.


MR. FAVISH: So I believe all 10 photos are at


play here in what decision you come up with, because the -


all the issues presented by all three petitioners are


subsumed under the question presented in the petition that


you granted.


QUESTION: I'm worried about - suppose you won. I


take it the police investigate hundreds of thousands or


millions or crimes every year, and in those investigations


they may investigate people whom they later conclude are


innocent, perhaps again hundreds of thousands of millions

of them.  And, of course, there might, in respect to those


people, be lots of newspapers or others who would like to


have the police records about people found to be innocent.


Now, what would protect these thousands or


hundreds of thousands of innocent people from having the


police investigation of them displayed on the front page


of their local paper if you were to win this case?


MR. FAVISH: Well, if I was one of those people


that you're talking about and -


QUESTION: Yes, well -


MR. FAVISH: - and there's information about me


in the document, I have a privacy interest in the


document, is what my position is.


QUESTION: Well, if you - but suppose you won 

this, if you won it, then you and everybody else, let's


say millions of people, you don't mind perhaps, or not


enough, you don't mind enough, but a lot of people would


mind having a police report about them on the front page


of the local paper.


MR. FAVISH: Well, then, in that case -


QUESTION: Now, what is it that - if you win, I


don't see that those people would have any protection


whatsoever.


MR. FAVISH: The protection would be in the


balancing that's done to see -

 QUESTION: The balancing would be that the police


had found them innocent, and it's not that hard if you win


this, where there have been five investigations, for


somebody to say, oh, there was a police cover-up, they


weren't really innocent.


MR. FAVISH: I -


QUESTION: And if there are two investigations,


they'll still say it, and there'll always be something


that isn't perfect about the investigation, so they'll


have a peg to hang their hat on.


MR. FAVISH: Under the balancing, all the factors


must be taken into account.  We have an almost unique


situation here of a deputy White House counsel, public


official, very close to the President of the United 

States, who was under investigation at the time, there


were documents related to that investigation in Mr.


Foster's office, that is why Kenneth Starr and Robert


Fiske investigated this.  We're talking about the highest


levels of government where there's a mysterious death by


gunshot.  This is not one of the cases that you pose a


hypothetical about.  This is something unique and -


QUESTION: But I don't see how you can confine it


to uniqueness. Why doesn't everyone in every hometown in


America have a - a very significant interest in whether


their police department is adequately investigating and

evaluating reports of homicide.  Of course they have an -


an interest in that.


MR. FAVISH: I -


QUESTION: Every - everyone in - in - in any


Federal district has an interest in whether the United


States Attorney and the FBI and so on are investigating


serious crimes, and I - I don't see how you can confine


this to what you call the unique case.


MR. FAVISH: I - I'm not saying it would be


confined.  I'm saying that this is what sets those other -


this case apart from the others.  But in principle,


unless it falls within one of the exemptions, then that


information would have to be made public -


QUESTION: So -


MR. FAVISH: - under the FOIA as it currently


exists.


QUESTION: But here's the - I think one of the -


the - one of the things that's bothering Justice Breyer,


and it's bothering me, if we accept as broad a principle


as you argue for, is this: that one of the things that -


that most police investigators learn very early on is that


when they investigate a crime and they investigate a


suspect, the suspect's old friends and enemies come


forward, and the latter frequently even up some old


scores.

 The amount of misinformation that is


intentionally communicated to law enforcement officers is


enormous.  They have to evaluate that, and it seems to me


that that kind of misinformation is - is - is going to


come very close to the front page in most cases if - if a


principle as broad as yours is accepted.


MR. FAVISH: Well, first of all, I believe in the


FOIA, in exemption 7, there is an exemption for ongoing


investigations, so much of what you're talking about -


QUESTION: Well, yeah, but the - the problem for


the person being investigated who is ultimately exonerated


is going to be the same the day after the investigation is


- is over.  So that - that doesn't answer the problem.


MR. FAVISH: Yeah. 


Now, I'm just talking about 

the privacy exemption in 7(C).  Now, I don't know in your


hypothetical whether there would be other exemptions to


prevent disclosure in those situations.  I'm not


commenting on that.  Now, with regard - yes.


QUESTION: Neither - neither do I, in fact.


QUESTION: Mr. Favish, here's - here's my - I


mean, one - once you get past the first - the first issue,


whether the privacy exemption at all covers this, if you


assume it does cover it, you have relatives here who are


going to be very much - very much harmed by - by this, as


is shown by the mere fact that they've conducted this

lengthy litigation.  It's lasted how long, and I'm sure


it's been expensive.


Now, what is the interest on the other side?  If


- if you - if you had a plausible case that - that these


investigations reached the wrong conclusion, I'd say,


yeah, that's a pretty significant governmental interest. 


But I don't see that here.  I - you - you - you've just


demonstrated some foot faults in - in each of the


investigations.  Oh, this - this investigation made this


mistake, this other investigation made the other mistake. 


Who cares?  I mean, you really think that that is a matter


of - of significant moment for - for the country, that


there was an isolated mistake in - in one and another of


the investigations?  Who cares?


MR. FAVISH: Justice Scalia, I would not


characterize them as foot faults.  I think these are major


omissions of significant evidence that pointed away from


the Government's official conclusion, and what it


establishes is that the government reports are not


trustworthy.  I agree that in the end those reports may be


correct and it was suicide in the park.


Again, like I said earlier, I can just make


educated guesses about that.  I'm not saying that it was


definitely something other than that, but I am saying that


when you have a high-level government official involved in

this kind of investigation, and then you have so many


investigations by the Government, apparently to get it


right, that it took so many, you have a public interest


here, unlike almost any other case I could imagine.


QUESTION: Well, why should the high level of the


victim make that much difference?


MR. FAVISH: As opposed to just an innocuous


neighbor down the street, perhaps.


QUESTION: Well, say a - a public interest in


something that happens in Albuquerque, New Mexico, maybe


the assistant to the mayor is shot. 


MR. FAVISH: Because we're dealing with somebody


who was working close to the President of the United


States and we're talking about the Freedom of Information 

Act, whose primary purpose is to allow the people to be a


check on government, not only to -


QUESTION: Well, but - but why - why wouldn't


that be just as true of this incident, hypothetical


incident in Albuquerque as the Vince Foster slaying?


MR. FAVISH: Well, it very well might be with


regard to city or state government and states have their


own open records acts, and as we heard before, some of


them prohibit death photos, but they do that by


legislation.  We know that the State of Florida did that


in response to amicus Teresa Earnhardt's plea.  That's

what should be done here if they want the Federal


Government to follow the lead of the state legislatures


here.


It's not for the courts, with all due respect,


to rewrite the FOIA exemption, so I - I'm not disagreeing


that that's a valid concern, but the way -


QUESTION: Well, you're - you're - you're getting


away from the hypothetical.  The hypothetical, if you - if


you insist on taking this line, could be refined so that


we assume New Mexico has exactly the same statute and has


interpreted exactly the same way.  Then you have to answer


the hypothetical.


MR. FAVISH: Oh, absolutely then.  If - if the


balancing is done and you're talking about a law like FOIA 

where the primary purpose is to allow the people to ensure


that their government is honest, because that's the heart


of our democracy and we're talking about the integrity of


our law enforcement agencies, I can think of no higher


public interest than what's being asserted here.  And


again, all of this is going to have to be -


QUESTION: So - so - so then it doesn't just turn


on the fact that it's Vince Foster and that - and the


Chief Justice's point is - is that this was going to apply


to every police department, every - every local government


in the country that has an act like this?

 MR. FAVISH: Well, in principle, yes.  How the


balancing would come out in each individual case would


depend on the ad hoc balancing, but the principles would -


would be the same if the law is the same, I agree. 


QUESTION: When a person goes to work for the


Government, on top of everything else, he even loses a


private right to bury the body.  I mean, I'm speaking


metaphorically, but, I mean, there are a lot of


disadvantages in government, and you're saying one of the


things would be that after death there is no protection,


even to see that that body is buried and the photographs


disappear for the - for the -


MR. FAVISH: Well -


QUESTION: It would just go on forever. 

MR. FAVISH: Well, we're not talking about


interfering with the - the burial process.


QUESTION: No, I know.  I'm speaking


metaphorically.  I have Antigone in my mind.


(Laughter.)


MR. FAVISH: Again, as I read the FOIA exemption


7(C), the privacy exemption, Congress has not legislated


that the Government is allowed to withhold death


photographs under this privacy exemption.  If we think


that's a good public policy to enact, we should get


Congress to hold hearings on it and we'll find out all the

yeas and the nays and that's how good legislation comes. 


And that's what should be done here and -


QUESTION: What does privacy cover without that? 


Are you suggesting that there be a catalog A to Z of - and


the - and the word privacy within the meaning of 7(c)


covers, and that's -


MR. FAVISH: Oh, in terms of what Congress might


do or what this Court might do?


QUESTION: No, in terms of - the Court has no


leeway unless Congress has such a catalog and this is one


of the enumerated items -


MR. FAVISH: Well, we know that Congress used the


phrase, personal privacy, in the statute, and now the


debate is over what did they mean by that.  And


apparently, people are scribing words, Alice-in-


Wonderland-like definitions to words, and if we go down


that route -


QUESTION: But it's not very Alice in Wonderland-


like to take the Brandeis definition that started this


all.


MR. FAVISH: What I like about the Brandeis


article is -


QUESTION: I think it's Alice in Wonderland-


like.

article is the section of that article that was cited by


this Court in Reporters Committee.  The Brandeis article


was one of the six scholarly articles.  Now, keep in mind,


the Brandeis article, 1890, was maybe the earliest trying


to come up with a definition of privacy, so the language


isn't as precise as what, for instance, former Solicitor


General Fried came up with in his seminal 1966 article,


also cited by this Court.


So I would say that the best definition that


provides the clearest workable standard is the right to


control information about yourself, and again, on the


second point here, I - I won't go down the litany of


things that are in the brief talking about how there was


misconduct, at least negligence with regard to reporting 

this case, but once I've established that, which I have, I


think that the Government can no longer be trusted to


filter the raw evidence to the people in this case, and I


don't see how in a democracy that depends on the integrity


of its law enforcement agencies in a case where you've had


- well, by the way, there haven't been five


investigations.  For instance, the Senate Whitewater


Committee stated out the outset of its two-day hearings


they're not looking into whether Mr. Foster committed


suicide or not.  That's in the record.  Look at ER 603 and


those pages.

 So we're also looking at a situation with regard


to the Fiske and Starr offices using FBI agents as part of


their investigation, where the FBI did the initial


investigation with the Park Police.  That's all in the


record.  There's a conflict of interest there when you


have FBI agents participating in an examination of what


they already did. 


So to call this five separate investigations is


highly misleading, and I think that the only investigation


that will matter in this case is the one that the people


can do directly by seeing the raw evidence for itself,


because for whatever reason, and I don't impugn the


motives of Judge Starr or anybody else, I have no personal


knowledge that he actually wrote the report.  He had


lawyers in his office.  I don't know what the mechanics


was.  I want to make that very, very clear.


I just want it to be known that we know


objectively, and it's undisputed, there were major pieces


of evidence omitted from the Fiske and Starr reports that


point to something other than the official conclusion, not


just little details, because those things, I agree, can be


explained sometimes.  We're talking about major, major


issues, and those are spelled out in the brief in detail


for you.


QUESTION: Mr. Favish, are there any other

Federal statutes that use the term privacy?


MR. FAVISH: There is the Privacy Act enacted in


1974, and there is a definition which talks about


personally identifying details, and I don't have that at


hand right now, but it's consistent -


QUESTION: You don't think that covers relatives


who are deceased?


MR. FAVISH: I don't think it enacts a definition


that gives somebody a privacy interest in a document -


QUESTION: I don't either.


MR. FAVISH: - which has no information about


them, and I think that's indicative also.  And my one last


point has to do with what the Ninth Circuit did here in


addition to the reasons I've already explained.  They


basically said that it isn't the release of the photos


that will cause the harm, it's what's going to be done


later, media intrusion and so forth, which I think


violates what Justice Scalia said in his concurrence in


the Ray case about the derivative uses.


Now, Ray was an exemption 6 case, but it focused


on the word that's common to both exemptions, constitute,


would the release or production constitute the invasion of


privacy?  What the Ninth Circuit came up with really


violates what Justice Scalia said in his concurrence in


Ray, with which I - I agree wholeheartedly.

that, they would see that what they did was wrong on that


score.  And that's really all I have.  I thank you.

Justice Breyer, you hit the nail on the head when you said


that if this type of investigation isn't enough, what's


going to happen in the routine case?  This is the gold


standard for law enforcement investigations, and if in


this case, the fact that someone can think of something


more that should have been said, something more should


have been done, something more should have been revealed,


then in the run-of-the-mill routine law enforcement case,

there will be little protection left for privacy.


And the problem won't be just that this


information will end up on the front page of the New York


Times, but under the 1996 amendments to the FOIA, if - if


the Government anticipates three or more requests for


information, we're obliged to post the information on our


Web sites for photographs taken after 1996 - November


1996.  You won't need to go to findadeath.com.  You can go


to DepartmentofDefense.gov to find pictures of - the 50


pictures that are routinely taken during autopsies of


military office - officials killed overseas.


Justice Kennedy, you had asked about the remand,


whether a remand was necessary.  It is not in this case. 


On pages 56A through 59A of the petition appendix, the 

district court, before being redirected by the court of


appeals, we think erroneously, ruled that the - the


pictures should be withheld applying a less demanding


standard than the one that we approached, that it just


balanced the allegations of misconduct against the privacy


interest, and concluded that the privacy interest still


outweighed, assuming that - that just allegations count


for something on the public interest side. 


So if this Court agrees with the Government's


position or requires anything more than allegations of


misconduct, there'll be no need to remand.  It's also not

a discretionary decision, it's a de novo review.  The


balancing is undertaken in the first instance, but it's


reviewed de novo by the court of appeals and de novo by


this Court.


Justice Scalia, you talked about this doesn't


sound like privacy.  Well, privacy is a language that has


been used by not all, but a number of common law courts


that are cited in our opening and reply brief.  And this


Court's interpretation of the concept of privacy under the


Freedom of Information Act has gone far beyond what tort


law would protect.  There - I don't know that there's any


court case that would suggest that rap sheets should be


public records, like rap sheets would be protected under


privacy conceptions in common law, so it would be 

extraordinary in this case to decide that the language


Congress employed, personal privacy, is intended to be


interpreted more narrowly than it has, at least at some -


at some courts at common law.


Justice Scalia, you also asked about narrowly


construing the exemptions.  It's - I agree that there are


cases that say that, but in John Doe Agency v. a John Doe


Corporation, this Court made clear that these exemptions


still have to be interpreted in a way that allows their


exempt - the purposes of the exemptions to be served.  And


in a - and they should not be construed in the non-

functional manner.  If law enforcement is to become the


instrument - in the eyes of the public, the law


enforcement, the Federal Government, will be the


instrument of these types of disclosures and causing this


type of pain to families that is likely to have a chilling


effect on people's willingness to provide information to


law enforcement.


You asked about other statutes, and we discussed


the Privacy Act statute.  The Privacy Act statute doesn't


apply to survivors, but that's because the language is


specifically different.  The Privacy Act talks about -


defines the - the records that are covered in terms of


information about an individual and information that - to


that pertains to the individual. 
 It has a sort of very -

and it has to be information contained in a system of


records that - where information can be retrieved by an


individual identifier.  It's a very narrow and specialized


definition.  It's exactly the type of definition that


Congress would have used if it wanted a more narrow


approach.  Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Millett. 


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 10:58 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
