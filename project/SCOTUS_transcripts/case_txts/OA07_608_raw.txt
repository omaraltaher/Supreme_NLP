 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-608, United States v. Hayes.

 Ms. Saharsky.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Respondent's conviction for battering his 

wife is a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence 
primarily for two reasons:  First, the statutory text is 
most naturally read that way.  Second, a contrary 
reading would defeat Congress's purposes. 
Nine courts of appeals have determined that the text 
does not require a domestic relationship to be an 
element to the predicate offense.  That's because the 
statute's text uses only one element, using the singular 
word "element," which relates to mode of aggression.  It 
then introduces a new concept related to domestic 
relationship, using a comma and the word "committed." 
The word "committed" naturally modifies the word 
"offense."  In common usage, a person commits an 
offense; he doesn't commit a use or attempted use of 
physical force.

Under Respondent's reading of the statute, when it was 
enacted it would have become immediately a dead letter 
in two-thirds of the States, and it wouldn't have any 
application to the Federal Government.  And --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, Respondent says that 
may be because a lot of people in Congress wanted it to 
be a dead letter.  They would have wanted the whole 
thing to be a dead letter.  There are a lot of people 
who didn't like this statute because it was a gun 
control statute.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  But Congress did act this 
statute, and this Court presumes two things:  First --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, if it's a compromise 

with the people who wanted no statute at all and you 
come out with a statute that covers one-third of the 
States anyway, I mean that's, you know -- that's the 
deal.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  There was a compromise made, 
but it wasn't with respect to whether there needed to be 
a domestic relationship element.  It was with respect to 
how violent the offense had to be.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do we know -- how do we 

know that?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, if you look at the 
statute's drafting history, there were two versions

considered.  One used the term "crime of violence" to 
discuss how violent the statute had to be, and then the 
second substituted in the new language:  "...has as an 
element the use or attempted use of physical force or 
threatened use of a deadly weapon."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it also substituted 
this structure that we are -- that we are discussing 
today.  Didn't that come in at the same time?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  The --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, why -- why say it's 
only the former provision that was the compromise and 
not the addition of this later language?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Both the original structure 

and the statute as enacted had the same structure in 
that they had a "committed by" clause that modified the 
word "offense."

 Now, it's true that the use -- "has as an 
element language" that came in added some additional 
structure in terms of the Romanette (i) and the 
Romanette (ii), but that all came in because there was a 
discussion about how violent the offense had to be, both 
-- in the original statute that was considered, you have 
an offense committed by a certain person, an offense of 
a certain type committed by a certain person, and in the 
statute that was enacted you have an offense of a

certain type committed by a certain person.  Now, 
Congress put more detail in, in terms of what that 
certain type of offense is.  This has as an "element" 
language, but it just didn't go to domestic 
relationship.

 And to get back to one of the earlier points 

in your question, you know, this Court presumes when 
Congress passes a statute two things are true:  First, 
it knows the legal backdrop on which it enacts the law; 
and second, that it's presumed that its law is going to 
have effect.  And that should be especially true here 
where Congress was dealing with a serious nationwide 
problem of domestic violence using firearms.  Congress 
--

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The suggestion was that 
Congress may have wanted to give an incentive to States 
to have special domestic violence statutes instead of 
punishing domestic abusers under a generic battery 
statute.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I don't think that makes 
sense for two reasons:  First, because when Congress 
wants to do that, it uses its spending power to give the 
States incentives to do things like that, and it did 
that in the VAWA enactment in 1994 and in VAWA 
re-authorization in 2005.

And, second, because if you believe what 
Respondents suggest, you would have to think that a 
Congress that was very concerned about the powder keg 
situation of a domestic offender with a gun would want 
to exempt domestic offenders who have proven that they 
are willing to hurt family members in two-thirds of the 
States, a Congress that was presumed -- that was 
concerned with the problem of domestic violence would 
enact a statute that would apply so infrequently, to at 
most these 17 States, and wouldn't apply at all to 
Federal offenses, making that "misdemeanor under Federal 
law" language superfluous.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I 

understand your objection to the reading that your 
friend would have us adopt, but you have the same sort 
of problem.  I mean, you've got a -- if it reads the way 
you would have it, then the word "that" after "an 
offense that" doesn't quite work, and have you to add 
"is" before "is committed," if you're going to keep the 
"that."  So it seems to me that this doesn't work 
grammatically either way.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I don't think that that's 
right, with respect, Your Honor, because you have an 
offense that is of a certain character committed by a 
certain person.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you've changed 
the word.  You read it as if it says "an offense that 
committed."  So either the "that" is out or you've got 
to add the word "is."

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I think that the word 

"offense" is twice modified.  There is an offense that 
is of a certain character and there is an offense 
committed by a certain --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  You use the 
word "that" in the first example, but you skip the word 
"that" in the second.  "That" appears in the line and 
then comes (i) and (ii).  In other words, that modifies 
both of them, and you're reading it that it's an offense 
committed, and yet under the statute it has to be an 
"offense that committed."  So you've either got to leave 
"that" out the second time but not the first or you've 
got to add the word "is" as it appears in (i).

 MS. SAHARSKY:  What I'm suggesting, Your 

Honor, is that the "that" refers to everything that is 
in Romanette (i) and (ii) up to the break with 
"committed by."  So that it is an offense that is a 
misdemeanor and has as an element "committed by."  You 
know, these -- these two different clauses both modify 
"offense," just as a grammatical matter, not looking at 
this Romanette (i) and (ii), but just looking at that

sentence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Romanette?
 MS. SAHARSKY:  Oh, little Roman numeral.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I've never heard 

that before.  That's -- Romanette.

 (Laughter.)
 MS. SAHARSKY:  If you just look at this as a 
sentence, you have "an offense that is a misdemeanor and 
has as an element committed by."  Now, that "committed 
by" clause, it could have come after "offense" or it 
could be in the place where it is now.  There are just 
these two different ways that offenses qualify.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can't.  I mean, you 

have the "that," and the "that" applies to both (i) and 
(ii), and this is part of (ii).  I think you've got to 
either say "that committed" or -- or put in an "is" --
"that is committed."  It just doesn't parse, and that 
lack of parsing is much worse than the one that you --
you point to in the other side's reading.  Yes, it's not 
usual to talk about committing a use of force, but it 
happens sometimes.  It's -- it's not the most elegant 
language, but there are many examples of such usage that 
have been brought forth by the other side and by some of 
the amici.  So they have something that -- it's not 
elegant, but people have spoken that way.  Nobody speaks

the way you want us to speak:  "An offense that 
committed by a person or an offense that" -- "committed 
by a current or former..."  Nobody talks that way.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Two responses.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Nobody.
 MS. SAHARSKY:  Two responses, Your Honor. 

First, the "committed by" language refers back to 
"offense" and the "that" is just part of this -- this 
first clause, but -- and we believe that the 
Government's reading is the most logical reading.  And 
think of it this way:  You know, Respondent agrees that 
if there were a hard return before the "committed by" 
language, that it's clear -- that it would be more clear 
that the Government's reading is correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wouldn't agree with that. 
You'd still have the "that" up above.  You would have to 
have a hard return and take out the "that" or -- or that 
(A) is a misdemeanor, "has as an element" and then a 
hard return, and you have to add "and is committed." 
You still have to add language besides the hard return.
 MS. SAHARSKY:  With respect, Your Honor, we 
think this can be read as all one sentence.  But just to 
make my second point, which is:  I think that it would 
do much more violence, Respondent's reading of the 
statute, than you suggest because you're talking about

treating the singular word "element" as plural.  You're 
talking about ignoring the comma that separates the "has 
as an element" section from the "committed by" section, 
and then you're talking about taking what even the 
linguists who filed a brief in this case essentially in 
support of Respondents say is a very weird usage of 
"committed."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you -- I'm 
sorry.  I'm not following why "element" is singular. 
The argument on the other side, I understood, is that 
the element is the use of physical force committed by a 
current or former spouse.  So "element" is still 
singular.  I -- maybe I'm missing something.  What 
change would you have to make to the word "element" to 
adopt their reading?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  We think that you'd say --

you'd have to say "has as its elements" to suggest that 
you would take two very diverse concepts and make them 
both required elements of the underlying offense.

 There are two concepts here:  One is how 
violent the offense has to be, and then there's the 
second concept, which is a class of defendants, and 
that's a very different concept.  But if you just see 
the singular "element," "has as an element," and then 
you see, oh, okay, it has to be violent.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but I thought 
the whole point of this was to get at violence committed 
by a family member, and if that's the critical element, 
you don't have to have two different elements, 
"violence" and then "committed."  It's violence 
committed by a family member.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, with respect, Your 
Honor, we think that because Congress broke these up 
into these two different clauses -- one that relates to 
violence and then a separate clause that's introduced by 
"committed by" where "committed" naturally modifies 
"offense" -- that it was treating -- that these were two 
separate requirements.  And you're right that Congress 
was trying to get at the problem of violent domestic 
offense, and if it was doing that it would make no sense 
at all for Congress to -- to have enacted a statute that 
would such extremely limited application.  And, of 
course, Respondent's reading would make the "is a 
misdemeanor under Federal law" superfluous.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If we think that 

there are two awkward readings, yours and your friend's, 
and both of them require surgery, don't we resolve that 
under the rule of lenity?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  No.  The rule of lenity says 
that there needs to be a grievous ambiguity after this

Court seizes aid -- any aid which can be derived from 
the tools of statutory interpretation.  So even though 
we think that the text here is most naturally read in 
the Government's way, every other indicia of meaning 
here points in favor of the Government's interpretation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what -- what's 
been the underlying rationale for the rule of lenity, 
which is a rule I think we should apply with great 
caution?  But if we think -- what's the reason for the 
rule of lenity?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I think one of the -- the 

main concerns is providing fair notice of what's 
illegal.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Fair notice.  It -- it --

it seems to me that if I were counsel practicing 
criminal law in the private sector, and I negotiated a 
plea for simple assault, but there was a spouse that was 
involved, and then I walked down the courthouse step 
with my clients, said we got a good deal, and 
incidentally, all guns in your house must immediately be 
surrendered to other people, you must take them all out, 
you may never hunt, you may never possess a gun.

 And under your view, if I don't say that I'm 
guilty of, it seems to me, serious malpractice.  I just 
don't see that there is notice to the legal profession.

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well certainly, Your Honor, 
we think that the statutory text is clear, and that's 
because people are presumed to know the law.  Certainly 
a person who has beaten his wife knows that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but the rule --
MS. SAHARSKY:  -- the assault he was 

convicted of is one against his wife.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  Where the context is, 

we are asking why the rule of lenity and the rule of 
lenity is to ensure notice.  And it seems to me this is 
a classic case where there has to be notice.  You could 
come back and say that even if the statute had been 
written as to apply specifically to domestic crimes, a 
lot of attorneys wouldn't have had notice on it when it 
was an omnibus budget bill added at the last minute.
 MS. SAHARSKY:  Your Honor, it was at the 
time that this statute was enacted the case that very 
few States had statutes with a domestic relationship 
requirement, only 17.  And to be clear, in those 17 
States those all covered more domestic relationships 
than the Federal statute.  They covered things like 
dating relationships, violence involving grandparents, 
etcetera.  So that even from the face of your State 
conviction, you wouldn't be able to just match it right 
up with this Federal offense.  And the fact that those

17 States -- A, that there was such a small number; and 
B, that those States cover a different range of domestic 
offenses --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There was a small, a 

small number.  Were they populous States?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I think it was a range of 

States.  I don't think I could say it was all the most 
populous or all the least populous States.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  California, New 

York?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  You know, I'd have to look at 
the list.  I think that California came in later -- no, 
California did have one statute; New York did not.
 But you know, one thing that's worth 

noticing in this case is that you know, the Senator, 
Senator Lautenberg, who was the sponsor of this 
legislation, was from New Jersey; and other Respondent's 
reading of this statute it wouldn't have even applied to 
offenses committed in New Jersey.  And that seems like 
an odd thing to believe.  And of course, it wouldn't 
have applied to Federal offenses despite the --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask -- may I ask, to 

make sure I understand the alternate reading.  Is it 
your view that the statute does mean the same as if, 
after the words "deadly weapon," there had been inserted

a parenthetical (iii), closed paren, "is committed by"? 
If -- now there is the element of "attempted use of 
force" is one, is the second requirement; and the third 
requirement is that it be committed by a current or 
former spouse.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  I think --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  So your -- your reading --
I'm just following up on the Chief Justice's question --
requires us to assume that Congress really intended 
there to be a triple "i" as well as a double "i", and 
the triple "i" would have begun with the verb "is."

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I think that that's one way 

of doing it, but I don't think that you have to do that, 
because if you look at the structure of this sentence --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it is true, is it not, 
that if you did do it that way, it would have been a lot 
clearer than it is now?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  There are ways that Congress 
could have made its manifest intent even more clear.  It 
could have added that Romanette (iii); it could put a 
hard return before "committed by."  But if you look at 
the effect that the statute would have, if you read it 
Respondent's way, I don't think that we can reasonably 
expect that Congress -- a Congress that wanted to get at 
the serious nationwide problem of domestic violence

using firearms, would have wanted to enact a statute 
that would have such limited effect.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I want to follow up on 
Justice Kennedy's inquiry about the rule of lenity. 
Don't you think the rule of lenity is particularly 
important when you're dealing with conduct that is not 
malum in se?  I mean, to say that, well, we are not 
going to apply the rule of lenity to a statute that 
posits an increased sentence for kneecapping or for some 
violent conduct, the person knows he shouldn't be doing 
that stuff anyway.  But this imposes a -- a -- a penalty 
for conduct that no one would think is unlawful.

 This fellow is -- wasn't it his father's gun 

he was taking to sell at a gun show or something?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  There were five firearms. 

There was one found in his home, three that he 
transferred and one that he sold.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, he could have ten, 

couldn't he?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, we would hope that he 

wouldn't in this situation.  But --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?

of a serious violent offense, and I think that's --

unlawful, it wouldn't be unlawful at all, would it?  He 
would have no reason to think he couldn't have a 
firearm.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I think that a person who has 
been committed of a violent offense should be on notice 
that their procession of firearms --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Should be.  Is that right?
 MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  A misdemeanor -- a 

misdemeanor offense.  And -- and -- and he should 
suspect that because he committed a misdemeanor, he 
cannot have a firearm?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  When --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think anybody would 

assume that.  Indeed, there are some who assume that 
you -- you cannot prevent the owning of a firearm for a 
mere misdemeanor, as opposed to a felony.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I understand that concern. 

We are not talking about mere misdemeanors here.  We are 
talking about a specific category of violent 
misdemeanors, Section 929(g)(9); specifically --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Make it clear.
 Make it clear, so that when -- when his 

lawyer pleads to the offense, he doesn't have to read in

a little (iii) where there is not a little (iii).  And 
he -- well, you did not plead guilty or you are not 
accused of the offense of using violence against a 
family member.  You're just -- just accused of -- of 
using violence, a misdemeanor.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Two thoughts on that, Your 
Honor.  The first is, you know, at the time that this 
statute was enacted almost all of the States except for 
this small number prosecuted offenses that were domestic 
disturbance offenses like the one in this case under 
general assault and battery statutes, and even the 17 
States that have those with the domestic relations, 
offenses with the domestic relationship requirement, 
still prosecute them routinely as assault and battery 
under those general statutes.

 So I think a person -- A, an attorney who 

handles those kind of cases would have knowledge of that 
law; and B, a person who has committed a serious violent 
offense like Respondent's previous offense in this case 
should be on notice that his possession of firearms 
might be regulated.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- a serious violent 

offense.  Are there -- is there felony assault and 
battery?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes. 

19 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And this was misdemeanor 

assault and battery, wasn't it?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes, that's right.  I mean, I 

really --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's not that serious an 

offense.  That's why we call it a misdemeanor.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, I mean, certainly the 

offense is this particular case was serious.  The 
charging document reflects that Respondent hit his wife 
all around the face until it swelled out, kicked her all 
around her body, kicked here in the ribs --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then he should have been 
charged with a felony, but he wasn't.  He was charged 
with a misdemeanor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wasn't the -- wasn't the 
statute responding to just that problem, that domestic 
abuse tended to be charged as misdemeanors rather than 
felonies?  And it was that fact that the Senator was 
responding to when he included misdemeanor.  The whole 
purpose of this was to make a misdemeanor battery count 
for the statute's purpose.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  That's exactly right, Justice 

Ginsburg.  All of the discussion of this in Congress 
said we need to have a zero tolerance towards people --
zero tolerance policy towards people who are -- have

proven that they are willing to commit violent acts 
against family members; and we already have a statute 
that prohibits felons from possessing firearms, but we 
know that sometimes these domestic offenses get charged 
as misdemeanors.  And Senator Lautenberg specifically 
said in the legislative record they are often charged as 
offenses like assault and battery, and we need to get at 
these offenses because these people should not have 
firearms.  They should not put their families in that 
type of powder keg situation, and they -- we should not 
be putting police in that type of situation, where 
police who respond to a domestic disturbance call like 
the 911 call in this case are put in a dangerous 
situation with a person -- an emotionally charged 
situation -- who would have a firearm.

 One other point that I wanted to make with 
respect to your question, Justice Scalia -- and this is 
not with respect to how this case should be resolved, 
but just as a practical matter -- that the VAWA 2005 
amendments do require States, for a condition of their 
grant funding, to have a judicial policy that gives 
notice for offenses like assault and battery that a 
person would not be able to possess a firearm.

 And the reason that they are doing that is 

not because, you know, as a constitutional matter we

think that they need to, but because they really --
Congress just really wants to keep firearms away from 
people who have shown that they are willing to hurt 
family members in this way.

 Now, I talked a little bit in the beginning 
of argument about how really every -- every indicia of 
meaning in this case -- and we do look to -- to each of 
those different interpretive tools before we would 
invoke the rule of lenity -- points in favor of the 
Government's construction.  First of all, you've got the 
text, and I think we've -- we've covered those 
arguments.  But just as a practical matter, this statute 
would have an extremely limited effect if it didn't --
if it were interpreted as Respondent suggests.

 The language with respect to Federal 

misdemeanors would be superfluous because the way that 
Federal offenses like domestic assaults on Army bases 
are charged is under a general Federal assault statute. 
There isn't one that's specific to domestic violence. 
So Congress would have put this "misdemeanor under 
Federal law" language in there, and it -- it would have 
immediately had no effect either.  You know, the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it seems there 

is no Federal misdemeanor that covers this particular 
type of assault, in other words?

MS. SAHARSKY:  There is -- there is a 

general Federal assault statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.
 MS. SAHARSKY:  But it doesn't have a 
domestic relationship requirement, and that's the 
problem.  You know, we also look to the drafting history 
just a bit, and I -- I think that, you know, every 
indicia -- every indication in the drafting history, 
both if you compare the first version of the bill with 
the statute that was enacted and the discussion relating 
to it, shows that this language "has as an element," 
which really only intended to get at how violent an 
offense had to be, it -- it was never intended to get at 
any kind of domestic relationship requirement.  And, of 
course, the -- the sponsor --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think -- I think that 
people are governed by the law that is passed, not by 
the law that Congress intended to pass.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  That's exactly right, Justice 

--

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, really, if a lawyer 
reading this would not think that it applied, I don't 
care what Congress intended.  If -- if the law doesn't 
say that, the person is not governed by it.  You think a 
person could be governed by it despite the fact that it

doesn't say that because Congress intended it?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Of course not, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course.
 MS. SAHARSKY:  We look to the text first, 
but we also look to other indicia -- many of us also 
look to other indicia of Congress's intent.  And some of 
those indicia include things like a comparison of the 
drafting history and Senator Lautenberg's statement, 
which is directly on point here, which says that 
offenses like assault and battery would be covered. 
This is a -- a powerful tool.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how does that 
relate to the rule of lenity?  I suppose, to get back to 
Justice Kennedy's point, you're saying that the lawyer 
would not only be obligated to read this, but in 
advising his client would be obligated to go back and 
read the drafting history and the legislative history. 
Do we really use those types of materials to trump the 
-- the rule of lenity?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  This Court has in -- in 

multiple cases looked to the fact that the statute, for 
example, would have such a narrow, limited purpose, in 
addition to the statute's text, to say, you know, we 
can't believe Congress would expect that purpose --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the lawyer 
advising his client in the typical assault case is 
supposed to know at the time that only 17 States had 
this type of provision?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I think it was well known at 
the time that these offenses, even in the 17 States that 
had the domestic relationship element, were commonly 
prosecuted as assault and battery offenses.  And this 
Court has -- for example, let's consider the Taylor 
case, where this Court was considering the example of 
burglary and trying to define:  Should we pick this 
narrow, common-law definition of "burglary," or a more 
expansive definition of "burglary"?

 And, aside from looking at the legislative 

history, there is a separate section of the Court's 
opinion where you said:  Look, if we took this narrow, 
common law definition of "burglary," it would apply 
basically nowhere and we just can't think that Congress 
intended that.

 And you didn't go right to the rule of 
lenity there.  You looked at, for example, how that 
frustration of congressional purpose would occur and the 
problem that that would cause.

 If there are no further questions, I'd like 

to reserve the remainder of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Giatras.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TROY N. GIATRAS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. GIATRAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 The fundamental flaw in the Government's 
argument is that it describes a statute that Congress 
considered but did not pass.  In the statute's final 
version Congress defined the "misdemeanor crime of 
domestic violence" to require that the predicate offense 
have as an element a domestic relationship between the 
offender and the victim.

 And the Government's reading ignores the 

legislative compromise that led to the contested 
language; and, if adopted by this Court, would rewrite 
the statute and hand one side the legislative victory 
that they were unable to achieve in Congress.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait.  You say that 

that was the compromise.  I don't know that you have any 
evidence to -- to show that that was an intentional --
an intentional alteration made in the House of 
Representatives.  Do you?  I mean --

MR. GIATRAS:  There is nothing that speaks 

to the words in the House of Representatives in the

Congressional Record, Your Honor, but their inaction and 
the lack of words speak very loudly.  And it was -- from 
March of 1996, when the legislation was introduced, and 
then it went over to the House after passing 
significantly in the Senate, it was stalled, and it was 
stymied, and it did not move.

 As a matter of fact, it had to at one time 
be taken from a -- and put into the stalking bill and 
then removed from the stalking bill and replaced back in 
then to a postal bill, which was then modified into the 
appropriations bill.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the other side says 

that the reason that was the case was that they objected 
to the fact that -- what was its language -- the -- the 
old version did not say a "misdemeanor crime of domestic 
violence."  It was -- it was broader.

 MR. GIATRAS:  It certainly was broader, but 
there was nothing -- and there was no one that spoke in 
the House of Representatives on that matter.  And there 
was only one -- the principal author of the legislation, 
the sponsor, spoke in the Senate.  And it was not until 
the eleventh hour on September 28th of 1996 that this 
entire change was made.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought it was that the 
use of force -- to make it clear is a misdemeanor -- had

to involve a use of force, and that wasn't clear before, 
right?

 MR. GIATRAS:  The --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where -- where is the 

earlier version?  Do we have the earlier version 
anywhere --

MR. GIATRAS:  Yes.

front of us?

brief -- I'm sorry.  It's page 4a of the red brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Thank you.
 MR. GIATRAS:  I apologize.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  While we pause, can I just 

ask you one question to make sure I understand the two 
-- two different positions?  Your view of the subsection 
ii is that the meaning you attributed to it is -- would 
be exactly the same if you left out the word 
"committed"?  In other words, it seems to me under your 
view the word -- either the word "committed" or the 
words "committed by" is superfluous?

 MR. GIATRAS:  No.  That is part of the 

element -- the one element that is required.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why would you need that in 
there if the statute means -- if the element is the use

of force by a family member?  Why do you have to put in 
another verb, "committed"?

 MR. GIATRAS:  Well, because that's who --

that's who it would -- that's who it would address to. 
And that would be with respect to -- when you look at 
the definition that's set forth, it was to change from 
the original -- original --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, I'm not interested 
in changes.  I'm just interested in the text before us. 
And it seems to me that your reading of the statute is 
exactly what the statute would say if it did not include 
the word "committed."

 MR. GIATRAS:  I -- I don't know, Justice.  I 

don't believe so, though.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I agree with 
Justice Stevens.  Read it without the word "committed." 
It not only has the same effect, but it's more natural, 
because it's "use of force by a current or former 
spouse," as opposed to "use of force committed by."

 MR. GIATRAS:  It would still include -- it 

would still include both attributes into the one element 
even if the word "committed" were removed from double 
ii, yes.  I'm -- I'm sorry about that.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  As I read this old one --
as I read the first one, Senator Lautenberg put in the

language, and his language in the first one was to say 
I'll tell you a group of people who shouldn't have guns. 
The people who commit a crime of domestic violence.

 Now what's that?  In the statute he says it 
is a misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a person 
in a family relation with the victim.

 Then he says after, I changed that language 
a little.  I'll tell you why.  Because somebody told me 
misdemeanor crime of violence is too broad.  It could 
include cutting up a credit card.  So I'll define it 
more specifically.

 And he defines if more specifically to say 

that it is a crime that has as an element the use or 
attempted use of physical force or threatening people 
with a weapon.  End of the matter.

 They substitute those words and they did 

another thing the drafter as he breaks out the thing it 
says:  It is a crime that is a misdemeanor and, you see, 
and that's where the problem is, because if you put in a 
"that," then you have to have an "is."  So he left out 
the "is."  Okay.

 So I say what did Senator Lautenberg want 

with these words?  I see.  How did he change it?  I see.
 I can't find a word that supports the reason 
that you have.  Now, maybe they are there.  That's what

you'll tell me.

 And then I say it's the fine language 

consistent with what he wanted.  It requires putting in 
an "is."  I don't find that too awful.  Okay.  That's 
your argument against you.  What is it?  Your argument 
to rebut that.

 MR. GIATRAS:  The legislation that the 
Senator introduced was not the legislation that was 
passed by Congress.  And, Justice Breyer, it is very 
clear from the statutory and legislative history in this 
case from -- you just take up through September 28th of 
1996, that the sponsor of the legislation decries with 
respect to the staunch opposition that was in the House, 
and the fact that his bill was going nowhere.  This may 
have been his intended purpose with respect to what was 
introduced, but it was then the will of Congress with 
changing --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the conclusion. 

You're reaching that conclusion.  What I need from you 
is something that would tell me, no, Congress didn't 
just want to clarify in the way Lautenberg said.  What 
they wanted to do was, in fact, restrict the scope of 
this so it only applied in 17 states.  Okay.  I'm open 
to that argument.  It could be a good argument.  Just 
point me to the things that suggest that that is what

Congress wanted to do, rather than by what Senator 
Lautenberg said.

 MR. GIATRAS:  By take -- by taking a look at 

the final passed legislation.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I've got the words.  If 

the best you can do is point me to the words of the 
statute, I'll take that into account.  I'm asking the 
question to see if there is anything at all more?

 MR. GIATRAS:  Other than the fact that the 

structure of the statute also changed, and the structure 
of the statute changed --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want the text.  I 

want something for my purposes.

 MR. GIATRAS:  What we have --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
 MR. GIATRAS:  And what is problematic here, 
Justice, is that the legislative history does not speak 
on this particular matter.  It is silent on this.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did this structure come 

from Senator Lautenberg?

 MR. GIATRAS:  No, it did not.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where did it come from?
 MR. GIATRAS:  It is -- it has to be presumed 
that it came from -- we don't know exactly where, but it 
came out of the House, and the House of Representatives

on September 28th --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It came out of the House 

version.  The House version had this which was different 
from the Senate version that Lautenberg was responsible 
for?

 MR. GIATRAS:  No.  This was a version that 

was passed in the Senate as the "as introduced" 
language.  It then went and it was sat -- it sat in the 
House of Representatives for a long period of time.

 It was not until September 28th, prior --

right prior to the time that the budget bill had to have 
been sent back to -- to the Senate to be voted on and 
then proved by the President to continue the government 
to run.  And this bill was changed then in the House of 
Representatives on -- at the 11th hour --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So this language came from 

the House?

 MR. GIATRAS:  Yes, it did.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, Senator 

Lautenberg would not have been the drafter of this 
language.

 MR. GIATRAS:  The -- Senator Lautenberg does 

not disagree that he came to an agreement on this 
language.

that Senator Lautenberg did not change the words 
"misdemeanor crime of violence" to the words "use of 
physical force" or "threatened use of deadly weapon"? 
That's what he got up on the floor of the Senate and 
said that he wanted to change.

 MR. GIATRAS:  Justice, as this Court has 

articulated in Allapattah, that sometimes there can be a 
strategic manipulation to secure results.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not -- we're in -- the 
question specifically is where did the words come from? 
I thought that the words came from Senator Lautenberg. 
The reason I thought that is because he got up on the 
floor of the Senate and said that's what he did.

 Now, if you're telling me they came from a 

different place, what is there in anywhere?  I'm open to 
hearing it, but I couldn't find anything that said they 
had come from a different place.

physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon 
language, including the words "misdemeanor crime of 
domestic violence" came over from the House.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This very form that was 

ultimately enacted was the form that came over from the 
House to the Senate?

 MR. GIATRAS:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Making progress.  And 

you're saying that in the House there were some people 
who didn't want it to extend to beyond 17 States?

 MR. GIATRAS:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And how do we know that?
 MR. GIATRAS:  Well, by the mere fact that 

they -- we don't have them speaking to it, because there 
was no actual congressional record of them speaking to 
it or someone taking to the floor in the House of 
Representatives.  It's absolutely silent.

 We have to, instead, go back to what Senator 
Lautenberg was saying on the floor of the Senate during 
this period of time, where he made very clear that what

was occurring to his bill that it was dying, that it was 
being killed and it was being gutted in September of --
early to late September of 1996, the author says that 
his bill is being gutted and it's dying, and that there 
are significant staunch opposition from certain forces 
in order to limit the bill.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Other than a desire to 

weaken this bill as much as possible, can you think of 
any reason why Congress would have drawn the distinction 
that you're drawing between States that have specific 
statutes relating to domestic violence misdemeanor 
statutes and those that don't?

 MR. GIATRAS:  I don't think we can speak why 
certain States did or did not or why Congress would only 
want there to be 17.  But, certainly, there is 
nothing -- and there is nothing in the legislative 
history to express other than the fact that it was the 
effect of a judicial -- of a legislative compromise.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What sense would it make 

for Congress to say take two abusers?  The conduct is 
identical.  And in state A there is one consequence to 
bar on the possession of guns, and state B there isn't 
for the identical conduct, why would Congress want these 
two different results?

 MR. GIATRAS:  It was -- the language that

was ultimately agreed upon by the entire Congress, Your 
Honor, was as a result of a compromise.  And -- that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose it gives greater 
assurance of what exactly the prior conviction was.  If 
there is just a prior conviction of misdemeanor 
violence, you have to go back, I suppose, and look at 
the conviction, look at the testimony to find out 
whether indeed it was domestic violence.  It was just a 
general -- general assault statute.  You don't know it 
was committed in the home or not.

 Whereas if you're -- if you're convicted of 
the crime, the misdemeanor of violence against a spouse 
or a relative like this, you know exactly what the --
what the crime is?

 MR. GIATRAS:  You will know that. 

Certainly.  And by even the -- the text of the statute, 
it changes from a crime of violence to the definition of 
misdemeanor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that -- that 
when someone purchases a firearm, they have to affirm, 
check a box, I have been convicted of a crime of 
domestic violence.  Is that how it reads?  And that goes 
to, you know, to the Federal Government and they check 
the records of convictions.

 How -- how would your client check that?  I

have been -- I have been convicted of a crime of 
domestic violence, if he had been convicted of assault 
and the assault happened to be domestic assault would --
would he be perjuring himself if he said no?

 MR. GIATRAS:  There are -- there are cases 
that are prosecuted in that manner where also lying on 
the form gives charge -- gives rise to a Federal 
offense.  And the ATF regulation is -- reads the statute 
slightly -- reads the statute -- it reads the statute 
significantly different and puts in parentheticals such 
as assault and/or battery and also puts in 
parentheticals how -- they use the word "was committed" 
in a -- in a third subparagraph.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does -- does it make clear 

whether the offense has to be domestic -- a domestic 
violence offense or whether an ordinary assault offense 
will qualify if as a matter of fact it was domestic?
 MR. GIATRAS:  Well, it -- it -- the ATF 

regulation denotes that you should even put it down if 
it's going to be an assault and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what 

you've said.

 MR. GIATRAS:  The ATF regulation is in 

appendix F to your red brief, page 12 A.

way the statute should have been drafted.  Isn't that 
interesting.

 In other words, it breaks out the "was 

committed by a current or former spouse" and makes that 
a separate provision, rather than a part of the element 
"use of attempted force against a family member."

 MR. GIATRAS:  That is correct, Your Honor, 

but that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's drafted the way 

it should have been if your friends are correct.

 MR. GIATRAS:  That -- it's drafted the 

way -- it's drafted the way the original sponsor of the 
legislation would have wanted it to pass Congress, Your 
Honor -- or Chief Justice.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the -- the statute 
uses the word element in the term singular.  It seems to 
me that although this statute is a mess anyway --

(Laughter).
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- that that -- that that 
doesn't particularly help you.  Elements usually refer 
to each component of the actus reus -- you entered a 
dwelling with a weapon.  You would say "elements" for 
that, wouldn't you?

 And it seems to me under your interpretation 

the statute should say "elements."

MR. GIATRAS:  Well, I think that the -- the 

best advice is to take that of judge Sentelle's 
dissenting opinion in Barnes where element or elements 
is insignificant, the plural of it.  Instead it's what 
is the element as opposed to how many elements there 
are.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I mean when we are 

gasping for straws I'm not sure anything is 
insignificant.

 MR. GIATRAS:  Well -- and in this particular 

matter, when in seeking -- if after seizing everything 
from which the aid can or may be derived, I think we can 
only guess as to Congress's intent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But suppose this statute, 

the one that was enacted, had the word "if" before 
"committed."  Would that then convey the meaning that 
the Government is urging?  Has as an element use of 
force, comma, "if" committed.

 MR. GIATRAS:  Well, that may make it 

slightly even more vague, Justice, because then it's 
whether or not it's even part or parcel or whether it is 
or isn't part of it.  Here at least what they --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  "If committed" would 

break from "use of force."  The element is the use of 
force, but then the crime would have to have been

committed by a current or former spouse; so wouldn't an 
"if" separate what is the element, that is, use of 
force?

 MR. GIATRAS:  I don't believe that to 
use the word "if" changes our position, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, sure it would.  Just 

as an "is" --

MR. GIATRAS:  Well, "was," if --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, if you want to add 
words you can add "if," you can add "as is," you could 
rewrite the statute a lot of ways.

 MR. GIATRAS:  Well -- and one way is that 

this statute denotes that there is a part (c), of which 
there is no part (c).  This statute also lacks -- even 
though it's very insignificant in and of itself, by 
itself -- it lacks a period at the very end of double i.

 Again, no one particular point can be --

would say that we would allow that punctuation to 
overcome the purpose, or overcome the text, but when 
taken as a whole, when you have the text and an 
inartfully drafted statute that references sections that 
don't exist, that has grammatical errors in it and that 
leaves things up to the reader to have to decide whether 
something is involved or not involved; and you also then 
have a lack of sufficient congressional record, then I

believe that it certainly is favored to look at the rule 
of lenity in this case.  I do want to also --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you really think there is 

a notice problem here?  If you had been advising 
Mr. Hayes after he was convicted of this misdemeanor, 
and you read this, would you say well, you know, you're 
-- it's a good thing that you were convicted of this in 
West Virginia, where there isn't a specific statute 
targeting domestic violence, because it doesn't cover 
you.  If you had been convicted in another State under a 
specific domestic violence statute then you wouldn't be 
able to possess firearms but you're home free because of 
the nature of the statute in your State?

 MR. GIATRAS:  I believe it would have 

been -- in 1993, '94 time period, it would have been 
very difficult -- it would have been, it should have 
been very easy to -- to advise Mr. Hayes with respect to 
that issue.  Certainly.  That he would not have lost his 
rights at that point.

 Thereafter when Congress passed this 

statute, then I believe that -- does it become a little 
murky?  It probably does become a little murky.  After 
you have the hindsight of being able to one, take a look 
at the legislative record if that's the necessary, 
and/or consider that, and/or if you take a look at the

ATF regulation, the only problem is the ATF regulation 
takes it -- takes us back in time to what they would 
have -- what would have been or what they would have 
liked it to have been as opposed to what was actually 
legislated.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if -- counsel 

advising Mr. Hayes surely would have looked at what was 
the uniform position in all the circuits.  All the 
circuits that had this question before the floor read it 
the way the Government is urging.  So counsel I think 
would have been highly irresponsible to advise Mr. Hayes 
that he would be home free, simply because his own State 
didn't have a separate domestic violence statute.

 MR. GIATRAS:  And Justice Ginsburg, the only 

reason I say that in this particular case, is because 
Mr. Hayes was in 1993 -- and was pled in 1994, which was 
prior to enactment of this statute and/or any of the 
circuit court opinions.  So that was my -- that was the 
reason for my answer that in Mr. Hayes' case it would 
have been very simple and no one would have looked to 
those issues because those didn't exist.

 To bring to the -- to answer one of the 

questions from the Chief Justice with respect to what 
States may have had these laws in 1996, on page 24 of 
the Government's merits brief, the footnote number 9

denotes -- footnote number 9 denotes the States, which 
include Alabama, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Maine, 
North Carolina and the like.  Kansas, and Mississippi.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Is that 
the right list?  That's -- that's statutes passed after 
1996.

 MR. GIATRAS:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I looked at the 
amicus brief filed by the National Network, page 18 
footnote 53, and I see California, Illinois, Michigan, 
Ohio.  Which is the right list?

 MR. GIATRAS:  And that is the right list, 
Chief Justice, and that includes West Virginia in the 
1996, that was passed.  And that is there on footnote 
number 53, just so it's correct.

 Our reading of the statute is more 

reasonable than the Government's.  Certainly with 
respect to the variances of the grammatical errors and 
the grammatical leaps that the Government must take in 
order to substantiate its reading of the statute, we 
believe that ours is more reasonable.

 Likewise, the legislative history in this 
particular case is very weak, and if this Court even 
considers it, then I think you can take a look with 
respect to the text, the structure, the purpose and the

history and determine --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me be sure I 

understand the legislative history correctly in a broad 
sense.  The text of the bill as originally introduced in 
the Senate favors the Government.  Is that correct?

 MR. GIATRAS:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And there was a change 
made in the House in the form of an amendment to that 
bill?  Or was it a separate bill introduced in the 
House?

 MR. GIATRAS:  It was not a separate bill. 

There was -- there no committee -- there was no 
committee substitute, there was no committee hearings. 
It just --

JUSTICE STEVENS: 

They enacted a different 

text.

MR. GIATRAS:  Yes
 JUSTICE STEVENS: 

, they did.
And then -- without 

explanation.  And then the bill went back to the Senate. 
As I understand it, it was approved in the form enacted 
by the House without -- with only that one comment.

 MR. GIATRAS:  That is with only -- yes.  And 
that -- and that comment did not speak -- the comment of 
the sponsor did not speak with respect to the domestic 
violence, the domestic relationships element.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Thank you.  In this case, the 
Court has a choice between either reading the statute in 
a way that uses the words very unnaturally and unusually 
-- "committed by" to modify "use" and "element" --
treating a singular as plural, and the word "committed" 
--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if I could 

stop you there.  The very first sentence in the United 
States Code, 1 U.S.C. section 1, says the singular 
includes the plural.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Right, and this Court has 
said that you do that only when two things are true: 
When it makes sense in context, and we think it doesn't 
because of the word "committed," which Respondent wants 
to read right out of the statute, and also because you 
do it when it's necessary to fulfill the evident 
purposes of the statute.  And here, for the reasons we

explained, treating the singular as plural would be 
contrary to the purposes of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know, but 

basically what you're saying is we don't follow 1 U.S.C. 
section 1 because our reading is correct.  If they said, 
well, it doesn't -- you know, in context it doesn't 
fulfill the purposes and therefore we read "element" as 
singular only rather than according to section 1 of the 
United States Code.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  It's because the element --

the singular "element" has other indicia meaning it 
involves the word "committed" and then also this -- the 
fact that Congress's objective would be stymied if you 
took Respondent's reading.

 So you've got a choice between just using 

the words unnaturally -- "committed by," taking 
"committed" and just making it superfluous, as in 
Respondent's view, or treating the singular "element" as 
plural, or you can give, as the Government is 
suggesting, a natural and logical reading that you're 
talking about an offense of this certain violent 
character committed by these certain people.  And, yes, 
that involves looking slightly past Romanette (i) and 
(ii) structure to look at this being two clauses that 
both modify the word "offense."  You --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have to add words.  It 
is unavoidable.  To come to your reading, you must add 
words to the statute.  To adopt the reading of the other 
side on the other hand, you need not add a single word. 
You just have to resign yourself to the -- to the usage 
that is unusual but not unheard of, that a particular 
use was committed.  And the other side gives a number of 
examples, as does the brief by -- by linguists, a number 
of examples where that appears.

 So it's an unusual usage but not an unheard 

of usage.  They don't have to add a single word or a 
single hard break in the text.  You have to, to get to 
your construction.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  With respect, Justice Scalia, 

we don't agree with that, and I'll give you two 
illustrations that hopefully would help establish that 
point:  One, if you just read this all as a sentence 
without respect to the Romanettes (i) and (ii), you have 
an offense that is as a misdemeanor and has, as an 
element, committed by a certain group of persons.  That 
reads as a sentence.  There is an offense of a certain 
type committed by a certain group of persons.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  For that, you'd have to 

assume that the GS-12 who drafted this, or whoever the 
equivalent was in the Senate, put the "that" in the

wrong place.  If he had put the "that" after the (i) 
when he broke it down, it would all read as a sentence. 
The "that" would be for the first part, and you'd say 
"felony committed" for the part that interests us.  Does 
that work?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I think it would read better 

that way.  I think that it would --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You'd would have to put a 

"that" --

MS. SAHARSKY:  It would read --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You'd have to put a "that" 

at the beginning of (ii) as well, wouldn't you?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Again, I think if you just --

I don't think you need to.  I think you can just read 
through this all as one sentence.  And we looked at that 
previous -- while were you talking with Respondent's 
counsel, you looked at that previous version of the bill 
Congress considered, and it just had it all as one 
sentence.  It said "an offense of this certain character 
committed by this certain group of persons."  And that 
same structure is in the statute as enacted, and that 
shows that the "committed by" refers back to "offense."
 And to get back to the point I opened with, 
the way that you choose between the two constructions in 
this case is to look at what Congress would achieve

under Respondent's construction of the statute, which is 
a statute that applies only in 17 States, not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And, again, not to 
beat a dead horse, but it's footnote 8 of your brief on 
page 23 that lists the 17 States.  They include 
California, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia.  That 
wouldn't be a useless act by Congress to cover everybody 
in those States.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  No, but it wouldn't be 

consistent with what Congress was intending, which is to 
solve the nationwide problem that every person who 
proved that they were willing to hurt their family 
members should not be able to possess a firearm, whether 
they're a felon or whether they were convicted of a 
misdemeanor.  And that was the problem that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know, but you 

point was this doesn't do any good because it's only 17 
States.  Those are -- there are a lot of people in those 
States.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Right, but some persons in 
those States who commit the same types of offenses, as 
Justice Ginsburg pointed out -- you know, they commit 
the same violent acts against family members.  Some of 
them would be prosecuted under the regular -- under a 
specific domestic violence statute, but some would be

And it doesn't make any sense, in those same States, to 
treat some people as being subject to the possession ban 
and some people as not being subject to that possession 
ban.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It makes it easier to 

identify it.  You don't have to go back and look to see 
whether this particular assault conviction was an 
assault on a family member or not.  It's there on the 
face of the indictment.  Pretty important, it seems to 
me.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  With respect, Justice Scalia, 

you can't just tell from the face of the State 
indictment whether you would not be able to possess a 
firearm under Federal law, because the domestic 
relationship covered by the State offenses, it is a 
broader universe in each of those 17 States.  More 
domestic relationships are covered than are covered by 
the Federal statute.  So you could have been convicted 
in one of those 17 States of a specific domestic 
violence offense, and still that would not necessarily 
be the case that you couldn't possess a firearm under 
Federal law, because they cover, for example, dating

raised but just to get back to one other point that came 
up with Respondent's counsel, when a person wants to buy 
a firearm, he fills out this particular form, Form 4473, 
and that form specifically says on that offenses like 
assault and battery are covered.  The ATF regulation 
that has been in place since this statute was enacted 
says that those -- that offenses such as assault and 
battery are covered.  In fact, all the courts of appeals 
up until recently, nine of them had this settled 
understanding.  Aside from the ATF having it, Congress 
relied upon it.  And we think that it makes sense.
 You should reverse the judgment below.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:50 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
