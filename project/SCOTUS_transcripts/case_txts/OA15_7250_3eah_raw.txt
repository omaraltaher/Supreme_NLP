ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. RASHKIND 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

12 

13

15

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A single notice of appeal perfects the 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal -- the appeal of a criminal judgment and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence even if a part of that sentence is deferred. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It doesn't matter whether the appeal is first noticed at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the completion, after restitution is decided, or if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal is noticed at the outset, after the initial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing hearing.  In either event, that single notice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeal perfects appeal of all issues that arise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within that judgment and sentence when it is fully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

completed. 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

We know this in part because of the Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision in Dolan.  In Dolan the Court struggled with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mechanics.  How was the Court going to evaluate the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mandatory Victims Restitution Act?  What does it require 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a district court to do?  And after struggling through 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those mechanics, the Court said that essentially the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

1 

2 

second document fills in an amount-related blank in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original judgment that made clear that restitution was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

applicable. 

4 

            

It is clear that what happens second, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

restitution part, is nothing more than a completion of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the original judgment and sentence.  It is not a new 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment.  It is not a new sentence.  It is simply a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

completion, a fill-in-the-blanks as the Court has 

   

 

 

 

 

9 

phrased it. 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

            

We know not only from Dolan that this should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be the case, but we know it also by looking at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal appellate rules as they relate to criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  If we go down one by one each of the sections of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4(b), each section leads to a single conclusion.  Only 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

one notice of appeal is required. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about 3(c), which 

  

 

 

 

 

requires the notice of appeal to designate the judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order or part thereof being appealed?  So a notice of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal can't designate an order that has not yet been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

made. 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  That's correct, yet it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

entirely correct.  3(c) says designate the judgment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under review, which we've done here.  It was the initial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment, the June 24 judgment, and that is the one and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only that's under review.  At the time that it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

entered, it was interim or incomplete, provisional, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that the Court has seen previously in cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like Corey and Firstier Mortgage, judgments that were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not completely filled out by the time the notice of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal was filed.  But we are only appealing the June 24 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment as it was eventually completed by the later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

restitution proceeding. 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

            

We argue -- and I think the rules and Dolan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make clear, that there is but one notice of appeal --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but one judgment in these cases and it only has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noticed the one time. 

 

 

 

            

If we look at the balance of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you tell the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

difference between one judgment and an amended judgment? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Are you suggesting you don't have to appeal from an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

amended judgment? 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  That's correct.  In the case 

  

  

 

 

 

 

of the deferred restitution, the Court made clear that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was not an additional judgment occurring, an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amended judgment or an additional judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Again, to use the Court's words, the second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

document, if you will, is filling in the blanks of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment that was previously entered, leaving clear that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those blanks were yet to be filled in.  I --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what happens if your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

1 

2 

3 

initial appeal ends before the restitution order is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually entered?  Have you lost your right to appeal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that second, that restitution order? 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  No, for the following reason, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

Your Honor.  As we indicated at the outset, there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two times to appeal, and this has been recognized by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts below as well. 

 

 

 

8 

            

There are two times that the defendant may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

appeal.  He may either appeal at the outset right after 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing -- actually the more logical time to do it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be at the conclusion of the case.  There have been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions where defendants have wanted their appeals --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

sentencing? 

15 

            

16 

            

17 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  At the outset right after 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. RASHKIND:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. RASHKIND:  Right after sentencing, or 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

again after restitution.  So that option to appeal after 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the restitution is completed is always available.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

remains available if the initial appeal has ended, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there never was an initial appeal.  There is always an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity to appeal again.  The 14 days commence with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the original sentence, and again a window opens after 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the restitution is completed. 

 

 

 

25 

            

So there are, in fact, two, 14-day windows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

for the filing of a notice of appeal.  And that's not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something we've created.  That's something Congress has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

created. 

4 

            

5 

            

6 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Rashkind --

  

 

 

 

MR. RASHKIND:  Well -- go ahead. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Rashkind, as I hear you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

now, you're saying something different from what I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood your brief to be saying, so maybe I just -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood your brief to be principally arguing that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was a consequence of Rule 4(b)(2), and so far, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't heard you mention Rule 4(b)(2).  Instead, what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you seem to be saying is that regardless of Rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4(b)(2), we should treat the initial judgment and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later judgment as though they are the same judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And 4(b)(2) doesn't have to exist for that argument to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be correct.  I'm not saying that argument is correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it's a different argument than the argument I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood you to be making in your brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

So which are you making? 

 

 

 

 

MR. RASHKIND:  I'm really making both.  I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

not saying 4(b)(2) is not part of this equation.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

began to say that earlier, when I started to go down the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parts of rule 4(b) that I think clearly show we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing with a single judgment here.  4(b)(2) is very, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

very helpful to us, because it incorporates the Court's

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

decision in Lemke from 1953 in which the Court really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked at the question of what does a premature notice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeal really mean, if anything, and how much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significance does it have, if any. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A theme that the Court -- that case Lemke 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

became Rule 4(b)(2), and the Court revisited this in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Firstier Mortgage when it said there is a difference 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

between something that's tardy and something that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

early, and that the vice of one is not the same as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.  In the case of something that's tardy, we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about the failure to allow a judgment to become 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final as it should, once the time expires for appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's why the court is very, very concerned with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that's tardy.  But as in Firstier Mortgage, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and originally in Lemke, there is a recognition if you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file something too early, that's just a technical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

17 

violation. 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In your view, if you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordered an entry of a conviction based on jury verdict, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fixing sentence, order of restitution, amount to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined within 60 days, can you wait 60 days to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal everything?  Or must you file the first notice of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal within 14 days as to the sentence and the order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

of conviction? 

 

25 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  No, I think you -- certainly, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

1 

2 

I believe that that was the natural progression; you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waited until the completion of the full judgment in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

sentencing. 

4 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- you can now wait 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

until the order of restitution before you appeal the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence and the order of conviction? 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  You -- you can -- you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

wait until restitution is completed to do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you understand the 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

government to take that same position?  I can ask the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

government, but... 

 

12 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  I'm not sure that we've --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

we've actually briefed it in that very way.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it -- before Dolan, most of the circuits actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

handled it that way.  In the Eleventh Circuit from where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case arises, that was precisely the process.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eleventh Circuit would hold the notice of appeal in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abeyance, would not let it go forward until the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution judgment was completed. 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  No.  I asked, but 

    

  

  

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

that's -- but that's when the notice of appeal was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

timely filed.  I'm -- my question is, can you wait to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file the notice of appeal until the restitution amount 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is determined, say 60, 80 days later? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Yes.  And the answer to that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

10 

is "yes."  And that's because certainly, at that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

juncture, the -- the judgment is completed, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

window is always naturally open when a judgment is

conceptually, at least, that seems odd.  In other words, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're saying you can appeal what looks like a nonfinal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment.  It's got to be blank in it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Right. 

  

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you say you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal that, even though it's not complete.  And then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later on, you can appeal either the part that fills it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in, or the whole thing.  It seems to me that usually if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things are -- they're either final or not, and if they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not, you can't appeal; and if they are, you can. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Although it may seem like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that conceptually, that's precisely what the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confronted in Corey, precisely what the court looked at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Corey.  That was a provisional sentence that was to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be completed with the actual sentencing hearing much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later down the road, up to -- up to six months down the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

road, than the time the initial appeal would have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed.  That didn't make -- make the judgment final at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time of appeal.  It made it final enough.  Because 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was freighted with significant indicia of finality in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

the language of Corey for it to be obtained upfront. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not challenging 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

your reading of the case, but, I mean, that's a very 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unusual type of approach when it comes to jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules, you know, final enough, you know, and then you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get other cases, are they final -- like this one:  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this final enough or not.  It just seems to me we would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be better served by a simple rule. 

   

 

 

 

 

9 

            

And even the rule -- well, if you can do two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

different things, that means the court gave a notice of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal from the original judgment and they don't know --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they don't necessarily know if there's going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything more, right?  The restitution may be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

insignificant enough that you don't feel it's worth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adding that to the appeal issues, any number of things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So I don't see how they know should we hold onto this or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not hold onto it. 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

court of appeals never knows what the parties will be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing in their briefs until they are filed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I know they 

    

  

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

can't.  Here, the question is whether you're going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

add anything at all.  I mean, obviously, if the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution amount hasn't been entered, you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge the amount.  But they don't know in the court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

of appeals:  Well, is he going to file another notice of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal?  I guess we have to hold this in abeyance.  And 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then you hold it in abeyance, and who knows for how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long, because it doesn't actually have to be within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

90 days.  It just seems to me a very confusing system. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  As a practical matter, it has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

not been confusing at all to the courts of appeal, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been -- who have been struggling with this, both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before Dolan and after.  We have identified in our brief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 post-Dolan appeals, and the government has identified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another 15 post-Dolan appeals.  In every single one of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those cases, some of which took five and a half years 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the restitution to be resolved, three and a half 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years, two and a half years, many cases go by where they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are resolved within the 90-day limit and -- and they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

not --

 

17 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So does the Eleventh 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

Circuit routinely hold their appeals until the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution transcript is available? 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  At one time, at one time, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

Eleventh Circuit actually took the position it had to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wait.  It had no jurisdiction to proceed.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

post-Dolan, post-Dolan, it has modified that position. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it waited here.  Why 

  

  

 

 

 

 

25 

did it wait here? 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

1 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Because it does wait.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

that's the tradition in the Eleventh Circuit.  They look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the judgment -- they look at the judgement.  They --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court and the parties all know that there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution matter outstanding, and it's held in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

abeyance. 

7 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I just asked 

   

  

 

 

8 

whether they did it routinely, and you said not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

post-Dolan. 

10 

            

11 

            

So what do they do now? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. RASHKIND:  They do it, but I was saying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

before, they did it because to them, it was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional issue.  It's not jurisdictional anymore, 

  

 

 

 

 

but, yes, they still awaited. 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they still did.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

they don't know whether you're going to challenge it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until the brief comes in? 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

            

20 

anyway. 

21 

            

22 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they're holding it 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. RASHKIND:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do they give up holding 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

it if you ask them to give it up? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  It -- it doesn't require a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

true holding, because if we count the days it takes an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

appeal to go forward, there's 14 days to file a notice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeal, 14 more to order the transcript, 30 more for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the transcripts to come in and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

understand we're in a mine run case.  But how about in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those cases where restitution orders can take a year, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

two years, three years?  What does the Eleventh Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

do? 

9 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  The Eleventh Circuit, as 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

every other circuit, has awaited the outcome of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution orders, the restitution answer, before it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes forward to decide the appeal.  In all of the cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that were identified in the Petitioner's brief, and for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that matter, in the government's brief -- that's 32 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  There may be some duplicates there.  Post-Dolan 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

cases -- a single panel of a single court of appeals 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

captured all of the issues that were to be heard in one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  They were not concerned or troubled by anything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was still outstanding. 

 

 

 

20 

            

The reason for that really was predicted by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the Solicitor General's brief in Dolan itself.  It said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in most cases we can expect that the court will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve it either at sentencing or within 90 days, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that most appeals back then would take 12 months.  Now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they take 10.6 months.  That's plenty of time for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1

3 

record to be raised, the new transcript of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution hearing to be prepared, as it was in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, and for the parties to be able to fully brief the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

issue. 

5 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm not so sure. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

You're adding at least 90 days under your rule.  And in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the meantime, if there is to be a new trial, we have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems with witnesses being unavailable, the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

often in custody during this time.  Three months is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

insubstantial. 

11 

12 

13 

14 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  It is not insubstantial, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it is -- it is three months, 7.6 months shorter than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

average appeal.  I don't believe that there's anything 

    

 

 

 

 

 

about these cases --

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The average appeal is too 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

long.  You're adding the 90 days. 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Well, I don't think -- Your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Honor, I would submit you're not adding 90 days.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

many cases you may be adding -- in many cases you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adding no time, because it's resolved either at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing or -- not necessarily at the 90-day limit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but sometime within that time.  That time is, if -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm using an appropriate phrase -- dead time in an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal anyway.  It's when the briefs are being -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- it's when the transcripts are being ordered and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

transcripts are being prepared.  It is not time when the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties are yet briefing the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

The first time under the Federal Rules of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

Appellate Procedure that a brief is due in most cases is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the 98th day, over three months after the notice --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after the judgment is originally entered.  That's three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

months in the average case.  That's if a court reporter 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not ask for an extension of time to prepare the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transcripts; that's if the parties don't need additional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time.  That's if the court clerk can prepare the record 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the day the last transcript arrives, which I think is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

rarity too. 

 

13 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, you've been 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

talking about how it works, or how you think it should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have, but not any statutory reasons.  You rely heavily 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on 4(b)(2), but it doesn't even seem to apply by its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

terms. 

18 

            

It says, "Notice of appeal filed after the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

court announces a decision, sentence or order, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

before the entry of judgment." 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

And that would not seem to apply to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

situation here.  This wasn't before the entry of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment, the appeal of the restitution part.  It was --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was after. 

 

 

25 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  That is our argument, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

Honor, that it is.  The words "the judgment" in 4(b)(2) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not the -- the interim judgment.  It's speaking in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms as the court in rules normally do, to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completed final judgment.  And it is not completed until 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the restitution amount fills in the blanks of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original interim judgment. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

Our argument is that it applies for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

precisely that reason because it is making reference to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the completed judgment. 

 

 

10 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but -- so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

you're saying the rule doesn't apply, what I understood 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be the typical situation when it applies? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  It --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The court announces 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

a decision, you file the -- the notice of appeal, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then they get around to entering it in a couple of days? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  It does apply.  It applies in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

this setting.  As the judge did in this case, he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

announces, because he must by law, and under the Dolan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formulation he has to, he says, restitution is mandatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't ascertain the amount of damages currently, so I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to postpone hearing on that.  In this case, he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

postponed them for 60 days, ultimately decided just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under 90 days. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

1 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So he hasn't entered 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

a judgment with respect to the amount of restitution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  That's correct.  The judgment 

  

  

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

he has entered is as to the conviction, as to the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspects of sentence, which are final.  But he has not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet entered a judgment --

   

 

 

7 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But he also 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

hasn't -- he also hasn't announced a decision, and this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule applies to a notice of appeal filed after the court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

announces a decision. 

   

11 

            

12 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  He has --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  With respect to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

subsequent order, that -- nothing about the amount has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been announced yet. 

 

 

15 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  He has announced it in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

same way, for example, that the announcement was made in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corey, Behrens, and Firstier. 

 

 

 

18 

            

If I may explain:  When he says restitution 

   

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

is mandatory, that's like the judge saying in a -- in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bench statement in Firstier Mortgage, I'm going to grant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summary judgment.  He doesn't explain any findings of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact or any findings of law, without which you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each have an appeal.  You wouldn't be able to have an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal without those details. 

 

 

 

            

When he says, I'm going to grant summary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2 

judgment and nothing more, that's exactly like saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm going to grant mandatory restitution.  It's required 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

by statute. 

 

4 

            

In Firstier Mortgage, the court explored 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

whether or not that type of a bench announcement, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

without the fleshed out details, was sufficient enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to initiate an appeal.  And the Court said --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the bottom line was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

summary judgment.  Here, no -- no amount of restitution 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been determined. 

 

 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  The details, the amount have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not been fleshed out.  But the order is given that there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall be mandatory restitution. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there might not be an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal when the defendant knows what the amount is.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the amount is small, defendant might not appeal.  So we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't -- we don't know at the point where there's just a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blank whether the defendant is going to appeal -- appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

the amount. 

 

20 

21 

22 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  I think that's correct, but 

    

 

 

 

 

that's always correct that no one knows for sure what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues will be raised by the appellant until the brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

is written. 

 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Did I understand you, 

   

  

 

 

Mr. Rashkind, to say earlier that you think you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

have an argument even if 4(b)(2) didn't exist?  In other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, and another way to say this is suppose we think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 4(b)(2) deals with a different situation from the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation that you're talking about.  Do you still have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an argument --

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

7 

            

8 

4(b)(2)? 

9 

            

10 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- or is it dependent on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. RASHKIND:  Yes, we do. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What's -- what's the 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

argument that's exclusive of 4(b)(2)? 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  The argument boils down to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

this:  In reading 4(b), there is not a single instance 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Federal rules regarding criminal appeals in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which two notices of appeal are required in a single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

appeal. 

17 

            

Every single time the rules drafted 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

encountered the possibility that two notices of appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be required, they immediately rewrote the rules to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoid that possibility.  Part of that is 4(b)(2).  Part 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that is further down the rule.  Part of that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4(b)(5) where there's a -- a rule 35(a) correction of a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence.  At every turn, the drafters of the rules have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made it clear that one notice of appeal is all that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required as to the one judgment and sentence in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

criminal case. 

 

2 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it's 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

addressed specific instances, as you say, in which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue may come up.  But it hasn't addressed your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

situation. 

6 

            

7 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  It has not. 

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I -- and it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

one of those arguments.  You're saying whenever they see 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, they provide for it, but they haven't seen it yet, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least with respect to the drafting of the rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Part of that --

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So maybe it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

apply in that situation. 

 

 

 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Part of that I think is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

matter of timing.  It has only happened since 2010 that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court interpreted the statute to have the mechanics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we speak of today.  Before that time, the circuits were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

split as to how they were handling it, so for -- it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't necessary to say more. 

 

 

 

 

            

For example, in the Eleventh Circuit Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

of --

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That might be true, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

still, aren't we to wait until Congress fixes it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Well, the rule --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Presumably, Congress sees 

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

problems; Congress fixes problems.  And -- and you might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be right that this is the kind of problem that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has fixed in the past, but that by itself doesn't seem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to give us the ability to go fix it ahead of the time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they do. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  If I may suggest why I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

think -- I think it would not be Congress so much as the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules' drafters.  The Court would recommend these rules 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then -- with Congress's approval or disapproval. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

And here is why I think the drafters have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

not gone forward:  Because in black and white in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's decision in Dolan, it acknowledged that these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of issues would arise and that the Court would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need to address them.  And perhaps they felt it would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumptuous if the Court says we see that these kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of problems going -- are going to arise and we'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address them, and instead the rules drafters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretermitted those decisions coming up with their own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answers to those questions. 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's the legal 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

principle that gives us the authority to create this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception?  Let's assume we -- we agree with you that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the rules don't cover this particular situation.  Let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume further we don't buy the government's argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that notices of appeal are jurisdictional.  And you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

1 

2 

3 

get into that when you're ready, but so let's just deal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with it's not jurisdictional.  What gives us the power 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do this? 

 

 

4 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  The power is in the rules. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

The Court decided decades ago that the rules would tell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers how to proceed in litigation.  The rules are to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

be clear. 

 

8 

            

When, for example, one of the rules on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

civil side made it possible for a lawyer to make a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistake by not filing a second notice of appeal, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something the Court recognized in its Griggs decision, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the rules drafters went right back and immediately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed that rule and said in their commentary it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed to eliminate the trap for the unwary that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previous rule created.  The rules are designed so that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a fair administration of justice without great 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cost and delay, without confusion. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

These rules say that you must notice an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

appeal from a final judgment.  That was done in this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  In fact, the final judgment in this case, and all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases like it, has this anomaly.  The notice of appeal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is at the same time timely and partially untimely.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a notice of appeal filed at a time when the court of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals would say that's so early; we need to dismiss; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we -- we have no jurisdiction, because it's unquestioned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

7 

that the court of appeals had jurisdiction over the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction and all aspects of the sentence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incarceration, the term of supervised release.  That it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had on the same day that the notice of appeal was filed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And in the anomaly, it perhaps didn't have jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or it was early to have jurisdiction over the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution portion.  That's --

  

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So isn't it easy and not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

a trap for us just to simply say, file two notices of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal?  That's what the government says.  File it when 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you get imprisoned; file another one when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution order is in place, and everything will be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

fine. 

14 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  I think a fair answer to that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

is, of course the court could have such a process.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would urge against it, and it's certainly one that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not in place at the present time.  It is not one that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governs the proceedings that occurred here and have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred up --

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no.  But there are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

21 

other jurisdictions that actually require that. 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Well, there are -- there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

one that requires it.  There's one that's so unsure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the answer, it has both accepted a single notice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeal and yet recommended the safer course is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

25 

file two.  There is one jurisdiction has repeatedly just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held over -- in two jurisdictions, have held over and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over under Rule 4(b)(2), that the original notice of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

appeal matures. 

 

5 

            

Now, those cases don't go into the kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

thought that we have here.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, right.  But Justice 

  

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

Sotomayor's question was, why not?  The virtue of having 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two notices of appeal, it's definite, a certain time, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

people know what to do.  When you have one notice of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal and then maybe you're going to add a few 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments later, did you -- did they have a fair chance 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to answer?  What is that later time?  It raises a lot of 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

questions. 

15 

            

So the simplest thing with a rule, and it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

doesn't hurt anybody, is what I think she was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting:  Just follow what the government says there. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

You appeal, then you appeal. 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  I think my answer to that is, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

although that may be intuitive --

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MR. RASHKIND:  -- the rules don't require 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

lawyers to use their intuition. 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But the rule says --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. RASHKIND:  The rule says to follow the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

1 

rules. 

2 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You're just being literal 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

in the rule.  The rule says in a criminal case, a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's notice of appeal must be filed within 14 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

days of the order being appealed from.  That's one of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the things -- and you're appealing from the order which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, pay so much. 

 

 

 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  And in this case, it would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the judgment, because there really are no appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of right by a defendant from an order. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  From the judgment.  So we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

have a judgment which says -- judgment says, and it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaves restitution open.  Then we have another judgment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is -- says how much the amount is.  I mean, that's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so simple, and all the lawyers would understand it, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other seems more complicated. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, what's your response to that? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  My response is that that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not the mechanical formulation that the Court provided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Dolan.  It wrestled with that, the majority --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Dolan didn't --

  

 

 

 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  -- wrestled with --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I know whether it answered 

    

 

 

 

 

the question.  But in one second, I'm going to conclude 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you don't have a reason, other than I would read 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

27 

the text.  Your reason is if the text literally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires -- doesn't require it, then it doesn't. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

4 

            

But do you have any answer other than that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. RASHKIND:  It would be the first time in

which two notices of appeal are required in a criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  And that, by itself, confuses the process of what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the appeals are trying to accomplish.  The appeals are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to -- the rules are trying to make it possible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for lawyers to know what to do and when.  They are clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to the criminal side that there is only one notice of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal that's required.

If I may reserve the balance of my time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

            

Mr. Kedem.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM 

 

 

 

 

16 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

please the Court: 

 

 

              

A criminal defendant may appeal an award of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution by filing a notice of appeal after the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount is determined and entered against him in the form 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a criminal judgment.  Appellate Rule 4(b)(2) applies 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to a notice of appeal that's filed after the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

announcement of a sentence, but before entry of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment memorializing the sentence.  It does not apply.

Whereas here, the notice of appeal is filed long before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court even decides the appropriate sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

If I could begin --

   

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I ask about the 

   

  

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

criminal rule -- what number is it? -- 32, the provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that says, "Appealing a sentence.  After sentence, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

the sentence." 

 

9 

            

10 

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And Defendant was so 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

advised after the sentence was issued.  There was no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such instruction, no such advice from the Court when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution order was entered. 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what is your position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

on whether the Court must advise the defendant of any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to appeal the restitution order? 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Absolutely, it must.  And I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

think when courts do that, as they absolutely should, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will prevent cases like this from arising again in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

future. 

22 

            

23 

this case. 

 

24 

            

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it didn't happen in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the Court committed an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

1 

error and it wasn't harmless. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Well, the way the Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

addressed those sorts of errors -- and this was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussed in the Peguero case, which is cited in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote to our brief -- is to ask whether the litigant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was aware of their opportunity to appeal.  There's been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no suggestion here by a Petitioner that the litigant or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his attorney were unaware of the opportunity to appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think in Mr. Rashkind's 

    

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

reply brief, he represents that there was no awareness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the opportunity to appeal.  I mean, the only thing 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that gives you pause in a case like this is just because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually, you only have to file one notice of appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You do get worried about, you know, traps for the unwary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a person who just won't understand that there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

another stage in this process and needs to file a notice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

of appeal. 

 

18 

            

As long as the Court is fulfilling its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

obligation of saying, okay, now, you know, if you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an objection to this, you need to file another notice of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal, well, that solves the problem.  But if the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't say it, it doesn't solve the problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And apparently, that's what happened in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  And Mr. Rashkind represents that his client 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't know of his opportunity to, or his need to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

appeal. 

2 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Well, with respect to this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

Petitioner, I think that that's true.  Once the Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

makes unmistakably clear that a second notice of appeal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is required, I don't think this is the sort of thing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's likely to arise in the future. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So would we find this to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a Rule 32 error? 

   

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Pardon? 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why don't we just say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this was a Rule 32 error? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  If you're talking about harmless 

  

 

 

 

 

 

error, I think the types of errors that are cognizable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under -- I think it's Federal Criminal Rule 52, whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're talking about harmless errors or --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm talking about a 

  

 

 

 

 

Rule 32 error. 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I see. 

    

 

            

Rule 32 errors are dealt with in the manner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was discussed in Peguero.  And so if there was an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error of that sort here, then the proper remedy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming one is available, would be to file a 2255 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition, assuming that those apply to restitution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

orders. 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Other than making a 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

Supreme Court case of this issue, given the practices in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Eleventh Circuit where the Court automatically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears to wait for the restitution transcript to come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and for these issues to be litigated once -- I'm not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to talk about whether that's efficient or not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They've chosen it to be efficient.  And virtually in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every other case, you've never raised an objection. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

Why did you raise an objection here?  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

was the purpose of doing this?  Was it to make a test 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

case? 

11 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Not to my knowledge.  I think 

    

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

the general principle that you can't appeal a decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that hasn't yet been met is a pretty standard principle 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the law generally, not just in criminal cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

            

17 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's just --

  

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  And I can't --

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- such a hybrid 

   

  

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

situation.  He's absolutely right.  In most criminal 

  

  

 

 

 

 

appeals, it's one criminal appeal from a final judgment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It doesn't appear as if you raised this timeliness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection in the Eleventh Circuit as a matter of course. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

23 

            

24 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why in this case? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  Well, in the Eleventh Circuit, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

the Court had decided in a case called Muzio -- and that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

happened in -- I believe it was July of 2014, so before 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the restitution hearing, but not much before it -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a criminal defendant in Petitioner's situation had two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

options:  They could either file a notice of appeal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

after the initial sentencing and then a second notice of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal after restitution was ordered, or they could wait 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until the end and file one notice of appeal after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution.  And so that decision came down in July of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

2014. 

10 

            

And we cannot verify or dispute the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

representations that Petitioner has made that in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits, courts always wait. 

 

 

 

13 

            

But, Justice Kennedy, I think you identified 

   

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

a very troubling implication of Petitioner's argument: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Namely, that it would prevent, in many cases, criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants from getting an immediate appeal from their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction in their terms of imprisonment.  Because if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner is correct about Appellate Rule 4(b)(2), it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means that the notice of appeal that he filed wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take effect; it wouldn't become effective until after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution was ordered, which means that the appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process really shouldn't begin until that point, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is especially troubling for criminal defendants who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normally want to get their appeals up and going as soon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

as possible.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Either in the rules 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

themselves or in the colloquy that takes place in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal system, is the restitution part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

sentence? 

5 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Restitution is certainly part of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

the sentence. 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So that Rule 32(b) that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg quotes is applicable.  There has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be -- there has to be advice of the right to appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's correct.  What many 

  

  

 

 

 

district courts do is they have sentencing scripts which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they read at the end of a sentencing.  And there's no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason that they couldn't -- for instance, at the end of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the script that they used for a restitution hearing --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make sure that they advise a criminal defendant that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they have a right to separately appeal restitution. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why -- why -- you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

I think you answered this, but I didn't grasp what the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

answer was. 

 

20 

            

The -- the judge makes a mistake.  Doesn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

advise the defendant, if you want to appeal a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution order you have to file a notice of appeal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Didn't say that.  Isn't it harmful error, that slip that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court made? 

 

 

25 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So the Court addressed this in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

the Peguero case and talked about a situation in which a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice of appeal was not filed, and the Court denied --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advised the defendant to file a notice of appeal and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a proper procedure that you have to go through 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the type of prejudice that you're talking about has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to depend in part on the State of knowledge of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal defendant and his attorney. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

9 

            

But if I could, more directly --

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, but if they don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

have knowledge, which is what we're assuming here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because that was alleged --

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. KEDEM:  So I'm not sure it actually was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

alleged.  I don't see any place in Petitioner's brief 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

where they represent that they didn't know they had a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to appeal.  And with respect to their argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they didn't know they had to file a second notice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeal, that was inconsistent with directly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable case law in the very same circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

If I could --

   

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But here, in fact, when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

the restitution judgment was entered, the clerk of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court sent that order to the court of appeals. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So it was an amended judgment that was sent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

The -- the clerk of the court treated it as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

though it were an amendment to the judgment, and it went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

to the court of appeals.  So it seems to me to be the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

height of formalism to say that there has to be a second 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice.  The clerk had already notified the court of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals that the judgment had been amended to include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

restitution. 

6 

            

MR. KEDEM:  There's certainly some amount of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

formalism, but let me explain why I don't think that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's just formalism. 

 

 

9 

            

The general principle that you can't appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

a decision that hasn't been made I think makes sense and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not only consistent with the rules, but also with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the way things normally work in litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

Let me give you three examples of cases in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

which you actually would need a second notice of appeal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a criminal case. 

   

 

16 

            

The first is a motion under Rule 35(a) of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

the criminal rules to correct a sentence.  If you file 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your notice of appeal before making a Rule 35(a) motion, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the courts of appeals generally require you to file a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second notice of appeal if what you want to challenge is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the resolution of the Rule 35(a) motion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

Similarly, Rule 35(b) allows a court to, 

   

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

based on the substantial cooperation of a criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

defendant, alter the sentence.  If the sentence is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

altered and the defendant wants to challenge that, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

36

the defendant has to file a second notice of appeal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

And the third example relates specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8

10

to restitution, because under the Mandatory Victims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Restitution Act you can actually end up with several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different restitution awards and therefore several 

 

 

 

 

 

different judgments.  And that's because criminal --

  

 

 

 

 

 

victims of criminal offenses have 60 days to bring up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new losses which they can raise to the court's attention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at any time.  And if they do, the court has to award and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide whether there's a new award of restitution.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

not clear how Petitioner's approach either to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 4(b)(2) or his approach to judgments would handle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  Whether --

  

 

14 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under your approach then, 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

if there are four different victims and you -- and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court has seriatim hearings and makes seriatim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments, there has to be four different notices of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

appeal? 

19 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I'm not aware of any scenario in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

which a court with respect to --

   

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's my hypothetical. 

  

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  Sure.  I understand. 

    

  

 

23 

24 

25 

              

I think that if you're talking about things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that were understood to be part of the original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing, you can wait until that's complete and file 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

37 

1 

one notice of appeal. 

 

 

 

2 

            

But if you're talking about completely new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

losses, there's no reason why the original notice of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal should suffice to challenge a decision that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't yet been made. 

 

 

 

6 

            

And keep in mind the nature of Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

challenge here, which is not to the fact of restitution, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which he acknowledges was mandatory under the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He objected to the amount of restitution, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically, to the sufficiency of the evidence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government put forward at the hearing to justify the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$4500 that was awarded in restitution.  And there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply no way that Petitioner at the time he filed his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice of appeal could have had any idea about the basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

for that. 

 

16 

17 

18 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The issue here 

  

 

 

 

 

strikes me as -- as somewhat similar to the issue that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arises in the civil context with respect to attorneys' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

fees. 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

You have a judgment and you're entitled to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys' fees because you've won, but of course they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know what those are yet.  And then they have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing down the road. 

 

 

 

            

What is the rule there?  One notice of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal, two notices of appeal? 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

1 

            

MR. KEDEM:  The rule there is you have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

file a second notice of appeal.  And I'd point you to a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case called Ray Haluch Gravel.  That's a good example 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

where you might have a judgment for the defendants on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summary judgment and then a notice of appeal.  And at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time it grants summary judgment, the district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, I'm going to determine at a later time the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate amount of attorneys' fees. 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

You cannot, on the basis of the first notice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

of appeal, challenge the amount of attorneys' fees.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to file a second notice of appeal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

We also think that --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  In the civil context, am I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

right that sometimes you file a second notice of appeal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but you're -- the rules waive fees? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But not here?  I mean, it's 

    

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

a little bit odd.  In the civil context, fees would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waived for the second notice of appeal and -- and in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal context not. 

 

 

21 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Well, fees would not be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

raised -- would not be waived in the specific scenario 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Chief Justice posited.  There are only certain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very limited scenarios in which it would be waived, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you're talking about a scenario like this one, but a

4 

criminal defendant who unlike Petitioner was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indigent, I don't see any reason why the defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't be able to file an amended notice of appeal, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and many circuits don't require an additional fee. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

And if the fee issue is something that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

Court is concerned about, that is the sort of thing that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would be appropriate for the rules committee to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

address. 

9 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're recognizing that 

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

he could file -- you could treat as an amended notice of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal, so it's one notice of appeal but it's been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

amended. 

13 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I think you have to take a step 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

to amend the notice of appeal, because, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg, as you yourself pointed out, Appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 3(c)(1)(b) requires the notice of appeal to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify the judgment being appealed, and if you want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see the notice of appeal that Petitioner filed, I would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct you to page 42 of the joint appendix where he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

states very specifically that he is seeking appeal, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote, "From the final judgment and sentence entered in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this action on the 24th day of June, 2014." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

So the -- he's seeking review of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

judgment that did not include restitution. 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, the Peguero 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

case, I -- do you read that as saying that if there is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice to the defendant who wasn't advised of his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to appeal, that defendant is entitled to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

collateral relief? 

 

5 

            

6 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I do read it that way. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I suppose the 

   

  

 

 

 

7 

8 

collateral relief is what, reopening the -- the case so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he can file a notice of appeal? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I think in that case, if you're 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

talking about a case that's cognizable on 2255, I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the remedy could be re-entry of the judgment to give him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another opportunity to file his notice of appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

If I could briefly return just to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

Rule 4(b)(2) argument, because I think the text of that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule explains why it is that it doesn't apply to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

case. 

17 

            

4(b)(2) refers to entry -- announcement of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

sentence followed by entry of the judgment, which I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think makes clear that you're talking about precisely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same judgment that was just announced.  And that's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty familiar pattern in criminal cases where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences get announced and then they get entered into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the docket.  It's sort of like opening and closing a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pair of parentheses, and usually that happens within a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

few days of one another, if not a few hours. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

1 

            

And so when you're talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

Rule 4(b)(2), you're really talking about the notice of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal that would have been filed, for instance, after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the September 17 hearing at which a $4500 award of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution was announced but before it was entered into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the docket the next day.  But that's obviously not what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're dealing with here. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why couldn't you treat a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

notice of appeal as adequate to cover modifications of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judgment from which the appeal is taken?  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what this is.  It's a modification of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

judgment. 

13 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I think that would be 

    

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

inconsistent with a few existing appellate rules of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

procedure.  And I -- I think you could change the rules, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps, to deal with that situation, but it would be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairly radical change in the way that notices of appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and jurisdiction normally work, because normally we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think of a notice of appeal as transferring to the court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeals' jurisdiction over all of the elements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contained in the judgment that was identified.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead you would be transferring on a prospective basis 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions that had yet to be made.  And I think it would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also, for the reasons that the Chief Justice identified, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be for a court of appeals very confusing.  Because 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

remember that, in many cases, criminal defendants have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong incentive to get their appeal up and going as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

soon as possible.  That's especially true if you're a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal defendant who's got a short prison term or you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to be let out on bail pending appeal.

6 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You said -- I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

going to get the phrase right -- jurisdiction over all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the elements of the appeal, or something like that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's right.  Contained in the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

10 

judgment that you have appealed. 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But I 

  

  

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

thought the basic rule was -- and your friend has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphasized this in his briefs -- that you get the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You don't get different elements that may have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicated or whatever.  If you're filing the appeal, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the whole case goes up. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Sure.  I -- I don't think that 

    

   

  

 

 

 

that's accurate.  The only authority he can point to for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that proposition is the Corey decision.  But that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually was a very different scenario that I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

actually supports the government. 

 

 

 

22 

            

In Corey you were dealing with a statute in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

which a district court was authorized to impose a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisional sentence to the statutory maximum, and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within six months it could revisit that sentence and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

reduce the sentence based on new information.


 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the question in Corey was whether the


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal defendant who filed a notice of appeal only


   

 

 

 

 

 

 

after that later-reduced sentence had waited too long to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge his conviction.  It wasn't a challenge to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

sentence or anything that happened at the second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing.  Instead, it was a challenge to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

1 

2


3


4


5 

6 

7 

8 

conviction. 

9 

            

And what this Court said is no, both the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

original -- the original sentence to the statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maximum and the later sentence were sufficiently final 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they can be appealed, which is consistent with what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court has said in Dolan, and the government agrees, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is that you can file a notice of appeal either 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from your initial sentence or from your later sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Or you can wait until the very end and file one notice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeal at the very end that will allow you to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge all elements of your sentence, including your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

conviction.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, maybe this would be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

good segue.  This -- this -- you understand the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement of a notice of appeal to be jurisdictional. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Do you understand the requirement of timeliness to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional or not? 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Not in the criminal context. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Now, I understand it 

   

  

  

 

 

9 

doesn't matter in this case --

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- because you objected. 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

But in the criminal context, that's a non-jurisdictional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  That's just a claims processing rule --

15 

            

16 

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that correct? 

  

 

 

 

And are there requirements as to what counts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

as a notice of appeal?  In other words, suppose I'm a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant and I miss my 14 days, I don't file a notice 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

of appeal within that time.  Actually, I don't file it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

later; I file a brief. 

   

   

21 

            

22 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Does the brief count as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

notice of appeal? 

 

 

24 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Yes.  A brief, in certain 

    

  

 

 

 

25 

situations, has been deemed to count as a notice of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

45 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  In certain situations? 

  

 

 

 

MR. KEDEM:  Well, the case -- there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

appeal. 

2 

            

3 

            

4 

5 

6 

7 

specific Supreme Court case, the name of which escapes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me at the moment, but the Court dealt with it in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pro se situation.  I don't know whether the Court would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

feel the same way if it were someone who's represented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

by counsel. 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  But assuming that 

  

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

that's not just applicable to pro se situations, I file 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a brief; I file it late; the government doesn't say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything about it.  The appeal goes forward? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

15 

            

MR. KEDEM:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. KEDEM:  I would also point out that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

there's a rule that also allows district courts -- and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is Appellate Rule 4(B)(4) -- to extend by 30 days 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the deadline for filing a notice of appeal so long as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can show reasonable -- reasonable diligence or good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause.  And I think good cause might be shown by a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel's ineffective assistance.  So that would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

another way to deal with the same thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Turning now, perhaps, to Appellate Rule --

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to Rule 52.  The types of errors that are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cognizable, as I said earlier, are errors in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

46 

district court's proceedings.  They are not a party's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

own failure to comply with the rules necessary to bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the issue up for appellate consideration.  And if it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

were --

 

5 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why -- why isn't the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

judge's failure to give the necessary advice, why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't that come under Rule 52? 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. KEDEM:  Well, I'm not sure that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

relief that Petitioner is asking for here is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correction for that error.  I think the Court has 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

already conceived of a different mechanism as the proper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

way to deal with that. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that seems to -- to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have another -- yet another proceeding, a 2255, instead 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of saying, well, the judge forgot to give them the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the advice, so that was a harmful error. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. KEDEM:  I think, Justice Ginsburg, that 

    

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

would be inconsistent with the way the Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceived of its mandatory claim processing rules, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which it has said consistently that a party's failure to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply with such a rule, so long as it's invoked by the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side at the appropriate time, means that dismissal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the claim is mandatory.  You don't have a separate 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry into prejudice. 

 

 

            

There are a number of Federal rules that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

include time limits.  And if a party's failure to comply 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with one of those time limits could be excused absent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice to the other side, then I think those time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits would no longer be mandatory in a -- in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

meaningful sense. 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

              

I think it's also inconsistent with another 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal rule that I would point out, which is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 3(a)(2), which you can find at page 6A of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix to the government's brief, which states, "An 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellant's failure to take any step, other than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

timely filing of a notice of appeal, does not affect the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

validity of the appeal," which again suggests if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have a proper notice of appeal, you don't have a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

valid appeal. 

 

15 

            

16 

            

17 

            

18 

remaining. 

If the Court has no further questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Rashkind, you have three minutes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. RASHKIND 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

If I may begin with the last point, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

reason Rule 3(a)(2) makes the statement it does is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because in the civil context, the timeliness, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

temporal limits on a notice of appeal, are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

jurisdictional.  And so 3(a)(2), which captures both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

civil and criminal appeals, would need to say that.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not say, though, that in a criminal case those same 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues apply in exactly the same way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

It is perceptive to note that the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

court failed to comply with Rule 32(j), because that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advice was an important piece of advice in this very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case:  Not that he had a right to appeal, but that he 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had a duty to appeal again. 

   

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So is the government 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

right, however, that the Eleventh Circuit had issued a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision telling you to file a second notice of appeal? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Telling the public, not you personally. 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Well, I disagree that that's 

   

  

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

what happened.  The Muzio case did not involve a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant who was appealing restitution.  And the battle 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Muzio case, which was issued about the same time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the hearing in this case, the majority judge, Judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wilson, and the concurring judge, Judge Kugler, both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, we are absolutely not going to decide whether that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice of appeal could have captured the early -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution and the other, because restitution is not at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

issue. 

24 

25 

            

So a discussion in Footnote 9 of a case that 

   

   

   

 

 

 

is not on point at all, and does not become final -- so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

1 

2 

3

5 

6 

it was not denied in that case until after the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution hearing and judgment in this case, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rehearing was denied by this Court in the next year -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submit that a decision that isn't final, that isn't on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, and makes its reference by a footnote is not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

telling the lawyers how to proceed on an appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7

you. 

11 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. RASHKIND:  The point of the rule --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sorry to interrupt 

  

 

 

 

 

What is the citation for the case that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

relevant in --

 

 

13 

            

(Laughter.) 

14 

            

MR. RASHKIND:  Muzio is -- Muzio is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

discussed throughout the Manrique decision.  And its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

citation is --

 

 

17 

            

18 

            

19 

            

20 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 

  

 

 

MR. RASHKIND:  -- 757 F.3d 1243. 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Thank you. 

  

  

 

 

 

MR. RASHKIND:  So I don't think it's fair to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

say that lawyers were on notice.  That's why I come back 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the Court and say that even the Court shouldn't be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding this in an opinion.  It belongs in the rules. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

Lawyers are entitled to pick up a book of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

rules and determine how they should proceed.  And what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

has been clear in these rules from the beginning as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal cases, one notice of appeal is all that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

required. 

4 

            

Where Congress legislates in a way that 

   

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

creates this sort of anomaly where there might be two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

windows to appeal, it shouldn't change the underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules.  They are that if you file a notice of appeal as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a type -- which is timely as to part of the sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and judgment, that it remains timely as to all aspects 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that as it is completed. 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

The case is submitted.
