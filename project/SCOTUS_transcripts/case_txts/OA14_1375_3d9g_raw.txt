CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We  will  hear 

  

 

 

 

 

argument  first  this  morning  in  Case  14­1375,  CRST  Van 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Expedited  v.  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Smith. 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  PAUL  M.  SMITH 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

On  the  issue  we  initially  asked  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  resolve  in  the  petition  for  certiorari,  the  parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  now  in  complete  agreement.  That  issue,  of  course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  whether  a  prevailing  defendant  in  a  Title  VII  case 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  barred  from  seeking  attorneys'  fees  if  it  hasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevailed  on  the  merits.  As  we  showed  in  our  opening 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief,  such  a  rule,  which  exists  only  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Circuit,  makes  little  sense.  It  doesn't  ­­ it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  not  compelled  by  the  statutory  language  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  serve  any  rationing  statutory  policy  to  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away  the  power  of  work  fees  in  a  ­­ in  a  case  of  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­merits  disposition. 

 

            

The  EEOC,  having  staunchly  defended  that 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  in  its  brief  in  opposition,  executed  an  about­face 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  its  merits  brief  and  now  agrees  with  us  that  a

non­merits  disposition  can  be  the  basis  of  a  defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys'  fee  award  under  Title  VII. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  for  that  reason  and  for  all  the  reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  opening  merits  brief,  which  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparently  found  convincing,  at  least,  we  would  suggest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Court  should  reverse  the  Eighth  Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruling  and  resolve  the  circuit  conflict  and  rule  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevailing  defendants  can  seek  fees  as  long  as  they  meet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Christiansburg  standard,  whether  or  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposition  was  on  the  merits. 

 

 

 

 

            

If  there  are  no  questions  about  that,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  issue  is,  what  do  we  do  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't  the  standard 

  

 

 

 

whether  the  EEOC's  actions  were  frivolous,  unreasonable, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  without  foundation? 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  That's  the  Christiansburg 

  

 

 

 

standard,  yes,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what  difference  does 

  

 

 

 

 

it  make  on  what  ground  it  was  dismissed? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  I  couldn't  agree  more. 

    

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I've  been  reading  these 

  

 

 

 

 

briefs,  and  with  or  without  prejudice,  merits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­merits,  I  don't  know  that  even  if  a  judge  gets  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  point  of  deciding  whether  it  was  on  the  merits  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not,  that's  not  enough.  You  always  have  to  decide  the

bottom  line. 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Right.  But  the  Eighth  Circuit's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

ruling  was  that  even  if  it  was  frivolous  or  unreasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  without  foundation,  if  the  reason  it  was  frivolous  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable  or  without  foundation  was  the  fact  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  res  judicata,  or  was  time­barred  or  something  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  There  wasn't  the 

  

 

 

 

slightest  suggestion  of  any  frivolity  or  groundlessness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  this  complaint. 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Your  Honor,  there  certainly  is. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

As  the  case  turned  out,  they  never  had  any  foundation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  for  bringing  this  class  claim.  They  never  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  pattern  of  practice  that  they  could  identify  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  prove. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  They  ­­ the  claim  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  many  women  had  been  harassed  by  lead  drivers,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one,  but  many. 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  That  was  ­­ that  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegation,  Your  Honor.  But  in  order  to  bring  a  class 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  ­­ a  collective  claim  under  Title  VII,  what  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EEOC  needs  is  a  pattern  or  practice,  which  means  either 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  express  policy  that's  discriminatory  or  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unexpressed  standard  operating  procedure.  That's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

term  the  Court  used  in  the  Teamster's  case.  In  the

absence  of  that,  what  you  have  is  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  thought  that  was  the 

    

 

 

 

 

whole  thing,  that  the  ­­ the  ­­ that  the  company  was  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving  the  lead  drivers  adequate  training.  To  put  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bluntly,  they  were  not  taking  sexual  harassment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seriously. 

            

            

MR.  SMITH:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That  was  ­­ that  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  about  the  employer,  that  there  were  complaints 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  these  lead  drivers,  and  the  ­­ and  the  employer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  didn't  take  them  seriously. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  But  what  became  clear  as  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  proceeded  is  that,  A,  the  EEOC  never  investigated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  kind  of  pattern  or  practice  at  the  investigatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phase.  They  only  investigated  two  cases.  And  then  when 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ when  they  started  alleging  that  they  had  a  pattern 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  practice  and  telling  the  Court  they  wanted  to  go  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  on  a  pattern  of  practice,  we  ­­ we  filed  a  motion 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  summary  judgment  and  said,  what  is  your  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  a  consistent  policy  of  disregarding  these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

complaints,  that  there  is  a  consistent  failure? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  the  ­­ and  as  Judge  Reed  found, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  evidence  didn't  remotely  support  that.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  ­­

MR.  SMITH:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  There  were  well  over  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SMITH:  Your  Honor,  the  ­­ the  EEOC's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion  that  we  did  not  answer  their  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  was  looked  at  in  detail  both  by  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  and  by  the  Eighth  Circuit,  and  they  both  concluded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  only  ­­ the  question  at  issue  was  a  question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  people  who  had  complained  about  the  conduct  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  in  this  case,  meaning  Ms.  Starke  ­­ Ms.  Starke's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harassment.  The  ­­ the  suggestion  that  we  had  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answered  that  question  completely  was  rejected  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  on  Pages  168  and  69  of  the  Petition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix.  It  was  rejected  by  the  Eighth  Circuit  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factually  baseless  on  Page  92  of  the  Petition  Appendix. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  simply  didn't  ask  a  question  that  called  for  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until  later  in  the  investigation.  And  what  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ all  the  judges  below,  the  ­­ the  district  judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  majority  in  the  Eighth  Circuit,  concluded  is  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answered  every  question  in  the  investigation  fully  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accurately.  So  that  is  not  a  basis  for  what  ­­

were  initially  asked  how  many  complaints  have  you  gotten 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  tell  us  the  names  of  the  people  who  have  complained, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  came  up  with  two  people? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  It  is  true  that  they  named  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  And  as  Judge  Reed  concluded  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

it? 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That  wasn't  accurate,  was 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  that  wasn't  the  question. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The  question  that  we  were  answering  was  people  who  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complained  about  the  particular  issue  in  the  charge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  as  Judge  Reed  concluded,  we  gave  them  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  than  the  EEOC  requested.  That's  on  page  169 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Cert  Petition  Appendix. 

 

 

 

 

            

When  they  later  on  asked  for  all  the  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  had  filed  charges  of  discrimination,  we  gave  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  that  information.  That  was  about  eight  more  people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  got. 

 

 

            

Finally,  at  the  end  of  the  investigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phase,  they  said,  Give  us  the  names  of  all  the  women  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  driven  for  you  in  the  last  several  years  with  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contact  information.  We  gave  them  that.  They  didn't  do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  with  it. 

 

 

            

They  then  filed  their  ­­ their  class  finding

systematic  look  at  how  things  were  done  at  the  company. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  when  they  put  together  this  case  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court,  they  listed  270  people  who  were  so­called  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members;  and  it  turns  out  most  of  those  claims  washed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out.  They  simply  were  non­meritorious.  And  we  file  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion  for  summary  judgment  saying  they  don't  have  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  a  systematic  problem  here  of  a  ­­ of  a

everything  that's  in  these  depositions,  there  may  be

didn't  act  fast  enough.  Maybe  they  could  have  been  more

training.  That  was  all  factually  not  true. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  is  true  that  there  were  some  complaints 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which,  of  course,  when  you  read  them  are  ­­ are  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious,  but  that  doesn't  mean  the  company  is  liable, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  not  liable  on  a  class  basis  where  ­­ for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  which  were  never  investigated,  never  conciliated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  whole  policy  of  the  statute,  of  course,  is  to  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  investigation,  have  a  reasonable  cause 

   

 

 

 

finding,  have  conciliation.  And  here  that  became 

  

 

 

 

 

 

meaningless,  except  with  respect  to  one  claimant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  you're  here 

  

 

 

 

complaining  about  a  threshold  question.  That  is,  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

said  that  the  investigation  and  conciliation  efforts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  inadequate.  But  you  said  that  after  18  months  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heavy  litigation. 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  No,  Your  Honor.  Here's  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

happened.  They  come  in  October  15,  2008,  with  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list  of  270  people.  They  ­­ we  said  ­­ we  then  say  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court,  well,  they  can't  possibly  have  investigated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

270  claims,  and  how  are  we  going  to  adjudicate  this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyway?  They  respond  and  say,  This  is  a  pattern  of

that  it  is  their  de  facto  policy  to  neglect  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harassment,  and  then  we're  going  to  have  a  damages  phase 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  individual  claimants  will  come  in. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  we  had  a  class  claim  which  they  said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  pattern  of  practice  claim.  And  there  was  no  way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  that  point  for  us  to  say,  well,  you  ­­ you  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigate  these  individual  claims,  because  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classifying  these  people  as  class  members,  and  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  use  them  as  witnesses  to  establish  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  ­­ this  policy  of  neglect  of  sexual  harassment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  then  do  154  depositions  of  all  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people,  except  for  the  ones  who  didn't  show  up  at  all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  99.  And  most  of  those  claims  turned  out  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­meritorious,  even  accepting  the  truth  of  everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ the  complainants  said. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  then  file  a  motion  that  says,  You  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  pattern  of  practice  case.  This  is  not  a  class 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

case.  You  can't  litigate  this  case  because  there  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

systematic  policy  that  has  been  identified. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  have  this  wealth  of  factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  from  these  154  depositions,  154  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stories  involving  different  drivers,  different  charges, 

 

 

 

 

 

different  conduct,  different  responses.  And  Judge  Reed

this  Court  need  not  reach  that,  I  take  it,  if  we  ­­ we

is  ­­ as  you  understand  the  government's  position  ­­ we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can,  of  course,  ask  them  in  a  few  minutes  ­­ in  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  where  there  is  not  an  adjudication  on  the  merits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  the  government  agree  that  there  is  a  prevailing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

party,  that  the  defendant  can  be  a  prevailing  party? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  I  think  they  have  ­­ they've 

    

 

 

 

 

 

said  the  merits  issue  is  not  really  relevant.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  ­­ as  I  understand  it,  what  they've  said  certainly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  you  know,  if  it  was  ­­ they  ­­ they  would  say  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  disposition  with  prejudice,  whether  it's  based  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  merits  issue  or  some  other  merits,  non­merits  issue, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  statute  of  limitations  or  something  else,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears  to  be  their  position.

prejudice/with  prejudice  distinction,  which  they  ­­ they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  out  in  their  merits  brief,  is  that's  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  in  this  litigation  that  that  argument  has  ever  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  by  the  EEOC.  They  have  never  in  the  lower  courts

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Smith,  understanding 

  

 

 

 

that  you  think  that,  but  if  we  could  just  go  on  from

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  Your  Honor,  as  ­­ as  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  question,  the  first  problem  with  the  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  it's  factually  not  true.  The  ­­ the  disposition  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  with  prejudice. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Right.  Let's  just  assume 

  

  

 

 

 

that  it  were. 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Okay.  Leaving  aside  the  waiver 

  

  

 

 

 

 

and  the  fact  that  there's  no  factual  predicate  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  here,  on  the  merits,  we  didn't  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity  to  brief  this  issue  because  it's  not  in  the

I  think  that  it's  a  ­­ there's  ­­ there  is  a

there  are  going  to  be  situations  ­­ and  this  case  is  a

claims  which,  if  they'd  been  ­­ been  investigated  and

MR.  SMITH:  Yes,  sir. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  that  a  phrase  district 

   

  

 

 

 

courts  use  often,  "bars"? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  You  know,  I  think  it  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

invented  by  the  judge  here  because  she's  dealing  with  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  peculiar  animal,  which  is  a  one­count  complaint 

   

 

 

 

 

 

which  says  Ms.  Starke  was  sexually  harassed  and  it  was

You're  barred  from  litigating  this  claim,  this  claim, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  claim.  And  there  were  six  or  seven  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories  of  claims  where  she  went  through  and  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  can't  do  these  six  because  there  was  never  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  made  to  the  ­­ to  management.  You  can't  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  six  because  the  conduct  just  wasn't  severe  enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  sexual  harassment. 

 

 

 

            

And  then  she  gets  to  the  67  and  says,  You 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  do  these  claims  because  you  never  investigated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  or  conciliated  them  or  made  a  reasonable  cause 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding.  And  there  was  ­­ the  whole  class  thing,  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

led  you  to  bring  them  into  court  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  With  respect  to  those  67, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  thought  we  had  held  that  in  Mach  Mining,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  for  inadequate  conciliation,  investigation  and 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation,  is  not  dismissal,  but  return  to  continue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  efforts  to  conciliate. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  What  you  held  in  Mach  Mining, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  is  that  where  there  is  a  failure  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation,  the  appropriate  remedy  is  a  stay  so  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  conciliate  some  more.  And  you  cited  a  provision  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Title  VII  in  706  which  specifically  authorizes  a  judge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  stay  a  case  for  further  conciliation. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

What  Judge  Reed  concluded  is  that  a  stay

the  claims,  and  you  haven't  made  any  findings  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits  of  the  claims,  and  you've  put  the  court  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  through  years  of  litigation. 

 

 

 

 

            

In  that  situation,  the  ­­ the  additional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanction  of  barring  you  from  litigating  the  case  is

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Smith,  do  you  understand 

  

 

 

 

 

 

her  order  as  ­­ as  saying  that  if  the  EEOC  did  engage  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation,  had  made  the  initial  findings,  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied  all  the  pre­suit  requirements,  could  the  EEOC, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  you  think,  have  come  back  and  brought  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  claims? 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Certainly  I  ­­ I  think  she  was 

   

   

  

 

 

 

very  clear  that  that  was  not  available  to  them  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Even  after  filing  the 

  

 

 

 

 

pre­suit  requirements?  Even  after  satisfying  the 

  

 

 

 

 

pre­suit  requirements? 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Yes.  Because  she  ­­ she 

  

  

 

 

 

 

considered  whether  to  stay  the  case  and  let  them  go  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  and  said,  no,  I'm  going  to  do  the  much  more  severe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  of  dismissing  these  claims.

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  she  does  eventually,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

Honor.  The  ­­ the  judgment  that  ends  the  merits  case 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  ­­ in  this  ­­ the  merits  phase  in  this  case  in

expressly  says  that  the  case  and  all  the  claims  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  litigated  in  this  case  are  dismissed  with

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  back  in  2009,  she  didn't

language. 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  She  did  not  include  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SMITH:  She  didn't  use  that  language. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

She  said  the  government  shall  take  nothing  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment.  She  said,  I'm  not  going  to  stay  the  case  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let  you  go  back  and  do  it  ­­ do  a  do­over.  And  she  said 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  severe  remedy  that  means  these  claims  may  not

the  word  ­­ "prejudice"  language  at  that  point.

order,  that  they  had  ­­ that  the  order  had  barred  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  from  ever  seeing  the  inside  of  a  courtroom  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  judge  acknowledged  that  fact.  They  did  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again  in  the  second  appeal  from  the  Eighth  Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then,  most  tellingly,  they  file  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule  60  motion  after  Mach  Mining  is  decided  last  year  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  they  asked  the  district  judge  to  reopen  the  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say,  you  should  have  done  a  stay;  you  shouldn't  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed  this.  And  the  reason  you  should  do  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  have  been  prevented  for  the  last  six  years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  litigating  these  claims. 

 

 

 

            

And  does  Judge  Reed  then  say,  no,  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed  without  prejudice.  I  wasn't  telling  you,  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  litigate  these  claims.  No.  She  said  I  did 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

what  I  did,  and  I  did  it  for  good  and  sufficient  reason 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  the  way  you  messed  up  this  case,  and  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abused  the  process  and  didn't  follow  your  obligations, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I'm  ­­ and  I'm  denying  the  motion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  they  then  appealed  that  to  the  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals.  And  the  day  before  they  file  their  merits 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  in  this  Court,  they  ­­ they  pull  that  appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  recognize  that  the  Rule  60  motion  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  they're  making  is  completely  inconsistent  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  argument  they're  about  to  make  ­­

you  still  haven't  satisfied  your  pre­suit  requirements, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  of  course  I'm  not  changing  anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  Your  Honor,  there's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  question  is  what  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  happened  if  the  government  came  back  and  said  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  satisfied  the  pre­suit  requirements.  Would  she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

then  have  thought,  okay,  well,  that's  a  different  story 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

now.  I  didn't  ­­ I  didn't  dismiss  these  with  prejudice. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

Now  that  the  government  has  satisfied  the  pre­suit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements,  it  can  go  ahead. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  No,  Your  Honor.  I  think  it's 

    

  

 

 

 

 

quite  clear  from  what  she  did  say  last  fall,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

December,  actually,  that  ­­ that  she  knew  it  was  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice,  intended  it  to  be  with  prejudice,  and  wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  change  her  mind.  And  I  think  there's  no  other 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  read  the  record  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  ultimately  have  a  judgment  that  says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with  prejudice,  which  is  the  controlling  judgment  ­­

Your  Honors  ­­ there  is  a  judgment  that  appears  on  page 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

115  and  116  which  says,  "Judgment  is  entered  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordance  with  the  attached."  And  the  attached  is  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  of  dismissal  which  was  negotiated  by  the  parties. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  you  look  at  the  bottom  of  118a,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  of  dismissal,  which  was  incorporated  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment,  at  the  bottom  of  118a  it  says,  "Based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EEOC's  withdrawal  of  its  claim  on  behalf  of  Tillie 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jones,  the  parties'  settlement  of  EEOC's  claim  on  behalf 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Monika  Starke  and  the  mandate  issued  by  the  court  of

claims  asserted  by  the  EEOC,  this  case  is  dismissed  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice." 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  the  end  of  it,  isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it?  It  was  dismissed  with  prejudice. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  That's  the  point,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  SMITH:  There  doesn't  seem  to  be  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt  about  it.  And  the  government  knew  it.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  agreed  to  this  form  of  judgment.  So  we  found 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  rather  remarkable  that  we  were  facing  this  ­­ this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Smith,  what  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

what's  ­­ what  are  you  asking  us  to  do  in  this  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What's  the  disposition  that  you're  seeking?

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  you  should  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Are  we  supposed  to  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Eighth  Circuit,  you're  wrong,  it  has  nothing  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  ­­ exclusively  with  the  merits?  Do  a  do­over? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  That's  ­­ that's  the  issue  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  ­­ you  should  certainly  reverse  them  on,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  But  there's  ­­ I  think  we  have  agreement  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courtroom  that  that's  just  ­­ at  least  on  this  side  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ of  the  bench  ­­ that  that's  an  incorrect  ruling. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then,  you  know,  I  think  you  should  give 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  back  of  the  hand  to  this  idea  that  the  judgment  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  without  prejudice  and  therefore  that  has  some  impact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  this  case.  It's  just  not  factually  true.  It  was  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preserved,  and  it's  ­­ and  it's  not  ­­ it's  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  not  the  right  line,  anyway. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Then  the  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Smith  ­­ Mr.  Smith, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

will  you  explain  why  "dismiss  this  case  with  prejudice" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  talking  about  the  case  that  was  settled,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Starke  case? 

 

            

The  ­­ there  were  ­­ all  the  other  women

out;  one  was  left.  Why  isn't  this  case  the  case  that

claims  asserted  by  the  EEOC  under  a  one­count  complaint. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  is  no  separate  count  for  each  of  these  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  when  you  dismiss  that  count,  it  expressly  says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"With  respect  to  all  the  other  claims  asserted  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EEOC,"  I  think  it's  pretty  obvious  that  the  case  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed  with  prejudice  with  respect  to  all  the  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asserted  by  the  EEOC,  including  the  67,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  was  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  All  the  claims  that  were

the  claims  that  had  previously  been  dismissed  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure  to  satisfy  the  pre­suit  requirements. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  It's  a  basic  principle  that  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

judgment  at  the  end  of  the  merits  phase  goes  back  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporates  all  the  ­­ the  prior  rulings  of  the  court,

respect  to  that  set  of  claims,  neither  cured  it  nor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

renounced  the  possibility  that  they  would  cure  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  2013,  the  court  was  facing  a  much  reduced

without  prejudice,  you  wouldn't  agree  to  a  judgment  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  form. 

 

            

In  any  event,  the  ­­ the  government  told  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Circuit  twice  in  two  separate  appeals  that  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  were  dismissed  with  prejudice,  and  that  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  for  them,  that  they  were  precluded.  They  file  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule  60  motion  acknowledging  that  they  were  dismissed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  prejudice  and  asking  for  that  dismissal  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lifted.  I  just  ­­ it's  hard  for  me  to  believe  that  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they're  ­­ that  this  argument  is  available  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them,  especially  since  they  never  made  it  before. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  why  should  we  decide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this? 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  I  think  it  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Why  don't  we  just  remand  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely,  and  let  the  Eighth  Circuit  decide,  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  decide  what  it  meant? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  you  should  certainly

whether  there's  a  factual  predicate  for  it  at  all?

unreasonable. 

            

We're  actually,  in  some  ways,  tempted  to  ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  to  go  ahead  and  rule  on  that  issue  too,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  been  doing  this  ­­ the  issue  now  for  six  years.

MR.  SMITH:  Oh,  no,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  The  fees  were  separated 

  

 

 

 

 

out. 

            

MR.  SMITH:  First  of  all,  they  were  Cedar 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rapids  rates,  and  we  charge  Chicago  rates.  But  aside 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  that  problem,  it  was  about  ­­ there  was

on,  it  was  where  there  was  a  settlement.  That  was

may  be  some  value  in  the  Court  reaching  the

complaint  for  which  they  have  no  factual  basis,  then  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end  up  creating  a  great  deal  of  litigation  exposure  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants  in  situations  where  class  litigation  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  appropriate. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Smith,  do  you  think  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible  to  have  a  pattern  of  practice  appropriate  class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  with  respect  to  sexual  harassment? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  I  do,  Your  Honor.  I  think  it 

    

    

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ but  it  ­­ but  it  may  be  more  difficult  than  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  contexts.  For  example,  you  could  have  a  pattern 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  practice  case,  I  think,  about  one  work  setting  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  hostile  work  environment  would  affect  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

woman  working  in  that  setting.  I  think  that  would  be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate. 

            

If  ­­ if  they  had  some  specific  policy  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  identified  that  they  said  has  a  discriminatory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

effect  such  as,  for  example,  we  had  a  three­strikes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy.  You  have  to  harass  people  three  times  before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'll  take  the  complaint  or  something  like  that.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  a  pattern  of  practice  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

But  what  I  don't  think  you  can  do  is  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

154  individual  stories  involving  different  alleged 

 

 

 

 

 

malefactors,  different  alleged  conduct,  different

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Couldn't  you  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

pattern  and  practice  case  of  saying  there  ­­ there

gave  the  ­­ the  driver  a  slap  on  the  wrist? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Your  Honor,  I  think  you  can  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ a  standard  operating  procedure  that  you  show  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  over  and  over  again  they  don't  do  what  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  do  and  that  their  policies  are  not  taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seriously.  But  you  have  to  show  a  consistent  pattern  or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice  in  order  to  do  that.  And  what  Judge  Reed  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  by  and  large,  that's  not  what  they  do.  They  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  the  opposite. 

 

 

            

There  may  be  some  situations,  if  we  take  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  of  the  complainants  at  ­­ at  face  value 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  any  ­­ hearing  from  anybody  else,  that  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  of  the  managers  didn't  do  good  ­­ as  good  a  job  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  might  have  in  some  of  these  cases,  but  that's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sporadic  exception;  that's  not  the  rule.  That's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  do  as  a  matter  of  policy. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  I  could  save  the  balance  of  my  time, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.

Mr.  Fletcher. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  BRIAN  H.  FLETCHER 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  question  on  what  this  Court  granted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certiorari  is  not,  as  Mr.  Smith  suggested,  and  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  basis  for  his  waiver  arguments,  whether  or  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Circuit  was  correct  to  say  that  a  Title  VII 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  has  to  prevail  on  the  merits  in  order  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secure  a  fee  award  and  to  be  a  prevailing  party. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Instead,  the  question  that  petitioner  framed 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  petition  and  the  question  on  what  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

granted  certiorari  is  whether  the  dismissal  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Title  VII  case,  based  on  the  EEOC's  failure  to  satisfy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  pre­suit  investigations,  can  form  the  basis  for  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award  of  attorneys'  fees. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  In  your  brief  in  opposition, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  argued  that  the  Eighth  Circuit  was  correct;  did  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not? 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  We  did.  We  endorsed  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Have  you  abandoned  that 

  

 

 

 

 

argument? 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  We're  advancing  a  slightly 

   

  

 

 

different  argument  that  yields  the  same  answer  on  the

question  presented. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Have  you  abandoned  the 

  

 

 

 

 

argument  that  there  must  be  an  evaluation  of  the  merits? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  We  are  ­­ we're  making  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

slightly  different  argument,  yes. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  have  abandoned  it,  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  question. 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes  or  no? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  We  have  abandoned  the  Eighth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's  view  that  you  need  a  disposition  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  But  I  think  in  explaining  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

I  don't  think  that  the  change  in  our  argument  and  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  in  our  argument  to  a  different  argument  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  within  the  scope  of  the  question  presented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutes  a  waiver.  I'd  like  to  talk  about  two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  why,  because  I  understand  Mr.  Smith  to  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

argued  that  we're  waiving  the  version  of  the  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we're  presenting  now  at  two  stages  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  don't  care  if  it  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  that's  up  to  you,  what  you  want  to  argue.  But  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  like  ­­ look,  it  says,  can  the  dismissal,  based  on

defendant  in  such  a  case  be  a  prevailing  party? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  He  has  to  meet  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  too. 

 

            

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  would  think  the  answer  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  yes.  They  won.  Okay?  So  if  they  won,  why 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  that  the  end  of  it?  It  says  judgment  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  ­­ it  says  the  ­­ the  case  is  dismissed  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice.  Therefore,  they  won.  So  why  aren't  they  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevailing  party? 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Sir,  I'd  like  to  talk  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  dismissal  with  prejudice,  which  is  a  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case­specific  issue  here  that  I  ­­ I  do  want  to  address. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  first,  I  want  to  talk  about  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

broader  question,  which  is  what  makes  a  party  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevailing  party?  Because  this  Court  addressed  that  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  Buckhannon  decision.  It  said  prevailing  party  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term  of  art.  In  the  fee­shipping  statutes,  including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Title  VII,  it  means  a  party  that  has  secured  an  order 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  materially  alters  the  legal  relationship  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  parties. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Can't  a  plaintiff  be  a 

   

  

 

 

 

prevailing  party?  I  don't  know  the  answer,  but  I

thought  the  plaintiff  brings  a  suit  charging,  you  know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious  discrimination.  After  lots  of  litigation,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

parties  decide  to  settle,  and  they  settle  on  terms  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable  to  the  plaintiff,  really  because  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  I  thought  in  such  cases,  the  plaintiff  was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prevailing  party.  A.m.  I  wrong? 

   

  

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  under  Buckhannon,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

depends.  What  this  Court  says  that  under  Buckhannon,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  incorporates  the  settlement  agreement  into  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent  decree  or  the  lower  courts  have  held  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement  agreement  is  approved  by  the  court  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated  into  the  judgment  such  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable  by  the  court,  then  yes.  But  the  courts  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally  said  that  private  settlement  agreements,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  particular  issue  in  Buckhannon,  if  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  voluntarily  changes  its  conduct  and  the  plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets  what  it  wants,  the  plaintiff  is  not  a  prevailing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  because  it  has  not  secured  an  order  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materially  changes  the  party's  legal  relationship.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  suppose  that  the 

    

 

 

 

 

settlement  agreements  often  take  into  account  liability

to  apportion  those. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Very  often,  yes. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  do  we  apply  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  to  a  defendant?  The  plaintiff  is  seeking  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

change  of  the  status  quo,  but  a  defendant  is  actually  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  they  want  is  the  status  quo.  They  want  just  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stay  ­­ not  to  be  found  liable.  So  why  do  we  apply  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  whether  there's  been  a  legal  change  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  parties?  The  defendant  was  never  seeking  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  what  the  defendant  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

seeking,  though,  was  a  judicial  declaration  that 

   

 

 

 

 

essentially  ratifies  the  status  quo,  that  ­­ that  ends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  dispute.  And  so  after  this  Court's  decision  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Buckhannon,  the  circuits  have  looked  at  this  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  eight  of  them,  which  we  cite  at  Pages  26  to  28  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  Brief,  as  far  as  we  can  tell,  every  court  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider  this  question  has  said  that  the  same  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  to  the  defendant.  And  if  the  defendant  obtains 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  dismissal  because  the  plaintiff  voluntarily  withdraws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  because  it's  in  the  wrong  forum  or  something  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  something  that  allows  the  underlying  dispute  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue,  then  the  defendant  hasn't  prevailed  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  in  the  sense  in  which  the  fee­shifting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes  have  used  ­­

that  ­­ where  that  artificial  line  comes  from.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant  wants  to  win.  And  I  don't  know  ­­ it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting  pretty  ­­ when  I  was  practicing  that  ­­ parties 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  come  in  and  say,  I  want  to  win,  and  I  want  to  win 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  this  ground.  They  said,  I  want  to  win.  I  want  the 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  thrown  out. 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  that's  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

that's  right,  but  I  think  that  what  the  defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  ­­ and  I  think  this  is  perhaps  expressed  best,  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  cases  we  cite,  in  Judge  Easterbrook's  opinion  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Steel  Co.  case.  The  defendant  wants  to  win,  but  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  wants  to  win  in  a  way  that  definitively  ends 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  litigation.  And  if  the  defendant  wins  on  a  ground 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  makes  clear  that  the  plaintiff  can  come  back  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  the  next  day,  or  in  a  different  district,  or  after 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfying  a  precondition  to  suit,  I  don't  think  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

defendant  has  won  in  the  way  that  the  defendant  wants  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

win. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  There  is  a  material 

   

  

 

 

alteration  in  their  relationship,  is  it  not?  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  as  big  a  one  as  the  defendant  would  like.  A 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  would  like  to  have  a  ­­ a  win  that  precludes 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

future  litigation.  But  don't  you  think  a  defendant  who 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

secures  a  dismissal  of  a  complaint,  and,  therefore, 

   

   

 

 

 

doesn't  know  whether  the  ­­ the  complaint  is  going  to  be

filed  again  is  going  to  celebrate?  Isn't  that  a  ­­ an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alteration  in  the  relationship  between  the  parties? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  I'm  sure  the  defendant  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  happy  about  that,  in  much  the  same  way  a  party  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  happy  if  they  secured  the  reversal  of  a  directed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict  on  appeal  or  if  they  defeated  a  motion  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summary  judgment.  And  you  could,  in  some  sense  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words,  say  that  all  of  those  things  materially  changed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  party's  legal  relationship  because  they  settle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  issues  and  they  alter  the  course  of  the  future 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation. 

            

But  what  this  Court  has  said  in  Buckhannon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  in  the  cases  that  it  ascribed  there  is  that  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorts  of  interlocutory  wins  don't  count. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Oh,  well,  this  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interlocutory.  This  ended  the  litigation.  So,  I  mean, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

I  have  the  same  question  the  Chief  Justice  had,  where  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  secures  the  end  of  a  case,  dismissed,  goodbye, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  win.  Now,  maybe  they  can  bring  another  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tomorrow;  that's  another  case.  But  they  won  this  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  going  to  be  pretty  hard  for  them  to  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys'  fees  anyway  because  there's  a  very  tough 

   

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  But  why  isn't  a  simple  rule  the  best  rule? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  the  case  is  over,  the  defendant  won,  he  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevailing  party  for  purposes  of  that  case.

Then  we  could  go  on  to  take  all  the  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  wanted  to  into  account  when  we  consider  what  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fee  is  reasonable  and  when  we  consider  whether  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  frivolousness.  I  mean,  the  ­­ the  plus  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  to  me,  is  the  simplicity.  And  ­­ and  I  don't  see 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  it  would  work  any  unfairness  or  serious  harm  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objective  of  this  statute.  So  I'd  appreciate  it  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  address  what  could  be  my  benighted  view. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  I  wouldn't  go  that  far,  but  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  think  it's  a  different  view,  and  a  very  different 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

view,  than  the  one  that  all  of  the  courts  of  appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  have  considered  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  then  they  might  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  unfortunately,  I  a.m.  in  the  position  of  having  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  it. 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  I  put  the  question  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you.  And  I'd  say  at  first  blush,  the  simplicity  of  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach,  its  consistency  with  the  language,  its  ease  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administration,  and  so  forth,  in  terms  of  prevailing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  has  that  to  recommend  it.  So  now  what  is  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  like  it,  so  tell  me  why. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  I  think  because  when  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

defendant  prevails  on  this  sort  of  round  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff,  say,  withdraws  the  claim  voluntarily  or

secures  a  dismissal  with  prejudice,  the  dispute  really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  over.  And  it  certainly  isn't  over  in  the  sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  Court  used  the  term  in  Buckhannon,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  a  judicially  sanctioned,  material  alteration  of 

   

 

 

 

 

the  legal  relationship  of  the  parties.  And  I  this  Judge 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Easterbrook  put  this  well  in  Steel  Co.  If  the  plaintiff 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  come  back  the  next  day  or  if  the  plaintiff  can  sue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  next  district  or  if  the  dispute  is  going  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue,  that  really  doesn't  ­­ hasn't  changed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  relationship  of  the  parties. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  if  they  don't? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

What  if  they  don't  come  back  the  next  day?  What  if  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  sue  in  the  next  district?  Then  it  seems  to  me  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  of  this  fee­shifting  provision  have  not  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

served. 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  I  ­­ I  don't  think 

   

   

  

 

 

that's  quite  right.  I  think  you're  right,  as  Your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor's  question  alludes  to.  I  think  the  purpose  of  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fee­shifting  statute  ­­ and  this  is  what  the  Court  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Fox  versus  Vice  and  Christiansburg  ­­ is  to  protect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants  who  are  forced  to  bear  factually  or  legally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unjustified  suits.  I  think,  first  of  all,  there's  some 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  to  question  whether  that  purpose  is  served,  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  why  this  suit  is  defeated  is  a  failure  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy  a  procedural  precondition.  I'm  not  sure  it's

fair  to  say  that  that's  a  factually  or  legally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ungrounded  suit.  It's  a  suit  where  the  plaintiff  failed 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  take  a  step  that  it  was  supposed  to  take  before 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coming  to  court,  but  a  curable  step. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  in  those  sorts  of  circumstances  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  those  defendants  can't  recover  for  whatever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees  they  secure  in  resolving  that  initial  procedural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  doesn't  really  get  at  the  core  of  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  was. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  there  ­­ because  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

now,  there's  much  to  recommend  what  you're  saying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  at  least  if  you  come  back  the  next  day,  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  could  sue  in  another  district.  But  have  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heard  of  the  Hatfields  and  the  McCoys?  You  see  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see  why  I  bring  them  up?  Because  they're  going  to  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fighting  each  other  for  30  years.  And  if  you  tell  them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  can't  sue  in  this  district,  they'll  change  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  slightly  and  go  to  a  different  district. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  I  adopt  the  standard  you're  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting,  I  will  discover  a  whole  host  of  questions: 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Is  this  really  the  same  suit?  What  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility  that  they  could  have  sued  in  Tasmania?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  about  the  possibility  ­­ you  ­­ you  see  where  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going.  And  so  I'm  back,  again,  to  that  kind  of  concern, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  administrative  concern  ­­

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ versus  the  simplicity  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

saying,  well,  that  ended  this  case.  If  they  bring 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  case  and  it's  frivolous,  we'll  consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys'  fees  in  that  one. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  So,  I  guess,  to  the  ­­ to  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  point,  I  do  think  the  ­­ the  views  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  circuits,  and  the  views  that  the  circuits  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying  for  16  years,  in  some  cases  more  now,  ought  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  persuasive?  Not  just  because  that's  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  didn't  say  that.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

haven't  read  them  yet. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  But  ­­ but  just  in  ­­ in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notion  that  if  the  sort  ­­ if  our  rule  was  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  problems  of  administration  like  you  suggest,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  expect  to  see  it  in  the  circuits,  and  I  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  you're  seeing  that  in  the  circuits.  I  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  applying  this  rule;  has  the  plaintiff  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barred  from  pursuing  this  claim  permanently?  If  so, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  the  defendant  is  a  prevailing  party.  If  not,  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  different  ground,  if  it's  a  precondition  to  suit, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

if  it's  the  wrong  forum,  if  it's  a  dismissal  without 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice,  then  the  defendant  hasn't  been  precluded. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  don't  think  you  can  hypothesize  cases.  I  don't

think  we've  seen  them  in  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Wouldn't  it  be  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

adequate  response  to  your  concern  if  fees  were  awarded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solely  on  the  ground  in  which  the  case  was  dismissed? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  would  be  ­­ in  other  words,  the  judge  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  discretion  to  do  that.  If  the  judge  looks  at  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  says,  okay,  it's  clear  you're  in  the  wrong  venue, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  and  hours  of  research  would  have  showed  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  So,  you  know,  it's  frivolous  on  that  ground,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  throwing  the  case  out  because  the  ­­ the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevails  on  that  ground. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  defendant  may  have  spent  a  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  money  with  depositions  and  everything  else.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  could  say,  well,  you  can  file  the  ­­ the  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again  tomorrow.  You  probably  will.  You  just  have  to  go 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  next  district.  So  I  a.m.  going  to  award  fees. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're  going  to  be  equal  to  the  amount  of  time  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  had  to  spend  defending  against  your  frivolous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue  assertion. 

 

            

It  doesn't  have  to  do  that.  I  mean,  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  if  you  have  the  wrong  venue,  and  they  spend  five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  doing  depositions  because  you  have  the  wrong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue,  they  should  probably  get  fees  for  all  of  it.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  it's  just,  you  know,  a  small  portion,  easily  disposed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of,  is  that  a  possible  remedy?

MR.  FLETCHER:  Sir,  I  think  that's  a  better, 

   

   

  

 

 

a  more  sensible  rule.  Certainly  I'll  ­­ I'll  say  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  bit  about  why  I  think  it  may  be  a  little  tricky 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  fit  into  the  doctrine,  but  just  to  illustrate  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application  in  this  case,  for  instance,  a  petitioner  got 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  fee  award  on  the  order  of  4.6,  $4.7  million,  as  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  in  our  brief.  The  amount  of  those  fees  that  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributable  to  actually  litigating  about  this  ground 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  whether  or  not  we  satisfied  the  preconditions  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit,  is  a  little  more  than  $100,000. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  then  that  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  case  contrary  to  the  proposal  where  it's  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discreet.  In  other  words,  your  frivolity  on  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  point  compelled  them  to  incur  $4.6  million 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  many  years.  It's  not  their  fault  that  that  issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  come  up  until  later  in  the  litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  first  of  all  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It's  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

intertwined  with  the  merits.  It's  not  a  venue 

   

  

 

 

 

 

objection. 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  I  ­­ I'm  not  sure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that's  ­­ that's  right,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  we  ­­ we  disagree  that  we  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frivolous  in  thinking  we  satisfied  our  pre­suit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligations.  That's  an  issue  that  hasn't  been  resolved

by  the  Eighth  Circuit  yet,  and  we  think  for  some  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  that  Justice  Ginsburg  suggested  and  that  Judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Murphy  suggested  on  the  merits  in  the  Eighth  Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Actually,  we  very  much  were  not  frivolous  on  thinking  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  satisfied  these  preconditions. 

 

 

 

            

But  to  get  to  the  ­­ the  heart  of  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  I  do  think,  actually,  that  it  is  a  very 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

discreet  issue.  It's  ­­ Title  VII  says  before  you  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  court,  you  have  to  do  an  investigation.  There  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  a  reasonable­cause  determination  and  you  have  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempt  to  conciliate  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yeah.  Well,  it  may 

  

  

 

 

 

 

be  a  discreet  issue,  but  it's  a  cause  in  fact  for  all 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  fees. 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  I  ­­ I'm  not  sure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that's  right,  in  that  if  Petitioner  had  raised  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

early  on  ­­ and  I  ­­ I  do  want  to  be  clear,  that  from 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  outset  in  this  litigation,  I  disagree  a  little  bit 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

with  what  Mr.  Smith  said  about  what  the  EEOC  looked  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  its  investigation.  But  from  the  outset,  everyone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

knew  that  we  had  told  them  in  conciliation,  we  think  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  problem  here;  we  think  you're  engaged  in  sexual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harassment  against  a  class  of  women.  We  tried  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

conciliate  that  class  claim;  they  declined  to  do  that.

suppose  whether  the  issue  we're  debating  may  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  pertinent,  my  question  is  whether  or  not  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  a  factor  that  the  district  courts  could  look  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  deciding  the  amount  of  fees  and  so  on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes,  I  take  that  point. 

   

  

 

 

 

If  ­­ if  you  resolved  the  question  against  us,  you  say  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  could  be  a  prevailing  party  when  it  prevails 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  this  sort  of  ground  that  doesn't  foreclose  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation,  then  I  absolutely  agree  with  you  that  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  perfectly  appropriate  and  ­­ and  indeed,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  a  good  idea  for  the  district  court  to  engage  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  kind  of  inquiry.  But,  I  ­­ I  guess,  I  think  the 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

main  question  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  ­­ so  as  I  understand 

   

  

 

 

 

 

your  answer,  let's  assume  a  hypothetical  case,  not  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  For  five  years  there's  litigation,  and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  is  finally  dismissed  because  the  EEOC  has  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

followed  its  obligations.  It's  a  frivolous  or  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

unreasonable  suit.  The  trial  judge  said  you  are  barred 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  proceeding  further  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Doesn't  say  with  prejudice 

  

 

 

 

 

or  without. 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes.

that  case? 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  I  believe,  no.  I  believe 

    

    

 

 

that  is  this  case,  but  ­­ but  I  believe  no. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Because  he  didn't  say 

  

 

 

 

 

with  ­­ with  prejudice? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Because  that  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

dismissal  under  principles  of  res  judicata,  under  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  interpretation  of  Federal  Rule  of  Civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Procedure  41,  when  you  have  ­­ even  after  extended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Incidentally,  is  it  clear 

  

 

 

 

 

that  after  this  time  that  there  was  no  time  bar  if  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  come  back  again? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  That's  right.  The  EEOC  does 

  

  

 

 

 

 

not  have  a  statute  of  limitation  that's  applicable  to  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  suits  brought  by  the  commission. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  then,  your  position 

  

 

 

 

 

that  no  matter  how  unreasonable  the  plaintiff  has  been, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  matter  how  costly  it's  been,  no  matter  how  long  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken,  that  you  cannot  award  fees  unless  the  case  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  the  case  is  dismissed,  and  the  judge  says  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barred  from  bringing  this  claim  in  this  suit,  no  fees; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  your  position. 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  That's  correct.  And  I

such  a  case  ­­ but  in  some  cases,  that  might  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unappealing  consequences. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  and  that's  ­­ in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  like  that,  what  if  the  ­­ the  EEOC  after  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal  goes  back  and  looks  at  these  cases  and  says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know  what,  we  really  have  nothing  here,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  chooses  not  to  bring  the  case,  you  would  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  because  the  ­­ because  the  first  case  was  dismissed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  prejudice,  there  could  be  no  fees? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  I  ­­ I  would,  and  I  think 

    

   

   

 

 

that  follows  ­­

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  sense  does  that  make? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLETCHER:  I  think  it  follows  from 

    

 

 

 

 

Buckhannon.  Remember,  that  ­­ the  issue  in  Buckhannon 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  you  have  a  plaintiff  that  brings  a  suit.  By 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

hypothesis,  let's  assume  it's  a  meritorious  suit,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there's  some  litigation  and  the  plaintiff  incurs  fees, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  at  some  point  the  defendant  sees  the  writing  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  wall  and  voluntarily  recedes  from  the  conduct  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  the  plaintiff  exactly  what  they  want. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  the  Court  recognized  that  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  strong  policy  argument  for  allowing  courts  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award  fees  to  plaintiffs  in  that  case,  because  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  what  Title  VII  and  the  Civil  Rights  Act  intended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  encourage  plaintiffs  to  do.  And  they're  sort

prior  decision,  there  shouldn't  be  a  possibility  of  fees 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  situation. 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  I  do  think  it's  pretty 

   

  

 

 

 

 

close  to  foreclosed  by  Buckhannon.  Obviously, 

  

 

 

 

 

Buckhannon  dealt  with  whether  or  not  a  plaintiff  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevailing.  Our  argument  is  that  the  Court's  rationale 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  "prevailing  party"  is  a  legal  term  of  art.  It  means 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  party  that  secured  a  material  alteration  in  the  legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship  of  the  parties. 

 

 

 

            

And  the  court  in  Buckhannon  stuck  to  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

despite  very  strong  policy  arguments,  saying  that  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorts  of  plaintiffs  ought  to  get  fee  awards.  And  I

think  it  ought  to  do  the  same  thing  here  when  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented  with  essentially  the  converse  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Then  what  is  the  argument? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  take  it  your  argument  now  is  what's  sauce  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goose  is  sauce  for  the  gander. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Buckhannon  says  that  a  plaintiff  can't 

   

 

 

 

recover,  even  if  he  litigates  to  death  and  they  find  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  up  and  pay  him  a  billion  dollars.  Unless  there  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  judicially  sanctioned  change  in  legal  relationship,  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  recover  fees.  And  if  he  can't  recover  it,  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  the  defendant  recover,  unless  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicially  sanctioned  change  in  relationships  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  candidate  for  such  a  thing  is  a  dismissal  with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  of  some  form. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes,  that's  correct. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  Got  the  argument. 

  

  

 

 

 

            

So  if  that's  the  argument,  and  that  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  correct,  why  don't  we  have  the  situation  here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  you  heard  the  judgment  being  read.  It  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"with  prejudice." 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes.  So  there's  two 

  

  

 

 

 

judgments  in  this  case,  the  one  that's  entered  after  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  resolves  the  issue  that's  before  you

district  court  says  is  the  EEOC  has  asked  me  to  stay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  to  allow  it  to  go  conciliate.  I'm  not  going  to  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  I'm  going  to  dismiss  instead.  And  it  drops  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote  ­­ this  is  a  few  pages  earlier  on,  pages  213 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  14  ­­ and  it  cites  another  case  that  dismissed  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  under  the  same  circumstances.  That  earlier  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  district  court  cited  as  precedent  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal  was  expressly  a  dismissal  without  prejudice. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The  district  court  then  goes  on  to  say  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  is  language  that  you've  referred  to,  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy  ­­ that  the  EEOC  is  barred  from  further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  on  the  claims.  But  it  says  barred  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  litigation  in  this  case.  It  cannot  pursue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief  in  the  trial  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  most  importantly,  when  the 

   

 

 

 

 

district  court  says  it's  dismissing,  and  then  when  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately  enters  a  judgment  of  dismissal,  it  does  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

specify  that  the  judgment  is  with  prejudice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  actually  have  a  Federal  Rule  of  Civil 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Procedure,  Rule  41(b),  that  is  particularly  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressly  designed  to  address  this  situation  to  ensure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  parties  and  courts  don't  have  to  engage  in  the  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  inquiry  that  Mr.  Smith  was  engaged  in,  in  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half  of  the  argument,  of  trying  to  figure  out  what  does

in  another  case.  They've  ­­ they've  secured  a  dismissal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  said  the  EEOC  didn't  satisfy  the  preconditions  that

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  our  view  is  that  Mach 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mining  suggests  that  this  issue  shouldn't  come  up  again 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  future  cases.  As  we  read  Mach  Mining,  it  suggests 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  appropriate  remedy  for  a  failure  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation  like  the  one  here  is  a  stay  rather  than  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal.  I  don't  think  ­­

wouldn't  you  think  if  the  reason  they're  ­­ didn't  ­­ it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  frivolous  for  them  to  bring  the  suit  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation,  you  know,  if  somebody  said,  Well,  we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  to  conciliate,  and  they  said,  Oh,  forget  about  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  ahead,  why  wouldn't  fees  be  a  perfectly  appropriate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanctions? 

            

In  other  words,  there's  no  ­­ under  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense,  there's  no  incentive  for  them  to  conciliate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  if  it  turns  out  they  didn't,  they  have  to  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliate.  But  if  they  were  subject  to  fees  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ignored  their  duty  to  conciliate,  it  seems  to  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  might  give  them  some  incentive  to  get  it  right  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  time. 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  I  think  I  ­­ I'd  like  to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

quibble  with  the  premise.  I  ­­ I  think,  as  we  explain 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  brief,  the  EEOC  has  a  great  incentive  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliate  because  it  gets  a  massive  number  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

complaints  each  year  or  charges  each  year.  It  finds  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  there's  been  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  Title  VII  in  a  huge  number  of  cases,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  very  limited  resources.  And  so  it  really  does,  try 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  actually  does,  resolve  far  more  cases  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation  than  by  litigation;  it  doesn't  rush  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.

good  thing. 

 

            

            

okay. 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  sometimes  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLETCHER:  But  I  take  your  point,  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

then  the  question  is,  so  if  the  EEOC  ­­ let's  ­­ by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothesis,  should  ­­ unreasonably  fails  to  satisfy  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation  obligation,  and  the  court  finds  that  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case,  and  then  it  stays,  pursuant  to  Mach  Mining, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  sends  them  off  to  conciliate,  could  the  court  award 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees,  I  take  it  to  be  the  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  I  think  the  answer  is  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  do  it  under  this  provision  because  everyone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agrees  that  you  have  to  be  a  prevailing  party  to  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees  under  this  provision.  And  I  don't  think  even 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Smith  would  argue  that  if  all  the  defendant  gets  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  stay,  the  defendant  has  prevailed.  Now,  I'll  argue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  is  dismissal  without  prejudice  to  allow  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation  and  then  the  potential  for  coming  back  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  isn't  that  different  from  a  stay  to  allow  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation  as  to  the  same  ­­

you're  pointing  to  that  the  ­­ that  the  Petitioner  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevailing  party  entitled  to  attorneys'  fees  at  the  end 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  case. 

 

 

            

Certainly  the  district  court  thought  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposing  a  sanction.  It  was  barring  you  from  trying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

these  cases,  at  least  at  this  trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  At  ­­ at  least  at  this  trial, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  agree  with  that.  And  the  district  court  did  say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  same  order  that  that  made  Petitioner  a  prevailing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party.  It  didn't  explain  what  test  it  was  applying,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  certainly  didn't  say  "dismissed  with  prejudice."  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  gets  back  to  the  point  that  I  was  making  to  Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer  about  Rule  41,  which  is  that  Rule  41  serves

MR.  FLETCHER:  It  doesn't  specify  its 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ the  real  problem  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  is  that  any  ­­ the  dismissal  of  the  action,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

according  to  this  order  by  the  court,  would  happen  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  end  of  the  case.  And  at  the  end  of  this  case  we  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  dismissal  with  prejudice.  One  would  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  would  get  merged  into  the  final  judgment.

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  I  ­­ I  disagree  with  that, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that  you're  talking  about  the  dismissal  ultimately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered  after  remand  in  2013.  I  do  want  to  talk  about 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  but  ­­ but  first  I  think  it's  ­­ it's  helpful  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  sort  of  tie  down  the  2009  dismissal  originally. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  just  to  wrap  up  the  point,  it's  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Rule  41,  if  you  have  a  dismissal  that's  for  lack 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  jurisdiction,  that  doesn't  count  as  an  adjudication 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  merits;  it's  not  with  prejudice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  this  Court's  decision  in  Costello, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  courts  have  followed  ever  since,  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  doesn't  mean  jurisdiction  in  the  sense  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  the  person  or  the  subject  matter.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  includes  a  failure  to  satisfy  a  precondition  like 

   

   

 

 

 

 

it  did  here. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Just  simply,  No.  279, 

  

 

 

 

 

10/1/2009,  judgment  in  favor  of  CSRT  against  the  EEOC? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  I  believe  so,  yes. 

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  Where  is  it? 

  

  

 

 

 

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  the  ­­ the  judgment  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  actually  entered  is  I  think  not  in  the  Joint 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix.  It's  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  I  mean  ­­ but  where 

   

  

 

 

 

 

do  I  find  it? 

   

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  You  find  it  at  Docket  Entry

No.  279  on  the  district  court's  docket. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  does  it  say? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLETCHER:  It  says,  "Decision  by  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court.  This  came  to  trial  or  hearing  before  the  Court. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  issues  have  been  tried  or  heard  and  a  decision  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  rendered.  It  is  ordered  and  adjudged  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plaintiff  EEOC  takes  nothing,  and  the  action  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed." 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  action  is  dismissed. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes.  The  action  is 

  

  

 

 

 

dismissed.  And  so  then  to  understand  the  effect  of  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal,  you  look  to  Rule  41,  which  says,  "A  dismissal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involuntarily  ordinarily  operates  as  an  adjudication 

 

 

 

 

 

with  prejudice  on  the  merits." 

 

 

 

 

            

We're  not  disagreeing  with  that  as  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  on  which  the  district  court  passed  on  the  merits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  concluded  that  we  didn't  have  enough  evidence  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

survive  a  motion  for  summary  judgment. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Except  ­­ it  has  three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions:  Lack  of  jurisdiction,  improper  venue,  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

failure  to  join  a  party. 

   

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  This  was  not  failure  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

join  a  party. 

   

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  is  not  improper  venue. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  don't  think  it's  lack  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

jurisdiction.  Is  that  what  it  is,  lack  of  jurisdiction? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  It's  exactly  that  because  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  decision  in  Costello,  the  Court  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  in  Rule  41  doesn't  mean  lack  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  the  parties.  It  also  includes  failure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  satisfy  a  precondition  to  bringing  suit. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

In  Costello,  that  particular  precondition 

 

 

 

 

was  the  failure  to  file  an  affidavit  of  good  cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  government  brought  a  denaturalization 

   

 

 

 

proceeding.  That's  a  precondition  that  looks  a  lot  like 

   

   

  

 

 

 

this  one.  And,  in  fact,  in  Mach  Mining,  this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogized  the  precondition  at  issue  in  Costello  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precondition  at  issue  here  in  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Fletcher,  could  I  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

could  I  take  you  back  to  where  you  started,  which  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  you've  waived  all  of  this? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And,  you  know,  you  point  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  question  presented  includes  your  argument,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  it  is,  as  you  say,  a  different  argument  from  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  you  litigated  below,  both  in  the  district  court  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  circuit  court.

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  in  the  bio  that  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  Mr.  Smith  has  responded  to  this  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

filed  here. 

 

            

argument  in  less  than  a  page,  which  is  really  his  every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  do,  given  that  it  has  sort  of  sprung  from  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

head  at  this  late  date.  And  I'm  wondering  why  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't  just  ignore  the  whole  thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  So  if  I  could  address  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

separately.  First  of  all,  as  to  why  it  wasn't  raised 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below,  below  this  ­­ both  parties  litigated  this  case  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  understanding  that  it  was  governed  by  circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent  established  by  an  Eighth  Circuit  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called  Marquardt  that  made  clear  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  you  can  always  file  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote,  you  know?  I  mean  ­­

    

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  that  ­­ that's  true, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

but  I  guess  that  ­­ that  argument  doesn't  do  Mr.  Smith 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  good  because  he  didn't  make  that  argument.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  challenge  beyond  the  merits  rule  in  the  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit.  They  didn't  even  do  it  in  their  petition  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rehearing  en  banc. 

 

 

            

Now,  we  haven't  argued  that  they've  waived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  because  we  think  it  was  within  their  rights  to  stay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  confines  of  circuit  precedent  and  then  to

make  a  broader  argument  on  the  same  legal  question  once 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  in  this  Court.  But  we  think  we  have  a  equal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  refine  our  arguments  once  we're  free  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constraints  of  circuit  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We  ­­ what  is  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  suppose  I  should  know,  but,  I  mean,  what  is  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  practice?  I  mean,  it  would  be  kind  of  futile  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  before  the  Eighth  Circuit  and  say  we  think  you  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overrule  your  precedent,  at  least  on  the  panel  decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  that  doesn't  mean  they're  not  free  to  raise  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  here.  This  is  where  ­­ where  you  should  go  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  want  a  court  of  appeals  overruled. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Absolutely.  And  as  I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

saying,  I  don't  fault  Mr.  Smith  for  not  raising  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenging  me  on  the  merits  rule.  I'm  just  saying  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  good  reason  why  we  weren't  considering  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  argument  or  considering  how  we  might  respond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  challenge  to  that  rule  because  it  just  wasn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised  by  either  party.  Both  parties  should  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigated  within  the  confines  of  Eighth  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent. 

            

Now,  that  also  leaves  the  brief  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposition,  Justice  Kagan,  which  you  also  asked  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There,  you're  right;  we  didn't  raise  this  argument.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defended  the  Eighth  Circuit's  decision.  In  part,

frankly,  obviously,  if  we  had  it  to  do  over  again,  we'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present  the  argument  that  we  presented  in  our  merits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief. 

            

But  I  think  it's  important  to  go  back  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  petition.  The  petition  doesn't  really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

develop  a  developed  argument  on  this  point,  either.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  say  Buckhannon.  It  doesn't  make  an  extended 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  about  what  it  means  to  be  a  prevailing  party. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  mostly  focuses  on  certiorari  considerations. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  did  the  same  thing  in  our  brief  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposition.  I  think  this  Court's  argument  ­­ or  cases 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  when  you  waive  an  argument  by  failing  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  it  on  ­­ in  the  op.  Our  focus  on  cases  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  is  about  why  the  question  presented  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  presented  or  why  there's  a  bar  to  reaching  it, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that's  not  what  this  argument  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  regardless  of  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

there's  blame  on  either  part,  we're  still  in  a  situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it  really  has  not  been  briefed  by  one  party,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  hasn't  been  thought  about  by  the  courts  below.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually,  you  know,  we  do  that  ­­ we're  a  court  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review,  not  a  first  view,  mine,  and  we  would  kick  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back. 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Yes.  You  certainly  could  do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that.  We  think  ­­ you  know,  we  have  presented  it.  It's

aired  in  the  amicus  briefs.  And  Mr.  Smith  certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  addressed  it  at  greater  length  in  his  reply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  But  if  that's  your  view,  it's  certainly  well 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  Court's  right  to  kick  it  back  to  the  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  for  consideration  of  these  issues. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Fletcher,  is  it  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

view  that  all  of  this  discussion  of  prevailing  parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  really  academic  because  there's  no  way  that  the  EEOC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  satisfy  the  Christiansburg  standard? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  I  think  I  agree  with  that, 

    

   

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg.  And  that's  where  I  was  going  to  go, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  to  say  another  option  for  this  Court  is  to  resolve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  on  the  alternative  ground  that  we've  raised,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  Christiansburg. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  seems  even  worse.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

mean,  nobody  has  thought  about  that.  It  seems  to  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated  factual  scenario,  you  know.  There  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  in  which  you  could  proceed  with  a  class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly  and  circumstances  in  which  you  couldn't,  and  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  nothing  about  whether  this  is  the  circumstances, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  or  the  other. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FLETCHER:  Well,  you  don't  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  don't  have  to  resolve  it  on  the  merits.  But  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  all  you  need  to  do  is  to  say  it  was  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable  for  us  to  think  that  we  had  done  it  here.

And  I  think  the  way  that  you  know  that  is  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  Murphy,  in  a  very  persuasive  dissent,  concluded 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  were  not  only  reasonable,  but  correct  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking  that  we'd  satisfied  our  obligations.  And  also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  not  even  Petitioner  is  defending  the  rule  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court  applied. 

 

 

 

            

The  district  court  said  you  cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliate  a  claim  on  a  classwide  basis.  You  have  to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

conciliate  on  behalf  of  each  and  every  one  of  these  67 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals.  That's  the  rule  the  Eighth  Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

applied.  That's  the  rule  Judge  Murphy  criticized.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  doesn't  defend  it.  What  Petitioner  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instead  is  that  this  was  all  fine  as  long  as  we  had  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pattern­or­practice  theory.  And  it  only  became  not  fine 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  we  lost  on  summary  judgment  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pattern­or­practice  issue.  But  I  don't  think  that  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

our  ­­ our  conciliation  can  become  inadequate  only  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  lose  a  summary  judgment  motion. 

   

 

 

 

            

Thank  you. 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Smith,  you  have  three  minutes  remaining. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

           

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  PAUL  M.  SMITH 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SMITH:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

First  of  all,  on  the  question  of  Buckhannon

and  this  idea  that  we  have  to  show  a  change  in  the  legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship  between  the  parties,  the  ­­ the  first  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Buckhannon  says  is  the  paradigm  of  a  ­­ a  case 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there's  been  a  prevailing  party  is  where  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  has  been  entered.  It  only  goes  on  to  talk 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  this  other  more  complicated  stuff  about  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationships  when  it's  talking  about  things  plaintiffs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

win  short  of  a  judgment.  But  there's  nothing  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Buckhannon  that  says  a  judgment  can't  be  treated  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  for  a  prevailing  party. 

   

 

 

            

Now,  to  the  extent  it  matters  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature  of  the  dismissal  here  was  ­­ and  I  don't  know 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  should,  but  if  it  does  ­­ I'd  point  out  that  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncertainty  about  the  nature  of  the  dismissal  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arises  from  the  fact  that  the  government  never  made  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  in  the  courts  below  that  the  distinction  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  difference.  And,  indeed,  it  contradicted  the  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  it's  now  making.  It  said  to  the  Eighth  Circuit  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  is  on  page  11  in  our  reply  brief  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote  ­­ it  said,  quote,  "The  court  recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal  as  a  severe  remedy  and  acknowledged  it  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

result  in  dozens  of  potentially  meritorious  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harassment  claims  never  seeing  the  inside  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courtroom."

result,  not  would  result. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  No,  no.  This  is  ­­ I'm  reading 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  quote  from  their  brief  where  they  left  out  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word  "may"  because  they  thought  that  it  didn't  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference.  That  they  knew  at  the  time  and  understood, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  at  least  believed,  she  was  referring  to  the  fact  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  individual  women  might  be  able  to  litigate  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  claims.  But  they  recognized  over  and  over  again  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  courts  below  that  the  "may"  didn't  mean  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EEOC  could  come  back  and  litigate,  that  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precluded.  That's  why  they  filed  their  Rule  60  motion 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five  years  later. 

 

 

            

Now,  to  the  extent  there  was  an  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  shouldn't  get  all  these  fees,  we  should  maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  a  little  bit  of  fees  because  we  should  have  raised 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  issue  early  on,  the  problem  here  precisely  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  action.  The  two  are  tied  together,  and  they  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both,  Judge  Reed  found,  frivolous,  the  argument  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  pattern  of  practice  here,  and  then  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  they  could  go  on  and  litigate  on  behalf  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  individuals  once  the  class  action  washed  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're  ­­ they're  part  of  a  package.  But  until  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Did  she  hold  that  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  to  investigate  and  conciliate  each  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim?

MR.  SMITH:  She  said  that  where  there  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  valid  pattern  or  practice.  I  don't  think  there's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  in  ­­ in  the  court's  decision  that  suggests  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  never  conciliate  a  class  claim.  The  court  so  held 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  General  Telephone.  She  cites  the  case.  I  don't  know 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  judge  was  intending  to  ­­ to  second­guess  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  decision  in  General  Telephone  about  how  pattern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  practice  cases  are  litigated.  The  question  is  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  don't  have  any  kind  of  a  policy  or  ­­ or  standard 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operating  procedure.  You  have  a  handful  of  individual 

   

  

 

 

 

 

stories,  or  maybe  a  large  number  of  individual  stories. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

How  do  you  conciliate  those?  And  the  answer  she  gave 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  you  have  to  conciliate  them  one  by  one,  just  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  ­­ or  you're  bypassing  the  statutory  procedure  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statutory  policy. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  is  the  rule  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  would  like  us  to  announce?  When  is  it  right  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award  prevailing  defendants  attorneys'  fees? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  When  they  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  would  be  your  rule? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  When  they've  won  a  judgment  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

prevailed,  and  where  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  doesn't  matter  with 

  

 

 

 

 

or  without  prejudice?
