CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in Number 02-524, Janette Price, Warden


versus Duyonn Andre Vincent.


Mr. Busch.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR A. BUSCH


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BUSCH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


This case involves a gang-related murder in


which a jury found the defendant guilty beyond a


reasonable doubt.  There was one trial conducted, and the


defendant was sentenced to life in prison.


The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in its 

conclusion that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision on


double jeopardy was unreasonable.  The AEDPA precludes


habeas corpus relief where a State court makes reasonable


factual determinations.  The Michigan Supreme Court's


decision was not only reasonable, but also correct.


The Michigan Supreme Court's decision was


correct for three reasons.


First, this was a factual matter which was


reasonably decided.


Second, the trial judge's --

 QUESTION:  When you -- when you say this was a


factual matter, I got the impression that as to basic


facts, there really wasn't any dispute about them.


MR. BUSCH:  Mr. Chief Justice, the Michigan


Supreme Court was evaluating what exactly this trial judge


said.  It was ambiguous.  And in trying to determine what


he said, then we could understand, or they could


understand what he had done and what legal import that


had.


QUESTION:  But -- but there was no -- all I'm


saying, there was no doubt about what -- what he said. 


The -- the legal import is -- may be much more difficult


to figure out.


MR. BUSCH:  Your Honor, the factual question in


terms of what it was that he said is -- is different than 

what he had actually done.  And therein lying --


understanding what this judge had done or said, the


meaning of it, then would give us some understanding of


what the legal import was.


QUESTION:  Well, I guess there are really three


questions, aren't there?  One is what he said, and


there -- as the Chief Justice says, there's no dispute on


what he said.  The second question is what he meant by


what he said.  And the third question is, once you know


what he meant, at law does that constitute a -- a final

judgment.


MR. BUSCH:  Yes, that's correct.


QUESTION:  So there are three questions, and --


and which one -- is the middle one, what he meant, as


opposed to what he said -- is that a factual or a -- or a


legal one?


MR. BUSCH:  That -- it would be our position


that it is a factual question and courts -- the Court in


Parker versus Dugger and Wainwright versus Goode have


dealt with this issue.  Where we have ambiguous rulings of


a trial judge, that has been found to be a factual --


QUESTION:  I'm not sure actually -- your


inference.  I mean, it's quite a fine point, but I guess I


wouldn't say necessarily that what he meant has anything


to do with it. 


That is, he said certain things in the 

world, and if he had a secret meaning, we don't care nor


does the law.  But having said these particular things in


the world, then the question would be, can the Michigan


Supreme Court -- does it -- did it -- it characterized


those things, and it said as a matter of Michigan law,


those things said in the world do not amount to a judgment


of acquittal.


So then I guess we would -- if that's the way to


look at it, then we would have the problem of deciding


whether, even though as a matter of Michigan law, those

events that took place in the world do not amount to a


judgment of acquittal.  Nonetheless, for purposes of the


Federal Double Jeopardy Clause, do they amount to a


judgment of acquittal?


Those would be two legal questions.  One, a


State law question, and one, a Federal question, and no


factual question.


MR. BUSCH:  Well --


QUESTION:  But that's something of a quibble


because I don't know that leads us to a different place.


MR. BUSCH:  The Michigan court found that this


trial judge's decision was, in fact, tentative.  And that


decision and conclusion was reasonable.  The judge, at


page 12 of the joint exhibit, speaks of -- and if I could


turn to that page. 


The judge starts out by saying, well, 

my impression is at this time --


QUESTION:  What page?


MR. BUSCH:  Page 12 of the --


QUESTION:  Page 12 of what?


MR. BUSCH:  At the bottom of page 12 of the


joint -- the joint appendix.  Excuse me.


The court says, nothing?  Well, my impression at


this time is that there's not been shown.  And then at


page 18 of the same exhibit, the court actually schedules


an 8:30 motion the following day when the prosecutor in

this case -- the assistant prosecutor asked the court if


he could be heard.  And the judge said, I'll be glad to


hear you.  And in fact, the court had originally scheduled


the attorneys to be there at 10:00 and then changed the


time for them to show up before the jury came back.


And lastly I think it shows that no one who was


involved in this case at the trial level actually believed


that a final ruling had been made.  The court says at


page 34 -- excuse me.  The defense counsel says -- and I'm


quoting Mr. Odette -- that's correct.  They don't -- I'm


not disputing that, but it's my firm impression that when


I left the court yesterday, that there had been a ruling


and that Mr. Stamos had indicated he'd like to have the


matter reconsidered.  And I believe the court said,


whatever.


And what's instructive is what the judge said


next.  That's right.  And I -- well, I said, yes, I'd be


glad to listen, or words to that effect.


Lastly --


QUESTION:  What about the docket entry?  Was


there a docket entry too?


MR. BUSCH:  There was a docket entry which was


made by a clerk which was not reviewed by -- and which is


not reviewed by the trial judge.  And in Michigan, the


docket entry isn't dispositive of whether or not the judge

had made a final ruling of acquittal or a judgment of


acquittal.


QUESTION:  May I -- may I just ask you a further


question to make sure that I understand the -- the sort of


the assumption behind your argument?  And it's really the


same question that Justice Breyer and Justice Scalia I


think were -- were raising.


My understanding is that the courts, up to this


point, have treated the issue here as an issue of fact. 


What was the judge -- what did the judge think he was


doing?  Did he understand or could one reasonably


understand that the had made a final ruling or not?


It might also have been treated as an issue of


law.  Given what the judge did, even if he thought he had


made a final ruling, he might, as a matter of law, 

consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause, have been able


to change his mind if he hadn't issued a formal order and


if no one had acted in reliance.


But I understand that legal question, the way I


just put it, is not the question that people understood


has been decided in this case, and that everybody is


treating this as a -- as an issue of the factual question


and that's what you're addressing.  Am I correct?


MR. BUSCH:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Okay.

 MR. BUSCH:  The Court has also -- and without


conceding my case, in the alternative, if this Court was


to conclude that this judge had, in fact, issued or made a


judgment of acquittal, it would be the people's position


or the petitioner's position that the trial court need not


be able to reconsider to reach a just result because


they -- they rule so swiftly.  In other words, the


Michigan court was correct because judges, trial judges in


particular, need time to reflect.  They're often making


these decisions without trial transcripts, in many cases


without extensive legal research.


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Busch, this case here


come -- the case comes to us under -- under AEDPA; that


is, that you don't have to show that the Michigan Supreme


Court was correct as a matter of law in its decision.  You


have -- your -- your opponent has to show that either it


was an unreasonable application of our precedents or


contrary to our precedents, if it's a legal question, and


if it's a factual question, that the Michigan Supreme


Court made unreasonable findings of fact.


MR. BUSCH:  Exactly.  And also, this Court has


held and the statute requires that that finding of fact be


presumed to be correct.


QUESTION:  Mr. Busch, why wouldn't it be


unreasonable if, as respondent asserts, the Michigan rules

provide that a directed verdict made at the close of the


evidence, that the judge may not reserve decision, must


decide it, may not reserve decision.  I think that's what


the judge ended up doing here, is that not so?  When he


reconsidered, he reserved decision 'til the end of the


defense case.


MR. BUSCH:  Yes, and in fact, in this particular


case, the judge did not come to a conclusion as to -- did


not enter a verdict of acquittal.  In this particular


matter, the court held -- in that particular circumstance,


it said in the opinion that it was harmless error in their


opinion.  However --


QUESTION:  They -- did they address -- I didn't


notice that the court had addressed the Michigan rule that


said --


MR. BUSCH:  They --


QUESTION:  -- you can't reserve decision.


MR. BUSCH:  The rule of the Michigan courts --


that is, the Michigan Rules of Criminal Procedure at


6.419, I believe it is -- requires that there be some


plain statement made, essentially, that there be something


clear.  And that was -- and it is -- our position that the


court --


QUESTION:  I don't understand what you mean. 


Are you addressing Justice Ginsburg's question?  She's

MR. BUSCH:  At the close of the prosecutor's


QUESTION:  Is that what the rule applies to?  At


the close of the prosecutor's proof?  Or does it apply to


only when the whole trial has been completed?


MR. BUSCH:  It -- it applies when the motion is


made is my understanding.


QUESTION:  I don't understand that.


QUESTION:  Well, that's not really an answer. 


If it's just the prosecutor's case and the motion is made, 

is that covered by the rule, or is it required that both


the prosecutor and the defense case be in?


MR. BUSCH:  No.  It can be made at any time


and -- and any point in --


QUESTION:  A motion can be made, but --


MR. BUSCH:  That is, the motion for a directed


verdict of acquittal.


QUESTION:  Do you have the rule, the rule of


criminal procedure, so we'll know -- that might give us


the answer to this question.

 MR. BUSCH:  The --


QUESTION:  The Michigan rule that says the trial


judge shall not reserve decision on the defendant's


motion.  Does that rule apply when the motion is made at


the close of the prosecutor's case?


MR. BUSCH:  The rule is 6.419(D), and it's cited


at page 17 of the petitioner's brief.


QUESTION:  Is it quoted there too?


QUESTION:  What does it say?


MR. BUSCH:  It says -- about in the middle of


the page in -- in bold, it says, did not substantially


comply with the requirements of MCR 6.419(D), and provide


that, quote, the court must state orally on the record or


in a written ruling made a -- a part of the record its


reasons for granting or denying a motion for a directed 

verdict of acquittal.  And my understanding of that is --


that rule is that anytime the motion is made, the judge is


supposed to make clear the reasons why he's granting a


directed verdict.


QUESTION:  Well --


QUESTION:  What is --


QUESTION:  But in ordinary trial practice


certainly you -- you can't -- the defense counsel in a


criminal case can't get up after the prosecution has


called two witnesses and said, I move for -- I -- I move

for a judgment of acquittal.  I would think the first time


that could be made ordinarily would be --


MR. BUSCH:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- after the close of the


prosecution's case.


MR. BUSCH:  That's correct, once the evidence is


presented.


QUESTION:  And what has the rule, as you just


quoted it, got to do with -- with reservation?  In other


words, the judge can say, my reasons are A, B, and C, but


I'm going to sleep on it, and -- and tomorrow morning I


may come up with D and -- and rule the other way.  I mean,


what's that -- what's it got to do with reservation,


his -- his reserving his right to change the ruling at a


later time?


MR. BUSCH:  The rights of the judge to change


his mind -- our -- our position is, is that he has that


right until the jury would be discharged.


QUESTION:  Well, does the rule address that?  I


mean, Justice Ginsburg asked a question going to


reasonableness that depended on what she understood from


the -- from the briefs to be a Michigan rule saying the


judge can't reserve his right to change his mind later or


reserve judgment on the motion when it's made.


QUESTION:  In respondent's brief, it's put in

quotes.  And it sounds like it's quoting from a rule,

the defendant's motion.


MR. BUSCH:  Yes, that --


QUESTION:  Do those words appear in the rule?


MR. BUSCH:  Yes, that's the rule.


QUESTION:  That's fine.  And what motion does it


refer to?  A motion made at what point?  At any point at


all?


MR. BUSCH:  That's my -- I don't think it's


specific, but I think the --


QUESTION:  Wow.


MR. BUSCH:  -- Chief Justice --


QUESTION:  So after two witnesses are called by


the prosecution, the motion can be made and the judge 

cannot reserve?


MR. BUSCH:  Excuse me.  At the close of the


prosecutor's proofs, that motion would be appropriate


under our rules of criminal procedure.


QUESTION:  Do -- do we have the full text of


this rule before us?


MR. BUSCH:  The rule is quoted at page 29a,

QUESTION:  The cert petition.


QUESTION:  In the cert petition.


QUESTION:  Yes, and footnoted.


QUESTION:  Yes.  It -- it says after the


prosecution's case has rested.


MR. BUSCH:  Yes, that's right.


QUESTION:  It's a little hard to understand


that.  Anyway, they said it was harmless error.  The --


the court -- the courts -- the Michigan court said it's


harmless error, all right.  But it's a little hard to


understand.


It says you -- you -- the prosecution finishes


the case.  The defendant then says, judge, I move for a


directed verdict.  All right?  Or a failure of proof,


whatever the words are.  Then it says the judge could give


his reasons in writing -- I mean, that's one way -- or


orally.  How is the judge supposed to do this without


taking some time?  What does reserve there mean?  Does it

mean he has to pass on it before they present the --


the -- he has to decide it before the defense presents its


case?  Does it mean you can't reserve it 'til after the


defense has presented the case?  Does it mean you have to


rule instantly?  What does it mean?


MR. BUSCH:  Your Honor, I --


QUESTION:  It can't mean instantly.  What?


MR. BUSCH:  The -- the rule means that he should


decide as promptly as he can is the way I understand --


QUESTION:  Now, Mr. Busch, may I make this


suggestion?  It seems to me the rule distinguishes between


motions made after the prosecution has rested and motions


made after the entire case is in.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION: 


It says in the latter case, the judge 

can reserve, take his time on it.


MR. BUSCH:  Yes.


QUESTION:  It seems to -- it strikes me, just


reading the thing, that the point of the rule is that


before the defense goes forward, the defense has a right


to know what the ruling is.


QUESTION:  That's what I would think.


QUESTION:  Now, in this case before the defense


went forward, it knew what the ruling was because the


judge had come in the next morning and said, okay, I --

you know, I've -- I'm going to listen to you again.  I've


listened to you again, and -- and, in point of fact,


I'm -- I'm not going to grant the motion.  And isn't that


enough to satisfy what seems to be the point of the rule,


and that is, before a defendant goes forward with a case,


he's got to know whether he has to or not?  Isn't --


don't -- isn't that a fair way of reading this thing?


MR. BUSCH:  Yes, and I think that happened in


this case.  This defendant came prepared to try the case


on a first degree murder theory, and nothing substantially


changed that and he was not prejudiced in any way.


QUESTION:  No.  But before he -- before he went


forward with his evidence, the judge had changed his mind


or come to a further, more final conclusion, however you


want to characterize it, so that before he went forward, 

he knew the judge was saying, no, I'm not throwing out the


first degree murder charge.  And isn't that enough under


the rule?


MR. BUSCH:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Okay.


QUESTION:  But you would say that if the --


MR. BUSCH:  May -- can -- can I --


QUESTION:  -- if the defendant was operating


under the impression that the -- if the defendant didn't


know before he put on his case, would it be too late for

the judge to change his mind at the end of the defense

MR. BUSCH:  Our -- no.  Our position would be


that he can change his mind anytime up until that jury is


discharged.


Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the


balance of my time for rebuttal?


QUESTION:  Yes, you may, Mr. Busch.


We'll hear from Mr. Lamken.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. LAMKEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


It's a long-established background principle 

that mid-trial rulings are inherently subject to


reconsideration by the trial court itself until the end of


trial.  That is especially so where, as here, a party


promptly seeks reconsideration which necessarily renders


the initial ruling inconclusive.  That rule reflects four


important legal and practical considerations.


First, trial courts often must rule swiftly


without the benefit of extended briefing, argument, or


deliberation or even a copy of the trial transcript.  They


could not operate justly absent the opportunity for

reconsideration.


Second, the Double Jeopardy Clause affords the


government a full and fair opportunity to make its case in


the first tribunal.  In the context of trial, that full


and fair opportunity includes reconsideration.  Indeed,


reconsideration is particularly important precisely


because the government very often cannot appeal.


QUESTION:  I guess we never reach your -- your


argument, do we, if we decide this on the 2254 ground.


MR. LAMKEN:  That's correct, Justice Scalia. 


The Court could -- there are many stopping points short of


our argument on which the Court could resolve this --


QUESTION:  Well, we shouldn't reach your ground


unless we have to, should we?  Because your ground is a


constitutional ground.


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, Your Honor, the Court would


have discretion to reach the constitutional ground if it


thought it were important enough to resolve the


disagreements in the State courts and their -- their


rulings that are contrary to --


QUESTION:  I thought we try to avoid deciding


constitutional questions.


MR. LAMKEN:  Yes.  That is -- that is one of the


rules the Court follows and it's a general rule, but in


important cases, particularly in the qualified immunity

context, for example, the Court will -- will sometimes


announce the constitutional rule because it's sufficiently


important to settle the matter rather than resolving it on


statutory grounds or in -- in the context of qualified


immunity on reasonableness grounds.


QUESTION:  Well, that's sort of a special


situation because in those situations you could never get


the answer if you always decided it on -- on immunity


grounds.  I mean --


MR. LAMKEN:  Justice Scalia, the Court would


have discretion to reach the constitutional issue if it


chose, but it would -- certainly would not be required to


do so.  For example, the Court decided a double jeopardy


issue in Monge, but that was 4 years after addressing the


exact same issue in -- on Teague grounds in an earlier 

case.  And for those 4 years, the lower Federal courts and


the courts in the State of California for which it had


special applicability suffered through a -- a tremendous


amount of uncertainty.


And we would urge the Court, given the


uncertainty that's out there, to reach the constitutional


question.  However, the Court would have discretion to


resolve this on 2254 grounds --


QUESTION:  If we follow the position that you're


urging and -- and the judge rules, as here, premeditation

is out of the case, I'm not going to charge first degree,


defendant puts on defendant's case on the assumption first


degree is out of the case and then the judge says at the


end, oh, sorry, I'm reversing and I'm going to charge. 


Now, you say the judge can change his mind at any time


'til the end of the line.  It seems to me that would be


grossly unfair to a defendant.


MR. LAMKEN:  For double jeopardy purposes, but


not for due process purposes.  That would raise a -- raise


a -- a serious due -- excuse me -- due process issue. 


It's the exact same issue that arises, for example, when a


trial court dismisses a count of a complaint, which raises


no double jeopardy concerns at all and then, very late in


the trial, determines that he had erred in dismissing


an -- a count of the indictment. 


When that happens, the 

ordinary process is either the court must reopen the


evidence to permit the defendant to put on the defense


that he didn't have the opportunity to present, or the


defendant may be entitled to a mistrial.  But that is very


much a fairness trial, due process issue, not a question


of double jeopardy.


The third point is that double jeopardy --


QUESTION:  So then in Fong Foo when Judge


Wyzanski I think got angry at the prosecution for some


reason that escaped the Court and everyone else, directs

an acquittal, what the prosecutor should have done is just


go back to Judge Wyzanski and say, Judge, you made a


mistake here.  I haven't been talking to the witness in


the hall as you thought, or whatever, and then Judge


Wyzanski could have, in fact, taken back the -- the


judgment of the directed -- directed verdict of acquittal,


although this Court later wouldn't have been able to do it


in your view.


MR. LAMKEN:  In our view that's precisely


correct, so long as Judge Wyzanski had not discharged the


jury because once you discharge the jury, the -- the


defendant's right to trial before his tribunal of choice


has been eliminated.  The -- so long as the jury hasn't


been discharged, the trial court has inherent authority to


correct its own mistakes. 


No double jeopardy purpose is 

served by giving -- by precluding reconsideration to give


the defendant the benefit of acquittal to which no court,


and certainly not the jury and not the trial court that


putatively granted it, believes the defendant is entitled. 


Particularly --


QUESTION:  What's your best authority for that


proposition from this Court?


MR. LAMKEN:  The --

 QUESTION:  Or does that take us somewhat further


than we've gone?


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, I think it would -- our best


case would probably be this Court's statements in Arizona


versus Washington, in essence that the government --


although the government often doesn't get an appeal and it


doesn't get a second shot at -- bite of the apple, it does


get one full and fair opportunity before the trial court. 


In our view that full and fair opportunity must include


reconsideration precisely because trial courts move so


swiftly and because the initial decision by a trial court


isn't meant to be a final decision but is, in fact, part


of the deliberative process, part of the ongoing dialogue


in trial among the judge, among a prosecutor and


defendant's counsel.


QUESTION:  So if you drop the first degree


murder charge -- or the judge orders it dismissed and then


the defendant testifies thinking, well, at least I'm not


going to be tried for first degree, in your view the trial


judge can change its ruling and reinstate the first degree


murder charges because the defendant shouldn't have


relied?  He --


MR. LAMKEN:  No.  We think it's --


QUESTION:  The -- the defendant should know that


the judge can change his mind, and so he better not take

the stand.


MR. LAMKEN:  No.  The ordinary rule -- and this


is the same rule that applies where a court, for example,


dismisses a count of the indictment -- is that defendants


are entitled to rely on the interlocutory rulings.  If


they do so to their detriment and to their prejudice and


it denies them the opportunity to present their fair


defense, that is a significant due process problem and may


entitle --


QUESTION:  What --


QUESTION:  Well, it wouldn't be if -- excuse me.


QUESTION:  What -- what if you have a series of


defendants in a -- in a case and it's being tried, and at


the close of the prosecution's evidence, the judge


dismisses the indictment as against one of the defendants, 

but keeps on so the jury is still there?  What happens


then?  Can the -- the prosecution come back a couple days


later and say, you made a mistake?


MR. LAMKEN:  That's, actually points up a


difficult question which is whether or not the dismissal


of the -- well, if it's dismissal in the indictment, it


certainly isn't a double jeopardy problem, but if it's a


judgment of acquittal at that point, the question the


court would have to confront --


QUESTION:  Well, say -- change my hypothetical

to a judgment of acquittal.


MR. LAMKEN:  Right.  That's what I assumed you


had meant.  And if that were the case, the court would


have to decide whether or not that there -- there's


constructively or through legal fiction the discharge of


the jury with respect to that defendant even though the


actual jury is still there 


--

QUESTION:  But that's --


MR. LAMKEN:  We believe the actual answer would


be --


QUESTION:  That's an extraordinary doctrine.


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, I -- I would believe that the


proper answer would be that if the jury is still


available, the prosecution can seek reconsideration.  But


one could say that the jury was constructively discharged 

with respect to that defendant and thereby preclude the


prosecution from seeking reconsideration.  But the


critical moment in all of those cases is what constitutes


discharge of the jury, the defendant's chosen trier of


fact.


QUESTION:  But getting back to the earlier


point, if a -- if the defendant testifies, thinking


there's going to be no first degree charge, and it's later


reinstated, under your position I think you would say, he


shouldn't have relied.  The rule is that he knows the

judge can change his mind.  Therefore, his reliance was at


his peril.


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, the Constitution --


QUESTION:  I mean, I don't know why you don't


argue -- that's the consequence of your argument it seems.


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, certainly the Constitution


doesn't require there to be mid-trial rulings on judgments


for acquittal.  In fact, Federal Rule of Criminal


Procedure 29(b) specifically allows --


QUESTION:  No, but the hypothetical is there is


one.


MR. LAMKEN:  Right.  And if the defendant relies


to his detriment and it prevents him from presenting a


fair defense to which due process entitles him, we believe


that he might be entitled to a mistrial.


But we -- nothing of that sort happened here


because defendant not only was on notice that this -- that


the ruling was subject to change, but if you look at the


point in the joint appendix, which is the penultimate


page, where the court announced -- page 46, where the


court announces that it has decided to reconsider, there's


no objection from the defense saying, wait a minute, we


relied.  Our whole defense rested on this ruling.  There's


no statement to that effect.


QUESTION:  I suppose parties can -- can

repudiate a contract, can't they, since there's no -- no


involuntary servitude?  But the mere fact that one party


to a contract knows that the other party can repudiate it,


does not mean that the repudiation can be cost-free.


MR. LAMKEN:  That -- that --


QUESTION:  The other party is entitled to rely


upon the contract despite his knowledge that it can be


repudiated.


MR. LAMKEN:  Right.  I -- I think that just


points out the general rule, that -- when a trial court


issues a mid-trial ruling, the defendant generally has a


right to -- to rely on it, and if he relies on it and it


denies him his opportunity to present a fair defense, that


presents a serious due process problem.  But it is not a


double jeopardy problem because double jeopardy is 

concerned with having two trials against the defendant


when the prosecution had its full and fair opportunity in


the first.


The final problem with the contrary rule is that


it requires appellate courts to engage in an often


unrealistic endeavor to go through and try and determine


what the trial court, through its spontaneous and


sometimes extemporaneous statements, really meant to do or


what it actually did.  For example, in this case it seems


to come down to the question of whether the words, my

impression at this time, is -- suggest sufficient


tentativeness and whether the word okay is the functional


equivalent of it is so ordered.


In addition, under respondent's approach, the


trial -- the court of appeals would be required to


determine whether the request for reconsideration came


promptly enough, whether or not it came in the same


breath -- I see I'm out of time.


Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Lamken.


Mr. Moran, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. MORAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


First of all, a brief factual correction.  The


change in the judge's ruling did not occur before


Mr. Vincent testified.  The change in the judge's ruling


occurred on April 2nd, 1992, 2 days after the ruling had


been made after Mr. Vincent had testified.  What happened


on April 1st, 1992 was the judge indicated that he would


reconsider his motion and hold it in abeyance, but he did


not, at that time, take back the directed verdict of


acquittal.


QUESTION:  Well, he didn't take it back, but he

made it clear that he -- he did not consider it -- he did


not consider that he had made a final ruling.  At least


that was clear.  It was clear that no final ruling had


been made before the testimony occurred.


MR. MORAN:  He -- he took the position, Justice


Scalia, that he could take back his ruling because he had


not informed the jury of it.


QUESTION:  Right.  Right.


MR. MORAN:  A position that we submit is wrong


under this Court's precedent in Sanabria.


QUESTION:  Can I -- can I ask you, do you


believe like Justice Breyer that a judge can enter a final


order without meaning to enter a final order?


MR. MORAN:  What a reviewing court has to do


under this precedent in Martin Linen, Justice Scalia, is 

look at the words and actions of the trial court and


decide whether or not it amounts to a ruling.


Now, in this case --


QUESTION:  And -- and you do that just


objectively, and even if there's plenty of evidence that


the judge didn't intend it to be a final ruling, if he


used certain magic words, it's a final -- it's a final


ruling.


MR. MORAN:  Well, actually, Justice Scalia, it's


petitioner who's arguing for a magic words approach, or

the Michigan Supreme Court at least.


QUESTION:  No.  I -- I don't know who -- who --


in whose favor it breaks.  I'm just asking what your


position on it is, whether -- whether -- because on


that -- on that question hinges whether we are dealing


here with a question of fact, as we would be in


interpreting -- in -- in deciding, you know, what he


intended, or a question of law, as we would be in


interpreting the words of a contract where indeed it


doesn't matter what the parties intended.  If they express


themselves this way, you -- you take the objective meaning


of it.  Right?  And that's a question of law for the court


and not a question of fact for the jury.


MR. MORAN:  Well, Justice Scalia, our position


is, is that the trial judge's intent is a relevant fact, 

but whether or not what he did amounted to an acquittal --


QUESTION:  Is a question of law.


MR. MORAN:  -- is a question of law.


QUESTION:  Well, in -- in your position here


attacking a State judgment, you don't -- you don't


immediately get to the constitutional question.  You get


to the question of whether the Michigan Supreme Court's


ruling was either contrary to our precedents or an


unreasonable application of them.  In other words, the


Michigan Supreme Court could have been wrong as a matter

of abstract constitutional law and it could still be


upheld here.


MR. MORAN:  Yes.  What we attacked in Federal


district court on habeas was the Michigan Supreme Court's 


conclusion that there had never been an acquittal at all,


and we persuaded the Federal district judge and the Sixth


Circuit that the Michigan Supreme Court's conclusion that


there had not been an acquittal was an unreasonable


application of this Court's precedents, particularly Ball,


Kepner, Green, because the Michigan Supreme Court placed


primary emphasis on the absence of formal trappings, and


this Court has repeatedly held that even in the absence of


any written judgment at all, as in Ball and Kepner, that a


final directed -- a verdict of acquittal is final.


QUESTION: 


It could be, but presumably Michigan 

knows Michigan law, and if they want to say, under the law


of Michigan, the events that took place here do not amount


to an acquittal, I guess that's their right.  Now, is


there anything in the cases that you cite which says that


Federal law requires Michigan to count these things as an


acquittal?


MR. MORAN:  Well, this Court's precedents,


particularly Martin Linen, teach that what the reviewing


court is supposed to do is look not to the form of the


trial court's ruling but the substance.

 QUESTION:  All right.  Now, it happens in


Michigan they don't do that.  In Michigan, they have the


Michigan system.  Now, what is it that tells Michigan you


have to, as a matter of Federal law, count this as an


acquittal?  I quite agree with you that there are cases


where the Court has said this is an acquittal, but I don't


think they're faced in those cases with a State court that


says the contrary.


MR. MORAN:  Well, Smalis, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. MORAN:  Smalis came from a State court.


QUESTION:  Yes, but in Smalis there was no doubt


about what the judge had done.  I mean, there he expressly


found that the State had not proved its case and everybody


agreed he had done that, and then the State appealed to 

the higher courts in Pennsylvania.


MR. MORAN:  That's right.


In this case, however, if you look at the full


record, the trial judge himself -- and if we get to the


issue of intent, Justice Scalia -- the trial judge himself


says over and over, I made a ruling, I came to a


conclusion, I made a decision, and even at one point, I


granted a motion for a directed verdict.  He took the


position simply as a matter of law, double jeopardy law,


Federal double jeopardy law.

conclusion --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. MORAN:  -- that there had been no --


QUESTION:  -- but AEDPA doesn't say one way or


the other.  AEDPA doesn't use the term, legal conclusion.


MR. MORAN:  No.  But it --


QUESTION:  So what is your answer to my


question?


MR. MORAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, it matters for


AEDPA whether it's law or fact because then we're under 

(d)(1) or (d)(2).


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. MORAN:  And so --


QUESTION:  I'm asking you which one you -- you


want to be under, or perhaps you want to be under both.


MR. MORAN:  Well, it is our position that we win


under either because even if it's a finding of fact, it's


so unreasonable to say that there was no directed verdict


of acquittal here, that we should prevail.  But --


QUESTION:  Anyway, the Michigan Supreme Court

didn't find the fact against you, did it?  It just -- I --


as I understand it, it said it really doesn't -- didn't


matter to the Michigan Supreme Court.


MR. MORAN:  That's right.


QUESTION:  It said even if he had made a ruling,


unless -- unless the jury had been advised, it was


ineffective for double jeopardy purposes.


MR. MORAN:  Oh, that's not quite right, Justice


Scalia.  What -- what the Michigan Supreme Court ruled or


stated was they agreed with the Michigan Court of Appeals


and the dissenters in the Michigan Supreme Court that


characterizing the trial judge's comments as an acquittal


would require us to reverse Mr. Vincent's conviction.  The


Michigan Supreme Court actually said that.  So they -- and


that was after a discussion of Smalis.


Both the Michigan Court of appeals and the


Michigan Supreme Court, after reviewing this Court's


decision in Smalis, like so many other lower courts, have


come to the conclusion that what a trial judge may not do,


consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause, is revisit a


directed verdict at any point later in the trial.


QUESTION:  All right.  Suppose that what he says


is, I direct the verdict.  There are two defendants, Smith


and Brown, and the judge says, I direct a verdict in favor


of Smith.  Oh, my goodness.  I said the wrong thing.

that and this is what?  12 hours?


MR. MORAN:  No.  The difference between that and


this is that the ruling is not final.  Here the ruling was


unquestionably final.  The judge --


QUESTION:  How?  Why?


MR. MORAN:  I'm sorry?


QUESTION:  Why, how?  Explain that.


MR. MORAN:  Because the judge announced his


ruling.  All the parties, including the judge, understood


that under Michigan court rules, the judge could not 

reserve his decision, had to make it.  He did so.  He


announced his decision.  He said, okay.  Is there anything


else?


QUESTION:  Reserve means, I take it, that you


have to make a decision prior to the -- the defendant


putting on witnesses.


MR. MORAN:  It -- the -- the court rule doesn't


say that.  The court rule says --


QUESTION:  When I read the court rule and then


read the Federal rule, the difference in the practice is

what they mean by reserve under the Federal rule where you


can reserve -- and it happens every day -- is a district


judge says, you move at the end of the plaintiff's case. 


I'm the district judge.  I say I'm going to let it go to


the jury.  If the jury acquits, you're home free.  If it


convicts, I'll go back to it.  That happens all the time. 


And that, it seems to me, is what the Michigan rule says


can't happen in Michigan --


QUESTION:  Well --


QUESTION:  Is that -- am I right?


MR. MORAN:  The Michigan rule -- I -- I don't --


frankly, I don't know because the Michigan rule simply


says the judge may not reserve his decision.


QUESTION:  But surely it can't mean that if a --


if a motion is made at quarter after 4:00 in the afternoon 

and the court customarily recesses at 4:30, that he can't


wait until the next morning, so no testimony being taken


in the meantime.


MR. MORAN:  In -- in that case that would --


that might well be all right because he hasn't made a


final decision.  The problem here -- we're not --


QUESTION:  Suppose in that case the -- the


arguments by the attorneys end at 4 o'clock.  The judge


says, well, I'll let you know my order.  He enters the --


he tells his clerk at 4:30, enter the order dismissing the

first degree charge.  He then comes back at 8:30 in the


morning, after having thought about it overnight.  He


tells the clerk, put in a new docket entry, order


withdrawn, motion to dismiss denied.  No one knows about


this until quarter to 9:00.  Defense doesn't even know


about it.  What result in that case?


MR. MORAN:  That's very similar to Lowe v. State


in the Kansas case in which the Kansas Supreme Court,


after this Court's decision in Smalis, concluded that a


judge couldn't do that even though there had been no


intervening proceedings.  The judge had --


QUESTION:  What interest is served by such a


rule?


MR. MORAN:  An acquittal is final.  That is the


most fundamental rule of this Court's double jeopardy --

QUESTION:  Well, but what -- no one -- no one


relies on it.  No one knew about it.


MR. MORAN:  But, Your Honor, this Court has said


over and over again that an acquittal by a judge, in the


context of a directed verdict, is equivalent to an


acquittal by a jury.  And the same --


QUESTION:  But he -- he didn't say, I acquit. 


The judge himself said this at the trial, he said, I


didn't enter a directed verdict.  I granted a motion.


MR. MORAN:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  In the judge's own mind, he didn't


acquit.


And what you're urging is so different from how


we approach trial rulings generally, and the point was


made that in a trial, things go fast, judge -- judges make


rulings.  It's very common, is it not, for a judge to make


a ruling and then go home that night, maybe read over the


daily transcript, maybe have her law clerk check a few


authorities, and say, oh, my goodness, I made a mistake,


the next morning.  You couldn't run trials -- I mean, the


trial judges don't have the luxury that appellate judges


do in that regard.  They have to make rulings on the spot,


and they can revisit them.  You -- you are suggesting that


this rule, like no other, is -- once the judge utters the


words, motion granted, that's the end of it. 

MR. MORAN:  I'm not arguing that, Justice


Ginsburg.  I am taking the position that if the judge


immediately corrects a mistake, as happened in People v.


Vilt, a case relied upon by the petitioner, that's


different.


QUESTION:  Well, what's different between --


QUESTION:  Why?


QUESTION:  -- saying at 4 o'clock in the


afternoon, I grant your motion, and then overnight -- and


then they come back the next morning and the judge says,

I'm not so sure.  Prosecutor, tell me more about this. 


What's the difference of the overnight interval?  Nothing


has happened.  The trial hasn't gone on.  No witnesses


have appeared.


MR. MORAN:  But, Your Honor, if that was the


law, then Smalis v. Pennsylvania is impossible to


understand because in Smalis the prosecution there could


have taken some sort of emergency appeal to the


Pennsylvania Supreme -- Pennsylvania Superior Court, got a


ruling late that afternoon, and come back the next morning


and resumed the trial.  And in fact, the prosecution tried


exactly that in a Tenth Circuit case, United States versus


Eliason.


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  I don't follow you


because I thought the judge in Smalis was firm throughout, 

that he never equivocated about what his ruling was.


MR. MORAN:  Actually the judge in Smalis agreed


to a reconsideration motion --


QUESTION:  But then he came up just where he was


the first time.


MR. MORAN:  Yes, that's -- that's right.


What I'm saying is, is that if double jeopardy


doesn't protect -- if there's no double jeopardy


violation, if it can be revisited quickly, then Smalis is


impossible to understand because Smalis then would simply

come down to if you can do it quickly, if you can get an


appeal to a higher court and a reversal quickly --


QUESTION:  Well, being -- being revisited on


appeal is different from being revisited at the trial by


the trial judge.  That's -- that's the distinction that's


being drawn by your opponent here.


MR. MORAN:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  And -- and the


point of that argument is that it makes it completely


dispositive as to whether there are other defendants


remaining, as I believe Mr. Chief Justice --


QUESTION:  You don't have to go that far at all. 


I mean, Smalis is not a case where the judge changed his


mind, I take it.  And this is a case where the judge


changed his mind.


MR. MORAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  So I'm back to my first question. 


The judge says, Smith, you're acquitted.  And 10 minutes


later he says, oh, my goodness, I used the wrong name.  It


was Brown.  Now, you're saying they can't retry Smith?


MR. MORAN:  If --


QUESTION:  My goodness, nothing at all happened


in those 10 minutes.  They were out drinking some water.


MR. MORAN:  If no further proceedings have


occurred, and that is the line that almost all --


QUESTION:  All right.  What -- what proceeding

occurred?  No proceeding occurred.  They adjourned for the


evening.  He comes back the next day and, at best, he says


for you, well, I misspoke.  I -- I didn't grant the


motion.  So what's the difference whether -- we're back to


Justice Ginsburg.  We're all pursuing exactly same thing


which I'm having trouble with, and --


MR. MORAN:  First of all, Justice Breyer, he


said, I granted the motion.  He took the position as a


matter --


QUESTION:  So does -- so does my judge.  I grant


the motion.  Smith -- Smith is acquitted.


MR. MORAN:  And he came back the next morning


and said I granted your motion.  He took the position that


it didn't count --


QUESTION: 


And he says, I say I granted the 

motion.  I acquitted Smith, but I misspoke.  It was Brown


I meant.


MR. MORAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  You're saying that in my case too


Smith is home free.


MR. MORAN:  If further proceedings have


occurred, which unquestionably occurred here, then


followed by an overnight recess, during a trial a


defendant --


QUESTION:  Which were the further proceedings?

13 through 18, the parties litigated a number of other


matters, including in which order will --


QUESTION:  But they were all --


QUESTION:  But no -- no evidence -- no -- no


witnesses testified, did they?


MR. MORAN:  Not at that point, no.  But what --


QUESTION:  There was nothing that -- that was


done to the defendant that the defendant himself did to


his detriment.


MR. MORAN:  We don't know because all we know --


QUESTION: 


Well, have we any reason to believe? 

MR. MORAN:  We know that his attorney made


decisions on matters such as who is going to go first,


will the defendants be present for each other's juries,


will witnesses be allowed in the courtroom, a


sequestration order.  He made those decisions at a point


when his client had been acquitted of first degree murder.


QUESTION:  No, but is there any reason to


believe that those decisions would have been different if


he had understood that first degree murder was going to be


in the case?

 MR. MORAN:  We simply don't know, Justice


Souter.  It's a --


QUESTION:  Well, we don't -- we don't know in


the sense that there -- there hasn't apparently been


specific litigation to that effect, but is there any


reason to suspect that the decisions would have been


different?  In other words, is there any reason whatever


to -- to think that there may have been detrimental


reliance here?


MR. MORAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Maybe there is, but what -- what is


it then?


MR. MORAN:  Yes.  Well, first of all, on those


particular decisions, we don't know and it's impossible to


reconstruct that at this point. 


What we do know is that 

during the overnight recess, Mr. Vincent and his


attorney -- as this Court noted in Geders versus the


United States, an overnight recess during a trial is a


critical time to make crucial decisions --


QUESTION:  No.  I -- I realize that, but by the


time he departed for the overnight recess, he knew that


the judge was going to take the matter up again the next


morning.  The judge had said so.


MR. MORAN:  That's actually not quite true as to


Mr. Vincent.  Mr. Vincent was removed from the courtroom

QUESTION:  But his lawyer knew.


QUESTION:  But his -- his counsel knew.  His


counsel knew.


MR. MORAN:  His lawyer was still there.  That's


right.


QUESTION:  Yes.  So -- so if -- if he -- if he


relied upon there being no change in the ruling, he was


doing so at his peril, was he not?


MR. MORAN:  The ruling had not been taken back,


though, Justice Souter.  All --


QUESTION:  No, the ruling had not been taken


back, but the -- the judge said, sure, I'll hear you,


prosecutor, in the morning. 


I'm always glad to hear 

people.  He made it -- he couldn't have made it more clear


that he did not understand that he had come to a final


conclusion on that motion, could he?


MR. MORAN:  What -- all he agreed to do is hear


more argument.  He did -- in no way indicate --


QUESTION:  But surely that -- that suggests that


he has not finally made up his mind.


MR. MORAN:  It suggests it, but it -- he


certainly doesn't say it.

might be a change as a result of what he had said before


they recessed?


MR. MORAN:  If I had been in trial counsel's


position, I wouldn't have known what to do because we have


a --


QUESTION:  Yes, you would.  You would have


defended your client as best you could, and you would know


that you could not treat with security what the judge had


said.  If you did, you were endangering your client --


MR. MORAN:  But --


QUESTION:  -- because the judge had signaled


that he might reverse his ruling --


MR. MORAN:  But --


QUESTION:  -- the next morning.


MR. MORAN:  As trial counsel stated the next


morning, it was my impression that you made a firm ruling,


judge.  So --


QUESTION:  Then at trial the next morning, if


what you say about the overnight being so critical to the


strategic planning, then counsel could say, judge, we

plotted all this thing out, give me a recess so we can


reshuffle the thing.  At that point, if there was any


detrimental reliance, the way to do it was to give back


the hours that had been lost.  Isn't that so?


MR. MORAN:  I don't know if that would be


possible with a -- with two juries.  There were actually


two juries in this case sitting around waiting for


the defense to --


QUESTION:  It wasn't requested, though.


MR. MORAN:  It -- it wasn't requested because at


the end of the hearing, in which the prosecution made his


improved closing argument to the judge, there was no


ruling.  The judge simply said, I'm going to think about


it.  I'm going to take it under advisement.  He didn't


make the ruling until after Mr. Vincent testified. 

QUESTION:  These are due process problems that


you're raising now, and I suppose we could always leave


them to be resolved by further proceedings below, inquiry


into whether there was any prejudice or not.  But that


doesn't go to the point that's before us here which is


whether for purposes of double jeopardy, this -- this


terminates the matter.


MR. MORAN:  I agree.  This Court's precedents --


QUESTION:  So it's -- it's no use arguing, well,


he could have been prejudiced.  Okay, he's prejudiced.

jeopardy, the prejudice is --

 MR. MORAN:  The rule from the Solicitor


General's position would make it completely dispositive as


to whether there happened to be other charges remaining,


as in Smalis itself, and whether or not there happened to


be other defendants.


QUESTION:  That's -- that may be true.  That's


why I'm nervous about the position.  But still, you from


your point of view, unfortunately, lose as long as


Michigan was -- was at least within the discretion that


Federal law grants them in characterizing what happened


here as not an acquittal.  I'm right about that.


MR. MORAN:  If they're correct that it was not


an acquittal.


QUESTION:  Well, not correct.  They -- they have


a degree of -- even under the law, that's -- I mean, under 

the law section too.


MR. MORAN:  I agree.  But if you look at the


trial judge's comments, he consistently maintains that


he -- he made a ruling.  And ruling is actually the exact


word from Martin Linen, that this Court has to decide


whether or not the trial judge made a ruling.


QUESTION:  Mr. Moran, I'd like to get back to an


AEDPA question, and that is, as I understand it, there is


a division among lower courts on just how much leeway a


trial judge has to take back a directed verdict.  And if

there is disarray in the lower courts, how can we say


there's clearly established law in your favor?


MR. MORAN:  Because what -- what AEDPA requires


is not to look at the decisions of the lower courts, but


to look to see whether the decision of the Michigan


Supreme Court was a clearly unreasonable application.


Now, I should point out, first of all, on that


issue whether a judge can take back a directed verdict,


the Michigan Supreme Court did not rule against us, in


fact indicated that it agreed with our position that a


judge may not take back a directed verdict if he had -- if


he has actually rendered one.  And the Michigan Court of


Appeals ruled the same way.


But if you look at the split of authority, it's


a very striking split of authority. 


The cases that cite 

and rely upon Smalis on very similar situations where


there is a directed verdict, a partial directed verdict


during an ongoing trial, so the trial continues, and then


the judge attempts to take back the directed verdict at


some point later in the trial, those courts that have


applied Smalis have, with one exception, held that the


judge cannot do it.  Those courts that have gone the other


way have almost uniformly relied on a Second Circuit


decision, United States versus LoRusso, which says that


there is no problem with doing that because it does not

result in a second trial.


And what this Court could not have been more


clear about in Smalis is that a double jeopardy is


violated not only if a reversal of a directed verdict


would result in a second trial, but if it would result in


a continuation of the same trial.


And that is why this case is constitutionally


indistinguishable from Smalis.  The only difference


between this case and Smalis is that instead of going to a


higher court, as was attempted by -- in the Tenth Circuit


in United States versus Ellison, what happened there is


that the prosecution -- there was a partial directed


verdict, exactly as in this case.  The prosecution ran


across --


QUESTION: 


But you -- that's assuming the --

assuming the whole factual point at issue here, that there


was a partial directed verdict.


MR. MORAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And in Smalis, there was no doubt


about that.


MR. MORAN:  Well, there was doubt as to what the


judge had done.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said it


wasn't a directed verdict because it was a legal ruling


and not a -- not --


QUESTION:  Well, but that -- that was a very

theoretical thing, whether as a matter of -- when you're


saying there's no evidence as a matter of law, that's a


factual ruling or a legal ruling.


MR. MORAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  I -- I don't think that bears on our


case.


MR. MORAN:  No, and that is -- and that is a


distinction.  That's why we have an issue one, Mr. Chief


Justice, is -- is, of course, we have to get past the


issue of was there a directed verdict.  Then we get to


issue two.  If there was a directed verdict, can the judge


take it back?  And that is where I maintain that this case


is constitutionally indistinguishable from Smalis.


On -- on issue one, I -- I just wanted to make a


further point about whether this is fact finding or a 

legal finding.  The Michigan Supreme Court itself did not


regard what it was doing as fact finding.  There was not


the slightest indication in the Michigan Supreme Court's


opinion that it thought it was engaged in fact finding. 


Nor did this Court think that it was engaged in fact


finding in several cases in which this Court has examined


arguably ambiguous district court transcripts to determine


whether or not an acquittal had been granted, for example,


Scott and even more clearly, Sanabria.


In Sanabria, this Court had to wade through a

difficult record to determine whether or not the district


court had, in fact, granted a directed verdict on both


theories, numbers theory and horse betting theory.


QUESTION:  Well, let me follow up on an earlier


question of Justice Breyer's.  Do you think that if this


is true under the Federal system that it was a directed


verdict, it must therefore be true under the -- under


an -- under any State system?


MR. MORAN:  Yes.  I believe that follows


immediately, well, first of all, from Maryland v. Benton


which applies Double Jeopardy Clause to the States, but


also from Crist --


QUESTION:  Well, but the fact that -- that that


case applies double jeopardy to the States I don't think


necessarily settles whether a particular State procedure 

is or is not a directed verdict.


MR. MORAN:  No.  But it also follows from


Crist v. Bretz in which this Court rejected a -- Montana's


attempt to declare that jeopardy doesn't attach until the


first witness is sworn in a jury trial.  And this Court


said, no.  Where -- where jeopardy attaches and terminates


is a matter of Federal constitutional law, and it


concluded, therefore, that Montana must follow the Federal


rule to that point which is that jeopardy attaches when


the jury is sworn.  And so this Court has consistently

applied the same principles about jeopardy-attaching and


jeopardy-terminating events whether the cases arise in


State or Federal court.


QUESTION:  Well, so the Federal rule is that it


attaches when there's been a directed verdict, but it's up


to State law when -- when there's been a directed verdict. 


I mean --


there.


MR. MORAN:  Your Honor, I find that --


QUESTION:  -- there's nothing incompatible


MR. MORAN:  Justice Scalia, I find that hard to


square with Martin Linen which teaches us that what a


reviewing court must do is putting aside form, looking at


substance to decide whether the trial court has found an


essential element of the offense is missing.  And here,


the trial judge clearly stated that there is no


premeditation been shown, that therefore second degree


murder is the appropriate charge, that a docket entry that


could not have been more clear was made to that effect on


that day, March 31st, 1992, and then followed by at least


five statements by the trial judge over the next 2 days


explaining that he had made a ruling, that he had directed


a verdict, come to a conclusion and made a decision --


QUESTION:  He kept saying I didn't direct a


verdict.  He was distinguishing as between granting a

motion.  He says, I granted a motion, but I didn't direct


a verdict.


MR. MORAN:  Excuse me, Justice Ginsburg.  You're


quite correct.  He said, I granted a motion.  I didn't


direct a verdict.  And his distinction was clearly one of


law.  He clearly believed that so long as the jury was not


told, there was a distinction between granting a motion


and directing a verdict.


And that position is untenable after Sanabria


versus United States and also Martin Linen where the --


the United States made the same argument in Martin Linen,


that as long as it's the judge after the hung jury


declaring a -- an acquittal, if it doesn't involve the


jury in some way, it doesn't count.  The same argument was


apparently made in Sanabria and dismissed in a footnote 

that it was so obviously -- so obviously contrary to


Martin Linen.


And so the judge never said as a fact -- as a


fact -- I did not find absence of premeditation.  He


clearly found absence of premeditation, consistently


admitted that that's what he had done, but simply


believed, as a matter of double jeopardy law, wrong as a


matter of double jeopardy law, that he could take back


that decision.


The Michigan Supreme Court's conclusion was

contrary even under the criteria that the Michigan Supreme


Court adopted, wanting to see certain formalities before


they would conclude that a acquittal has been granted. 


That standard was met here.  The Michigan Supreme Court


itself acknowledged that a docket entry is exactly the


sort of formality that they were looking for but then


inexplicably failed to notice that there had been such a


docket entry made in this case.  Not inexplicably the


State failed to include the docket entry in its appendix


in violation of the Michigan court rules.  That's why the


Michigan Supreme Court was apparently unaware of the


dispositive docket entry.


QUESTION:  Wasn't that called to their attention


in rehearing, though?


MR. MORAN: 


There was a motion for 

reconsideration filed, yes, Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  How do you explain their failure to


grant rehearing?


MR. MORAN:  Like this Court's denial of


certiorari there --


QUESTION:  That's not a discretionary matter, I


wouldn't think, in a criminal case.


MR. MORAN:  I -- I believe it is.  An appeal to


the Michigan Supreme Court is a discretionary matter in


the first place.  And the denial of reconsideration is

traditionally treated as a discretionary matter under


Michigan law.


QUESTION:  Even when there was an error of law


called to their attention.


MR. MORAN:  Well, it's an error in the record I


believe.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. MORAN:  I -- I can't explain it.  It was a


5 to 2 vote for denial of reconsideration.  I simply can't


explain how they came to that conclusion.


The bottom line here was, was Mr. Vincent


subjected to post-acquittal fact-finding proceedings in


violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause?  Exactly as in


Smalis, he was.  Smalis -- there would have been


post-acquittal fact-finding proceedings --


QUESTION:  May I ask you another question? 


Assume it would have been an acquittal as a matter of


Michigan law because of the -- the docket entry.  Would it


necessarily follow that it was also an acquittal for


purposes of Federal law?


MR. MORAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  I don't believe


that there has been any case distinguishing an acquittal,


in quotation marks, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy


Clause from any other sort of an acquittal.  An acquittal


is defined in Martin Linen and this Court's --

 QUESTION:  So your syllogism is that if he was


acquitted as a matter of Michigan law, a fortiori the


Double Jeopardy Clause applies as a matter of Federal law.


MR. MORAN:  I believe he was acquitted for all


purposes, Justice Stevens.  I -- I don't believe that one


can profitably draw a distinction between being acquitted


for one purpose or another.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Moran.


Mr. Busch, you have 2 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR A. BUSCH


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BUSCH:  Thank you, Your Honor.


The respondent here has stated that the Michigan


Supreme Court agrees with his position with respect to the


second prong of AEDPA. 


In fact, the Michigan Supreme 

Court stated in its opinion at footnote 4 -- it made


reference to the fact that it was actually not reaching


the conclusion.  It wasn't reaching a decision as to


whether the judge could change his mind.


The respondent's position essentially requires


the people to forfeit the second prong of AEDPA.  Even if


the Court was wrong on its factual finding or


unreasonable, the result of this case must be viewed


within the filter of that statute which says that the law


that they applied was reasonable.

 There are -- he has cited several cases and we


have several cases in the other direction, interestingly


enough, including one, United States versus Baggett, which


comes out of the Sixth Circuit itself, which says -- in


that case there were -- three times the judge announced a


ruling and then agreed to hold it in abeyance.  In -- in


that case the Court said that -- that -- the appeal court


said that they were free to change their mind -- the judge


was free to change their mind any time prior to the entry


of judgment.


So the courts -- there is -- there is no


established precedent with respect to reconsideration, and


we would respectfully say that alternatively this Court


ought to find a rule that trial courts can reconsider


where there has been no appeal and also -- and we would 

argue that the --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Busch.


MR. BUSCH:  Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.
