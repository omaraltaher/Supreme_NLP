 This case is about who gets to decide the 
12  facts that trigger a mandatory minimum sentence.  Any 
13  fact that entitles a prosecution by law to a sentence 
14  more severe than a judge could otherwise impose must be

MS. MAGUIRE:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor.  I do 
not believe that stare decisis poses a problem for the 
Court in this case because Harris was a plurality 
opinion.  And while four of the Justices found that --
I'm sorry, five of the Justices voted to uphold 
McMillan, only four of the Justices found that McMillan 

 Under Harris, the government is entitled --

 And so we have a plurality opinion, and, for 

as great as they claim -- potential damage, I should

8  States have passed laws relying on it, the Federal 
9  system is now structured around it, why isn't the damage 
10

It was alleged in the indictment.  It went 

to the jury, the jury got a special verdict form, so 
there is no difficulty in implementing this rule --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But isn't your position that 

1  924(c) facts to a jury, notwithstanding the -- the fact 
2  that it's not required? 
3
4  there is little to no practical effect, if the Court is 
5
6  courts are already -- and Federal prosecutors are 
7  already -- alleging these facts in the indictment and 
8  proving them to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  And I 
9  think that this case is the exact example of that.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I can think of some 
pretty important decisions of this Court that were not 
the result of a majority opinion.  Do you want us to 
adopt that as a blanket rule? 

 MS. MAGUIRE:  No, Your Honor, but I would 
note that, in constitutional questions like this one,

 MS. MAGUIRE:  Yes, Your Honor.  I do not

1  stare decisis is at its weakness -- weakest.  I would 
2  also --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Constitutional 
3
4  decisions of this Court not decided with the majority 
5
6
 MS. MAGUIRE:  Well, and also, Your Honor, 
7  what I think is significant in this case, in terms of 
8  the issue of stare decisis, is that McMillan was not a 
9  Sixth Amendment case.  McMillan was decided more on due 
process grounds.  And the only discussion of the Sixth 
10
11 
Amendment in McMillan comes in the last paragraph, when 
it talks to the fact that the defendant has no right to 
12 
13 
jury sentencing. 
14
15
16
17  McMillan.  You've distinguished Harris.  How do you 
18  distinguish McMillan?  Your -- your only grounds for 
19  distinguishing that is it was not a 
20
21  the Sixth Amendment? 
22
23  fact, refer to the Sixth Amendment in the very last 
24  paragraph.  But what McMillan was mostly concerned about

that stare decisis poses a problem.

 MS. MAGUIRE:  That's absolutely --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Maguire, you don't --

stare decisis effect.  In a unanimous -- a recent 
unanimous decision of this Court, obviously, would carry 
more weight than one that has a plurality opinion, so 
you don't have to say -- it isn't a question of yes or 
no, it's a question of the degree of respect that we 
would give to our former decision. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care about 
1
2  "mostly."  The issue is whether McMillan was a 
3  Sixth Amendment case, in part or in whole.  And I don't 
4  know how you can say it wasn't.  We -- we don't decide 
cases on -- on what a case mostly says.  We decide on 
5

10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  right, Justice Ginsburg.  And, in fact, the other 
18  factors that the Court considers when looking at stare 
19  decisis is what were the margins of vote on the previous 
20
21  whereas Harris, as we've noted, was a plurality 
22  decision. 
23
24  dissents.  They have been criticized by this Court and 
25

cases, and McMillan was decided on a 5-4 decision, 

 MS. MAGUIRE:  I think that that is exactly 

 Both opinions were found over spirited 

the lower courts, and, in all of those instances, we 

7

 Now, with the suggestion of 


Justice Ginsburg, I gather that your position is, if 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I think it's important 

1  believe that stare decisis is at its weakest --
2
3  for this Court to have a consistent doctrine of stare 
4  decisis.  The doctrine can't be, "We will overrule 
decisions that we don't like, but we will stick with 

5
6  decisions that the majority does like."  So I'm still 

7  looking for your understanding of what stare decisis 

8  means in constitutional cases. 

9
10
11  it's a narrow decision, then it's -- stare decisis has 
12  less weight; is that it?  Now, what other factors?  So 
13  it has less weight.  Why isn't it controlling, though? 
14  Why does it have insufficient weight here? 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
 And, if you look at this Court's Sixth 
22  Amendment jurisprudence, as it has developed since 
23  Apprendi, then in Booker, then in Blakely, then in 
24  Cunningham, what we are asking for today is a logical --
25

another thing that you look -- look to, when you are 
considering stare decisis, is whether or not the rule is 
workable, whether or not the prior decision was badly 
reasoned, and those are other factors that the Court can 
consider. 

MS. MAGUIRE:  Because, Justice Alito, 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why is this not 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But haven't the last number of years 

 MS. MAGUIRE:  Well, the Harris rule is not 

1  workable?  I mean, you can -- you can argue about 
2  whether it was right or wrong.  You can argue about 
3  whether it has created some incongruity in the system. 
4
suggested that it's perfectly workable?  Everybody knows 
5
6  what they are supposed to do; everybody does it.  Why --
7  why is this not workable? 
8
9  workable on a practical level because what happens under 
the Harris rule is the government is entitled to a fact 
10
11 
that drives a more severe punishment that never goes to 
the jury.  If -- if -- and what we are asking here is 
12 
13 
that the court find that, where there is a fact that 
triggers a mandatory minimum, that that fact be found by 
14 
the jury. 
15
16
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now I understand --
17
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That sounds like --
18  that sounds like an argument that it's wrong, and that 
19  is, of course, the first step in -- in the stare decisis 
analysis.  It doesn't sound, to me, responsive to 
20
21  Justice Kagan's question is, in what sense is it 
22  unworkable? 
23
24  unworkable in the drug cases, Your Honor, and in the 
25

9841 statute because what you have there is you have, in 

 MS. MAGUIRE:  Well, I think it becomes 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company

the drug weights in the indictment. 


 And that becomes unworkable and quite 


brief, that the rule is somewhat unworkable. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why wouldn't that be a 

1  some circuits, people alleging drug weight, but, in 

2  other circuits, you have they called this mixing and 

3  matching.  And, as long as the statutory maximum does 

4  not exceed 20 years, the prosecutors are not alleging 

5
6
7  confusing to the courts.  And the lower courts have 

8  criticized the Harris rule, primarily in cases like 

9  Krieger and others that we -- are cited in our amicus 

10
11
12  problem if -- if the question had to be decided by the 
13  jury?  Why does -- why does requiring it to be decided 
14  by the jury eliminate that -- that problem of the -- of 
15
16
17  a jury solves the problem because it -- it allows the 
18  fact to go to the jury, the jury finds it.  And we have 
19  a long history in this country that jury verdicts drive 
punishment.  And so the idea is that the punishment that 
20
21  somebody is open to should be driven by the jury 
22  verdict. 
23
24  weight.  Let's -- so you're making -- your argument 
25

would mean that drug weight also has to be found by the 

 MS. MAGUIRE:  Well, asking it to be found by 

the mixing or not mixing? 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You mentioned drug 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

say that, under our rule, that that would have to be 

And so this is not going to put -- put any 
additional burden on the prosecutors to be doing this. 
And, fundamentally, what it does is that it levels the 
playing field because what it does in trial situations 
is it allows a defendant to know exactly what it is that 
the government is going to prove. 

1  jury because that can -- the length of the sentence can 
2  depend on the -- the drug weight. 
3
4  trigger a mandatory minimum, Your Honor, yes, we would 
5
6  alleged in the indictment and proved to the jury beyond 
7  a reasonable doubt, which, as our amicus briefs point 
8  out, is being done already in the majority of circuits 
9  throughout the country. 
10

12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  witnesses at the time of trial, so that they can be 
18  cross-examined on this fact that is going to trigger the 
19  mandatory minimum in their case.  And so it helps level 
20
21
22  case involving drug weight and your client maintained 
23  that he or she had nothing to do with these drugs, how 
24  would you proceed?  Your argument would be:  They're not 
25

the playing field in that regard. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, if you were defending a

19  the defense in a very difficult position?

very difficult position because, in fact, if you adopt 
our rule, we believe that you are protecting the 
defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury because this 
is a fact that is going to be triggering a mandatory 
minimum. 

 MS. MAGUIRE:  Well, any strategic decision a 
lawyer makes is going to depend on the individual facts 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you -- but -- but

4  more --
5
6  difficult for you to say he had nothing to do with the 
7  drugs, plus the drugs didn't weigh more than a certain 
8  amount? 
 MS. MAGUIRE:  I don't believe that that is 
9
difficult, and I believe that those are decisions that 
10
11  you make in every case.  For example, in the case -- in 
12  this case -- in Mr. Alleyne's case, our theory --
13
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think that I am hearing 
14  that, in every case, you are going to want witnesses --
you are going to insist on a jury determination of the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's good because that's 

an extra problem.

2
3  far with this.  But one answer you could say is that, in 
4  order to preserve the constitutional right, you want us 
to have a bifurcated trial.  I thought you were -- might 
5
6  say that. 
7
 MS. MAGUIRE:  No, we are not -- we are not 
8  asking for a bifurcated trial.  We are just asking that 
9  if there's one --
10
11 
12
13
14  you to a different kind of question? 
MS. MAGUIRE:  Certainly. 
15
16
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let's assume that there were 
17  a statute, and it said carrying a gun is an offense and 
18  that the range is 5 to 10 years.  I realize it goes up 
19  further in the real word, but let's just say 5 to 10 
20
21  that range, the judge shall consider whether the 
22  defendant brandished the gun and whether the defendant 
23  discharged the gun.  Now -- and that's all the statute 
24  said. 
25

 (Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Maguire, could I take 

years.  And Congress said, in setting the penalty within 

That would be constitutional; is that not 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So it's 

1  right? 
2
 MS. MAGUIRE:  Yes, Justice Kagan, that would 
3  be constitutional because it doesn't have the mandatory 
4  effect. 
5
6  constitutional for the judge to say, seven years because 
7  you brandished, nine years because you discharged. 
 So what makes it unconstitutional, what 
8
9  makes it a violation of the Sixth Amendment, when, now, 
Congress just provides something extra in the statute? 
10
11 
It says not just you shall consider brandishing and 
discharging, but, if you find brandishing, you get 7; if 
12 
13 
you find discharging, you get 9. 
14
15
16  of all authority, and, by operation of law, you are 
17  telling that judge that you must impose this sentence. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that seems right as a 
18
19  definitional matter, as a descriptive matter.  But I 
guess the question I'm having difficulty with is why 
20
21  does that matter for purposes of the Sixth Amendment? 
22  The jury is doing the exact same thing, which is the 
23  jury isn't doing anything in either of my examples. 
24
 So the only difference between example 
number one, which you said was constitutional, and 
25

unconstitutional is because you are stripping the judge 

 MS. MAGUIRE:  Okay.  What makes that 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MS. MAGUIRE:  Well, yes, it is because, in 

 And the jury verdict in this case authorized 

1  example number two is that, now, Congress is giving 
2  further instruction to the judge, but nothing more is 
3  being taken away from the jury; is it? 
4
your second hypothetical, where it is the mandatory 
5
6  minimum, which is exactly what we have in this case, 
7  this notion that somehow Congress is channelling 
8  discretion is a fiction because what it does is it tells 
9  the judge, you must impose seven years, and you cannot 
even consider what is authorized by the jury verdict in 
10
11  this case. 
12
13  a range of five years as the bottom.  And so what 
14  happens is, when you have Congress coming in and saying 
that, if you find this fact on a mere preponderance 
15
16  standard, you must impose seven years, then you are 
17  stripping the defendant of the benefit of the full jury 
18  verdict in this case, which authorized a range that had 
19  a lower floor than that called for by the Federal 
20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It started,

8
9  "Mr. Chief Justice." 

(Laughter.) 
10
11
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think what you said was 
12  who has to decide a fact which causes a defendant to be 
13  subject to a penalty that he would not otherwise be 
14  subject to?  And the fact is that, in the case of a 
15
16  that mandatory minimum.  It was up to the judge. 
17
18  the penalty to which the defendant is subject.  He's 
19  subject, in Justice Kagan's example, to any penalty 
20
21  without the statute that she mentioned, could have given 
22  him seven years because he -- he brandished a gun. 
23  There -- there is really no -- no increase in the 
24  penalty to which he is exposed. 
25

mandatory minimum, the defendant could have been given 

 So this mandatory minimum does not increase 

between one years -- one year and 10.  The judge, even 

And I thought that is what Apprendi 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

mandatory minimum, you get between one and 10 years. 

 So what's the complaint, as far as Apprendi 

adopt, Justice Scalia, is a natural -- it follows the 
logic of Apprendi, is because, in both cases, you have 
judicial factfinding that's leading to a more harsh 
sentence.  In your --

1  addressed, any increase in the penalty to which you are 
2  exposed, so that when you decide, I'm going to rob a 
3  bank -- you know -- you know, when you go in, you are 
4  going to get between one and 10 years, and, with a 
5
6
7  is concerned? 
 MS. MAGUIRE:  The complaint is that -- and 
8
9  why we believe that the rule we are asking the Court to 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  Apprendi.  Does it lead to a sentence which is greater 
17  than the judge would otherwise be authorized to impose? 
18  And, in the case of a mandatory minimum, it never is. 
19  The judge could impose that, if he was a hanging judge. 
20
21  bleeding heart judges. 
 And -- and what a mandatory minimum simply

2
3  Justice Scalia, that's -- that's a false presumption.  I 
4  think that's the position of the government, that, 
5
6  range.  That is a fiction because a judge is being 
7  told, you must impose this, you have no choice, you 
8  cannot go below this.  That is the whole nature of a 
9  mandatory minimum.  And so this --

15
16  cited in the Lucas briefs and Dorsey briefs that this

 MS. MAGUIRE:  That is exactly right.

that a judge might have given you less?

14  it takes away the discretion of the judge.  That seems, 
to me, to be a matter between Congress and the Judiciary 
15
16  and not a Sixth Amendment question. 
17
18  actually, the language of this Court in Apprendi said 
19  that it is unconstitutional for the legislature to 
remove from the jury the assessment of facts that

 So I'm not sure that we can get from the 

1  both ways.  I mean, that's the best sentence for you in 
2  Apprendi, but there are other sentences in Apprendi 
3  which more go towards what Justice Scalia suggested, 
4  that the question was increasing it above the maximum 
5
6
7  language of Apprendi -- and I guess the question is, as 
8  a matter of principle, why I -- I completely understand 
9  why a defendant would care about this.  The question is 
does it -- does it create a Sixth Amendment violation, 
10
11 
which is -- you know, the jury has to do this, when --
when Congress is decreasing the judge's discretion, but 
12 
13 
it's -- either way, the jury isn't deciding this.

4  that Mr. Alleyne should have been exposed was a 
5
6  argument assuming a maximum of life.  Here, what 
7  happened and at the sentencing hearing was on a mere 
8  preponderance, the judge had to impose seven.  And so we 
9  believe that is where you have the Sixth Amendment 
10
11
12  Apprendi correctly as saying that the jury has to decide 
13  any fact which increases the sentence to which the 
14  defendant is exposed.  That's the language you quoted, 
15
16
 Why does a mandatory minimum increase the 
17  sentence to which the defendant is exposed?  He could 
18  get the mandatory minimum sentence, even if there were 
19  no mandatory minimum prescribed.  He is exposed to a

22

24  change that at all.  He is at risk for one to 10 years. 
MS. MAGUIRE:  Well, I understand that that

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's true. 

MS. MAGUIRE:  And that becomes the problem. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's true.  But you must 

step, is that, if you have judicial factfinding that is 
resulting in a more harsh sentence being imposed, then, 
in fact, you have a Sixth Amendment problem. 

1  may not change the exposure.  What it does, on a 

2  practical level, is it prevents the judge from even 

3  considering anything less than the seven years.

8
9  Apprendi if you -- if you take it out to its logical 
10
11 
12 
13
 And so what happens on the mandatory 
14  minimums is that, if a judge finds the mandatory

16  as an example, in this case, the judge could not even 
17  consider giving the five-year year floor as a mandatory 
18  minimum, which we've already noted is, in fact, how most 
19  criminal defendants are sentenced under the 924(c) 
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think the logic of

in the first situation because, if there is no cap from

12  Mr. Dreeben, and -- and I think it's -- it's a great 
13  question.  Is the jury functioning as a low-level 
14  gatekeeper under the Harris rule?  Because I could make 
the argument that, in fact, it is -- you know, you take 
15
16  a statute, and it says, five and up for carrying, and 
17  seven and up for brandishing, right?  And this isn't 
18  even a hypothetical.  This is pretty close to this case. 
19
20
21  brandishing, all right?  And then it goes to the judge. 
22  And, now, the judge says, you know what, if I had my 
23  druthers, I would only give five years.  If I had my 
24  druthers, I absolutely would defer to the jury verdict, 
but I can't defer to the jury verdict because Congress

and he's not deferring to the jury when he would prefer

it would be dishonest of me to do that, wouldn't it?  I

 I think this is a case where the effect

it's possibly the best illustration of the unfairness

Justice Breyer has written about in his opinions.  The 
issue at trial in this case was identity.

 As Apprendi and its subsequent progeny laid

supplanting the jury by just saying what it said in 
924(c)?  Every single crime has a maximum of life. 

1  legislature not attempting to supplant the jury's role

3  started out in a country where almost all sentencing was

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think, Justice Sotomayor, 
3  that the Court recognized, in Apprendi, that its rule 
4  was limited and to certain extent could be evaded by 
5
6
7  history is wrong.  In fact, the way the country started, 
8  there was no judicial discretion.  There were simply 
9  fixed penalties for crimes.  If you stole a horse, you 
10
11 
12
13
14  risk involved is whether, if we come out the way that 
the Petitioner here urges us to do, legislatures will 
15
16  consider going back to -- to where we started from and 
17  simply saying, if you brandish, you get seven years, 
18  period, with no discretion in the judge.

 That, it seems to me, is the greater risk. 
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Scalia, I agree 
in part with both you and Justice Sotomayor on history. 
In fact, if you look at the 1790 Crimes Act that the 
First Congress passed, many of the set sentences are 
determinant sentences. 

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well --

1  prescribed up to a certain amount of years.  And, within 
2  that, it was well understood that judges would find 
3  facts to graduate the penalties according to the gravity 
4  of the crime. 
And what the legislatures have done in the 
5
6  20th Century innovation of mandatory minimums within an 
7  otherwise authorized range, as you have with 924(c), is 
8  say, we would prefer that judges take into account 
9  brandishing and discharging, as under Justice Kagan's

18
19  the five years anyway, couldn't he have?  I mean, you --

I'm going to say, well, so what, why does that matter?

 MR. DREEBEN:  It's descriptively accurate, 
22  but it says nothing about the constitutionality of the 
23  procedure.  And I think that it's very important to 
24  focus not only on the fact that stare decisis is in

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You're just going to say,

 In this case, by comparison, there is no 

historical showing that would justify extending Apprendi

elements of the statutory crime in the indictment.  That

8  wanted to raise only the minimum, and that's it.

19  we're discharging, 60.  All right.  So a very large gap.

12  about this -- it's a constitutional matter, it's the 
13  same, but the hypothetical sort of suggests exactly what

5
6  924(c) violation is charged by itself, and a defendant 
7  is an armed career criminal, then his sentencing range

14  as a mandatory minimum that will leapfrog you from five

16
 MR. DREEBEN:  It's not incongruous if you 
17  look at it from the point of view of the fact that the 
18  jury verdict itself allows a life sentence.  And if the 
19  defendant draws the proverbial hanging judge who, in his 
discretion -- or her discretion, wants to give that life 
20
