 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear 

reargument this morning in Case 08-205, Citizens United 
v. The Federal Election Commission.

 Mr. Olson.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

 MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 Robust debate about candidates for elective 

office is the most fundamental value protected by the 
First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.  Yet that is 
precisely the dialogue that the government has 
prohibited if practiced by unions or corporations, any 
union or any corporation.

 The government claims it may do so based 

upon the Austin decision that corporate speech is by its 
nature corrosive and distorting because it might not 
reflected actual public support for the views expressed 
by the corporation.  The government admits that that 
radical concept of requiring public support for the 
speech before you can speak would even authorize it to 
criminalize books and signs.

 This Court needs no reminding that the

government when it is acting to prohibit, particularly 
when it is acting to criminalize, speech that is at the 
very core of the First Amendment has a heavy burden to 
prove that there is a compelling governmental interest 
that -- that justifies that prohibition and that the 
regulation adopted, in this case a criminal statute, is 
the most narrowly tailored necessary to accomplish that 
compelling governmental interest.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Olson, are you taking 

the position that there is no difference in the First 
Amendment rights of an individual?  A corporation, after 
all, is not endowed by its creator with inalienable 
rights.  So is there any distinction that Congress could 
draw between corporations and natural human beings for 
purposes of campaign finance?

 MR. OLSON:  What the Court has said in the 

First Amendment context, New York Times v. Sullivan, 
Rose Jean v. Associated Press, and over and over again, 
is that corporations are persons entitled to protection 
under the First Amendment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would that include --
MR. OLSON:  Now, Justice --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would that include 

today's mega-corporations, where many of the investors 
may be foreign individuals or entities?

MR. OLSON:  The Court in the past has made 
no distinction based upon the nature of the entity that 
might own a share of a corporation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Own many shares?
 MR. OLSON:  Pardon?
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Nowadays there are 

foreign interests, even foreign governments, that own 
not one share but a goodly number of shares.

 MR. OLSON:  I submit that the Court's 

decisions in connection with the First Amendment and 
corporations have in the past made no such distinction. 
However --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could they in your view, 
in the view that you are putting forth, that there is no 
distinction between an individual and a corporation for 
First Amendment purposes, then any mega-corporation, 
even -- even if most of the investors are from abroad, 
Congress could not limit their spending?

 MR. OLSON:  I'm not -- I'm not saying that, 
Justice Ginsburg.  I'm saying that the First Amendment 
applies.  Then the next step is to determine whether 
Congress and the government has established a compelling 
governmental interest and a narrowly tailored remedy to 
that interest.  If the Congress -- and there is no 
record of that in this case of which I am aware.

Certainly the government has not advanced it in its 
briefs:  That there is some compelling governmental 
interest because of foreign investment in corporations.
 If there was, then the Court would look at, 
determine how serious is that interest, how destructive 
has it been to the process and whether the -- maybe the 
limitation would have something to do with the ownership 
of shares of a corporation or some --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think Congress could 

prevent foreign individuals from funding speech in 
United States elections?

 MR. OLSON:  The -- the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Private individuals, 

foreigners who -- who want to --

MR. OLSON:  That's, of course, a different 

question.  I haven't studied it, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's not different. 

I asked it because I thought it was related to the 
question you were answering.

 MR. OLSON:  The fundamental point here is --
and let me start with this, and I think we should -- we 
should start with this, and the government hardly 
mentions this.

MR. OLSON:  The language of the First 

Amendment, "Congress shall make" --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Olson -- Mr. Olson, 

would you answer Justice Ginsburg's question yes or no? 
Can the -- leaving aside foreign investors, can the --
can -- does the First Amendment permit any distinction 
between corporate speakers and individual speakers?

 MR. OLSON:  I am not -- I'm not aware of a 

case that just --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I am not asking you that. 

I meant in your view does it permit that distinction?

 MR. OLSON:  My view is based upon the 

decisions of this Court and my view would be that unless 
there is a compelling governmental interest and a 
narrowly --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But if there is a 

compelling government -- can there be any case in which 
there is a different treatment of corporations and 
individuals in your judgment?

 MR. OLSON:  I would not rule that out, 

Justice Stevens.  I mean, there may be.  I can't imagine 
all of the infinite varieties of potential problems that 
might exist, but -- but we would eventually come back to 
the narrow tailoring problem anyway.

prohibit speech.  I don't know how many unions there are 
in this country, but there are something like 6 million 
corporations that filed tax returns in 2006.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Olson, do you 

think that media corporations that are owned or 
principally owned by foreign shareholders have less 
First Amendment rights than other media corporations in 
the United States?

 MR. OLSON:  I don't think so, Justice Alito, 

and certainly there is no record to suggest that there 
is any kind of problem based upon that.  And I come back 
to the language of the First Amendment:  "Congress shall 
make no law."  Now, what this Court has repeatedly said 
is that there may be laws inhibiting speech if there is 
a compelling governmental interest and a narrowly 
tailored remedy.  But there is no justification for 
this.

 I was going to say that 97 percent of the 6 
million corporations that filed tax returns in 2006 had 
assets less than $5 million -- assets, not net worth. 
So we are talking about a prohibition that covers every 
corporation in the United States, including nonprofit 
corporations, limited liability corporations, Subchapter 
S corporations and every union in the United States.

have used the word "prohibition," Mr. Olson.  One answer 
to that is that no entity is being prohibited, that it 
is a question of not whether corporations can contribute 
but how.  They can use PACs and that way we assure that 
the people who contribute are really supportive of the 
issue, of the candidate.

 But so the -- the corporation can give, but 

it has to use a PAC.

 MR. OLSON:  I respectfully disagree.  The 

corporation may not expend money.  It might find people, 
stockholders or officers, who wanted to contribute to a 
separate fund, who could then speak.  That in one -- to 
use the words of one Justice, that is 
ventriloquist-speak.  I would say that it is more like 
surrogate speech.  If you can find some other people 
that will say what you want to say and get them to 
contribute money through a process that this just --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who is the "you"?  I mean 

do you -- you -- those are the directors, the CEO, not 
the shareholders?  We don't know what they think.
 MR. OLSON:  Well, this statute is not 

limited to cases where the shareholders agree or don't 
agree with what the corporation says.  As the Court said 
in the Bellotti case, the prohibition would exist 
whether or not the shareholders agree.  But let me go

back to your question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It -- it covers totally --

totally owned corporations, too, doesn't it?

 MR. OLSON:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, if I owned all the 

stock in a corporation, the corporation still can't --

MR. OLSON:  Yes.  And it includes membership 

corporations such as Citizens United that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And the individual 

contribution also covers people who would like to give 
$2500 instead of $2400, which is the limit.  And maybe 
there are 100 million or 200 million people in the 
United States who, if they gave 2500 rather than 2400, 
nobody could say that that was really an effort to buy 
the Senator or the Congressman.  So is that 
unconstitutional, too?

 MR. OLSON:  No -- well, what this Court has 
said is that in connection with contribution limitations 
there is a potential compelling governmental interest.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
 MR. OLSON:  This is what Buckley says.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
 MR. OLSON:  Then that -- in that -- but 

expenditures, which is what we are talking about today, 
do not concern the -- the question, the actual threat of

quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of quid pro 
quo corruption.  And you know, Justice Breyer, what the 
Court said in that case is because it's not inhibiting 
someone from actually speaking, it's -- it's giving 
money to someone --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So here the obvious 

argument is:  Look, they said the compelling interest is 
that people think that representatives are being bought, 
okay?  That's to put it in a caricature, but you 
understand what I'm driving at, okay?  That's what they 
said in Buckley v. Valeo.  So Congress now says 
precisely that interest leads us to want to limit the 
expenditures that corporations can make on 
electioneering communication in the last 30 days of a 
primary, over-the-air television, but not on radio, not 
on books, not on pamphlets, not on anything else.  All 
right?

 So in what respect is there not conceptually 

at least a compelling interest and narrow tailoring?
 MR. OLSON:  Well, in the first place, I 

accept what the Court said in Buckley, that expenditures 
do not raise that concern at all.  Congress has not made 
that finding.  You are talking -- and you mentioned just 
-- just a matter of radio and television, but in Buckley 
v. Valeo the Court specifically said that that is the

most important means of communicating concerning 
elections --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's important --
MR. OLSON:  And the Court used the word 

"indispensable."  So what -- and -- and what the Court 
said in Buckley v. Valeo is it compared a limitation on 
expenditures, independent uncoordinated expenditures, 
with the prohibition that the Court addressed when it 
had a statute before it that said newspapers couldn't 
endorse candidates on the day of election, and the 
Torneo case, where it required a right of reply to be 
given.  And the Court said those restrictions, which 
were unconstitutional, were considerably less, and that 
the restriction in Buckley v. Valeo on expenditures --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I agree -- I agree 

that Buckley made the distinction between contributions 
and expenditures, and it seems to me that the 
government's argument necessarily wants to water down 
that distinction.  But in response or just in 
furtherance of Justice Breyer's point, you have two 
cases, one in which an officeholder goes to a 
corporation and says:  Will you please give me money? 
They say:  We can't do that.

 The other is in which a corporation takes 
out an ad for the -- for the candidate, which relieves

that candidate of the responsibility of -- of 
substantial television coverage.  Isn't that about the 
same?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, in the first place, if 

there is any coordination --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I -- and I think 

Buckley says no.

 MR. OLSON:  Buckley says --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, as a practical 

matter, is that always true?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, it may not always be true. 
In the infinite potential applications of something like 
that, Justice Kennedy, anything might possibly be true. 
And Justice Breyer said, well, what if Congress thought 
or what if Congress thought the people might think that 
that was kind of somehow suspect?  That is not a basis 
for prohibiting speech by a whole class of individual --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, of course, it did --
was a basis for prohibiting speech by, in the sense of 
giving contributions above $2,400, by 300 million people 
in the United States.  But the point, which I think is 
the one that Justice Kennedy was picking up, is are we 
arguing here between you and my questions, is the 
argument in this case about the existence of a 
compelling interest?  Because Congress seemed to think

that there was certainly that; it's this concern about 
the perception that people are, say, buying candidates.

 Are we arguing about narrow tailoring? 

Congress thought it was narrow tailoring.  Or are we 
arguing about whether we should second-guess Congress on 
whether there is enough of a compelling interest and the 
tailoring is narrow enough?

 MR. OLSON:  You must always second-guess 

Congress when the First Amendment is in play.  And that 
we are arguing -- we are not -- we are discussing --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
 MR. OLSON:  -- both the compelling --
(Laughter.)
 MR. OLSON:  -- both the compelling 

governmental interest and the narrow tailoring, and 
what -- what -- there is not a sufficient record.  The 
reason --the government has shifted position here.  They 
were, first of all, talking about the so-called 
distortion rationale in Austin, the distortion rationale 
which they seem to have abandoned in the -- in the 
supplemental briefs filed in connection with this 
argument, and they resorted to the corruption, 
appearance of corruption.  There isn't a sufficient 
record of this.  There isn't --

district court's finding?  Wasn't there a finding before 
the three-judge court that Federal officials know of and 
feel indebted to corporations or unions who finance ads 
urging their election or the defeat of their opponent? 
There was a finding of fact to that effect, was there 
not?

 MR. OLSON:  The find -- yes.  I -- there is 
something to that effect in the district court opinion, 
but it doesn't cover all corporations.  It didn't focus 
in specifically on expenditures.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if -- so if they just 
covered large corporations, so you take out the mom and 
pop single shareholder --

MR. OLSON:  Well, that is 97 percent of the 

corporation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Not 97 percent of the 

contributions.  I mean, the contributions that count are 
the ones from the corporations that can amass these huge 
sums in their treasuries.

 MR. OLSON:  I think that goes back to 
Justice Kennedy's question, and my response, which 
distinguishes between contributions and expenditures. 
The point that Justice Kennedy was making in his 
question is that under -- under some circumstances an 
expenditure might coincide or resonate with what the

candidate wishes to do, but the Court looked at that 
very carefully in Buckley v. Valeo and said that might 
not be the case.  It might, in fact, be these 
expenditures might be counterproductive when they are 
independent, they are not coordinated with the 
candidate, they are more directly expression by the 
party spending the money, they are not like a 
contribution, so they are more of an infringement on the 
right to speak.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel --
MR. OLSON:  And they are less of a threat of 
corruption because there is less -- there is no quid pro 
quo there, and if there is it would be punishable as a 
crime.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, in your 

discussion of Austin, you rely on its inconsistency with 
Bellotti.  Bellotti, of course, involved a referendum 
and Austin expenditures in an individual election.  Why 
isn't that a significant distinction?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, it is -- it is -- what the 

Bellotti Court said is that we are not deciding that 
question.

 And -- and Austin did address, you are 

correct, expenditures, but it based it on a rationale --

not deciding.  It said they are entirely different 
situations.  You read that long footnote which has been 
cited six or eight times by our later cases.

 MR. OLSON:  Yes.  And I also read the 

footnote 14 in the Bellotti case that cited case after 
case after case that said corporations had rights, 
protected rights under the First Amendment.  I am not 
disagreeing with what you just said, Justice Stevens. 
The Court said it was -- it was dicta, because the Court 
did not deal with --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it has been 

repeated -- that footnote has been repeatedly cited in 
subsequent cases, most of which were unanimous.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, because it was -- and I 
agree the Bellotti Court was not discussing that.  But 
The Bellotti Court --

precisely in that footnote and it said it's a different 
case.

 MR. OLSON:  I understand and I don't 

disagree with what you have just said, Justice Stevens.

out differently.  It just said, we're not deciding that

point I'm trying to make.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't mind citing that. 

Bellotti didn't decide that.

 MR. OLSON:  What Bellotti also said is --

and I think this is also in many decisions of this Court 
-- the inherent worth of speech in terms of its capacity 
for informing the public does not depend upon the 
identity of the source, whether corporation, 
association, union, or individual.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now that we've 

cleared up that Bellotti didn't decide the question, 
what is the distinction that -- why don't you think that 
distinction makes sense?  In other words, a corporate --
you don't have a potential for corruption if a 
corporation is simply speaking on a referendum that may 
directly affect its interest.  If you are dealing with a 
candidate, what the Court has said in the past is that 
you do have that problem of corruption.

 MR. OLSON:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, why 
isn't that distinction a way to reconcile Bellotti and 
Austin?

 MR. OLSON:  There is a distinction, but I 

think the distinction goes back to, A, expenditures 
versus contributions, number one; and then secondly, it

goes back to what this Court said in conjunction with 
the impossibility of finding a distinction between issue 
ads and candidate ads.  The line dissolves on practical 
application.  The interest --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where did we say 

that?

 MR. OLSON:  You said that repeatedly, 

including most recently in the Wisconsin Right to Life 
case.  And it first appeared in Buckley itself.  The 
distinction is very hard to draw between the interest 
that the speaker is addressing and whether it's a 
candidate or an issue, because issues are wrapped up in 
candidates.  The corporation interest and the interests 
that its fiduciary officers are representing when it 
speaks on behalf of the corporation --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I don't think you are 

correct to say the Court said there was no distinction. 
It said the distinction requires the use of magic words. 
And that's what they said in Wisconsin Right to Life, 
too.  Both of them said there is a distinction.
 MR. OLSON:  Well, but the words --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  It's difficult to draw in 
some cases, but nobody said there is no distinction that 
I am aware of.

use -- to use the words of the Court, which occurred 
repeatedly, is that the distinction dissolves 
impractical application.  That, Justice Stevens, I think 
addresses the very commonsense point that when you are 
addressing an issue, whether you are addressing a 
referendum matter, whether it is a proposed legislation 
or a candidate that is going to raise taxes on the 
corporation, those distinctions dissolve.  It's all 
First Amendment freedom.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I -- I thought that 

Buckley had narrowed the statute precisely to magic 
words and still found it unconstitutional as applied to 
corporations that made independent expenditures.

 MR. OLSON:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that what happened in 

Buckley?

 MR. OLSON:  The $1,000 limit in Buckley was, 

first of all, limited to the magic words "candidacy 
expression"; then secondly, the Court -- and the -- and 
the words of the statute were "any person," which 
included corporations found, the statute as narrowed 
unconstitutional and said --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And some of the plaintiffs 

were corporations.

corporations.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but that point wasn't 

even discussed in the opinion, was it?

 MR. OLSON:  It was not discussed in the 

opinion.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  No.
 MR. OLSON:  But what was discussed in the 
opinion was the breadth of the definition of "person," 
which did include corporation.  Corporations were 
parties in the case.  And in that part of the Buckley 
case, the Court repeatedly cites cases involving 
corporations, including NAACP v. Alabama and New York 
Times v. Sullivan, all cases involving corporations.

 So while it wasn't specifically discussed, 

it was a part of the decision of the Court that a $1,000 
limitation was worse, more restrictive than the -- than 
the restriction of editorials appearing on election day 
or requiring a newspaper to give a right of reply.

 The Court in Buckley in fact says, this 

is -- with respect to that expenditure limitation, the 
words of the Court were this is the most drastic of the 
limitations imposed by the Federal Election Campaign 
Act.  It goes to the core of First Amendment freedom.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If that is so -- this is a 

point that is concerning me.  I don't know the answer

precisely.  But suppose you are right.  Suppose we 
overrule these two cases.  Would that leave the country 
in a situation where corporations and trade unions can 
spend as much as they want in the last 30 days on 
television ads, et cetera, of this kind, but political 
parties couldn't, because political parties can only 
spend hard money on this kind of expenditure?  And 
therefore, the group that is charged with the 
responsibility of building a platform that will appeal 
to a majority of Americans is limited, but the groups 
that have particular interests, like corporations or 
trade unions, can spend as much as they want?

 Am I right about the consequence?  If I am 

right, what do we do about it?

 MR. OLSON:  I think you are wrong about the 

consequence.  There are 27 States that have no 
limitations on either contributions or expenditures and 
that -- the Earth is not --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I'm not -- I'm not -- I 

am saying am I right in thinking that if you win, the 
political party can't spend this money, it's limited to 
hard money contributions, but corporations and trade 
unions can spend unlimited funds?

in favor of the arguments that we are making here, I

think what you are suggesting is that because there are 
other limitations that someone has not challenged in 
this case, that that would be somehow unfair and 
unbalanced.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I'm not suggesting 
that.  I am suggesting we will make a hash of this 
statute, and if we are going to make a hash of this 
statute, what do we do about it?  And that's why I want 
you to take a position on another important part of that 
statute, and that is the part that says political 
parties themselves cannot make these expenditures that 
we are talking about except out of hard money.

 MR. OLSON:  What -- I want to address that 

in this way, and I said when we were here before the 
most fundamental right that we can exercise in a 
democracy under the First Amendment is dialogue and 
communication about political candidates.  We have 
wrapped up that freedom, smothered that freedom, with 
the most complicated set of regulations and bureaucratic 
controls.  Last year the Federal Election Commission 
that was supposed to be able to give advisory opinions 
didn't even have a quorum for 6 months of the year 2008 
when people would have needed some help from the Federal 
Election Commission.

question, Justice Breyer, there are, I suspect, all 
kinds of problems with Federal election laws where they 
apply to parties and where they apply to what candidates 
might do and so forth; but that has never been a 
justification.  We will uphold a prohibition on all 
kinds of people speaking because if we allowed them to 
speak someone else might complain that they don't get to 
speak as much as they would like.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, with reference to 

any incongruities that might flow from our adopting your 
position, are you aware of any case in this Court which 
says that we must refrain from addressing an 
unconstitutional aspect of the statute because the 
statute is flawed in some other respects as well?

 MR. OLSON:  No, I'm not, and that's -- I 

think that was what I was attempting to say in response 
to what Justice Breyer was asking me.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Olson, are you 

giving up on your earlier arguments that there are ways 
to avoid the constitutional question to resolve this 
case?  I know that we asked for further briefing on this 
particular issue of overturning two of our Court's 
precedents.  But are you giving up on your earlier 
arguments that there are statutory interpretations that 
would avoid the constitutional question?

MR. OLSON:  No, Justice Sotomayor.  What --

what -- there are all kinds of lines that the Court 
could draw which would provide a victory to my client. 
There are so many reasons why the Federal Government did 
not have the right to criminalize this 90-minute 
documentary that had to do with elections, but what the 
Court addressed specifically in the Washington Right to 
Life case is that the lines if they are to be drawn must 
not be lines that are ambiguous, that invite litigation, 
that hold the threat of prosecution over an individual; 
and in practical application that is what the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Olson, my difficulty 

is that you make very impassioned arguments about why 
this is a bad system that the courts have developed in 
its jurisprudence, but we don't have any record 
developed below.  You make a lot of arguments about how 
far and the nature of corporations, single corporations, 
single stockholder corporations, et cetera.  But there 
is no record that I am reviewing that actually goes into 
the very question that you're arguing exists, which is a 
patchwork of regulatory and jurisprudential guidelines 
that are so unclear.

 MR. OLSON:  I would like to answer that. 
There are several answers to it and I would like to 
reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.  It is the

government has the burden to prove the record that 
justifies telling someone that wants to make a 90-minute 
documentary about a candidate for president that they 
will go to jail if they broadcast it.  The government 
has the obligation and the government had a long 
legislative record and plenty of opportunity to produce 
that record and it's their obligation to do so.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Olson --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the facial 

challenge --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- may I ask one question 
you can answer on rebuttal?  No one has commented on the 
National Rifle Association's amicus brief.  None of the

Justice Sotomayor's thought that there are narrow ways 
of resolving the problem before us.  On rebuttal, will 
you tell us what your view on their solution to this 
problem is?

that would be drawn in several of the amicus briefs, and 
they are not the same, could put the entity who wishes 
to speak before you again a year from now.  Because the 
movie might be shorter, it might be video on demand, it 
might be a broadcast, it might have a different tone 
with respect to a candidate.  Every one of those lines 
puts the speaker at peril that he will go to jail or be 
prosecuted or there will be litigation, all of which 
chills speech and inhibits individual --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but to answer my 
question, the line suggested by the NRA is the line 
identified by Congress in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment 
dealing with individual financing of speech which would 
separate all of these problems.  What is your comment on 
that possible solution to the problem?

 MR. OLSON:  I would like to take advantage 

of Justice Stevens' offer and respond to that during the 
rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS

 ON BEHALF OF SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

27 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

IN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLANT

 MR. ABRAMS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The first case cited to you by Mr. Olson 

happened to be New York Times v. Sullivan, and I would 
like to begin by urging two propositions on you from 
that case.

 In that case the Court was confronted with a 

situation where the Times made three arguments to the 
Court.  They said -- for us to win, they said, you 
either have to revise, basically federalize, libel law 
to a considerable degree, which they did; or, they said, 
we only sold 390 copies in Alabama, so you could rule in 
our favor by saying there was no jurisdiction; or, they 
said, we didn't even mention Sheriff Sullivan's name, so 
you could rule in our favor on the ground that they 
haven't proved a libel case.

 The Court did the first.  It did the first, 

which is the broader rather than the narrowest way to 
address the question, and I suspect they did it -- don't 
know, but I suspect they did it -- because they had come 
to the conclusion that the degree of First Amendment 
danger by the sort of lawsuits which were occurring in 
Alabama and elsewhere was something that had to be faced 
up to by the Court now, or --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Abrams, Times v. 

Sullivan was not -- did not involve overruling 
precedents of this Court that had been followed by this 
Court and others.  So, I think the situation is quite 
different.

 MR. ABRAMS:  That's true, Your Honor.  It 

did involve overruling 150 years of American 
jurisprudence.  I mean, there was no law at that point 
that said that actual malice --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was no -- there was 

no decision of this Court, I mean --

MR. ABRAMS:  That's true, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We do tend to adhere to 

our precedents --

MR. ABRAMS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- especially a case like 

Austin which was repeating the business about amassing 
large funds in corporate treasuries.  It was not a new 
idea in Austin, and it was repeated after -- after 
Austin.  But there was -- so Times v. Sullivan I think 
is quite distinct.

 The question that was posed here is, is it a 

proper way to resolve this case, to overrule one 
precedent in full and another in part?

 MR. ABRAMS:  And what I'm urging on you,

Your Honor, is that by a parity of reasoning, although 
not precisely the same situation, that there are cases 
in which there is a -- an ongoing threat to freedom of 
expression which may lead -- if you were to agree to 
that, which may lead the Court to say, rather than 
taking a narrower route to the same result, that it is 
worth our moving away in this case from looking for the 
narrowest way out, and determining it now, rather than 
the next as-applied challenge.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are -- there are two 

separate questions that -- that have been raised in 
opposition to your position.  One is -- one is that we 
should not resolve a broad constitutional issue where 
there are narrower grounds, and that's the question you 
are responding to.

 An entirely separate question is the issue 

of stare decisis, and you acknowledge that stare decisis 
was not involved in New York Times v. Sullivan, but the 
first question obviously was.

 MR. ABRAMS:  And stare decisis of course is 
a question much -- much briefed by the parties, and it 
is one which involves of course a consideration not only 
of the merits of the decision, but certain other 
factors, the length of time the decision has been in 
effect and the like.  The time in this case for the

McConnell case, of course, is only 6 years.  The time 
for the Austin case is 19 years, which is less than one 
ruling of this Court's just last term.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what the Court said 

in Austin it also said in the NRWC case, which was I 
think 8 years before Austin.  So Austin was not a new 
invention.

 MR. ABRAMS:  Well, Austin was the first time 

that corporate speech was barred -- corporate 
independent expenditures were barred by a ruling of this 
Court.  That had not happened prior to Austin, and the 
Solicitor General's brief acknowledges that.  Now --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there have been 
limits on corporate spending in aid of a political 
campaign since the turn of the 20th century.

 MR. ABRAMS:  There had been limits on 

corporate contributions since the turn of the century. 
Corporate independent expenditures came much later and I 
think that is something that I think is worth --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Much later than 1947.
 MR. ABRAMS:  Yes, Your Honor.  In 1947, 

President Truman vetoed that bill, saying that it was a 
dangerous intrusion into free speech.  That has always 
been an area of enormous controversy, not just in the 
public sphere but in the judicial sphere.  The early

cases about Taft-Hartley were ones in which what the 
Court did was to basically say in one case after another 
that the statute did not govern the particular facts of 
the case so as to avoid --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But those were union 

cases, weren't they, rather than corporate cases?

 MR. ABRAMS:  Yes, they were three union 

cases.  And the case after that essentially was Buckley. 
And Buckley held unconstitutional the limits posed there 
to independent expenditures.  All I'm saying is that 
this is not a situation as if we have an unbroken amount 
of years throughout American history in which it has 
been accepted that independent expenditures could be 
barred.  It has always been a matter of high level of 
controversy, with courts at first and understandably 
shying away from facing up to the issue directly and 
then the first ruling on point.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But have you read Justice 

Rehnquist's dissent in the Bellotti case?

 MR. ABRAMS:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Have you read Justice 

Rehnquist's dissent in the Bellotti case?

MR. ABRAMS:  Yes, it is.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And also 

inconsistent with his later view, correct?

 MR. ABRAMS:  Yes.
 Yes, Justice?
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Going back to the 

question of stare decisis, the one thing that is very 
interesting about this area of law for the last 
100 years is the active involvement of both State and 
Federal legislatures in trying to find that balance 
between the interest of protecting in their views how 
the electoral process should proceed and the interests 
of the First Amendment.

 And so my question to you is, once we say 

they can't, except on the basis of a compelling 
government interest narrowly tailored, are we cutting 
off or would we be cutting off that future democratic 
process?  Because what you are suggesting is that the 
courts who created corporations as persons, gave birth 
to corporations as persons, and there could be an 
argument made that that was the Court's error to start 
with, not Austin or McConnell, but the fact that the 
Court imbued a creature of State law with human 
characteristics.

 But we can go back to the very basics that

way, but wouldn't we be doing some more harm than good 
by a broad ruling in a case that doesn't involve more 
business corporations and actually doesn't even involve 
the traditional nonprofit organization?  It involves an 
advocacy corporation that has a very particular 
interest.

 MR. ABRAMS:  Your Honor, I don't think you'd 

be doing more harm than good in vindicating the First 
Amendment rights here, which transcend that of Citizens 
United.

 I think that, reading my friend's brief here 

on the right, they come -- some of them at least come 
pretty close to saying that there must be a way for 
Citizens United to win this case other than a broad way. 
In my view the principles at stake here are the same. 
Citizens United happens to be sort of the paradigmatic 
example of the sort of group speaking no less about who 
to vote for or not who to vote for or what to think 
about a potential ongoing candidate for President of the 
United States.  But in lots of other situations day by 
day there is a blotch to public discourse caused as a 
result of this Congressional legislation.

 And so we think it is not a matter of 

cutting off what legislatures can do.  They can still 
pass legislation doing all sorts of things.  They can do

public funding.  They can do many other things that 
don't violate the First Amendment.  If we are right in 
saying that independent expenditures, that category of 
money leading to speech that we are talking about today, 
if we are right that that is the sort of speech which is 
at the core of the First Amendment, then you would be 
doing only good, only good, by ruling that way today 
across the board.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELENA KAGAN
 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
 GENERAL KAGAN:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 I have three very quick points to make about the 
government position.  The first is that this issue has a 
long history.  For over 100 years Congress has made a 
judgment that corporations must be subject to special 
rules when they participate in elections and this Court 
has never questioned that judgment.

 Number two --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  We 

never questioned it, but we never approved it, either.

And we gave some really weird interpretations to the 
Taft-Hartley Act in order to avoid confronting the 
question.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I will repeat what I said, 
Justice Scalia:  For 100 years this Court, faced with 
many opportunities to do so, left standing the 
legislation that is at issue in this case -- first the 
contribution limits, then the expenditure limits that 
came in by way of Taft-Hartley -- and then of course in 
Austin specifically approved those limits.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what you 
are saying.  I mean, we are not a self -- self-starting 
institution here.  We only disapprove of something when 
somebody asks us to.  And if there was no occasion for 
us to approve or disapprove, it proves nothing whatever 
that we didn't disapprove it.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, you are not a 

self-starting institution.  But many litigants brought 
many cases to you in 1907 and onwards and in each case 
this Court turns down, declined the opportunity, to 
invalidate or otherwise interfere with this legislation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that judgment was 

validated by Buckley's contribution-expenditure line. 
And you're correct if you look at contributions, but 
this is an expenditure case.  And I think that it

doesn't clarify the situation to say that for

100 years -- to suggest that for 100 years we would have

allowed expenditure limitations, which in order to work

at all have to have a speaker-based distinction,

exemption from media, content-based distinction,

time-based distinction.  We've never allowed that.


 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I think 

Justice Stevens was right in saying that the expenditure 
limits that are in play in this case came into effect in 
1947, so it has been 60 years rather than 100 years. 
But in fact, even before that the contribution limits 
were thought to include independent expenditures, and as 
soon as Congress saw independent expenditures going on 
Congress closed what it perceived to be illegal.  So in 
fact for 100 years corporations have made neither 
contributions nor expenditures, save for a brief period 
of time in the middle 1940's, which Congress very 
swiftly reacted to by passing the Taft-Hartley Act.

 Now, the reason that Congress has enacted 

these special rules -- and this is the second point that 
I wanted to make --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Before you go to your 

second point, may I ask you to clarify one part of the 
first, namely, your answer to the question I proposed to 
Mr. Olson, namely, why isn't the Snowe-Jeffords

Amendment, which was picked on by Congress itself, an --
and which is argued by the NRA, an appropriate answer to 
this case?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  That was my third point, 

Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Oh, I'm sorry.
 (Laughter.)
 GENERAL KAGAN:  So we will just skip over 

the second.

 My third point is that this is an anomalous 
case in part because this is an atypical plaintiff.  And 
the reason this is an atypical plaintiff is because this 
plaintiff is an ideological nonprofit and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you are giving up 
-- you are giving up the distinction from MCFL that you 
defended in your opening brief?  There you said this 
doesn't qualify as a different kind of corporation 
because it takes corporate funds, and now you are 
changing that position?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  No, I --I don't think we are 

changing it.  MCFL is the law, and the FEA -- FEC has 
always tried to implement MCFL faithfully.  And that's 
what the FEC has tried to do.  But if you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I guess -- do you 

think MCFL applies in this case even though the

corporation takes corporate funds from for-profit 
corporations?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I don't think MCFL as 

written applies in this case, but I think that the Court 
could, as lower courts have done, adjust MCFL 
potentially to make it apply in this case, although I 
think that would require a remand.  What lower courts 
have done -- MCFL was set up, it was written in a very 
strict kind of way so that the organization had to have 
a policy of accepting no corporate funds whatsoever.

 Some of the lower courts, including the D.C. 

Circuit, which, of course, sees a lot of these cases, 
have suggested that MCFL is too strict, that it doesn't 
--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you -- do you 

think it's too strict?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I -- I -- the FEC has no 

objection to MCFL being adjusted in order to -- to give 
it some flexibility.  What the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you want to give 

up this case, change your position, and basically say 
you lose solely because of the questioning that we have 
directed on reargument?

question we have posed on reargument.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  No, I don't think that that 

is fair.  We think -- we continue to think that the --
the judgment below should be affirmed.  If you are 
asking me, Mr. Chief Justice, as to whether the 
government has a preference as to the way in which it 
loses, if it has to lose, the answer is yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What case of ours --
what case of ours suggests that there is a hierarchy of 
bases on which we should rule against a party when both 
of them involve constitutional questions?  Extending --
modifying MCFL would be, I assume, by virtue of the 
First Amendment.  Overruling Austin would be by virtue 
of the First Amendment.  So what case says we should 
prefer one as opposed to the other?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I think the question really 
is the Court's standard practice of deciding as-applied 
challenges before facial challenges.  And this case 
certainly raises a number of tricky as-applied 
questions.  One is the question of how the -- the 
statute applies to nonprofit organizations such as this 
one.  Another is a question of how it applies to VOD 
transmissions.  Yet another is the question of how it 
applies to a 90-minute infomercial as opposed to smaller 
advertisements.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if you -- if you 

insist on the as-applied challenge, isn't that 
inconsistent with the whole line of cases that began in 
Thornhill v. Alabama and Coates v. Cincinnati?  What 
about the Thornhill doctrine?  It is not cited in the 
briefs, but that doctrine is that even a litigant 
without standing to object to a particular form of 
conduct can raise that if the statute covers it in order 
that the statute does not have an ongoing chill against 
speech.  And there is no place where an ongoing chill is 
more dangerous than in the elections context.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I think even --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you are asking us to 

have an ongoing chill where we have as-applied 
challenges which are based on, as I indicated before, 
speaker, content, time, and this is the kind of chilling 
effect that the Thornhill doctrine stands directly 
against.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  You know, I think even in 

the First Amendment context, Justice Kennedy, the Court 
will not strike down a statute on its face unless it 
finds very substantial overbreadth, many applications of 
the statute that are unconstitutional, as opposed to 
just a few or just some.  What I am suggesting here is 
that the Court was right in McConnell and then confirmed

in WRTL to find that BCRA, which is of course the only 
statute directly involved in this case, did not have 
that substantial overdraft.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me ask you this. 

Suppose that we were to rule that nonprofit corporations 
could not be covered by the statute.  Would that --
would the statute then have substantial overbreadth?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I would urge you not 

to do that in that kind of sweeping way, because the 
reason for the nonprofit corporations being covered is 
to make sure that the nonprofit corporations don't 
function as conduits for the for-profit corporations.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But suppose we were to say 

that.  Would the statute then not be substantially 
overbroad?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I don't think that the 
statute is substantially overbroad right now.  So if you 
took out certain applications, I can't think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I am asking you to 
assume that we draw the nonprofit/profit distinction. 
Then the statute, it seems to me, clearly has to fall 
because, number one, we couldn't sever it based on the 
language.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I see what you are saying. 

Well, you could do a couple of things.  You could do

what Justice Stevens suggested.  Justice Stevens 
suggested -- I suggested to Chief Justice Roberts --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  I don't think you -- I 

don't think you really caught what I suggested because 
you treated it as an enlargement of the MCFL example.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I was going to go back.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But that is not what the 

National Rifle Association argues or what Snowe-Jeffords 
covers.  It covers ads that are financed exclusively by 
individuals even though they are sponsored by a 
corporation.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, that's exactly right. 

What you are suggesting, Justice Stevens, is essentially 
stripping the Wellstone amendment from the --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Correct and treating the 

Snowe-Jeffords amendment as being the correct test.  And 
nobody has explained why that wouldn't be a proper 
solution, not nearly as drastic as -- as being argued 
here.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, and there are some, you 

know -- there are -- there are some reasons that that 
might -- that might be appropriate.  The Wellstone 
amendment was a funny kind of thing.  It was passed very 
narrowly, but beyond that it was passed with a -- a 
really substantial support of many people who voted

against the legislation in the end, presumably as a 
poison pill.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if we -- if we go --
if we go that route, what we are doing is creating an 
accounting industry, aren't we?  Corporations give huge 
amounts of money to the C-4 organization, and then 
somebody, perhaps the FEC, has to decide whether in fact 
that is a way of subverting the prohibition against the 
direct payment for the communication, right?  Okay, so 
Congress said, we don't want that.  Congress said, 
that's going to be a nightmare, and we decide Wellstone, 
for whatever reasons.

 Now don't we have to focus on whether 

Congress can say that or whether it can't?

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And I don't know why it 

cannot say it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Congress also said if you 
strike down the Wellstone amendment, we want the Snowe-
Jeffords amendment.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And why shouldn't we 

follow that direction?

amendment --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.
 GENERAL KAGAN:  -- which allows nonprofit 

organizations of the kind here to fund these ads out of 
separate bank accounts, not PACs just separate bank 
accounts --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Correct.
 GENERAL KAGAN:  -- which include only 

individual expenditures.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then why is that not the 
-- the wisest narrow solution of the problem before us?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, it is -- it is 

certainly a narrower and I think better solution than a 
facial invalidation of the whole statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, what do you 
-- what do you understand to be the compelling interest 
that the Court articulated in Austin?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I think that what the Court 

articulated in Austin -- and, of course, in the 
government briefs we have suggested that Austin did not 
articulate what we believe to be the strongest 
compelling interest, which is the anticorruption 
interest.  But what the Court articulated in Austin was 
essentially a concern about corporations using the 
corporate form to appropriate other people's money for

expressive purposes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  So but you 
-- you have more or less -- "abandoned" is too strong a 
word, but as you say you have relied on a different 
interest, the quid pro quo corruption.  And you -- you 
articulate on page 11 of your brief -- you recognize 
that this Court has not accepted that interest as a 
compelling interest.

 So isn't it the case that as you view Austin 

it is kind of up for play in the sense that you would 
ground it on an interest that the Court has never 
recognized?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, a couple of points. 
The first thing is, as you say, we have not abandoned 
Austin.  We have simply said that in addition --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where --
GENERAL KAGAN: -- to other people's money 

interest that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where in your --

where in your supplemental briefing do you say that this 
aggregation of wealth interest supports Austin?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I would not really call it 

an aggregation of wealth interest.  I would say that 
it's -- it's a concern about corporate use of other 
people's money to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Putting it outside, 
putting the quid pro quo interest aside, where in your 
supplemental briefing do you support the interest that 
was articulated by the Court in Austin?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Where we talk about 

shareholder protection and where we talk about the 
distortion of the electoral process that occurs when 
corporations use their shareholders' money who may or 
may not agree --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand that to 

be a different interest.  That is the shareholder 
protection interest as opposed to the fact that 
corporations have such wealth and they -- they distort 
the marketplace.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I -- I think that they 

are connected because both come --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so am I right 
then in saying that in the supplemental briefing you do 
not rely at all on the market distortion rationale on 
which Austin relied; not the shareholder rationale, not 
the quid pro quo rationale, the market distortion issue. 
These corporations have a lot of money.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  We do not rely at all on 
Austin to the extent that anybody takes Austin to be 
suggesting anything about the equalization of a speech

market.  So I know that that's the way that many people 
understand the distortion rationale of Austin, and if 
that's the way the Court understands i, we do not rely 
at all on that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if we have to 

preserve -- if we are going to preserve Austin we have 
to accept your invitation that the quid pro quo interest 
supports the holding there or the shareholder protection 
interest.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I would say either the quid 

pro quo interest, the corruption interest or the 
shareholder interest, or what I would say is a -- is 
something related to the shareholder interest that is in 
truth my view of Austin, which is a view that when 
corporations use other people's money to electioneer, 
that is a harm not just to the shareholders themselves 
but a sort of a broader harm to the public that comes 
from distortion of the electioneering that is done by 
corporations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's -- let's talk about 

overbreadth.  You've -- let's assume that that is a 
valid interest.  What percentage of the total number of 
corporations in the country are not single shareholder 
corporations?  The local hairdresser, the local auto

repair shop, the local new car dealer -- I don't know 
any small business in this country that isn't 
incorporated, and the vast majority of them are 
sole-shareholder-owned.

 Now this statute makes it unlawful for all 

of them to do the things that you are worried about, you 
know, distorting other -- the interests of other 
shareholders.  That is vast overbreadth.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  You know, I think that the 

single shareholders can present these corruption 
problems.  Many, many closed corporations, single 
shareholder corporations --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not talking about the 
corruption interest.  You -- you have your quid pro quo 
argument, that's another one.  We get to that when we 
get there.  But as far as the interest you are now 
addressing, which is those shareholders who don't agree 
with this political position are being somehow cheated, 
that doesn't apply probably to the vast majority of 
corporations in this country.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  You are quite right, 

Justice Scalia, when -- we say when it comes to single 
shareholders, the kind of "other people's money" 
interests, the shareholder protection interests do not 
apply.  There --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that can't be the 

justification --

GENERAL KAGAN:  There --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- because if it were, the 

statute would be vastly overbroad.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  There the strongest 

justification is the anticorruption interest.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, with respect to that 
what is your answer to the argument that more than half 
the States, including California and Oregon, Virginia, 
Washington State, Delaware, Maryland, a great many 
others, permit independent corporate expenditures for 
just these purposes?  Now have they all been overwhelmed 
by corruption?  A lot of money is spent on elections in 
California; has -- is there a record that the 
corporations have corrupted the political process there?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I think the experience of 
some half the States cannot be more important than the 
100-year old judgment of Congress that these 
expenditures would corrupt the Federal system, and I 
think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Congress has a 

self-interest.  I mean, we -- we are suspicious of 
congressional action in the First Amendment area 
precisely because we -- at least I am -- I doubt that

one can expect a body of incumbents to draw election 
restrictions that do not favor incumbents.  Now is that 
excessively cynical of me?  I don't think so.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I think, Justice Scalia, 

it's wrong.  In fact, corporate and union money go 
overwhelmingly to incumbents.  This may be the single 
most self-denying thing that Congress has ever done.  If 
you look -- if you look at the last election cycle and 
look at corporate PAC money and ask where it goes, it 
goes ten times more to incumbents than to challengers, 
and in the prior election cycle even more than that.
 And for an obvious reason, because when 

corporations play in the political process, they want 
winners, they want people who will produce outcomes for 
them, and they know that the way to get those outcomes, 
the way to get those winners is to invest in incumbents, 
and so that's what they do.  As I said, in double digits 
times more than they invest in challengers.  So I think 
that that -- that that rationale, which is undoubtedly 
true in many contexts, simply is not the case with 
respect to this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But under your position, 
if corporations A, B, and C, are called to Washington

committee chairmanship and told to tow the line and to 
tell their directors and shareholders what the policy 
ought to be, some other corporation can't object to that 
during the election cycle.  The government silences a 
corporate objector, and those corporations may have the 
most knowledge of this on the subject.

 Corporations have lots of knowledge about 

environment, transportation issues, and you are 
silencing them during the election.
 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When other corporations, 

via -- because of the very fact you just point out, have 
already been used and are being used by the government 
to express its views; and you say another corporation 
can't object to that.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, to the extent, 

Justice Kennedy, that you are talking about what goes on 
in the halls of Congress, of course corporations can 
lobby members of Congress in the same way that they 
could before this legislation.  What this legislation is 
designed to do, because of its anticorruption interest, 
is to make sure that that lobbying is just persuasion 
and it's not coercion.  But in addition to that, of 
course corporations have many opportunities to speak 
outside the halls of Congress.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  One of the amicus briefs 
objects to -- responds to Justice Kennedy's problem by 
saying that the problem is we have got to contribute to 
both parties, and a lot of them do, don't they?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  A lot of them do, which is a 

suggestion about how corporations engage the political 
process and how corporations are different from 
individuals in this respect.  You know, an individual 
can be the wealthiest person in the world but few of 
us -- maybe some -- but few of us are only our economic 
interests.  We have beliefs, we have convictions; we 
have likes and dislikes.  Corporations engage the 
political process in an entirely different way and this 
is what makes them so much more damaging.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's not --

I'm sorry, but that seems rather odd.  A large 
corporation just like an individual has many diverse 
interests.  A corporation may want to support a 
particular candidate, but they may be concerned just as 
you say about what their shareholders are going to think 
about that.  They may be concerned that the shareholders 
would rather they spend their money doing something 
else.  The idea that corporations are different than 
individuals in that respect, I just don't think holds 
up.

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, all I was suggesting, 
Mr. Chief Justice, is that corporations have actually a 
fiduciary obligation to their shareholders to increase 
value.  That's their single purpose, their goal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if a candidate --

take a tobacco company, and a candidate is running on 
the platform that they ought to make tobacco illegal, 
presumably that company would maximize its shareholders' 
interests by opposing the election of that individual.
 GENERAL KAGAN:  But everything is geared 
through the corporation's self-interest in order to 
maximize profits, in order to maximize revenue, in order 
to maximize value.  Individuals are more complicated 
than that.  So that when corporations engage the 
political process, they do it with that set of you know, 
blinders -- I don't mean it to be pejorative, because 
that's what we want corporations to do, is to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I suppose some 

do, but let's say if you have ten individuals and they 
each contribute $1,000 to a corporation, and they say, 
"we want this corporation to convey a particular 
message," why can't they do that, when if they did that 
as partnership, it would be all right?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, it sounds to me as 
though the corporation that you were describing is a

corporation of the kind we have in this case, where one 
can assume that the members all sign on to the 
corporation's ideological mission, where the corporation 
in fact has an ideological mission.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  General Kagan, most -- most 

corporations are indistinguishable from the individual 
who owns them, the local hairdresser, the new auto 
dealer -- dealer who has just lost his dealership and --
and who wants to oppose whatever Congressman he thinks 
was responsible for this happening or whatever 
Congressman won't try to patch it up by -- by getting 
the auto company to undo it.  There is no distinction 
between the individual interest and the corporate 
interest.  And that is true for the vast majority of 
corporations.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yet this law freezes all of 

them out.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  To the extent that we are 
only talking about single shareholder corporations, I 
guess I would ask why it's any burden on that single 
shareholder to make the expenditures to participate in 
the political person in the way that person wants to 
outside the corporate forum?  So single shareholders 
aren't suffering any burden here; they can do everything

that they could within the corporate form, outside the 
corporate form.  They probably don't get the tax breaks 
that they would get inside the corporate form, but I'm 
not sure anything else is very different.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, he wants to put up a 

sign --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Ultra Vires would take 

care of about 90 percent of the small corporations that 
Justice Scalia is talking about.  They can't just --
they can't even give money to charities sometimes 
because of Ultra Vires.  Giving political contributions 
is not typical for corporate activity.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is -- I -- I remember 

spending quite a few days one summer reading through 
1,000 pages of opinion in the D.C. Circuit.  And I came 
away with the distinct impression that Congress has 
built an enormous record of support for this bill in the 
evidence.

 And my recollection is, but it is now a 

couple of years old, that there was a lot of information 
in that which suggested that many millions of voters 
think, at the least, that large corporate and union 
expenditures or contributions in favor of a candidate 
lead the benefited political figure to decide quite 
specifically in favor of the -- of the contributing or

expending organization, the corporation or the union.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, that's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, it was on the basis of 

that, I think, that this Court upheld the law in BCRA. 
But we have heard from the other side there isn't much 
of a record on this.

 So, if you could save me some time here, 
perhaps you could point me, if I am right, to those 
thousand pages of opinion and tens of thousands of 
underlying bits of evidence where there might be support 
for that proposition?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, that's exactly right, 

Justice Breyer, that in addition to the 100-year old 
judgment that Congress believes this is necessary, that 
very recently members of Congress and others created a 
gigantic record showing that there was corruption and 
that there was the appearance of corruption.

 And in that record, many times senators, 

former senators talk about the way in which fundraising 
is at the front of their mind in everything that they do 
the way in which they grant access, the way in which 
they grant influence, and the way in which outcomes 
likely change as a result of that fundraising.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  BCRA has changed all that.

ask, it seems -- to your shareholder protection 
rationale, isn't it extraordinarily paternalistic for 
the government to take the position that shareholders 
are too stupid to keep track of what their corporations 
are doing and can't sell their shares or object in the 
corporate context if they don't like it?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I don't think so, Mr. Chief 
Justice.  I mean, I, for one, can't keep stack of what 
my -- where I hold --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You have a busy job. 

You can't expect everybody to do that.

 (Laughter.)
 GENERAL KAGAN:  It's not that -- it's not 

that I have a busy job.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it is 

extraordinary -- I mean, the -- the idea and as I 
understand the rationale, we -- we the government, big 
brother, has to protect shareholders from themselves. 
They might give money, they might buy shares in a 
corporation and they don't know that the corporation is 
taking out radio ads.  The government has to keep an eye 
on their interests.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I appreciate that.  It's not 

that I have a busy job, it's that I, like most 
Americans, own shares through mutual funds.  If you

don't know where your mutual funds are investing, so you 
don't know where you are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it is -- I mean, 
I understand.  So it is a paternalistic interest, we the 
government have to protect you naive shareholders.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  In a world in which most 

people own stock through mutual funds, in a world where 
people own stock through retirement plans in which they 
have to invest, they have no choice, I think it's very 
difficult for individual shareholders to be able to 
monitor what each company they own assets in is doing or 
even to know the extent of the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In that respect, it's 

unlike the union, because the -- the worker who does not 
want to affiliate with a union cannot have funds from 
his own pocket devoted to political causes.  But there 
is no comparable check for corporations.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  That's exactly right, 

Justice Ginsburg.  In the union context, of course, it's 
a constitutional right that the unions give back 
essentially the funds that any union member or employee 
in the workplace does not want used for electoral 
purposes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does that mean that 
unions should be taken out, because there isn't the

same -- the shareholder protection interest doesn't --
there is no parallel for the union?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  You are right about that. 
But I -- the government believes that with respect to 
unions, the anticorruption interest is as strong, and 
that unions should be kept in.

 I think what your point suggests, that 

the -- that the union member point suggests why Congress 
might have thought that there was a compelling interest 
to protect corporate shareholders in the same way that, 
let's say, dissenting union members are protected by the 
Constitution.  There is no State action, of course, so 
there is no constitutional right in the corporate 
context.

 But Congress made a judgment that it was an 
important value that shareholders have this choice, have 
the ability both to invest in our country's assets and 
also to be able to choose our country's leaders.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not investing 

in our country's --

argument, have you covered point two?

what it is, so that I -- my notes are complete.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I very appreciate that, 

Justice Kennedy.  I think I did cover point two, which 
was an explanation of some of the questions that the 
Chief Justice asked me about what interests the 
government was suggesting motivated these laws and are 
compelling enough such that this Court certainly should 
not invalidate these laws.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I take it we have 
never accepted your shareholder protection interest. 
This is a new argument.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I think that that's fair. 

Certainly Bellotti does not accept it.  I would think --
you know, National Right to Work is an interesting 
opinion, because National Right to Work accepts for a 
unanimous court both the shareholder protection argument 
and the anticorruption argument with respect to the 
section 441b in particular.

 Now, in later cases the Court has suggested 

that National Right to Work was only focused on 
contributions.  If you read National Right to Work, that 
distinction really does not -- it's not evident on the 
face of the opinion, and I think Chief Justice Rehnquist 
at later -- in a later dissent suggested that he had 
never understood it that way.

But -- so National Right to Work is a 

confusion on this point.  It --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess other 

than that, and I think there may be some ambiguity 
there, but I wouldn't say NRWC is a holding on 
shareholder protection.  So to the extent that you 
abandoned the original rationale in Austin, and 
articulated different rationales, you have two, the quid 
pro quo corruption interest and the shareholder 
protection interest --

GENERAL KAGAN:  Which we think is not in 

Austin.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Austin, I thought, 

was based on the aggregation of immense wealth by 
corporations.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Again, Austin is not the 

most lucid opinion.  But the way we understand Austin, 
what Austin was suggesting was that the corporate form 
gave corporations significant assets, other people's 
money that when the corporations spent those assets --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can you -- can you 

give me the citation to the page in Austin where we 
accepted the shareholder protection rationale?

when the Court is distinguishing MCFL.  And the message

of that distinction of MCFL is the shareholder 
protection interest?  But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do the words 

"shareholder" -- I don't know, do the words "shareholder 
protection" appear in the Austin opinion?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I honestly don't know, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  And -- and I don't want to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If they don't --

let's assume they don't, then I get back to my question, 
which is, you are asking us to defend the Austin or 
support or continue the Austin opinion on the basis of 
two rationales that we have never accepted, shareholder 
protection and quid pro quo corruption?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I would say on the quid pro 

quo corruption, of course you have accepted that 
rationale --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In the context of 

contributions, not expenditures.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  That's correct.  And I think 

what has changed since -- since that time is the BCRA 
record that Justice Breyer suggested, which was very 
strong on the notion that there was no difference when 
it came to corporate contributions and expenditures, 
that there actually was no difference between the two.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that a yes?  Is 

that a yes?  In other words, you are asking us to uphold 
Austin on the basis of two arguments, two principles, 
two compelling interests we have never accepted, in 
expenditure context.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  In this -- in this 

particular context, fair enough.  But, you know, I 
think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And to undercut Buckley in 

so doing?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I don't think so, 

because I do think Buckley was about individuals rather 
than corporations, and Buckley was in 1976, not in 2009, 
after the very extensive record that was created in 
BCRA.

 I see my time is up.  I don't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I ask you one 

question that was highlighted in the prior argument, and 
that was if Congress could say no TV and radio ads, 
could it also say no newspaper ads, no campaign 
biographies?  Last time the answer was, yes, Congress 
could, but it didn't.  Is that -- is that still the 
government's answer?

changed, Justice Ginsburg.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  It is still true that BCRA 
203, which is the only statute involved in this case, 
does not apply to books or anything other than 
broadcast; 441b does, on its face, apply to other media. 
And we took what the Court -- what the Court's -- the 
Court's own reaction to some of those other 
hypotheticals very seriously.  We went back, we 
considered the matter carefully, and the government's 
view is that although 441b does cover full-length books, 
that there would be quite good as-applied challenge to 
any attempt to apply 441b in that context.

 And I should say that the FEC has never 

applied 441b in that context.  So for 60 years a book 
has never been at issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What happened to the 

overbreadth doctrine?  I mean, I thought our doctrine in 
the Fourth Amendment is if you write it too broadly, we 
are not going to pare it back to the point where it's 
constitutional.  If it's overbroad, it's invalid.  What 
has happened to that.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I don't think that it would 

be substantially overbroad, Justice Scalia, if I tell 
you that the FEC has never applied this statute to a 
book.  To say that it doesn't apply to books is to take

off, you know, essentially nothing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But we don't put our 
-- we don't put our First Amendment rights in the hands 
of FEC bureaucrats; and if you say that you are not 
going to apply it to a book, what about a pamphlet?
 GENERAL KAGAN:  I think a -- a pamphlet 

would be different.  A pamphlet is pretty classic 
electioneering, so there is no attempt to say that 441 b 
only applies to video and not to print.  It does --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the 

particular -- what if the particular movie involved here 
had not been distributed by Video on Demand?  Suppose 
that people could view it for free on Netflix over the 
internet?  Suppose that free DVDs were passed out. 
Suppose people could attend the movie for free in a 
movie theater; suppose the exact text of this was 
distributed in a printed form.  In light of your 
retraction, I have no idea where the government would 
draw the line with respect to the medium that could be 
prohibited.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, none of those things, 

again, are covered.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but could they?  Which 
of them could and which could not?  I understand you to 
say books could not.

GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, I think what you --

what we're saying is that there has never been an 
enforcement action for books.  Nobody has ever 
suggested -- nobody in Congress, nobody in the 
administrative apparatus has ever suggested that books 
pose any kind of corruption problem, so I think that 
there would be a good as-applied challenge with respect 
to that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you're -- you are a 

lawyer advising somebody who is about to come out with a 
book and you say don't worry, the FEC has never tried to 
send somebody to prison for this.  This statute covers 
it, but don't worry, the FEC has never done it.  Is that 
going to comfort your client?  I don't think so.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this -- this statute 

doesn't cover.  It doesn't cover books.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  No, no, that's exactly 

right.  The only statute that is involved in this case 
does not cover books.  So 441b which --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does cover books.
 GENERAL KAGAN:  -- which does cover books, 
except that I have just said that there would be a good 
as-applied challenge and that there has been no 
administrative practice of ever applying it to the 
books.  And also only applies to express advocacy,

right?  203 has -- is -- is -- has a broader category of 
the functional equivalent of express advocacy, but 441b 
is only express advocacy, which is a part of the reason 
why it has never applied to a book.  One cannot imagine 
very many books that would meet the definition of 
express advocacy as this Court has expressed that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, I'm sorry, we 

suggested some in the last argument.  You have a history 
of union organizing and union involvement in politics, 
and the last sentence says in light of all this, vote 
for Jones.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I think that that wouldn't 
be covered, Mr. Chief Justice.  The FEC is very careful 
and says this in all its regulations to view matters as 
a whole.  And as a whole that book would not count as 
express advocacy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.

electoral advocacy the same way individuals do, that is 
with money voluntarily committed by people associated 
with the corporation, is grounded in interests that are 
so compelling that 52 years ago, before Buckley was 
decided, before FECA was enacted, before Buckley-style 
quid pro quo corruption was ever addressed, this Court 
explained that, quote:  "What is involved here is the 
integrity of our electoral process and not less the 
responsibility of the individual citizen for the 
successful functioning of that process."

 If the Court now wishes to reconsider the 

existence and extent of the interests that underlie that 
sentiment expressed for the Court by Justice Frankfurter 
in the context of a prosecution of union officials for 
running television ads supporting political candidates, 
it should do so in a case in which those interests are 
forthrightly challenged with a proper and full record 
below.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One of the amicus 

briefs, I'm not -- maybe it's professor Hayward, if I am 
getting that right -- suggested the history of this 1947 
provision was such that it really wasn't enforced 
because people were concerned about the First Amendment 
interests and that the courts to the extent cases were

limitations.

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I don't recall who the 

professor was either, Mr. Chief Justice, but I do recall 
pretty well the history that was recounted -- I would 
say the history that was recounted by this Court in the 
Auto Workers case, in CIO, in the Pipefitters case, 
which is quite inconsistent with that.  We've never had 
this case -- until this Court's supplemental order, we 
never had a case that challenged directly, quote, 
"Austin" and Austin-style corruption, which is a term I 
think that is quite misleading.

 When the sober-minded Elihu Root was moved 
to stand up in 1894 and urged the people of the United 
States, and urged the Congress of the United States, to 
enact legislation that would address, quote, "a 
constantly growing evil which has done more to shake the 
confidence of plain people of small means of this 
country in our political institutions than any practice 
which has ever obtained since the founding of our 
government," he was not engaging in a high level 
discussion about political philosophy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But he was talking about 

contributions in that context.  That's quite clear.

distinction whatsoever in that time between the 
distinction that this Court came to understand as a 
result of FECA, and its adjudication of FECA and that --
really the prehistory of Taft-Hartley, between 
contributions expenditures.

 For this reason, Justice Kennedy, was that 

what Root said was the idea -- and I am quoting now from 
his speech which is also partly reprinted in this 
Court's opinion in McConnell -- the idea is to prevent 
the great companies, the great aggregations of wealth 
from using corporate funds directly or indirectly to 
send members of the legislature to these halls in order 
to vote for their protection and the advancement of 
their interests as against those of the public.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Great aggregations of 
wealth.  The brief by the Chamber of Commerce, the 
amicus brief by the Chamber of Commerce points out that 
96 percent of its members employ less than 100 people. 
These are not aggregations of great wealth.  You are not 
talking about the railroad barons and the rapacious

about small business corporations.

point and I think you have made this point forceful lily 
many times before.  A unanimous court in National Right

to Work Committee concluded that Congress was entitled 
to make the judgment that it would treat in order to 
address this root evil, a problem of such concern that 
it goes to the very foundation of the democratic 
republican exercise, that is, the notion of integrity in 
representative government.

 Now this -- this case, of course, is not a 

case --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand that 

answer.  I mean, if that's what you were concerned 
about, what Elihu Root was concerned about, you could 
have said all corporations that have a net worth of more 
than, you know, so much or whatever.  That is not what 
Congress did.  It said all corporations.

 MR. WAXMAN:  Right.  And Justice Scalia, if 
a small corporation or even any corporation of any sort 
wants to bring an as-applied challenge to 441b or a 
State law analogue and say, you know, I am not the 
problem that Theodore Roosevelt and Elihu Root was 
addressed at; there isn't a compelling interest because 
I only have three employees and $8,000 in my bank 
account, that's fine.  But what is extraordinary, truly 
extraordinary, given the sentiments that underlay the 
Tillman Act and the Taft-Hartley Act is that we would be 
having a discussion today about the constitutionality of

a law that has been on the books forever when no party, 
no corporation, has ever raised the challenge.  I well 
recall --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You say it's been on --

it's been on the books forever.  But, No. 1, the 
phenomenon of -- of television ads where we get 
information about scientific discovery and -- and 
environment and transportation issues from corporations 
who after all have patents because they know something, 
that -- that is different.  And the -- the history you 
applied apply to contributions, not to those kinds of 
expenditures.

 MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Kennedy, first of all, 
I -- I think it is actually true that patents are owned 
by individuals and not corporations.  But be that as it 
may, there is no doubt -- I am not here saying that this 
Court should reconsider Bellotti on first principles any 
more than I am saying that it shouldn't consider Austin 
on first principles.  Corporations can and do speak 
about a wide range of public policy issues, and since 
the controlling opinion was issued in Wisconsin Right to 
Life, the -- the kind of campaign-related speech that 
corporations can't engage in, in the pre-election period 
is limited to the functional equivalent of expressed 
advocacy and nothing else.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Waxman, all of this talk 

about 100 years and 50 years is perplexing.  It sounds 
like the sort of sound bites that you hear on TV.  The 
-- the fact of the matter is that the only cases that 
are being -- that may possibly be reconsidered are 
McConnell and Austin.  And they don't go back 50 years, 
and they don't go back 100 years.

 MR. WAXMAN:  My point here is, Justice Alito 
-- and I don't mean to be -- to be demeaning this Court 
with sound bites.  The point is that what -- Austin was, 
to be sure, the very first case in which this Court had 
to decide -- actually had to decide whether or not the 
prohibition on corporate treasury funded campaign speech 
could properly be limited and was supporting by a 
compelling interest.  All I am suggesting -- and I hope 
that if you take nothing else from my advocacy today it 
will be this -- is that we have here a case in which the 
Court has asked a question that essentially goes to the 
bona fides, that is, the factual predicates of the 
interests that have been viewed as compelling in Austin, 
in MCFL, in McConnell itself, whether you call it the 
corrosive effect of corporate wealth, whether you call 
it, quote, "shareholder protection" --

JUSTICE ALITO:  And my point is that there 
is nothing unusual whatsoever about a case in which a

party before the Court says, my constitutional rights 
were violated, and there is no prior decision of this 
Court holding that what was done is constitutional.  And 
in that situation is it an answer to that argument that 
this has never been challenged before?  The Court has 
never held that it was unconstitutional?  It has been 
accepted up until this point by the general public that 
this is -- that this is constitutional?  No, that is not 
regarded as an answer to that question.

 MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Olson is -- was quite 

right -- either Mr. Olson or Mr. Abrams, I find it so 
difficult to tell the two apart.  One of them was 
saying, well, it's, you know -- yes, I think in response 
to Justice Sotomayor's question, you know, about there 
is no factual record here.  There is absolutely nothing 
in this case.

 And the response was, well, it's the 

government's burden.  The government has to prove that 
any restriction that it imposes passes strict scrutiny.

 Fair enough, but the question has to be 
raised.  The issue has to be raised.  If the -- if 
Austin, Justice Alito, or the compelling interests that 
Austin and McConnell relied on were forthrightly 
challenged in a case, the government would have the 
option --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Mr. Waxman, 

the government did have that opportunity, and the 
government compiled a record.  And when the Citizens 
United abandoned that position -- you are quite right, 
they changed their course -- the government and the 
district court complained that it had to go to all this 
work to develop this record, and yet we hear nothing 
about what the record showed.

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, that's because the 

ultimate -- I assume I have your permission to answer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead.
 MR. WAXMAN:  The -- the only challenges that 
were litigated in the district court -- and they largely 
were related to disclosure -- were very direct 
as-applied challenges that had -- that did nothing 
whatsoever to implicate the foundation of McConnell or 
Austin.  And all I'm saying is, if you want to re-
examine the predicates, the existence and magnitude of 
interests that Congress has, going back a -- whether 
it's 60 years or 100 years, and courts, whether it has 
been the actual rationale of the decision or a predicate 
of the rationale of the decision, you ought to do it in 
a case where the -- where the issue is squarely 
presented so that the government can do what it did in 
McConnell and in another context in Michigan v. Grutter

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

 MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The words that I would leave with this Court are the 
Solicitor General's.  The government's position has 
changed.  The government's position has changed as to 
what media might be covered by congressional power to 
censor and -- and ban speech by corporations.  Now we 
learn, contrary to what we heard in March, that books 
couldn't be prohibited but pamphlets could be 
prohibited.  We also learn --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's not -- the --
the statute that we are involved in, in this case does 
not cover those.

 MR. OLSON:  Unless they are engaged in, 

quote, "expressed advocacy."  And the other way in which 
the government has changed its position, if I listened 
carefully, is what type of corporation might be covered. 
The government now says that it wouldn't -- the -- the 
FEC is now willing to recede from its regulations which 
explicitly covered this corporation, and I don't know as

I stand here today what kind of corporations the 
government would choose to prosecute.

 Remember, the Federal Election Commission, 

which didn't even have a quorum and couldn't function at 
all for six months during the important election year of 
2008 --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  If the FEC chooses to 
prosecute only those who do not -- who do not rely 
exclusively on individual contributions.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, that's your question from 

before.

gets it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.  I want to see he 

 MR. OLSON:  And that -- (a), it wouldn't --
this corporation accepted a small amount, $2,000 out of 
-- out of the funding of this, so that wouldn't solve 
the problem for my corporation, my client's corporation.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it would solve it for 
the advertising, and there are two things.  There is the 
long Hillary document and the advertisements.  It would 
cover those.

 MR. OLSON:  If -- but the --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  And they are the only --

only ones that clearly violate the statute.

 MR. OLSON:  My point is that the overbreadth

in this statute -- that solves the problem by saying 
that corporations still can't speak, and if you don't 
have anything to do with them, you -- you -- they wear a 
scarlet letter that says "C."  If you accept one dollar 
of funding, then you had better make darn sure that when 
a check comes in for $100 from the XYZ hardware store in 
the neighborhood, that it wasn't a corporation that you 
used to -- to make a documentary about a candidate.
 The other way in which the government's 

position has changed is we do not know --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Does that mean you 

disagree with the NRA's submission?

 MR. OLSON:  I -- I submit that it does not 

solve the problem.  It would lead exactly --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  If it solved the problem 

as it would for the advertising, would it be an 
appropriate solution?

 MR. OLSON:  It -- I can't say that it -- if 

it solved the problem, because it doesn't solve the 
problem of prohibiting all corporate speech.  And I 
think -- and I am submitting, Justice Stevens, that that 
is unconstitutional.  I think what you are suggesting is 
that some limitation that -- what -- what you were 
suggesting is not a whole lot different than PAC.  It 
would lead, I think Justice Breyer was saying, to an

accounting nightmare.  It would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it is a nightmare that 

Congress endorsed in the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment.
 MR. OLSON:  Well, but the -- but the 

Wellstone Amendment sort of in a sense repealed it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  We have held the Wellstone 

Amendment literally cannot be applied.

 MR. OLSON:  Well --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  We unanimously held that.
 MR. OLSON:  I think what -- what the -- my 

response is that that does not solve the problem of 
inhibiting --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  You do not endorse the 

NRA's position?

 MR. OLSON:  No, we don't Justice Stevens, 
and -- and, as I said, it would not exempt my clients. 
The other -- the third way in which the government has 
changed its position is its rationale for this 
prohibition in the first place.  Is it corruption?  Is 
it shareholder protection?  Is it equalization?

 There was some dispute.  I heard the 

Solicitor General say that the equalization rationale 
was something the government disavowed.  It wasn't what 
Austin said, the government -- the government said.  And

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Justice Marshall said 
that he was not trying to equalize all voices in the 
political process.  He has a sentence that says, well, 
that's not what the rationale of this case is.

 MR. OLSON:  I don't -- I don't -- with all 

due respect Justice Ginsburg, the words that jump out at 
me are the words from page 665 that say the desire to 
counterbalance those advantages unique to the corporate 
forum is the state's compelling interest in this case. 
That sounds to me like -- like equalization.

 I don't know.  I am -- I am representing an 
individual who wants to speak about something that's the 
most important thing that goes on in our democracy.  I'm 
told it's a felony.  I am not -- and I -- I don't know 
what the rational basis is.  It's overbroad.  Now I hear 
about this shareholder -- protecting shareholders. 
There is not a word in the congressional record with 
respect to the -- which was before the Court in the 
McConnell case about protecting shareholders.  As the 
Bellotti case pointed out, that would be overbroad 
anyway because this statute applies to every --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Actually I read that 

sentence that you just read as meaning the corporation 
is an artificial person in respect to which the State 
creates many abilities and capacities, and the State is

free also to create some disabilities and capacities. 
Not a statement about balancing rich and poor.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, it -- it -- it strikes me 

that it is, because it follows the words that say 
corporations are given unique advantages to aggregate 
wealth and that we must take away that advantage by 
equalizing the process.  I think that's the plain 
meaning but my point I guess is -- if I may finish this 
sentence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Briefly.
 MR. OLSON:  My point is that the government 

here has an overbroad statute that covers every 
corporation irrespective of what its stockholders think, 
irrespective of whether it's big, and whether it's 
general -- a big railroad baron or anything like that, 
and it doesn't know, as it stands here today two years 
after this movie was offered for -- to the public for 
its view, what media might be covered, what type of 
corporation might be covered and what compelling 
justification or narrow standard would be applied to 
this form of speech.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
