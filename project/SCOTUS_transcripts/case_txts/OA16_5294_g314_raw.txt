CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first this morning in Case 16-5294, McWilliams v. Dunn. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Bright. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This Court, in 1985, clearly established in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its decision in Ake v. Oklahoma that a poor defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whose mental health or mental issues were a significant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor in the case, is entitled to an expert, and an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert independent of the prosecution, to assist in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluation, the preparation, and the presentation of an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective defense for the defendant. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose we thought that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

and it's not your position, I understand it -- that Ake 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was ambiguous on this point.  And then over time, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

became clear that, really, the psychiatrist ought to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consulting with the defense and -- and not with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution. 

            

Would we say that the basic right was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established, and that over time, we are simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making a refinement, or if we think Ake is ambiguous --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

I know you'll disagree -- if we think Ake is ambiguous, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are establishing a new right --

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- when we say it must be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

a defense psychiatrist. 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, as Your Honor guessed, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think it's ambiguous.  In fact, we think it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite clear when you look --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Sorry.  Go ahead.  I'm --

  

  

  

 

 

 

I'm assuming that we find it ambiguous.  I'm asking, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then is that -- is -- can it be the position that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is just a refinement of the right, or is it a new right? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, if you accept that it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous, which, of course, we do not accept --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right. 

  

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  -- but, of course, I mean, this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

goes to some of the clearly established cases the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has looked at where it's -- does it extend a decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the -- the Court has -- has rendered, and is this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking for something more.  We would submit here, it --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this can't be anything but an independent expert, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why --

  

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  -- if it even goes to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- is that so,

Mr. Bright, if -- if it's -- we're informed correctly by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Respondent that on remand in Ake itself, the lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

courts held that due process is satisfied by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of a neutral psychiatrist. 

   

 

 

            

So if it was all that clearly established, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was not understood by -- in the very case that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argued here, and that on remand, according to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent at least, the lower courts held a neutral 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

psychiatrist is good enough. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, but whether or not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Oklahoma court got it right or wrong when the case was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remanded, what -- what clearly established, we believe, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

starts and ends with this Court, whether something is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established. 

 

            

And when the Court says, where it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant factor, you have a right to an expert and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then goes through the things that that expert is going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do to gather facts for the defense, to analyze facts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the defense, to even assist in cross-examination of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State's expert witness, you can't get more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intimately involved in the defense of the case than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being involved in the cross-examination of witnesses for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the prosecution. 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we're told here that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- that the -- the prosecution didn't have a

partisan expert either, that there was this -- everyone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

who was appointed was a neutral expert serving the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, the prosecution, and the defendant. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think, roughly, it suggests you're 

   

 

 

 

 

asking for something that the prosecution didn't have, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't have an independent expert. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, in -- in our case, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very much like Ake.  I mean, there were mental health 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experts who testified, but all of them are State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experts.  And --

  

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you mean by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"State experts"? 

 

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  They all worked --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Provided by the 

  

 

 

 

 

State or working for the prosecution? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  No.  They all worked for the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

State hospital.  And so, as a result, they were people 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

who -- the Lunacy Commission, which did the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examination, are three doctors at the State hospital 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that make an evaluation and then report to the court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you mean they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were paid for work by the State --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- as opposed to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

being -- working for the prosecution for a particular

result in a given case. 

   

 

 

7 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

but had there been an issue, which there was in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, and should have been litigated, certainly the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State has no problem having an expert.  The State can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retain an expert, can retain more than one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the right that was given in Ake was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very modest.  It was very modest.  It was an expert --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant can't choose the expert.  But -- and --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it's only one expert.  But it is an expert to at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least make the adversary system work, to some extent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think what the Court recognized, and I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think this goes to what Justice Ginsburg was asking me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about, is that mental health today, as the Court said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ake, experts vary widely with regard to, first of all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there is a mental illness.  Second, what it is, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the effects of it are on behavior, and how it plays 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the legal --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bright, even the 

  

 

 

 

 

terminology that you are using, both here and in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs, contains some ambiguity, because you keep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, well, Ake established the rights to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent expert.  But "independent" can mean, really, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the defense expert, or "independent" can mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent of both the prosecutor and the defense.

And what you are saying that Ake held was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

that it was a defense expert.  But -- and there are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly parts of the opinion that read like that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's no question that when Ake talks about assistance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over and over again, it reads like a defense expert. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But the question is, did Ake really preclude the idea of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a completely independent person, independent of both the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State and the defense? 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, it did, because of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way it described what the expert was to do.  And in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two places where the Court said, "we hold," they said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"we hold, when it is a significant factor, that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant is entitled to an expert."  That is with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regard to both the guilt phase issues and with regard to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the penalty phase issues. 

 

 

 

            

So I think the Court -- and then the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court isn't -- this is not one of these cases that has, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least in my opinion, a lot of ambiguity, because the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court could not have been more detailed or specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about what that expert was going to do.  So we get --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose you have a single, 

   

  

 

 

 

court-appointed expert, and let's assume he's not paid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the State; he or she is an outside expert.  Can that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert, ethically, under the ethical rules that apply to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

psychiatrists, meet just with the defense and say, now, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

you should be sure to do this, and then go meet just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

with the prosecution, or do both parties have to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present?  Do -- do you know what their ethical duties 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are in this regard?  I read the article by Dr. Stone and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't quite clear on this. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, I think the ethical duty 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is that you can't work both sides of the street in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  It's hard to imagine how that could ever work, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless you just want the opinion of the expert.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once -- what happens so often with people who start out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as neutral experts, is they become experts for one side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or the other, usually the prosecution. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you say --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  So --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- in your -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your reply brief in -- on page 1, you've got four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples where you say the language clearly shows that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were meant -- meant to be -- I don't know what the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word is, but you hope it's not partisan or nonobjective, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but aligned experts, I guess.  And the first one, they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are supposed to provide assistance that may well be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crucial to the defendant's ability to marshal his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense. 

            

Well, you can certainly understand the 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance being here is the diagnosis, this is what

rules are or this is -- you know, it doesn't necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

mean that they are going to be partisan in helping shape 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defense. 

 

            

The other one -- another one of the four you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say is that they're needed to translate a medical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

diagnosis into language that will assist the trier of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact.  Well, that doesn't entail partisanship of any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind.  It -- it's simply sort of a medical instruction. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

You know, this particular term means this, and then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer can go off and develop her defense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  But I don't think you can take 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

each one in isolation.  You have to look at all the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that the Court talked about.  It talked about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this person gathering information, organizing 

 

 

 

 

information, meeting with the defense about how this can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be used in the defense of the case, choosing among 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viable defenses.  It even talks about the person, as I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, talking to the lawyers about how you cross-examine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the prosecution's expert. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Bright, that is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

essence of this.  Another -- there is a lot of talk 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about independent, neutral, defense expert, but really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's at issue is what kind of aid a defendant is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to to mount a viable defense, correct?

MR. BRIGHT:  Correct. 

  

 

11 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so once there is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence -- and here, there was evidence at the last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moment -- that, in fact, as the prior experts have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testified that certain tests should be taken, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain signs of organic brain injury were present, once 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was confirmed, what the expert was saying to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court is now I need help. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because this expert 

  

 

 

 

is -- this court-appointed expert is telling us that all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these things really are irrelevant to my defense, but I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a viable claim that organic brain injury exists, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that it might have an effect and provide me with a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense.  So I need assistance in determining that, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

correct? 

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Exactly. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In what other area do we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit the State or a court to appoint -- to not fund an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert once there is viable evidence of a potential 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense? 

            

            

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  I -- I don't know of any. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

You mean with regard to mental health? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In the -- in any area. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  I mean, you look at Ford v. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Wainwright, where the Court looked at the question of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

whether someone was competent to be executed or not, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court found that there, the -- for the process to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work, you couldn't have what Florida had, which was just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept information from the State's doctors and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept information from the defendant's doctors. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And, of course, this Court found in Panetti 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v. Quarterman that that was a clearly established rule, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what was in Justice Powell's concurring opinion was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established rule about the procedures that were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be involved with regard to whether or not a person is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competent to be executed. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, I'm not sure that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you've answered Justice Kennedy's question.  He started 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with the observation that there is an argument.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know -- we know you don't accept it, you don't have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keep saying that -- that Ake was ambiguous. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If it was, what happens to your case?  How 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do you win?  How do you get to the point that this was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently clearly established at the time of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case so that it was an unreasonable application of law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the court below? 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  I -- I think to prevail under 

    

   

 

 

 

 

2254(d), we have to show that there was a violation of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established -- of a -- a Federal rule or a

constitutional rule that was clearly established by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision of this Court.  So I think that's what our --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we have to show, and Ake is what we have to show 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for that. 

 

            

            

And I want to say this --

   

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Bright, before 

  

 

 

 

 

you move on to that, you say it's clear.  The LaFave 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treatise on criminal law -- which I think is, if not the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most cited treatise in this Court, certainly one of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them -- this is a quote:  "Ake -- Ake appears to have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been written so as to be deliberately ambiguous on this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, thus, leaving the issue open for future 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration." 

            

So your position has to be that the LaFave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treatise is -- is wrong, it wasn't ambiguous at all --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, I --

   

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- it wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

deliberately ambiguous. 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  -- have the greatest respect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for Professor LaFave, but just like lower courts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

professors make mistakes, too. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they do, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your position has to be that LaFave made a mistake, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fifth Circuit made a mistake, eight State courts -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final State courts made mistakes, the -- on remand in

Ake, it was a mistake.  All of those things -- not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

saying whether you're right or wrong on the merits, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that body of authority that takes a different position 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would seem to me to establish that the question was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous, at least coming out of Ake, as opposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established. 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, I think whether a 

   

  

 

 

 

proposition is clearly established begins and ends with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court.  I think the ultimate question of whether it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was clearly established -- yes, this has been 30 years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since Ake was decided.  So, of course, there are going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be lawyers and judges, being what they are, there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be differences.  But I would point out the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight of the authority is certainly on our side --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Bright --

  

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  -- according to the Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

finding.  I'm sorry. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  As I understand your 

   

  

 

 

position -- and you'll correct me if I'm wrong -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem to be arguing that what the defendant is entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to is an expert who will function, more or less, like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the kind of expert who would be retained by the defense, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the defense were simply given funds to -- to hire an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert. 

            

Am I right in -- in thinking that? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

holds. 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, that's not what the case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But I -- but in terms of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what this expert would do, you'd want an expert who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would function more or less like that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, to -- I mean, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

prosecution can hire as many experts as it wanted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. 

  

 

MR. BRIGHT:  It can choose experts that will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

come out the way it wants.  If you're in Texas and you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to prove future dangerousness, doctors will testify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every single time they get a chance that the defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a future danger.  So you can hire that kind of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisan expert. 

 

            

I'm --

 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, well, that's what 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  But I --

   

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- that's what I'm getting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

at.  I don't see how an expert who is chosen by the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court and paid by the court can ever function in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything like that capacity for a defendant.  And one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

thing that is perfectly clear from the opinion in Ake, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that the court would pick the expert, and it's one --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court will pick one expert and that's it; the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense has to live with it.

16 

            

And I just -- if you could explain how that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of an expert can ever function like an expert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retained by the defense. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, it's no different than a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court-appointed lawyer.  I mean --

    

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  It is different from a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer, because a lawyer -- you know, a lawyer doesn't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

have to believe in the client's innocence.  The lawyer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a professional duty, within the bounds of -- of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

professional responsibility, to do everything that can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be done to advance the interests of the client.  But an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert who's going to write a report and is going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testify, presumably, if the person acts in good faith, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is going to give an honest opinion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Am I wrong? 

   

  

 

MR. BRIGHT:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So what would you say to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this court-appointed -- you -- you get one expert that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appointed -- what do you say to this expert?  Now, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't really want you to give your neutral opinion.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to give you -- I want you to give your most 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense-friendly opinion on this? 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  No.  But, I think, what the --

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

the court could have gone further.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But, Mr. Bright, why is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

MR. BRIGHT:  What?  I'm sorry. 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why -- why is it wrong 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to ask an expert that's been provided to the defense to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that? 

 

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, I think --

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- to say I have to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

defend this man, give me my best argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  I -- I think that's what 

    

   

 

 

 

lawyers do.  And I think --

   

  

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not lawyers, experts. 

  

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  Yeah, and experts.  I think we 

    

  

 

 

 

 

ask the expert to look at whatever information the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert has gathered, look at the defendant, examine the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant, all those sorts of things.  And, of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're looking for, hopefully, a favorable opinion, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that's not always going to be the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, no, I understand. 

   

  

 

 

That really wasn't my question.  I -- of course you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could ask the expert, you know, give me the -- give me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever is most favorable, give me advice that is most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable to my client.  But when it comes down to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving an opinion about whether the individual is sane 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or -- or something that's relevant to mitigation, I

don't see how you can ask the expert to do anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

other than to give the expert's honest professional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion. 

            

So it doesn't -- it's -- I'm having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficulty seeing how an expert who is appointed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court -- you get one -- could ever function that way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I -- I read the oral argument transcript in this 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, and there are several places in the oral argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transcript when -- where the court and the attorney for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ake equates an -- an expert who is appointed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court with a neutral expert.  And that seems to be what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that kind of an expert would be, a neutral expert, not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an expert who is really part of the defense team. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  But -- but the -- the expert 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described in the Ake opinion, Justice Alito, is someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who is a part of the defense team. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, this question of partisan came up, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of using the word "partisan."  Of course, parties, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it be the prosecution, whether it be a wealthy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal defendant, whether it be a wealthy civil 

   

 

 

 

 

 

litigant, are all going to hire partisan experts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're going to hire the experts that they think will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give them the opinion that will help their side of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.

MR. BRIGHT:  But --

  

 

 

19 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Did the -- did the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defendant ask for an expert?  On page 11 of their brief, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they quote the Respondents, these court of appeals, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which says that there is no indication in the record 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that McWilliams could not have called Dr. Goff, or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial court indicated that it would have considered a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion to present an expert.  But McWilliams says the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent chose not to file one. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And your brief on page 9 doesn't say he did 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask for an expert.  He wanted more time. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Did he ask?  He said, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Judge, please appoint an expert.  Did he? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Two things, Justice Breyer. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  Well, did he or 

  

  

 

 

 

 

didn't he?  Yes or no. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, what he did, and you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at what John Bivens, one of the lawyers said, right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

towards the end -- it was in the Joint Appendix at about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

207 -- where he made a long plea, you can almost see him 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on bended knee reading this, in which he said, we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received these records, which show he's on psychotropic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drugs.  We've received this report.  We don't know what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

these terms mean or what it's about.  We cannot 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

determine for ourselves what we have here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

sandbagged. 

            

And I'd point out, these lawyers were really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then he ended up by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, that is why we renew the motion for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuance. 

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  For an expert.  I mean --

    

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Does it say that?  Where 

  

  

 

 

 

 

did it say that?  I just don't see --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- where he said. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  -- if you read all the way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through, all the motions for a continuance, I mean, half 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the pages. 

 

            

appoint --

 

            

say --

 

            

that right? 

 

            

true --

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Did he ask the judge to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  He didn't come right out and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The answer is no, then; is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, no, I don't think that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. BRIGHT:  -- because I think everybody

need an expert and I need --

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where, somewhere else, does 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

it become apparent that he wants the State to appoint an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert?  Where?  I just want to know where. 

    

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, he says --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not seeing --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  -- over and over, we can't do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this without an expert. 

 

 

 

            

has --

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  But maybe he already 

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  We --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- someone --

  

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  -- need --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe he already has an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

expert.  They did have someone advising them. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, when the case goes up on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal to the court of criminal appeals, both the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Alabama and the defendant brief it on the merits of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ake claim.  The State argues he got everything he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to under Ake, a neutral expert.  He's not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to any more. 

 

 

 

            

The argument for -- on behalf of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. McWilliams was that he was entitled to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent expert. 

 

            

And the court of criminal appeals, when it

decided the case, said all he was entitled to was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert that he had or no expert at all, but to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these State experts examine him. 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

So that issue is crisply and clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented there.  It's presented in the district court. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's presented in the court of appeals.  And every court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has looked at this on the question of whether he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to an independent expert or not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

out --

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I -- may I point 

   

   

  

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- on page 211A, 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Soble does say, "I told Your Honor that my looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at these records were not of any value to me, that I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed to have somebody look at these records who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood them, who could interpret them for me.  Did I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not tell Your Honor that?" 

 

 

 

 

            

And shortly thereafter he says, "Your Honor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave me no time in which to do that.  Your Honor told me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be here at 2:00 this afternoon.  Would Your Honor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have wanted me to file a motion for extraordinary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

expenses to get someone?"  "The Court, I want you to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach with your client." 

 

 

 

            

            

And proceeded to sentence him; correct?

then, without any further -- and I'd point out this, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I was saying -- about to say a moment ago, all of this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

evidence came in in 48 hours, 48 hours before they get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first report from Dr. Goff, which is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neuropsychological examination, the day before they get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

records from the mental health -- the hospital, from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Taylor Hardin Mental Health Hospital. 

 

 

 

 

            

And on the day of -- he had been subpoenaing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the records from the prison since August, and this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

October 7th -- he receives those records on the morning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the hearing itself when he gets to court.  And now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's got two huge piles of records from the hospital and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the prison.  He's got a report using terminology 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that he doesn't understand, making findings that he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't understand.  And he says I need help.  We can't 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

possibly go forward in this case because we don't know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we have. 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose --

  

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  We know we have something. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the Judge, the 

  

 

 

 

 

court, appoints the head of the psychiatric department 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at a distinguished private university, one person, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

he comes in and he tells the defense counsel, now I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to explain to you what all these terms mean. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are lots of tests.  I'll tell you about each of

these tests.  And I'm going to have the same meeting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

with the prosecution later on.  You can ask me anything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want and then I'm going to testify.  I'm not sure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what my opinion is yet, but I'll give my opinion.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here -- here's the basis for -- for my opinion, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want you to ask any questions you want about what these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tests mean. 

 

            

            

            

            

            

Is -- is that sufficient? 

 

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  That's not sufficient --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. BRIGHT:  -- because --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you say that there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

always a conflict of interest unless the psychiatrist 

   

 

 

 

 

 

works for the defending -- for the defense only. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  No.  Not necessarily a conflict 

   

  

  

 

 

of interest.  But what Ake stands for is two things, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really -- the adversary system.  The Court talks about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making it possible for the defendant to present his case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the adversary system.  It's a minimal ability. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

He doesn't get a partisan expert.  He doesn't get to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

choose the expert, but he gets a competent expert to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give whatever advice that expert can give to him as he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prepares his defense and as he prepares to deal with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution case.

for your interpretation of -- there are two paragraphs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

on page 85 which talk about Smith v. Baldi, which was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case --

 

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- where there was, in fact, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a neutral expert.  And -- and -- and the court talks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about why it doesn't have to pay attention to Smith v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Baldi.  I'm just curious as to what your interpretation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these paragraphs are, because -- well, I'll just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave it like that. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, I think it was giving 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Baldi -- Smith v. Baldi a respectable burial is what it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boils down to, because the court says we're in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental disagreement and points out that Baldi is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case that comes from 1953.  At the time that case was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided, there wasn't even a right to counsel for -- for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants.  So the court says this is of another time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and other variables and, therefore, it's -- it's not --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keep us from -- from facing -- taking on this issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about --

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But, counsel, if we could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just follow up on that.  Doesn't it imply that a neutral 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert would be permissible? 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  No.  I think it says that was 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

the old days.  Those were the horse-and-buggy days, or

almost there, and this is today.  And today, mental 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health is hotly contested.  It takes experts on both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sides.  And for the defense to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Where -- where is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

stopping point, then?  Because common law history, our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tradition is that often courts could apply and appoint a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neutral expert of its own choosing.  If the defense now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a right to a particular kind of expert, partisan 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

expert --

 

            

I'm sorry. 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  It's not a partisan expert. 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, if I might just 

   

  

 

 

 

finish, and then you can tell me where I've gone off the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rails. 

            

Where's the stopping point?  Is it just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

psychiatry?  Would we also have to apply the same rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in other kinds of medicine, perhaps?  Forensic science? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where is the stopping point that you would advocate for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court? 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, I wouldn't advocate it 

   

  

 

 

 

because it's not before the Court in this case.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But it would be something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we'd have -- an implication we would clearly have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider. 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Well, but -- but the thing that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the Court has to consider here is the unique nature of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mental health and the fact that experts widely disagree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on mental health. 

 

 

27 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Experts widely disagree on 

  

 

 

 

 

everything.  That's why --

  

 

 

            

            

            

            

much. 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  And that --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- you hire them.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And why they cost so very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  And -- and many courts, State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts, other courts, have said and, of course, under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Criminal Justice Act in the Federal courts, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where there are other issues, there may be other experts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a due process question --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That's -- that's my other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question, is if due process requires a partisan expert, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

surely it would also require a partisan lawyer, in which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case what does the Sixth Amendment do?  Does it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantee the -- the right of effective assistance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel, it's just superfluous? 

 

 

 

            

MR. BRIGHT:  No, the Sixth Amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

guarantees a lawyer who will carry out their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

professional responsibilities in an ethical and legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way as they should.  And by the same token, an expert

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. BRASHER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Ake did not hold that a neutral expert fails 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to satisfy the Due Process Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let me talk about the psychiatric assistance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was provided in this case, because I think it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important to begin there.  So before the trial of this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case even started, the defendant made a motion for a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full psychiatric evaluation, specific to mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances that he was then going to want to put at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue at the penalty phase of the case.  And he was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluated for over a month by three psychiatrists and a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

psychologist for that purpose, for developing mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I thought 

    

  

 

 

that the three psychiatrists were part of the Lunacy

Committee. 

            

Honor. 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  That's correct, Your 

  

 

 

 

29 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And I thought that the 

   

  

 

 

 

purpose of the Lunacy Committee was to see if he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentally competent or not. 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  That's incorrect, Your 

  

 

 

 

Honor.  The -- the first motion that was presented by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant expressly asked for an evaluation with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to mitigating circumstances, and the Lunacy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commission report also addressed that issue of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating circumstances.  But the --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did that report suggests 

  

 

 

 

 

that further tests had to be taken with respect to that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  No, Your Honor.  That 

  

  

 

 

 

report suggested that there were no mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances on the facts of the -- of the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Then after the penalty phase, the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked for more psychiatric assistance.  They filed a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion for a full neuropsychological evaluation, 

   

 

 

 

including a specific series of psychological tests.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that motion was also granted.  That motion was granted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the same day it was filed, September 3rd, 1986, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was just a year or so after this Court had decided Ake. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then two experts did that.  There was an expert --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Sorry, General, but if we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

30 

could just focus on -- because I think it would help to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just sort of -- let's assume for the moment that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant did not get what he was asking for, which was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a defense expert, and say whether Ake entitled him to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such an expert. 

 

 

            

And I just want to sort of focus on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money sentence in Ake, you know, what -- the "we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore hold" sentence.  And it says -- here's what we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold.  "We hold that when the defendant makes this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preliminary showing that mental health is going to be at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, the State must assure the defendant access to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competent psychiatrist who will assist in evaluation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preparation and presentation of the defense."  So assist 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense.  And, you know, recognizing that we're all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

smart people, and we can read any words, we can have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument that any words mean anything we say, still, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defense," doesn't that mean, like, you know, that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you -- that's the phrase you would use for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel, to assist in evaluation, preparation, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presentation of the defense.  It means somebody on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's side.

with two points, Your Honor.  The first is that I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

neutral experts are capable of -- of assisting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense in a way that an expert assists the defense.  An 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, they're capable in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sense that sometimes they might, but it's not what you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would -- this is -- I -- I guess I'm repeating myself, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but this is the language that you use when you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about, not somebody who sometimes might, and is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capable of, but who, in fact, will do so, to the best of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his ability, assist the defendant. 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  And -- and I think the way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

an expert assists the defendant is by translating a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical diagnosis into language that lawyers can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand.  The -- the Court says in Ake that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

psychiatrists gather facts and offer opinions.  And we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would submit that a psychiatrist who does what you ask 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them to do, who does the evaluations that you ask them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do, prepares the reports that you ask them to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prepare, they're assisting your defense, just like they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did in this case --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the word 

  

 

 

 

"assistance," you know, we use it -- we use it most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

often is, the defendant is entitled to the assistance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel.  Assistance of counsel doesn't mean neutral.

And this -- the one thing that stands out in this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the word assist the defense, assisting, adversarial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

The -- those at least are clues that what the decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

writer had in mind was assisting the defense, just as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer assists the defense. 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Well, if I could just 

   

  

 

 

 

respond to that, Justice Ginsburg.  I think the Court 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to evaluate the holding of Ake, in light of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts and the question presented in Ake, right?  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't a statute that we're interpreting, it's a judicial 

   

   

 

 

 

 

decision.  And the problem in Ake was not that there was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a neutral expert that had assisted the defendant.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem in Ake was that there was no expert that had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assisted the defendant at all --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But sometimes the Court goes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

beyond what the facts are, and sometimes -- you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes it issues a holding that's just precisely 

   

 

 

 

 

 

calibrated to the facts, and sometimes broader.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it seems that what we do is we look at the language, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we look at what the Court said, and said given what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court said, is this right clearly established. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I guess, again, just to repeat what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg said, I started counting up the word 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"assist" in this opinion and, frankly, I lost track. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

That every time this opinion talks about this, it talks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

about assisting the defense and assisting the defendant, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

including to cross-examine the prosecution.  It just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

seems that the premise of the entire opinion is you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the defense team. 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Well, there are -- there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are parts of the opinion that we would suggest that also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cut in our favor.  So, for example, the Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion of Baldi, I think, cuts in our favor, because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court does distinguish Baldi on the grounds that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neutral experts testified in that case.  Baldi was a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case where this Court affirmed --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, at first it does, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're exactly right.  And this is why I asked about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Baldi.  I find those two paragraphs incredibly 

    

 

 

 

 

confusing, because the first paragraph says, we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguishing it because there it was a neutral expert. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then the second paragraph says, anyhow, Baldi -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, it does -- it doesn't use the term overall, but a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower court would be crazed if it relied on Baldi after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that opinion. 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Well, I'll count 

  

 

 

 

"incredibly confusing" as a plus for me in a Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

habeas case, where the law has to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no.  Two paragraphs 

  

  

 

 

 

 

might be confusing, but the question is, what does the

opinion say, and particularly, what does the holding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

say? 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Right.  And -- and the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

other part of the opinion that we think counts in -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our favor is the part where the Court says, in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph that has this holding in it, that we're going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to leave it to the States to decide how to implement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this right. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I saw it, but what about 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the point that Justice Kagan raised.  She was quoting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the opinion.  Why do we have to get into an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument about whether they can be independent or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisan?  An expert should not be -- he should give his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

honest opinion.  That's what they're supposed to do. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why is that the right characterization?  Why not just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote from the opinion? 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  What -- what --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The defense has to have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

somebody who will conduct an appropriate examination, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defense.  And in case we're unclear what that means, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court previously said that that person, the object 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, is the insanity defense viable, present testimony to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that effect, assist in preparing the cross-examination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a State psychiatric witness.  So why do we have to

say more than?  That's the question.  And here it seems 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

to me that this defendant certainly did not get that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

help. 

            

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  He came in, they presented 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a -- a report, I've read pages from the report.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that report was apparently controversial.  And did the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant have someone to do cross-examination, help him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that, help him understand the report, et cetera, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that's the end of the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Right.  So if I could just 

   

  

  

 

 

 

address that, Justice Breyer. 

 

 

 

            

So just with respect to the timing, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant asked for this report, asked for a full 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

neuropsychological evaluation, and the court granted the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion.  And the defendant asked for that report to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided to the -- to the court before the judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing.  And that's when the report was provided --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what?  So what?  I'm 

  

  

  

 

 

 

sorry, I'm not being facetious.  I'm -- I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

literally, I'm -- I don't know the answer to that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So what?  Did he have a person who could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

look at the report, help him cross-examine, help him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand?  Now, who was that person?

It was exactly what --

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Mr. Goff? 

  

 

 

GENERAL BRASHER:  Mr. Goff, exactly. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  He didn't seem to be his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert.  He seemed to be a member of the State Lunacy 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commission.  I don't think he consulted -- did he 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

consult with the defense attorney before?  Did he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain to the defense attorney?  Et cetera, et cetera. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Just to be clear, he was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a member of the Lunacy Commission. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, all right. 

  

 

 

 

GENERAL BRASHER:  He was a -- he was the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

head of psychology at a mental hospital.  And Dr. Goff 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

also routinely testifies for criminal defendants in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine, fine.  I'm assuming 

  

  

 

 

 

he was a fine doctor. 

   

 

 

            

My question is, did he assist the defense in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cross-examination?  Did he assist -- of himself, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt it.  Did he assist in the preparation, the -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, these -- those four things that were listed?  Did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he or did he not?

GENERAL BRASHER:  There was no 

  

 

 

 

cross-examination. 

37 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And he was -- and why was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there no cross-examination? 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Because he was the defense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

expert.  I mean, this --

    

 

 

            

expert? 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because he was the defense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL BRASHER: 

 

  

JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

 

  

Right. 

Well, you usually meet 

 

 

 

with your expert and go over the testimony with care. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Did that happen here, or could that happen here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Kennedy --

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  It -- I -- Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and if he had met 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the prosecution, would that have been a violation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of -- of his ethical obligations? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Dr. Goff comes into the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case because the defendant files a motion for full 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

neuropsychological testing after the penalty phase of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial.  He wants to get those results to provide to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court. 

              

I mean, we submit that in Ake, this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said that the defendant has the right to get a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

psychiatrist to assist him, to put his mental health at

issue.  And here, the defendant wanted to put his mental 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health at issue for mitigating circumstances --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could he have been 

  

 

 

 

 

consulted by either or both sides privately to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prepare -- prepare the examination? 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  I don't think that there 

    

 

 

 

 

was anything prohibiting the prosecution from talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Would you -- would you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

object to the following disposition of the case:  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we say the issue is not partisan versus independent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The issue is whether the defense had assistance from a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

psychiatrist in the evaluation, preparation, and 

 

 

 

 

 

presentation of the defense, including cross-examination 

 

 

 

 

 

of hostile or State psychiatric witnesses.  That's what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ake provides.  That's clear.  And what we want you to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do, court of appeals, is decide whether that was so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  I -- I think that we -- I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

would suggest that the right way to -- to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Would you agree with that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

or not? 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Well, I -- I agree with it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

except for this one caveat --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You do agree with it.

caveat, which is that this is a Federal habeas case, so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question would be whether the State courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

unreasonably applied --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If they did not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL BRASHER:  -- the holding in Ake --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  If they did not give the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they did not give him psychiatric assistance and pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for it, a psychiatrist who would have done those four 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that I just mentioned, then they did violate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established law --

 

 

 

            

            

says. 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  But --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- because that's what Ake 

  

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL BRASHER:  But my -- my point is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

though, Your Honor, is that the question under Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas laws is whether the State court unreasonably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied the law.  That was the second question presented 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the cert petition from Mr. --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Brasher, I thought the 

   

  

 

 

 

question on which we granted cert was whether somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the status of Dr. Goff sat -- whether it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established that somebody with the status of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr. Goff did not satisfy Ake, not whether Dr. Goff, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given his status, did the things that he was supposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do under Ake.

40 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  That's exactly right, 

  

 

 

 

Justice Alito.  And my point was that that was the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second question presented in the cert petition.  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer's question was the second question that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't grant cert on. 

 

 

 

            

To talk about the question that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did grant cert on, I do think it's important that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue wasn't presented in Ake because this is a Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas case, and this is the first time that anyone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representing a State or the Federal government has been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to stand here and argue that a neutral expert 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually does satisfy the Due Process Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And we would submit that the way Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas is supposed to work in this area is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States sort of get a first shot at the -- the Supreme 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court to -- to argue our position. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there -- is there any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction that holds that today, that all that Ake 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires is a neutral expert?  I thought by now every 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction recognizes that Ake requires an expert who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be, essentially, part of the defense team. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Well, this issue really 

  

 

 

 

 

has been mooted over the last 30-some-odd years because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of statutory changes.  So there are -- there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions that have reversed their previous cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

because --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Including -- including 

  

 

 

 

41 

Alabama, am I right, that in 2005, the Alabama Court of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Criminal Appeals said Ake made it clear that an indigent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant is entitled to an independent expert devoted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to assisting his defense, not one providing the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information or advice to the court and prosecution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  That's correct.  But what 

  

  

 

 

 

we would submit is what these lower courts are doing is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are extending this Court's precedent to address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this question.  And we don't have to really address this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here because this is not a direct appeal case.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question in this case is not whether Ake should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extended to say that a -- a neutral expert doesn't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy the Due Process Clause.  The question in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case is whether Ake held that.  And we would submit that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ake says nothing about independent --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if Ake says that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a right to meaningful assistance from a -- from a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

psychiatrist, you, the defense, and then over time it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes clear to us that that psychiatrist must be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must -- must be retained for the benefit of the defense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only, is that a new clearly established holding, or is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it simply a refinement of a clearly established right 

   

   

 

 

 

 

that was set forth in Ake?

The -- the Petitioner's counsel didn't seem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

to want to embrace that.  So then if -- gave us the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impression that if it's ambiguous, he loses, but I'm not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure that's the case. 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Well, I think the reason 

   

  

 

 

 

my -- my friend didn't want to embrace that is because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you use the word "refinement," I think what you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting, Justice Kennedy, is extension.  And this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court has said that you can't extend a precedent in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of Federal habeas.  And that really is what my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend is suggesting, is that this Court should extend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the actual holding of Ake to embrace this new right that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says that a neutral expert is insufficient. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What was the case where we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said that?  I think you're right. 

    

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  The Court said -- is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in White v. Woodall, the Court said that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I should also point out that there's --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But again, General, I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

the actual holding of Ake calls for assistance in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the 

 

 

 

 

 

defense.  And the theme of Ake, if you will, is all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about how we used to think that psychiatric opinions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were just like one thing, but now we know better.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know that different psychiatrists have different

opinions, and it's really important to arm even an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

indigent defendant with the tools that he needs to come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back at the State and to say -- and to say -- and to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish what he wants to establish about his mental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health. 

              

I mean, that's really the theme of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion, that you have to give the indigent defendants, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just as you give the wealthier defendant, the tools that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they need to establish what they want to establish about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mental health.  And then that's consistent with the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with these words that are repeated in the holding and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elsewhere. 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Well, to go to the issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of wealthy and indigence, this Court did say, in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote, that it was reserving that question.  It was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not talking about the Equal Protection Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no.  And it's not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

taking about parity.  All it's saying is that we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize that the State is going to have experts, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize that if you had money you would have experts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we recognize that mental health is one of those things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that people can have different opinions about, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people would really like to have experts.

GENERAL BRASHER:  And our point, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Kagan, is just that this question presented in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, which is about whether a neutral expert can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy that, was not at issue in Ake --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It seemed in the defense --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, here, what about this.  Are you saying this?  "The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant should be entitled to one competent opinion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the psychiatrist who acts independently of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor's office."  That's, I think, what you're 

   

  

 

 

 

arguing. 

              

I mean, it's a trick question. 

   

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because, of course, I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

quoting from the dissent. 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And what the dissent says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is that is precisely what the Court doesn't hold.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wish they would.  I've written dissents like that, too. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We all have.  But if it's a dissent and you say that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't what the Court holds, that's at least some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that that wasn't what the Court held.

former Justice Rehnquist in that case dissented for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

three reasons, really, on this issue.  The facts was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most of his dissent.  He said that this is a situation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where no expert assistance was required at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And he also said that this entire discussion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was dicta.  And then, of course, he does have this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase where he says that you shouldn't be entitled to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense consultant on opposing view.  But we would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggest that his dissent is no more dispositive than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief Justice's concurrence in that case, which took a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very limited view of Ake. 

 

 

 

 

            

And ultimately, the way you interpret what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is clearly established under one of this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holdings is you look at the facts of the case and you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at the question presented, and there's just no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute that on the facts of Ake, the problem was that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he did not get any expert assistance at all --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, that just has to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong as a statement of how we figure out what clearly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established is.  We don't look at the facts in the QP, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we look at the holding. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  This is what the holding 

  

 

 

 

 

 

says.  You're entitled to somebody who will assist you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in evaluating, preparing, and presenting your defense.

GENERAL BRASHER:  Well, with respect, 

  

 

 

 

46 

Justice Kagan, this is what the Court said in Lopez 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about how you evaluate this issue.  The Court said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote -- I'm sorry -- the Court said, you look at, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote, "the specific question presented," end quote, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case, and you see whether it's come up again. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so the specific question presented here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is about whether a neutral expert can satisfy the Due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Process Clause.  That wasn't presented in Ake. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And just to be clear, in Ake, there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion filed for a psychiatric evaluation for sanity at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time of the defense, and that motion was denied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the motion that was filed here for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

psychiatric evaluation for mitigating circumstances, the 

 

 

 

 

 

two motions, both before trial and the full 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

psychological evaluation after the penalty phase, both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were granted. 

 

            

            

--

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Brasher --

  

 

 

 

GENERAL BRASHER:  And that's the dispositive 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Brasher, one piece of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence about what a holding means is what the parties 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask for in an adversarial system, where parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally control the outcome of cases, in terms of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues presented.  And in Ake, as I understand it,

defense counsel asked for either a partisan expert or a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

court-appointed expert.  Would have been satisfied with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

either one. 

 

            

            

Is my understanding wrong? 

 

 

 

GENERAL BRASHER:  That's -- that's exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

right.  And the fact that that motion was denied led 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court in italics, in the opinion, to say, quote: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"There was no expert testimony for either side on Ake's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanity at the time of the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That would be quite 

  

 

 

 

 

something, I have to say, General.  If we say:  Listen, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

when you read our opinions and when you try to figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out what we're saying, what you have to do is go back to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the QP and just narrow it to exactly what the QP said. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think that that would be a shocking way to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret this Court's opinions. 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Well, just to be clear, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan, I'm not saying you look at the cert. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition itself.  I'm saying you look at the question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented on the facts of the case.  Because, once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again, we're not doing statutory interpretation.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

effort here is not to determine the intent of the author 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Ake.  The question here is to determine what Ake 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established. 

 

            

And just the way you interpret judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

opinions has to be in light of the facts of the case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

and the question that's actually presented in the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because this is the first time that someone from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State has been able to make this argument to you, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it was not presented in Ake at all.  The State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Oklahoma --

 

 

            

            

actually --

 

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I --

   

  

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Maybe what the parties 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Ginsburg. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One -- one facet of this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case you presented as -- as -- the defense is asking for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a defense-oriented expert.  And you said that there was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no such expert for the State.  But I think the opinion 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself says that:  Before the sentencing judge, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor relied on the testimony of State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

psychiatrists who had testified at the guilt phase, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he was dangerous to society. 

 

 

 

 

            

So the judge -- before the judge imposed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence, is looking back to the guilt phase where there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were experts for the State, not independent, whatever, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were called by the prosecutor to testify to future 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dangerousness. 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Just to be clear, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg, are you talking about the facts of Ake, or the

facts of this case? 

 

 

 

49 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm talking about the 

  

 

 

 

 

facts of Ake. 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  Right.  Yes, Justice 

  

  

 

 

Ginsburg. 

            

So -- so in that case, one of the issues at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capital sentencing was that the State actually put the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's mental health at issue as an aggravating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance.  So this Court knows that the way capital 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment works is it's the State's burden to prove an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating circumstance, and if State doesn't meet that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden, then the defendant isn't eligible for the death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty. 

            

And in Ake, the problem was that the -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the State used psychiatric testimony to meet its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden to make the defendant eligible for the death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty, and the defendant didn't have any -- any way to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rebut that, because the defendant's motion had been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied. 

            

Here, once again, the defendant was trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to put his mental health at issue.  He was trying to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raise it as a mitigating circumstance.  There is no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

issue of future dangerousness in this case, because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating circumstances that made Mr. McWilliams 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible for the death penalty --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I -- I'm not asking about 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that particular issue, but I thought that the sentencing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge now, after the guilt phase, is looking to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony that was given at the guilt phase by experts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who were prosecution experts, not neutral experts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL BRASHER:  I'm so sorry.  Is that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

in -- is your question about Ake? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 

  

 

GENERAL BRASHER:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is all in Ake. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL BRASHER:  Yes.  So -- so they were 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

not prosecution experts; they were experts that were --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that had evaluated the defendant for competency to stand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial.  They -- there -- there was no evaluation ever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done for the defendant's sanity at the time of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense.  And that was a key fact in Ake, because that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the issue that the defendant wanted to raise.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue wanted to raise his mental health with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his sanity at the time of the offense.  And because his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion was denied, although Mr. McWilliams's motion was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

granted, in Ake, his motion was denied, and he couldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put that issue in front of the court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here, the -- the motion was granted, so he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was allowed to put that issue in front of the court.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had a full neuropsychological evaluation, and the judge

at sentencing looked at that report as part of his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluation. 

              

I just wanted to mention one thing that goes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to the timing issue, which is this argument from my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend that there was some kind of sandbagging with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to these records from the department of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department of Health.  The only thing that he has ever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested was relevant in those records was the specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prescriptions that the -- Mr. McWilliams was -- was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting at -- at the Department of Corrections.  But the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer for Mr. McWilliams knew about those drugs well in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advance of this hearing. 

 

 

 

            

If you look at page 269 of the trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transcript, well in advance of trial, counsel for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. McWilliams talks about the drugs that his client is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting. 

            

Actually, if you look at the Joint Appendix 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on page 191A, you'll see that the lawyer for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. McWilliams actually shows up to -- to the judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing with articles about the specific drugs that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his lawyers -- I mean, that his client is being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prescribed.  So he knew about this well in advance of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hearing. 

 

            

And another way to evaluate this issue is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that on post-conviction review, you know, 20-some-odd

years after this conviction was -- was done, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. McWilliams got to hire a partisan expert.  He got to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search the country for the best partisan expert, and he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

hired Dr. Woods, an expert from California.  And -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his analysis of this was just that Mr. McWilliams had --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was bipolar.  He didn't draw anything significant out of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those records that would lead to a change in the -- in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ultimate outcome here. 

 

 

 

              

I mean, ultimately, this case has been 

 

 

 

 

 

pending for over 30 years.  And -- and part of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why Congress said that under Federal habeas, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're going to require clearly established law at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time of the State court's decision, is because we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed to look at this not, you know, through 2017 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eyes; we're supposed to look at this through the eyes of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State court that had to evaluate this issue in 1991. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that, we submit, is why the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all these lower courts were saying that neutral experts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could satisfy the due process clause is important, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because --

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No that's true.  There have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

been a lot of lower courts, a lot of smart judges have 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read Ake and they found it ambiguous.  And I wonder if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this may have been what went on in their minds.  We know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's -- what was going on in Ake because we have

written opinions like that, and we have joined opinions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like that.  This is an opinion that is deliberately 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous, because there was probably disagreement among 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the members of the majority about how far they wanted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go. 

            

            

Do you think that's a reasonable hypothesis? 

   

 

 

 

 

GENERAL BRASHER:  I think that's a very 

    

   

 

 

reasonable hypothesis.  And I think one way -- one way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that hypothesis has some merit is that, when this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precise issue about neutral expert versus partisan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experts came back up to this Court in Granville, where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was directly presented, this Court didn't grant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certs.  And, instead, Justice Marshall was writing a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissent from the denial of the cert. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I see that my -- my light is on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Unless the Court has any further questions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll just wrap up and say that this case has been going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on for over 30 years.  This Federal habeas case has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually been pending for over about 14 years now, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we would respectfully request that the Court affirm the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court of Appeals. 

 

 

            

Thank you. 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice. 

MR. BRIGHT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think with -- with regard to this question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about extension, I think what really has happened here 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is refinement, that Ake was decided in 1985.  That's 30 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years ago.  There has been some refinement of it.  As --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as was pointed out, almost everybody today -- this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just not a controversial issue, because -- and I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

because of Ake you now have, as the amicus brief for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public defender showed, almost in every State that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either that's done in-house in a public defender office 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

so you don't even go before a judge and ask for an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert.  You just go and get it from your boss, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a budget in the public defender budget for it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In other places they have done it in other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways, but most people, including, as Justice Ginsburg 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed out, the State of Alabama courts have come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around to the view.  And -- and in -- in Morris v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State, the Alabama court said:  It is clear that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must be an expert independent of the prosecution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

De Freece case, De Freece v. State, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, regardless of what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Granville held, said:  This can't be right, what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Granville held, this -- in order for this to work in the

adversary system. 

 

55 

            

And I think that's what we come back to at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the end on this case, is the proper working of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adversary system.  And this certainly doesn't put the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense in an equal position with the prosecutor, not by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a long shot, but it at least gives the defense a shot, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least gives them one competent mental health expert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they can talk to, understand what the issues are, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present them as best they can.  And one of the things it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says is that that expert may very well testify for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense. 

            

So we're talking about everything from 

 

 

 

 

 

gathering information, to organizing it, to preparing or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding on the defense to be used in the case, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coaching the -- or advising the lawyer about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross-examination, to actually testifying. 

 

 

 

            

And this is like with Strickland v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Washington.  And -- and the statement that was made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, in this Court in two cases, in Wiggins v. Smith 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Williams v. Taylor, looked at the rule.  That is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there had to be an investigation that was clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established in Strickland, and then applied it to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lack of investigation, different kind of investigations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for different things, in Smith and in Williams v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Taylor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If you prevail, it would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be a new sentencing hearing, right?

over. 

            

            

MR. BRIGHT:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yeah, because guilt is 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BRIGHT:  Yes, that's true. 

  

 

 

 

Otherwise, if there are no questions, I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask the Court to reverse.  Thank you.
