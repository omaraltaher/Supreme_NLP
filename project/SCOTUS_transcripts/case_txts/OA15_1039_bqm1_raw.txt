CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first this morning in Case 15-1039, Sandoz v. Amgen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Before we get started, Ms. Maynard, 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms. Maynard and Mr. Waxman, the Court has decided to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give each of you five extra minutes, and you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed, Ms. Maynard, when you're ready. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD 

 

 

 

 

 

         

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 15-1039 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MAYNARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The Biosimilars Act created a comprehensive 

   

 

 

 

and self-contained scheme for the early resolution of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent disputes.  Regardless of the actions an applicant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

or sponsor take along the way, the end result is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same, patent litigation.  Courts should apply that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

comprehensive scheme as written.  They shouldn't look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

elsewhere for consequences. 

 

 

            

I'd like to start with the issue in Sandoz's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition, our petition, the notice of commercial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marketing issue, and then turn to the issue in Amgen's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition, the -- the information exchange. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Federal Circuit misread the notice of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

commercial marketing provision to provide sponsors a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

180-day automatic stay that's nowhere in the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That ruling will wrongly delay the marketing of every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biosimilar, even when there are no patent rights left to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you tell me, suppose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that in year 2 of the 12-year exclusive period, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application for the biosimilar is made.  And then in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year 4, there is eight more years to run, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commission -- the FDA decides that it's going to approve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  Is it licensed at that time? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or is it not licensed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

until the very end of the 12-day period. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  The FDA cannot license a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

biosimilar until the end of the 12-year period.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and actually, a sponsor can't apply for a biosimilar 

   

   

 

 

 

 

license until year 4, at the end of year 4.  As a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical matter, though, Justice Kennedy, it takes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eight to ten years to develop biosimilars, so it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be very rare. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If it's done in -- if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approval is done in year 6 or year 7, is that announced 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

publicly, that -- that the approval is done? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  The statute prohibits the --

the -- the FDA from making an approval effective, and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

and that's in -- in the statute, Your Honor, at (k)(7). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's the exclusivity provision that you're referring to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It prohibits the FDA from making the license effective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until 12 years have run.  That's the exclusivity period. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  They --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you clarify?  Does 

  

  

 

 

 

that mean that the FDA can't announce its intent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approve on year 12 plus 1 earlier than year 12, or --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm not quite sure I understand. 

   

 

 

 

            

How long does it take for the FDA to approve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the biosimilar?  Assuming you go through Phase I, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is -- and Phase II has been finished.  How long --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those run independent of the FDA approval, correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  That's right.  The information 

  

  

 

 

 

exchange and the patent litigation process is completely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate and de-linked from the FDA process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how long -- I want 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you to go back to Justice Kennedy, but I just want to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get a sense of timing.  How long does it generally take 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the FDA to say, this is okay effective 12 plus 1? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  So two points about that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor.  To answer your question, the FDA has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said that it takes about -- they are aiming to try to

application.  But there's nothing in the -- this Act, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrast to the Hatch-Waxman Act, that expressly allows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the kind of tentative approval that I think both of you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are asking about. 

 

 

            

And I think you may be asking about the --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the fix that the Federal Circuit suggested for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the problem they've created in the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no. 

  

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  No.  Okay. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm trying to get the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

process down. 

 

            

            

            

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It takes them 10 months. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume you put in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

an application in year 4.  Do they have to wait until 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when to announce that it's okay? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  They can't -- under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute, under (k)(7), they can't make it effective. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They can't make the approval effective until year 12. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When do they tell you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that they will? 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Well, there -- there's nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in the statute that calls for an approval before year

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, do they get a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

8 

phone call?  They say, hey, good news, we've got it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approved, but in five years, we're going to be able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market.  I mean, how does it work? 

    

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. MAYNARD:  No, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then --

  

 

 

 

  

incidentally, 

when you're talking about (k), is this in -- can you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give me the citation and the appendix to the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, Your Honor.  So I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

looking at -- it's in the blue brief --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right. 

  

 

MS. MAYNARD:  -- at 24A. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  24A.  Thank you. 

  

  

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  Exclusivity for reference 

  

 

 

 

from, and it says:  Effective date of biosimilar 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

application approval.  The approval of an application 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under this subsection may not be made effective by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Secretary until the date that is 12 years after the date 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on which the referenced product was first licensed under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection (a).  That's the reference product, 

  

 

 

 

 

biological sponsor. 

 

            

So the statute does not allow the FDA to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approve the biosimilar until year 12, until the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusivity period has run.  The statute also does not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

expressly allow any tentative approval, unlike the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

Hatch-Waxman Act, which does say you can call in advance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and say you're -- you're tentatively approved. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But even in the Hatch-Waxman Act, the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- the government doesn't consider it licensed, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the word in the statute in the marketing provisions --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

question --

 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I have one more 

    

   

 

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- and then I'll -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then I'll subside.  It seems to me that this process, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this aspect of the process cuts against you insofar as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 180 days' notice. 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  I'm not sure I understand the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

premise of your question, Justice Kennedy. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if -- the -- the 180 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

days has to run from some time, and it seems to me that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it has to run from the time that it's licensed --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

telling me. 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- based on what you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  No, Your Honor.  So I'd like 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

to turn to the text then of the Notice of Commercial

already noticed about.  What does this notice say?  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what it says is that you have to provide more -- no

Now, how could you do that if you don't know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the product licensed is? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And I take it that they had 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in the agency -- this goes to an agency, doesn't it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I have -- in the agency, they have the authority to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, we will license this provided it's made this way, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but not that way; provided you do this kind of a check, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but not that kind of a check.  They have a lot of power 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over what is licensed. 

 

 

 

            

So how can you provide notice -- by the way, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe that isn't what notice means.  Maybe it just means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice that you will commercially market X, or maybe it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means some combination thereof.  The reason that I point 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to that ambiguity -- which, to me, is a crucial

ambiguity -- and it has to do with both your arguments, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

indeed, all of them on both sides.  There is an agency 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, isn't there? 

 

 

            

            

MS. MAYNARD:  The FDA.  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, we are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

being asked to interpret very technical provisions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I find somewhat ambiguous and am operating in a field I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know nothing about.  But it's going to have huge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implications for the future.  So why isn't the way to go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about this case to ask the agency to issue some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations?  Then when we see their interpretation, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all will be able to argue that their interpretation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceeds the statutory delegation.  And by doing that, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have a better picture. 

   

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Well, I think, Your Honor, to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

take the text, which is where I think the Court should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look for the answer to this question --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

   

 

Oh? 

MS. MAYNARD:  -- on page 39A. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, I've got it. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  -- of the blue brief, is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Notice of Commercial Marketing Provision. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

   

 

Yeah. 

MS. MAYNARD:  And it says, as you read:  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection (k) applicant shall provide notice to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

12 

referenced product sponsor not later than -- so the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So --

  

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  -- not later than 180 days 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the date of the first commercial marketing.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 180 days, Justice Breyer, modifies the date of first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial marketing. 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, yeah, that's true. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  Because of that --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Provide the what?  What is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

it you're to provide notice of? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Of the biological product 

  

 

 

 

 

licensed under subsection (k).  But this statute uses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that phrasing to describe the biosimilar. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you just -- but you've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just said in answer to my question that the license 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't happen until 12 years plus 1. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Well, the license can't happen 

  

 

 

 

 

 

until 12 years plus 1, Justice Kennedy, but, like, right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now and for years to come, the exclusively period has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already run.  And so when applications are made, as it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was here, we expect it to be licensed within 10 months 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of application and were, in fact, licensed.  So when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sandoz gave the notice here and said we expect to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

licensed in the first quarter, second quarter of next 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year, Sandoz was licensed.

So if the -- if your questions earlier, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy, were getting to does the applicant have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an idea how its application is faring, does the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant know when to expect it's going to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approved, the answer to that is yes.  And Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't show any concerns with litigation too early. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So to your purpose question, Justice Breyer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the purpose of this statute is to allow early resolution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of patent --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But Justice Breyer's 

  

 

 

 

 

question was about agency regulations. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's right.  Thank you. 

  

  

 

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  Well, with -- with respect, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice, the United States is here explaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its reading of the statute and agrees with our reading. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oddly enough, I -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

would -- I would find an explanation far more convincing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a layperson, if, in fact, there had been notice and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comment proceedings before an expert agency, which, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, having heard all the different views on what that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word "notice" means, and having figured out whether if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we allow day one notice, what's going to happen is we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to gut the possibility of people going in and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making these exchanges, because everybody will be free

and start bringing declaratory-judgment actions.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

somebody will make that argument, somebody will make the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite, and we'll know what we're doing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

            

            

just said. 

 

            

So -- so that's the --

 

 

 

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  Well, we --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- same thing the Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. MAYNARD:  Well, we -- we know -- we know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two things from the text of the statute, though, Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  One is that the 12-year exclusivity period was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set by the Congress and said the FDA can make a license 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective at the 12-year point.  If the Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's reading is right, that license is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective, not effective in any case, even when there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are no patent rights until 12 1/2 years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I go back to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

beginning of Justice Breyer's question.  He made an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption that until the approval of the product, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other side won't know exactly what it is that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be approved, particularly in a situation like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, where you -- you've kept your application from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them so they don't have it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Take -- address that issue.  In your brief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you say they can get it.  They can get it from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

industry, from the SEC filings, from -- from FDA talk,

all of that stuff.  But that won't tell them exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what it is that you're intending to market. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

So -- or the other side -- how -- how would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know?  If you start a declaratory-judgment action, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

as you're entitled to do, wouldn't you know then? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Couldn't you get it in discovery? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Exactly, Your Honor.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

that's our point.  So -- so that's exactly the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence Congress provided when someone failed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide notice or doesn't provide the application. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So here, Sandoz didn't provide its 

 

 

 

 

 

application, as you note, and that allowed Amgen to sue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That -- there are two acts of artificial infringement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created by the statute, both of which are key to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding the whole point, which is to allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation based on the application.  It's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

application, just like in Hatch-Waxman, that 

 

 

 

 

 

crystallizes the controversy.  And so in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

situation -- and it provides two -- two acts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement. 

            

And if I can just point to them, they are in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

E(2)(c) of 271, so that's on page 5A.  One is in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance where the parties engage in the information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exchange, which applicants are highly incentivized to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do.  If -- if there's any fear of any patents that might

block their product, an applicant is going to go through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the information exchange, because it gives --

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could it -- could the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

company with the product file a declaratory-judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

action when they don't know what you're going to do?  Do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they have a good-faith basis for believing you're going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to infringe if they don't have the application to look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at until they get discovery? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, Your Honor.  So --

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Tell me how. 

  

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Okay.  Well, first I want to 

   

  

  

 

 

 

say, Congress obviously thought they did, because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created, in the text, an artificial-infringement act for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that very thing. 

 

 

            

Two, and they're right.  By definition, a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

biosimilar is highly similar to the reference-product 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sponsor's product.  So a reference-product sponsor would 

   

  

 

 

 

have good-faith basis in that case to bring suit on any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent that covers its own product, or any patent that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covers a use of its own product. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it doesn't know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the specifics of the biosimilar.  I mean, by definition, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the biosimilar is similar; it's not identical.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not it infringes might have something to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the ways in which it is different.

17 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  It might, Your Honor.  But the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

question is whether or not you have a good-faith basis 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to sue.  And given the standard of highly similarity and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the kind of similarities there have to be, if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sponsor has any patent that covers its product, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product itself or any uses of the product, it would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a good-faith basis to sue, which is exactly what Amgen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did here. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you're suing 

  

 

 

 

 

saying, this thing infringes our patent.  We don't even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know what "this thing" is. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  You know that -- that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant has submitted to the FDA using your data to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

produce a product that's highly similar to your product. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is the way this statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

works, Ms. Maynard, that if I have a valid patent, I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue? 

            

Kagan. 

            

MS. MAYNARD: 

 

  

Yes. 

  

Yes, exactly, Justice 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 

  

 
Is 

that it?  I mean, I don't 

    

   

 

know.  I'm asking. 

  

 

            

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Yes.  So if --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But just, is the practice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that given that these will all be similar, if I have a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid patent, I bring litigation?

MS. MAYNARD:  Right.  Exactly.  And Congress 

  

  

  

 

 

18 

provided for this exact situation in (e)(2)(C), which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on 5A of our blue brief, made an -- someone applying and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not providing the application within 20 days made that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precise act an act of infringement, and you would have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good-faith basis to sue, as they did here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You would not -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know if I agree with you on that.  But you would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to sue.  That's the problem; right?  What would the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent litigation look like?  I have this patent; you're 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

bringing this biosimilar; I'm going to sue you.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation would decide whether the biosimilar infringes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patent, and that would have something to do with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not it's sufficiently -- whether it's too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar or whether it's certainly distinct. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And what your argument means is that if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the patent Justice Kagan said, you have to sue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  No, Your Honor.

MS. MAYNARD:  No, Your Honor.  You don't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

have to sue.  I'm sorry if I misunderstood your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  All I was asking as a matter 

   

   

  

 

 

 

of practice, that, in fact, that's the way people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operate under this statute; that given the similarity of

these products, if I believe I have a valid patent, that 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

19 

the patent hasn't lapsed, I'm going to bring a suit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  That is exactly what Amgen did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  And I want to emphasize that in most situations, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicants will go through the process, because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information exchange and they have in those situations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So this is the only situation in which I'm aware 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  If the 

  

  

 

 

 

biosimilar files a notice of intent to file the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

application and a copy of the application, if it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

complies with all of the steps in Phase 1, does it estop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bio -- the -- the licensed product holder from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking a declaratory-judgment action? 

   

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, Your Honor.  And so if --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for -- until you get to a certain point in the process; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  So if the -- the way that it works is if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant does provide, so does participate in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information exchange, then they go through a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back-and-forth exchange. 

 

            

During that period of time, the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(l)(9)(A) bar -- if you'd like me to walk you through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, I can explain why -- so but the (l)(9)(A) bar would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bar anybody bringing declaratory action during that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exchange.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's assuming 

  

 

 

 

20 

good faith.  And that's the next question, which is if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- if the biosimilar doesn't comply, you're saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other side can sue.  But what happens if you do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply?  Can the other side -- and the other side fails 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, they -- they don't give you the notice that they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required to.  They don't do something that's required on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their part in that exchange process. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. MAYNARD:  This --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What is your biosimilars 

  

 

 

 

 

remedy in that case? 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  The statute provides powerful 

  

 

 

 

 

incentives for the sponsors to continue through the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process, Justice Sotomayor. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All incentives have a 

  

 

 

 

 

way of failing.  Just look at our society. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. MAYNARD:  If --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So --

  

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Yes.  And I -- but the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

consequence if they -- if -- to answer your question, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- if the sponsor doesn't follow through on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information exchange and then doesn't file the (l)(6) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit, so (l) -- at stage (l)(6), it says the sponsor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall sue within a certain period of time.  If the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

sponsor doesn't bring that suit, it's limited in any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future infringement suit to reasonable royalties. 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

That's the provision in (e)(6)(A) of 271 on 8A. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think -- but this is one whole 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ecosystem.  It's complicated to be sure, but Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

took into account all of these situations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain the 

  

 

 

 

 

difference -- there are two rounds of patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement; right?  Round 1 and -- can you explain the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference between those two? 

 

 

 

            

And with respect to Justice Breyer's 

 

 

 

 

 

question, you started out by saying all of this is about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

early resolution of patent litigation.  So which would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be the agency that's involved?  Your answer was the Food 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Drug Administration.  What about Patent and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Trademark Office? 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Well, just to clarify to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- Mr. Chief Justice's questions and Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer's questions, Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe 

   

 

 

 

 

FDA would have -- or the patent office has rule-making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority to interpret these provisions.  So -- but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- the -- so I don't think that will solve the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  I think this is a statutory interpretation 

    

   

 

 

 

question.  And I think the text answers --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  But you don't

need -- you don't need explicit regulatory authority. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

There are many situations where you defer to an agency's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination that can have informal -- you know, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all know all that.  So -- so -- so I -- I would stick 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the idea of the FDA doing this first, but maybe I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't get there.  And if I can't get there, I'm stuck. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MAYNARD:  I think the text answers these 

    

 

 

 

 

 

questions that I'm being asked. 

 

 

 

 

            

May I go back and answer Justice Ginsburg's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

question about the -- the way that the two phases work? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First, Your Honor, there's not always two phases.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even if the parties engage in the information exchange, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it contemplates -- it gives the sponsor -- I mean, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant a great deal of control.  The applicant can 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

put all of the patents on the lists into that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  And if that happens, they -- there may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never be a need for a second litigation if there are 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

never any new patents. 

 

 

 

            

That's what happened in the Apotex case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's pending.  There are no patents left, yet Apotex 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is subjected to the 180-day bar of the notice of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial marketing provision. 

 

 

            

So -- and the purpose of the notice of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial marketing provision, Justice Ginsburg, is 

 

 

 

 

 

that it lifts the gate.  So once the parties go through

the information exchange, as Justice Sotomayor was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

suggesting, that creates a stay of any litigation except 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the ones the parties agree to.  The sponsor has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

great control over that first litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The point of the notice is to allow the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sponsor to litigate any other patents it might have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the exclusivity period runs out.  And the notice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does two things.  It does two things.  It lifts the gate 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to allow the sponsor to bring any declaratory-judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions.  And it also says, if appropriate, the sponsor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seek a preliminary injunction.  But, of course, if you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

file an early-enough declaratory-judgment action, you 

 

 

 

 

 

don't need a preliminary injunction.  It's a very 

   

   

  

 

 

powerful remedy that the statute has given to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sponsors. 

            

Mr. Chief Justice, I see I -- I'm already 

   

   

 

 

 

 

into my -- am I into my extra rebuttal?  If I --

MR. YANG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The Congress enacted a detailed process for 

   

 

 

 

 

early resolution of patent disputes through patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement litigation while FDA is evaluating a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biosimilar application.  The statute expressly 

  

 

 

 

establishes a series of procedural steps, and then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

specifies the consequences for both the applicant and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the sponsor if they fail to take the steps that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set you off the -- the (l) path.  And all of those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences address the timing and the scope of patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation. 

            

Those consequences, which are quite 

 

 

 

 

detailed -- we don't have the time to talk about all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them, but they're in the statute, they're in our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief -- are the exclusive consequences.  It would be --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would muck up the statute for courts to come in and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start policing each step of the (l) dance and then send 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the parties back.  The whole idea of this --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But Justice Breyer's 

  

 

 

 

question and my question is the same.  The FDA is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved in -- intimately, page 32A of the brief, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection (k) application information.  Not later than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 days after the secretary notifies the applicant that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the application has been accepted, the applicant shall

provide. 

            

Now, this -- this means that the agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives the notice for 20 days.  And it seems to me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

certainly, it would be within its authority, or it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a sensible thing for it to say -- and they have a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation -- if you don't do that and we've told you to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that, we're going to delay the review process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  I actually think it's not so 

    

 

 

 

 

 

clear.  If you compare this to the Hatch-Waxman Act --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I believe you had an opinion called Caraco about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that not so long ago -- that actually embeds the FDA in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the process of identifying patents.  It has the orange 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

book. 

            

This is quite a different process.  The FDA 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is involved with the licensure, but Congress at this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point separated FDA.  FDA was actually petitioned to do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some rule-making in this context and it declined to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so because of those differences.  So we ultimately still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are here --

 

 

            

            

statute --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Yang, do --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. YANG:  -- about a statute.  And the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do we have your 

  

 

 

 

 

assurances that this is the FDA's position? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  It is the FDA's position.  It is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the PTO's position.  We have --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Has it been a consistent 

   

  

 

 

 

26 

position in other situations?  I don't know if it gets 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

--

            

MR. YANG:  Yeah. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- opinion letters or --

  

 

 

 

 

 

or --

 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, they've not issued opinions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on how this works, so I don't know of anything that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent.  I believe --

    

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In any litigation, have 

  

 

 

 

 

they taken a different position? 

   

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  No, not that I know of. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Yang, you -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

indicate that (l)(9) is the exclusive remedy for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2)(A) violation. 

 

            

MR. YANG:  Close. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All right.  Well, let me 

  

  

 

 

 

 

know where I get it wrong, but -- or at least I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand that's the primary position of -- of your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side.  But Amgen sought relief under State law and --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I -- I didn't take -- take it that Petitioner argued 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption in any way, shape, or form.  So where does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that leave us?  (l)(9) might otherwise be the exclusive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- or almost exclusive mechanism, but what happens when

27 

we have a claim under State law that no one's argued is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted? 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, I believe Sandoz argued, at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

least in the court of appeals, that it was preempted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But putting that to aside, the Federal Circuit in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case deemed the State law claim for the injunction to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moot.  This is at page 24a and 25a of the Joint 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix.  It did so because it found a Federal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

injunction and imposed a Federal injunction to enforce 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the statute.  That's precisely what the Federal Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

made even more clear in the subsequent decision in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Apotex, and so where we are now is only on the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Federal remedy, if there is one, for failing to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give notice or failing to comply with the information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exchange. 

              

I will say that it --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That's certainly not 

  

 

 

 

Amgen's position, so --

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  I will say that there are -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think there are strong arguments that this would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted.  This is a highly detailed scheme.  And if 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

States were to start to interject different means of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcing it on a State-by-State basis, that might wreak 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

some havoc, but we've not taken a position on that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Exactly.

MR. YANG:  Here we --

  

 

 

 

28 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I agree with you, but the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

absence of any argument on preemption is what makes it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so curious. 

 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, the judgment below did not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest on the State law claim.  Again, if you look at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 24 and 25 is where it says it's moot, it rests on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal law. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but it rests on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Federal law cause of action that also might not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there.  And in terms of the preemption question, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to me that it's very hard to give a comprehensive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer to the questions presented without considering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether, well, thanks for your opinion on what Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law does, but, in fact, State law, you can get the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunction.  It's really asking us to put together a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

puzzle where a big piece is missing. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  I don't think State law is a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

piece of the puzzle.  Congress does not have the habit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of enacting comprehensive statutes and then allowing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States to fill it -- figure out --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it becomes 

  

 

 

 

 

part -- so are you arguing the preemption question or --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, we think there are strong 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments.  Again, we've not taken a vetted position on

that because it's not been, as the case comes to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

Court, what the case is about.  The case is about --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do you think the statute can function in the way you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing, even if there are injunctions?  Based on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law provisions? 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  Can the statute work?  I think it 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

would mess up the scheme that Congress -- because if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were to look at "shall," you know, there's -- there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eight subsections, that's clauses of -- of subsection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(l).  If at each stage a court is policing and saying, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no, no, no, you didn't give sufficient information, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't do that, you'd have a series of back and forth in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the scheme.  The whole idea is you go along a path, and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at certain points, if you don't do something, boom, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bump out, you're in litigation.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're asking us, 

  

 

 

 

 

assuming, just an assumption for the sake of argument, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we rule in your favor and say, as you've asked us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say, that a declaratory judgment is the -- that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only remedy available, and there is no Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunction that's possible here, do we vacate and remand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the court below to decide whether State law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides --

 

            

MR. YANG:  No, I think the best -- the best

way for the Court to decide is what's required under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

statute.  The cause of action, if you do that, you'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave open questions of State law and preemption.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cleanest way is just to resolve what the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires in the --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, so I say the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

statute says -- we say the statute says that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  If the statute --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What are we doing? 

  

 

 

 

 

We're saying the State law is moot? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  No, because there's no State law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  If you're complying with the Federal statute, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is no State law claim.  The State law would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

piggyback on the Federal law. 

 

 

 

 

              

I also want to address the question that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court had earlier about no -- you know, you have to know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's licensed in order to -- to identify your claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If it's not preempted, 

  

 

 

 

 

how would it be mooted? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  It would just fail, just like on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(l)(2), the Federal Circuit said, you're complying with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal law, therefore, you have no State law claim, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because your State law claim is predicated on violating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal law.  It would be the same for both.

31 

            

            

So the reason --

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that begs the 

  

 

 

 

 

question on the question we're not looking at, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

begs the question on point 2 -- on the first point which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, is it a requirement that the biosimilar applicant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

give over the application.  It is certainly a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement of the statute, the remedy may be file a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaratory-judgment action. 

 

            

MR. YANG:  And the exclusive remedy, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which would answer -- that would --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That goes back to 

  

 

 

 

 

preemption. 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, no, I think that would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

answer.  You would say that this is the -- your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complying with the statute is a mandatory condition 

   

 

 

 

 

 

precedent to continue on the path to take all of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

steps, but if you don't, and the statute provides an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

off-ramp, you're not violating the statute.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

contemplated that path. 

 

 

            

Now, on the question of licensure, remember, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to identify at the very beginning what all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patents are at the (l)(3) stage.  One of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences is, if the sponsor fails to identify the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patents on the list, the sponsor can never bring an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement action.  Period.  This is 271(e)(2) --

(e)(6)(A) and (B).  And so the -- the consequence is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if you get at the end and you're like, oh, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something is new, something I didn't think about, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you're -- you have no artificial infringement action, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the list has been established before. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That isn't the problem. 

  

 

 

 

 

The problem is you take her reading, there's language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supporting it, but you can read that word notice, gee, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you read it, tough, you can't work it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  Well, I think the --

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And now -- now, but that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the language. 

 

            

Now, look at the next one.  (B), okay, (A), 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or whatever that thing is.  Hey, once they give the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 2, the Section (2) notice --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- no declaratory actions, 

  

 

 

 

 

they're all frozen.  Ah, until you give the notice of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marketing. 

            

            

MR. YANG:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And so all we have to do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, number 1, day 1, they give the Section (2) notice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send them all the information.  On day 2, they give the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial notice, and all of a sudden everybody is free 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to give declaratory judgments.

MR. YANG:  That's right.

that's what it's supposed to be?  That's what it's

MR. YANG:  That -- that is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The system that was 

  

 

 

 

 

supposed to set up a -- a system, where you've put 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

tremendous incentives on people to negotiate and to work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it out in an orderly way, that you can just gut it by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply filing your commercial notice on day 2? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  There are strong incentives.  For 

  

  

 

 

 

 

instance, if the applicant doesn't give the information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in the forefront, the (l)(2) information --

MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

Congress did not create detailed procedures

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'll put a question 

   

  

 

 

before you, okay? 

 

 

            

As I understand -- I got your position, 

   

   

 

 

 

which is that they have to give notice after the FDA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approval, correct? 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  On the -- yes, on an (8)(A) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, they have to give --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wouldn't that stop Phase 

  

 

 

 

 

2 litigation from starting immediately?  By your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

definition, they could go the biosimilar and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license --

 

            

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Referenced product. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- product could go all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

through round 1.  They've now narrowed their dispute.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought round 2 involved disputes about other patents, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

not the ones that they narrowed.  And so wouldn't your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading always force round 2 into the post-license 

   

 

 

 

 

 

12-year period?  I thought the whole purpose of the

before the 12-year period was finished.

MR. WAXMAN:  No.  The whole -- the purpose 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

36 

of the statute, assuming that it's followed, that is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there -- that (2)(A) is complied with and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information exchange occurs, is to have all patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation concluded before commercial launch.  And that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is, in fact, what was said over and over again. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no.  You still 

  

  

 

 

 

 

haven't answered my question. 

 

 

 

            

up. 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I'm -- I'm just getting warmed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're assuming --

  

 

 

 

you're assuming commercial launch has to be 12 years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plus 6. 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm assuming that 

  

 

 

 

commercial launch should be 12 plus 1 --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So let me --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- because you only have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

an exclusive license for 12 years. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So let me address that, the 12 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years plus 6 months first, and then go to the point of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why the notice of commercial licensing has to -- can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only coherently be done once the FDA has announced what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

molecule has been approved for what therapeutic uses and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by what manufacturing processes, which is the paramount

importance when you're talking about biosimilars. 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

            

So as to the 180 -- the 12 versus 12 and a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half years, the FDA -- no one has yet applied for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biosimilar licensure until long after the 12 years has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ended.  So we don't know when the FDA -- how the FDA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will address a license application that is made during 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 12-year period. 

 

 

            

But two panels of the Federal Circuit have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read the language of the statute that says -- and this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is 262(k)(7) -- that FDA's approval of a biosimilar may 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be made effective until 12 years -- until 12 years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of data exclusivity has run.  Two panels of the Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit have said that only means made effective.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FDA certainly could adjudicate a license and grant a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

license effective 12 years after, you know, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusivity period runs. 

 

 

            

The reason --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That strengthens my 

  

 

 

 

argument. 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because if the FDA is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

taking that position, then it's basically kicking off 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the possibility of round 2 pretty early. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  Now, the -- as -- as my 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend on the other side pointed out, the notion that

there is going to be round 2 litigation very early in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any event is unlikely for the following reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

            

Number one, as they've reported, it takes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about 10 years, even for a biosimilar, to get developed. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And, you know, Amgen is both a reference product maker 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a biosimilar maker, and that's, in fact, consistent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with our experience.  So the notion that there's going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be, you know, an application filed in year 4 or year 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 or year 8 is unlikely. 

   

 

 

 

            

Another reason that it's unlikely is 

 

 

 

 

 

these -- these biosimilars -- you know, up until very, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very recent advances in gene sequencing, biosimilars 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were -- the way they were defined was by the process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under which they were made.  You take a particular cell 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

line and then you do the following 18 things at this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

atmospheric pressure. 

 

            

And the FDA will not approve a biosimilar 

   

 

 

 

 

 

until it has inspected the manufacturing process and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilities, which, according to the record, take -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about 100 or $200 million.  And the notion that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biosimilar is going to create a whole factory for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FDA to review and then leave it open for -- until year 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 is quite unlikely. 

 

 

 

            

The -- the issue here, even if the FDA took 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the position that, nope, even though the statute only

says that approval can't be made effective, we're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

even going to tip our hand until 12 years is over, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still wouldn't defeat the manifest purpose of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

This statute, like the Hatch-Waxman Act, has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two relevant periods.  There is a period of data 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

exclusivity that is the period in which a competitor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't use the sponsor's data.  That's not a period of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

market exclusivity.  In fact, there is a competitor to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the product at issue in this case that's been on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market for five years because Teva went through the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regular 271(A) process.  So we have, as in Hatch-Waxman, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a period in which there's data exclusivity.  And we then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a period, just like in Hatch-Waxman -- there it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 months, here it's 180 days -- for the adjudication of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any patent disputes. 

 

 

            

Now, my friends on the other side say, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is different because in the Hatch-Waxman context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FDA actually approves, and then the 30-month period 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for patent litigation occurs, whereas here, the FDA's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approval leaves aside the question of when they can or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't approve it.  If they don't approve it until 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometime after the 12 years has run, there's an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional 180 days. 

 

 

            

We don't know that because this has never

happened.  But even if it did, the reason why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

Congress -- the reason why you have to have FDA -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FDA say what's being approved, whereas in Hatch-Waxman 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't, is in Hatch-Waxman we are talking about a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small molecule that has to be identical.  It's made by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chemical synthesis, so there's no question. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When -- when a generic asks for Hatch-Waxman 

   

 

 

 

 

 

approval, we know precisely what the molecule is.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know precisely for what therapeutic purposes it will be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used because it has to be identical, and no one cares 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the manufacturing process is because this is simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chemical synthesis of an identical molecule. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Whereas -- and this goes to Justice Breyer's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question about notice -- until the FDA decides what it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, what is the compound that it is going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorize -- which, by definition, won't be identical --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and until it decides for what therapeutic purposes that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be used, and until it specifies what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacturing process in what location will be approved, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't give notice of anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And, if -- in fact, if you look again, we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the 180-day notice provision, subsection (a) of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

262(l)(8), which -- I'm sorry, I'm looking at my own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix, but it's on page 31A of -- of my appendix.

Subsection (b), entitled Preliminary Injunction, tells 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

you the most important consequence of (8)(a) -- and this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does go again, I think, Justice Sotomayor, with respect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to your question about how soon this can be done -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(8)(a) notice, first and foremost, allows the sponsor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the very first time, to seek a preliminary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunction against the commercial marketing of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product for the uses using the processes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And you cannot go to a Federal district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

court and ask for a preliminary injunction until you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, A, that there's an imminency that occurs.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't go years in advance.  B, you have to know what it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that you are seeking to enjoin.  This notion that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's some artificial act of infringement that relates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to whatever you may or may not know is in the original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application for Article III purposes is irrelevant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, once the FDA -- the -- the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is can you get an injunction against what is approved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for what purposes using what processes.  Until you know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, a court doesn't have a way of evaluating --

issue the validity of the patent rather than its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement? 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  We don't have a sufficient data 

   

  

 

 

 

 

set to be able to evaluate it because, you know, in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

seven years that this Act has been in place, the FDA has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepted for review only 14 of these applications and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has only granted 5 of them, the last one being last 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Friday. 

            

And so in some of them, there have -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, for example, Amgen got approved -- biosimilar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approval for its biosimilar to AbbVie's referenced drug 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Humira.  We got that last year.  We haven't given the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

180-day notice yet, and so we haven't started commercial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marketing.  And it could be because some -- often, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biosimilar will wait until the expiration of the regular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant patents. 

 

            

It also can be that there is this -- this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation occurs, Phase I, Phase II, or whatever, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there is then a settlement, which is, in fact, what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened between Amgen's referenced product in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, and Teva's competitor.  We -- there was -- there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was litigation and the litigation was settled. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So -- but the -- the point here -- and if I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can just -- maybe this -- this is a -- is a good point 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to shift to the (l)(2)(A) issue, which is the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

requirement that you provide that once the -- once the

applicant decides not to go the regular route, that is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the A route, that is, to -- to do all the testing and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove that this is safe, potent, and pure, but instead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to piggyback onto the referenced products, once that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done, the statute says -- not only in (2)(A), but also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in (1)(A) -- says that you must -- once you make that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice, the consequence -- the consequence of using the

quote (1)(B), quote, "When a subsection (k) applicant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

submits an application under subsection (k), such

remains under (l)(9) -- (9) -- (9)(C), rather, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(l)(9)(C), what the remedy is.  And we've heard from the

MR. WAXMAN:  So --

  

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And here the remedy is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  So let me -- can I bookmark the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law cause of action, because I do want to get back 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and explain why --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  However -- however best 

  

 

 

 

 

you want to do it. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Our -- okay.  Let me do State 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

law first, which is what was at issue and was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicated here, and then go to the Federal law issue.

So the litigation -- the complaint in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case asked for an order under the California statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The California statute, like many other State statutes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including the one that was directly at issue in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision in Bates v. Dow Agroscience, makes it a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of State law to fail to comply with Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandates, including this one. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I got that. 

    

   

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm sorry.  My question is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

how can we understand what a violation is, of Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, without looking at both the rights section and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy section? 

 

            

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, the --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Because the -- a violation 

   

  

 

 

 

is circumscribed in a certain way here by the remedies 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided by Federal law. 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well -- so I don't -- this may 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a definitional failure of communication, but "shall" 

   

 

 

 

 

 

either means "shall."  The remedy question is who --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who, if anybody, can do anything about it, if you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply with "shall," right? 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that's -- no. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

It's not quite that.  "Shall" is if you want to invoke 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Federal process, this is what you have to do.

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  So --

  

  

 

 

46 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  So if you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

don't invoke the Federal process, what remains?  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a remedy.  That's a different Federal process, the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

declaratory-judgment process.  That's what (C) says. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Under your reading, (B) and (C) become 

 

 

 

 

 

 

superfluous, because if you can get a State law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

information-exchange provision under (C) or -- or under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law, why give the remedy of starting a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaratory-judgment action at all? 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  All right.  So let me go 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

right to Section 9.  I'm not trying to avoid it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section -- you have to look -- what Section 9 says. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(9)(C) is, if you will, an exception or a clarification 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of (9)(A).  The background principle is that Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has established an artificial act of infringement, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the submission of the ABLA, the submission of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biosimilar application. 

 

            

That is actionable.  There is a Federal 

   

  

 

 

 

cause of action under Section 281, which gives Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district courts jurisdiction to adjudicate patent 

 

 

 

 

 

disputes.  Under the Declaratory-Judgment Act and this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court's decision in MedImmune v. Genentech, you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring a declaratory judgment any time you want so long 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as there is a level of immediacy, which, by definition, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

there is, if an artificial act of infringement has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already occurred. 

 

47 

            

Now, what (9)(A) says is notwithstanding 

 

 

 

 

 

those background rules, if the biosimilar applicant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chooses the (k) route and provides the application and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the manufacturing information, we're making an exception 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the general availability of declaratory judgments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No one can file a declaratory-judgment action until the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice of commercial marketing is given. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What (9)(C) simply does is it has -- (9)(C) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says if you don't provide that (2)(A) information, you, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the applicant, can't ever file for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaratory-judgment action, but (9)(C) doesn't remedy 

 

 

 

 

 

the sponsor's harm for two reasons.  Number one, it has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no real operative effect with respect to the sponsor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because recall what (9)(A) -- the (9)(A) limitation is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicated, as the first clause indicates, only in those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances in which the application and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacturing information is provided. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  I think it does. 

    

  

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  And (9)(C) simply confirms what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is -- what should be obvious, which is if it isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided, the sponsor is left to his background rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to litigate the declaratory-judgment action.

us to the following conclusion, which will be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unsatisfactory, again, from everybody's point of view? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

We said you're right --

 

 

 

 

            

me. 

MR. WAXMAN:  Setting the bar pretty low for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You're right.  "Shall" 

  

  

 

 

means "shall."  Okay?  But let's stop there because, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

first, the Federal part, which you just read, doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that's the only remedy or that there are others. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But even if it did, we wouldn't know whether California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law picked up just the substantive part, or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive plus the remedy.  And even if we knew that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we wouldn't know whether some other State would be free 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to pick up in their own State law "shall," but not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusivity as to remedy.  And those involve either 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption questions, or questions of interpretation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law, and none of that is briefed.  And, therefore, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we stop.  "Shall" means "shall."  How do you like that? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No, you don't, but tell me why not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I -- no.  I like -- I like 

    

    

   

 

 

 

"shall means shall."  I -- I still want to get back 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to the -- make the (9)(C) point, but let me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address your State law question first.

Supreme Court in Rose v. Bank of America and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor General's Amicus brief to this Court in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, makes clear what California says.  California law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

is not incorporating into State law Federal remedies. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It says it is a violation of our State law, fair 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial practices law, to violate a command of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

another sovereign's law. 

 

 

            

            

That establishes the --

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that is fine. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

But we also have pretty well-established preemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws.  I would -- you know, this is a very reticulated 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute with enormous consequences, and you're reading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along and you finally figure it out, and all of a sudden 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up pops California law. 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well --

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And not only that, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, if we apply California law, then, presumably, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some circumstances, we apply the law of every other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State and maybe they reach different consequences.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if as your friends on the other side are right, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no Federal cause of action for this type 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of relief, then it seems odd to say but there's going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be -- you get the same thing under State law.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not to prejudge the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

issues, maybe. 

 

50 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  First of all, the preemption 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question, there's no ambiguity about whether preemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was waived.  At page 26A of the petition --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

understand that, but I'm not going to interpret a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal statute based on the decisions of one party to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waive the argument or not. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I completely understand that. 

    

 

 

 

In Bates v. Dow Agroscience, the Court rejected my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument that the -- the farmer in question had a remedy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under, I believe, it was Texas State law for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of a substantive -- Texas State law made a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of State law a violation of a substantive 

   

   

 

 

 

 

provision of the Federal FIFRA statute.  And I argued in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that case for the defendant that Congress had considered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what remedies, if any, to provide to individual farmers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and had made an advertent decision not to provide any. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This Court pretty emphatically rejected my 

 

 

 

 

 

argument and said that because Texas had made it a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of Texas law to fail to comply with a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision of the Federal FIFRA, the plaintiff could get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a remedy available under Texas law.

I mean, I -- I agree that we -- you know, it's somehow

51 

that was sought, the order that we went in to say, look, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to order them to give us this manufacturing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information and give us notice at a time when it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coherent to talk about notice about what, and we -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only remedy that the California statute provides is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunctive relief.  It doesn't allow for damages at all. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And we're entitled to this.  We're a California company. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

They're violating our laws. 

 

 

 

              

I understand that it's unsatisfactory and 

 

 

 

 

that, ultimately, some day perhaps, this Court will have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide whether it's -- whether there is a Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement, even if State law didn't exist, although I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do want to suggest that if this Court says, look, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"shall" means "shall," and you must if you -- if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choose to -- to parachute onto the back of their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, you have to at least let them know that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're doing it and what you're doing.  And in order to

MR. WAXMAN:  So, Justice Sotomayor, two 

  

 

 

 

 

points.  Number one, in terms of shouldn't all this --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't all this patent litigation be done early and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

often, everybody understands that the applicant, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biosimilar applicant under this Phase I, Phase II 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process alone decides which patents at issue in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exchange of lists are going to be adjudicated.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent -- the applicant announces -- the applicant can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say to the sponsor, in Phase I, we're going to litigate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of the patents that are on the (l)(3) lists.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only qualification is if the -- if the applicant says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm not going to -- I don't want to litigate any of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these things now.  I want to wait and see what's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approved. 

            

The sponsor has the election of choosing one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent, presumably the patent on the molecule itself, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicate.  So the -- the -- it is in the applicant's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hands to get all of this litigation on artificial acts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of infringement upfront.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- for the applicant to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

53 

invoke and participate in phase 1. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Now, let me --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What you're not telling 

  

 

 

 

 

me is, it's no longer a choice --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So let me explain --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- because State law can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

force them --

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- through you seeking 

  

 

 

 

 

injunctions to participate unwillingly. 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  Let me -- let me go back 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to (9), which I think is the source of Sandoz's argument 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the statute already provides remedies for the two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations that we allege occurred here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And if I may, let me -- let me address the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two substantive provisions differently, because they say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that (9)(B) is the remedy for a violation of the 180-day 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice, and (9)(C) is a remedy for the violation of not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing the information. 

 

 

            

The notion that (9)(B) is a remedy for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to provide 180-day notice is -- is crazy.

The -- what (8)(A) says is, you can't file a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

declaratory-judgment action until you get the notice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And what they say is, well, but the remedy of not giving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice is that you can file a declaratory-judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

action.  And not only that, you can file a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaratory-judgment action and you must file a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaratory-judgment action at a time when you don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

know when, if ever, the FDA will approve, what it will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approve, or for what purposes and by what means.  And if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a violation of the 180-day notice period, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first time that the -- the sponsor is going to know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it is when the FDA approves. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, what's -- what's 

  

 

 

 

 

wrong with that?  Why can't you argue that the notice is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defective and seek a declaratory judgment on that basis, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the notice is insufficient, doesn't provide you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with adequate notice as required by statute? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, that -- that, of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is exactly what we claim.  They gave -- they purported 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to give us notice the day after they --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right. 

  

 

MR. WAXMAN:  -- filed their application.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

said, that's not valid, that's not the right time.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question -- I'm separating out the substantive question

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I understand that.  If 

    

  

 

 

55 

MR. WAXMAN:  -- and the remedy. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  If you say the notice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

itself is defective, apart from when it's given, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't provide enough information, isn't that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible remedy right there? 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, yes.  In an instance in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

which -- the notice simply says we are going to begin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial marketing in 180 -- no less than 180 days. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our -- the -- you know, the issue in this case is -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive issue -- I'll leave aside the enforcement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question -- is that's not notice.  In order to notice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something, you can't provide notice of something when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't even know it's going to happen.  That is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice ordinarily and, for that matter, logically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implies that the preconditions that are outside your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control have been satisfied. 

 

 

 

            

If I say -- this notice early tells you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what?  It tells you I filed an application.  And if they 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

approve my application, I intend to start marketing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

immediately.  I don't know whether they will approve my 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

application.  I don't know, if they approve it, whether 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

they will change the substance, whether they will change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the indications.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But isn't that true of a lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of what this Act contemplates?  I mean, all the round 1 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation can occur before the approval is given. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  That's right.  And that's the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

reason why you have to have -- that's why (8)(A) has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- the notice has to come at a time when we know what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is that's approved.  That is, the parties may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choose --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I guess what I'm saying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is that it seems as though this statute contemplates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you can do a lot of this process prior to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approval, but that's not a necessary piece of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

information you need in order to start evaluating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there's infringement. 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So, Justice Kagan, the -- let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say Phase I starts.  I mean, I think I probably ought to 

    

   

   

   

 

 

 

talk about what happens -- their remedy for not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing the -- the (l)(2) information at all.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's say the parties decide, okay, we've -- we've each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

listed all of these patents that are potentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable.  That list is coherent if the sponsor knows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the application and what manufacturing processes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are there for.  If we don't know that, we have to list 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every patent that we have on every manufacturing process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we own, which is incoherent.

But let's assume that the parties say, okay, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57 

here are the list of patents.  How many does it make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense for us to adjudicate now?  It certainly makes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense for us to adjudicate the patents on the molecule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and perhaps the purposes of the molecule.  It may be we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it makes sense to get a court to adjudicate all of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  But even in that instance, number one, under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(l) -- the statute in (l)(7) recognizes that the sponsor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may well obtain other patents after the lists are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exchanged.  That has happened in this case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in the Apotex case that my friend was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressing where they said there are no other patents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available, it is about to happen in that case, too, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the -- the PTO has just allowed claims that read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on that patent.  So, number one, there can be and often 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be other patents. 

 

 

 

            

Number two, even if you adjudicate -- get an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication on the artificial act of infringement, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number one, if you follow the process, the sponsor gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a mandatory injunction under 271(d)(4).  And in any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

event, if it turns out that what the FDA has said is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, you know, there have been a lot of -- we require 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lots and lots of amendments to the application.  In this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case they require -- there were 30 amendments made from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time the application was filed until it was granted.

If it turns out that when the FDA issues its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license, it's licensed something materially different 

 

 

 

 

 

than what the application was, the parties and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court have to have some opportunity to say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wait a minute, I mean we adjudicated patent infringement 

   

   

 

 

 

 

on the assumption that the manufacturing process would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be X, Y, and Z, but the FDA didn't approve it.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insisted on A, B, and C, and there has to be some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period -- and that's what the 180 days does -- to allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the parties to say even with respect to the phase I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patents, we now have a real dispute. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The FDA has approved something different 

 

 

 

 

 

than what the application was, and the -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sponsor has to be given some period of time in order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure out what the FDA has approved, and a district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge has to be given some period of time to evaluate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like what are these patents, what is this compound, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the manufacturing processes, is -- are the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, Mr. Waxman. 

  

 

 

 

 

Assume that there has been phase I, round one and round 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two before the approval.  The district court has decided 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of two things.  There is a patent infringement. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

It's issued an injunction.  The FDA has narrowed the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope of things substantially.

the FDA is the one who narrowed it, why isn't it fair to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the licensed product holder to let that injunction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue until there's now certainty that there isn't? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the -- if the patent infringement process ended up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying no infringement, district court agreed and there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is no injunction, so these licensed products is going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal with goods in the market, but they've gotten a shot 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at this, and the claims are now even more narrow. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

wider ones. 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  So --

I -- I'm not sure what unfairness there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the license. 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So --

MR. WAXMAN:  Number one, it is very -- we've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not had a situation, and it is remarkably unlikely that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we will get to a situation in which there are no patent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputes left to be resolved once the license issues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both because, as has happened with respect to our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product at issue in this case, and in the Apotex case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FDA -- the -- the PTO has indeed issued us a patent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that bears on this that we couldn't include in the

which is that what the FDA has approved is narrower than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the application was, not broader.  And all that the

once the preliminary injunction is filed so that we can

the FDA has approved.  That's not made public at the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD 

 

 

 

 

 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 15-1039 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. MAYNARD:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

There can be no doubt that the judgment that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've petitioned on is a Federal judgment.  The -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit issued a Federal injunction and 

   

 

 

 

 

dismissed their State law claims. 

 

 

 

 

            

Two, the -- the statute -- Congress, when it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to provide for an injunctive relief of the (l) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures, it did so.  It provided for it in only one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

instance:  Violations of the confidentiality provisions 

  

 

 

 

 

61 

in (l)(1)(H).  And significantly, that's also the only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision that Congress called a failure to do something 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in (l)(1) a violation.  Yet, Amgen wants you to read the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute and to read those -- the rest of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions as implicitly entitling them to an injunction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress chose not to provide, and instead they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to call the remedies Congress did provide as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backup.  I -- that's a very odd way to read the statute. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The rights here are patent rights.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

remedies they were given were patent remedies, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are forceful.  They gave them artificial infringement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

actions in the case where you participate in an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exchange, and in the case where you don't.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shows no concern in the notice of commercial marketing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision with notice being too early.  It says at least 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

180 days.  And when you lift the gate, it allows the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the sponsor to go to court and litigate any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remaining patent rights they have. 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice Breyer, the -- Congress knew how to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require something to come after one event and before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another.  It does it in the very next provision, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(l)(8)(B).  Does not do it in the notice provision.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't read that requirement into the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"licensed," which is just a description of the

biosimilar. 

            

Congress would not have extended the 12-year 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusivity period in such a bizarre way.  That was a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

62 

very hotly debated item, and it would extend the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusivity period in every case, even when there are no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent rights to litigate. 

 

 

 

            

Our approach fully allows them to vindicate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their patent rights.  We wrote them and we told them to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue us.  Now, they delayed, but they could have sued us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right away.  That was the provision Congress allowed. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And in that suit they got our application, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requested as common in -- in patent cases to request all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of our FDA correspondence.  We have a -- a duty to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

continue updating them. 

 

 

            

They added -- they -- they were issued new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent during the suit.  They have added that patent to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the suit, which is also common in patent litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A lot of what they are telling you blinks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reality about the way the world works, and with respect, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those kinds of policy arguments are for the Congress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This statute works if you just apply it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

according to its terms.  The shall conditions are all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions precedent, and that's made clear by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(l)(6) provision which says, they shall sue.  It would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a very odd Federal law to say that is a violation of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Federal law, not to bring suit.  It isn't. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress provided consequences.  If they 

  

 

 

 

63 

decide not to sue, then they can only get a reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

royalty.  These are -- these are shalls, and they do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean must, but the government says they don't mean must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in all circumstances.  They mean must if you want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue in this process.  And if you don't continue in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the process, there are benefits and burdens to both the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant and the sponsor at every step.  And if you go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through the statute, and I recognize it's a very 

   

   

 

 

 

 

articulated scheme, it's all one coherent whole, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives them a very powerful remedy. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon, at 11:16 a.m., the case in the
