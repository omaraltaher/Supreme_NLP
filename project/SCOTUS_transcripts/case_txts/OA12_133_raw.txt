CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is Case Number 

12-133, American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant. 

Mr. Kellogg. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. KELLOGG:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

The court below thrice refused to enforce 

the parties' arbitration agreement because he thought 

that class procedures were necessary to vindicate the 

plaintiff's Sherman Act claims. 

That holding was reversible error for at 

least three reasons.  First, it has no basis in either 

the FAA or the Sherman Act.  Second, it creates an 

unworkable threshold inquiry.  And third, it is 

unnecessary to any legitimate policy concerns raised by 

the court below. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kellogg, suppose it 

goes to arbitration as you think it should, and the 

arbitrator says to the merchant, to prove your case, you 

have to show the relevant market, you have to show that 

American Express had market power, that it used that 

power to the detriment of its competitors, and the way

these sections -- the way these tying cases have gone 

is you get an expert.  And I don't see that you can 

prove it in -- in a new way. 

I mean, the whole point of this is that the 

expense to win one of these cases is enormous.  And no 

single person is not worth that person's while. 

MR. KELLOGG:  Well, three responses to that, 

Your Honor.  The first is, that it is up to the 

arbitrator in the first instance to devise procedures to 

deal with claims in an efficient and cost-effective 

manner. 

Second, to the extent that an expert report 

is required that would cost a lot of money, we have 

conceded below that the parties could share costs of 

that expert just as they could share the costs of a 

lawyer. 

And, third, the alternative is to have an 

inquiry upfront, that this Court has rejected in 

Concepcion, that you cannot condition the enforcement of 

an arbitration agreement on the availability of class 

procedures. 

It's up to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the -- what was 

the -- I missed that.  The sharing of the costs, how 

does that work?  It's certainly not in the agreement,

not in the arbitration agreement, that -- that American 

Express is going to pay for the expert for the other 

side. 

MR. KELLOGG:  We acknowledge below that they 

could share costs among multiple plaintiffs --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Oh.  Oh. 

MR. KELLOGG:  -- before that.  The sharing 

of costs.  Now, under the court below's regime --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And then what you would 

you have, five, six different arbitrations going, and in 

each of those five or six cases, you would have -- they 

could share?  They could share the million dollar cost 

of this -- the experts? 

MR. KELLOGG:  They can share the cost of the 

expert.  And, of course, they get their attorneys' fees 

back, plus reasonable statutory costs, plus potentially 

treble damages. 

The alternative, as the court below held, is 

that the district court has to decide in the first 

instance, I'm not going to send it to arbitration 

because I think they need a class action.  To make that 

determination, he first has to do a Rule 23 analysis. 

Would there even be a class certified in this case? 

Only 20 percent of putative classes are 

certified.  And that's not an inquiry that the Court

should be making at the outset. 

Official 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I -- I'm sorry, but I 

don't think I got the answer to my question.  Is -- the 

arbitrator has now said we have to have an expert, and 

the plaintiff says -- or the complainant says, I haven't 

got the wherewithal, and if I have six friends who bring 

individual arbitrations, that's not nearly enough. 

So what happens then, the case ends, and 

it's not possible --

MR. KELLOGG:  As we said, they would be able 

to share an expert between multiple plaintiffs, but 

there is no guarantee in the law that every claim has a 

procedural path to its effective vindication. 

This Court held in Eisen, for example, even 

though the Court acknowledged that it was a $70 claim, 

it could only be brought as a class action, but the 

plaintiff in that case said, I can't afford to do the 

notice costs, and the Court said well, then, the class 

is decertified because the plaintiff has to put up the 

notice. 

The whole point of arbitration of course is 

that it expands the universe of claims that can be 

brought efficiently and effectively for small consumers. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kellogg, do you think 

that if in your arbitration agreement you had a clause

which just said, I hereby agree not to bring any Sherman 

Act claim against American Express, could -- could your 

arbitration agreement do that? 

MR. KELLOGG:  Under this Court's decision in 

Mitsubishi, I believe not. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It -- it couldn't, 

right because we would say no, there has to be an -- an 

opportunity for a vindication of statutory rights, is 

that right? 

MR. KELLOGG:  Correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and suppose that the 

arbitration clause said something different.  Suppose 

that the arbitration clause said, I -- I hereby agree 

that I will not present any economic evidence in an 

antitrust action against American Express. 

Could it do that? 

MR. KELLOGG:  I think that would be subject 

to review under State unconscionability principles, and 

would probably be struck down, Your Honor, just like any 

other provision that essentially prevents --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, even putting aside 

State unconscionability principles, wouldn't you think 

that our Mitsubishi case and our Randolph case would 

again come in and say, my gosh, this arbitration clause 

prevents any effective vindication of the rights to

bring an antitrust suit. 

Wouldn't you say that. 

MR. KELLOGG:  I -- I don't think Mitsubishi 

can be read that broadly, Your Honor.  To the contrary, 

the whole point of Mitsubishi was that arbitration is an 

effective forum for vindicating Federal statutory 

rights.  Mitsubishi --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you think -- I'm sorry. 

Go ahead. 

MR. KELLOGG:  I'm sorry.  Mitsubishi dealt 

with the very specific question of a waiver, a 

substantive waiver of your rights, not with the 

procedures to vindicate those rights. 

As, for example, in the Vimar Seguros case, 

where the Court said, well, you might have to go to 

Japan, but we're not going to get into the business of 

weighing the costs and benefits. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I just want to make sure 

I understand your answer, which is that you read 

Mitsubishi and Randolph as so narrow that you would say 

that the principle that they embody does not prevent 

American Express from saying, you cannot produce -- you 

cannot use any economic expert or any economic testimony 

in an antitrust suit. 

MR. KELLOGG:  You know, I think the better

place to handle that would be State unconscionability 

law.  Whether the Court would want to expand the ports 

of Mitsubishi to say that. 

It's not clear to me what the statutory 

justification for that would be, given that the Sherman 

Act -- the question here, of course, concerns class 

procedures.  And given that the Sherman Act was passed 

at a time when there were no class procedures, and given 

that the Court in Concepcion --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, my -- my question is 

not about class procedures, it's about allowing economic 

evidence to help prove your claim.  And you said, no 

problem, even though it is, of course, true in the real 

world that to prove a successful antitrust claim, you 

need economic evidence. 

MR. KELLOGG:  Correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you said that's 

fine because you're going to read Mitsubishi and 

Randolph in such a way that it allows an arbitration 

clause to 100 percent effectively absolutely frustrate 

your ability to bring a Sherman Act suit. 

MR. KELLOGG:  I have no doubt that such a 

provision would be struck down.  I think the proper way 

to do that would be under State unconscionability law, 

which Section 2 specifically preserves.  But if the 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  Court felt the need to expand Mitsubishi in that narrow 

2  respect, that would still not help the Respondents here, 

3  who are saying that you should condition the enforcement 

4  of the arbitration clause on the availability of class 

5

procedures, which this Court held in Concepcion is 

6  fundamentally inconsistent with the purposes of the FAA. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I think -- I think 

8  what they are saying is something a little bit 

9  different, which is that if you go -- if you accept my 

10

premise that the arbitration clause could not say no 

11  economic evidence, what the -- Respondents here are 

12  saying is, well, now you have to give us the ability to 

13  produce economic evidence and maybe that involves class 

14  procedures, maybe it involves something else. 

15

It could involve some other cost-sharing 

16  mechanism.  But if the arbitration clause works to 

17  prevent us from sharing costs in such a way that we can 

18  produce that evidence, then once again we have a problem 

19  about completely frustrating the effect of the Sherman 

Act. 

20

21

 MR. KELLOGG:  Well, I think -- I think not 

22  Your Honor.  And I think we have to return to the fact that 

23  the only provision at issue here was the class action 

24  waiver.  That was the only issue that they raised below. 

25

It was the issue decided by the Court.  It was the issue 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  on which this Court granted certiorari, and it's 

2  directly contrary to this Court's decision in 

3  Concepcion. 

4

5

 I have no doubt that if there were 

provisions in a contract that essentially prevented a 

6  plaintiff from raising a substantive claim or from 

7  presenting evidence that they might have in support of 

8  that claim, that it would be struck down under State 

9  unconscionability principles or under Mitsubishi.  But I 

10

don't think we can expand Mitsubishi into a 

11  free-floating inquiry for district courts into the costs 

12  and benefits of each case. 

13

 They would have to sit down and say, well, 

14  what evidence is going to be needed in this case and how 

15

much evidence is going to be required.  They would have 

16  to say, what are the document production costs? 

17  According to the court of appeals, they would even need 

18  to say, what are your chances of winning?  Because, say 

19  it's going to cost a million dollars, but you only have 

20

21

a 50 percent chance --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that the only thing 

22  that the court of appeals said is, you have to pay 

23  300,000 minimum for the expert, the most you can get in 

24  treble damages is 5,000.  It didn't go into all the 

25

other things that you were saying.  It said nobody in

his right mind will bring such a lawsuit to pay $300,000 

to get $5,000. 

MR. KELLOGG:  And nobody in their right mind 

in Eisen would -- would pay a million dollars in notice 

costs to get $70 on --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess you could have said 

the same thing under the Sherman Act before Rule 23 

existed, right? 

MR. KELLOGG:  You could have. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Before there was such as 

thing as class actions. 

MR. KELLOGG:  Under that position --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The same thing would have 

been true.  If, indeed, your claim was so small that you 

can't claim -- can't pay an expert, you, as a practical 

matter, don't bring the suit. 

MR. KELLOGG:  That was true.  In fact, 

Congress at the time of passing the Sherman Act 

specifically considered adding class procedures and 

declined to do so.  For the first 4 decades of the 

Sherman Act, there were no class procedures even left. 

Even today, in court, as I noted, only 

20 percent of cases actually get the class certified. 

The whole point of arbitration, as I noted, is to expand 

the scope of claims, small consumer claims, that can be

brought in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think the nature of 

their underlying -- their antitrust claim is relevant to 

this?  They are claiming that they were unlawfully 

compelled to enter into the contract that they say, as a 

practical matter, precludes them from raising the 

antitrust issue.  Does that -- does it matter? 

MR. KELLOGG:  Well, a couple of points on 

that.  They certainly weren't compelled to enter the 

contract.  Lots of merchants don't take American 

Express.  It was a voluntary choice on their part.  But 

more fundamentally, the only provision that they have 

ever challenged in this case is the class action waiver. 

They have not suggested below that there was any problem 

with cost-sharing or other ways that they might deal 

with the specific question how to present their case in 

arbitration. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the AT&T Mobility 

case, the Court remarked that this was a -- that the 

arbitration agreement had certain provisions that made 

it easier for the consumer to use the arbitral forum. 

Is there anything like that in this arbitration clause? 

MR. KELLOGG:  I'm sorry, I didn't -- I 

didn't quite follow that, Your Honor.  A provision in 

the arbitration clause that makes it easier to -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, where not some other 

consumer in another arbitration, not that sharing of the 

costs, but wasn't AT&T Mobility going to pick up a good 

part of the tab of the cost of the arbitration? 

MR. KELLOGG:  That's correct, there were 

provisions in AT&T that the Court said would make small 

value claims easier to process.  I would note that in 

Concepcion the Court said even if small value claims 

could not be brought, it would still fundamentally 

change the nature of arbitration to insist upon class 

procedures.  So I don't think that helps them in 

distinguishing Concepcion. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  One of the ways I have 

been thinking about this case is to think about 

arbitration and the whole point of arbitration is to 

have a procedure where you don't have costs, you have as 

an arbitrator an antitrust expert or the best in the 

class in the third year antitrust course in law school. 

And they cite reports, and -- you know, it's 

classic to have contractors sit in as arbitrators in 

construction claims; just because it's cheaper and they 

know -- so I was thinking that that's substantial 

justification for your position.  But your argument so 

far seems to say that doesn't make any difference.  Even 

if they can't bring the suit in an economic way -- the

arbitration in an economic way, that that's irrelevant. 

That's -- that's what I'm getting from your argument. 

MR. KELLOGG:  I did not mean to imply that, 

Your Honor.  The key point is that it's up to the 

arbitrator in the first instance to find the most 

efficient and cost effective way to resolve a particular 

claim. 

And it's not necessarily the case that 

complicated -- that huge numbers of documents --

plaintiff said, we will need 5 million documents and we 

will need a very, very expensive expert and they got an 

affidavit from a very, very expensive expert saying, 

this is what I would charge to do this. 

The whole point of arbitration, of course, 

is that its informality actually expands the universe of 

claims, of small value claims that can be brought 

effectively. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kellogg, are you 

suggesting that you can win an antitrust suit in 

arbitration without presenting economic evidence of such 

things as monopoly power, antitrust injury, damages? 

How could somebody do that? 

MR. KELLOGG:  No, I acknowledge that they 

would probably need a report in this case. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  I mean, I could be

2  would ask for five things, which will be admitted, and 

3  one thing that's going to be difficult for them to

have to have this enormous report. 

 MR. KELLOGG:  Well, I -- perhaps I --

10

11

12

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, maybe. 

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. KELLOGG:  But in this case, if you look 

13  at the complaint, the market definition that they're 

14  seeking to establish is, if I might put it, somewhat 

15

16

gerrymandered.  It essentially consists --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If you want to argue that 

17  stuff, which I -- then I guess maybe they're right. 

18  Maybe you do need experts on that.  I don't know that we 

19  want to get into this, but I just want to know if you 

20

want to concede that there is no way to win this case in 

21  arbitration unless they spend $300,000. 

22

 MR. KELLOGG:  I did not mean to concede that 

23  at all, Your Honor.  The whole point of arbitration is 

24  the informality and the speed of the procedures.

does need to be some sort of safety valve, of course 

Congress can deal with that question.  Congress recently 

in the Dodd-Frank Act said, in certain circumstances 

we're going to allow the Consumer Financial Protection 

Board to determine whether class action waivers will be 

permitted.  But obviously there's nothing either in the 

FAA or in the Sherman Act that would justify such an 

inquiry here. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Kellogg, could I 

go back to Justice Alito's point because I'm not sure I 

quite understood your -- your answer to it. 

Essentially, the claim here, right, is that this is a 

party with a monopolistic power, such that -- and this 

is just the Plaintiff's allegation, it may or may not be 

true, but -- but they say that American Express is using 

its market power to impose particular contract terms. 

And they have a tying thing, but it could just as easily 

be the case that American Express could be using its 

economic power to impose terms essentially making 

arbitration of antitrust claims impossible. 

And why shouldn't we understand this problem 

as connected to the very allegation that's being 

brought?  That -- you know, how is it, how is it going 

to be possible in a case where there's a monopoly power 

able -- able to impose contracts terms that -- that you

can create an arbitration clause, which essentially 

prevents that from being challenged? 

MR. KELLOGG:  Well, there is a separate 

issue below which the court did not reach about whether 

the arbitration clause itself had been improperly 

imposed.  But the question before the Court has to do 

with the class action waiver, which this Court in 

Concepcion said there's no statutory basis for the 

courts to preclude application of that waiver. 

It's also -- would create a completely 

unworkable inquiry at the outset of litigation in order 

to determine whether to refer a case to arbitration in 

the first place, and it's unnecessary because State law 

unconscionability, can deal with contracts of adhesion 

or unfair terms.  The arbitrator in the first instance 

can deal with how to cost effectively arbitrate the 

claims in issue. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did -- did American 

Express say, as Justice Breyer suggested, that, well we 

will concede A, B, and C, so the only issue on which you 

need proof is D?  As I understood it, American Express 

never took the position that it would -- it would 

concede certain issues so that you could limit the 

proof.

their resources --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No, I'm not 

talking about --

MR. KELLOGG:  -- and share the cost of the 

claim. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm not talking about 

pooling with other single merchants bringing single 

arbitrations.  I'm asking whether American Express -- so 

here's the complaint.  It says, I have to prove relevant 

markets separately.  And did American Express take the 

position, no, you don't have to prove all that.  I think 

that's what Justice Breyer was suggesting.  There's only 

one thing that's really in controversy, and the rest we 

could stipulate. 

But I didn't see anything in all the time 

this case has been in the courts on American Express's 

part to say that we are not going to demand the 

full breadth of proof. 

MR. KELLOGG:  Well, that's -- that's not 

actually correct.  We did not say that we're going to 

relieve them of their burden of proof on any issues, but 

we did say, and the district court agreed with us, that 

the arbitrators are capable of dealing with these claims 

in an efficient and cost-effective way that would allow

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose that American 

Express wouldn't have had to agree to arbitration at 

all, right?  They could have just said -- you know, 

you -- you have a cause of action, you sue us in court, 

right?  They could say that, legally, couldn't they? 

MR. KELLOGG:  We could.  And indeed --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And until Rule 23 was 

adopted, that would mean -- you know, if you had a small 

claim, tough luck, right?  De minimis non curate lex. 

If it's just negligible, it's impracticable for you to 

bring a Federal claim.  And that would not violate the 

Sherman Act, would it? 

MR. KELLOGG:  Correct.  That -- that very 

issue was present in the Eisen case. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm a little 

confused about this business about pooling resources and 

whether it's prohibited or permitted.  Tell me exactly 

what your position is on that. 

MR. KELLOGG:  Our position is that multiple 

claimants in arbitration could share the costs of an 

expert for preparation of a report.

me -- I don't see how that concession is at all needed 

by the other side.  I mean, let's just say they have a

trade association or something.  They -- they can all 

get together and say we want to prepare an antitrust 

expert report about what American Express is doing, and 

they do, and then presumably, one of them can use it in 

the arbitration.  Any problem with that? 

MR. KELLOGG:  That -- no problem with that, 

and that's absolutely right.  But the plaintiffs below 

said that wasn't good enough.  They said, we need the 

aggregate damages provided in a class action to make 

this worthwhile because if we're just going to 

essentially get costs --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they could borrow the 

money from a lawyer instead of from the trade 

association, right? 

MR. KELLOGG:  Well, or from a hedge fund, 

which increasingly finances litigation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, again, that 

doesn't seem too difficult.  You either have your trade 

association or you have a big meeting of all them and 

say we need to pay for this expert report and once we've 

got it -- you know, I'm going to represent each of you 

individually in individual arbitrations and I'm going to 

win the first one, and then the others are going to fall 

into place and they'll get a settlement from American 

Express that's going to be -- satisfy their concerns.

that after we suggested that they could pool resources.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

This case is about the scope and continuing 

existence of a doctrine that has been a feature of this 

Court's cases and a necessary corollary of its 

willingness to extend arbitration to Federal statutory 

claims, the vindication of rights doctrine. 

Ever since this Court 30 years ago, roughly, 

got in the business of extending arbitration to Federal 

statutory claims, it's used the effective vindication 

doctrine as an assurance that Federal statutory claims 

would not go unvindicated just because of the arbitral 

forum. 

And so, if you look at this Court's cases, 

they stand for a simple proposition.  When the choice is 

arbitration or litigation, surely the FAA favors 

arbitration and it's no threat to the underlying 

statute because the underlying statutory claim is 

vindicated in the arbitral forum. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't see -- I don't see 

how a Federal statute is frustrated or is unable to be 

vindicated if it's too expensive to bring a Federal 

suit.  That happened for years before there was such a

thing as class action in Federal courts.  Nobody thought 

the Sherman Act was a dead letter, that it couldn't be 

vindicated. 

take --

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Scalia, let me 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I don't see why it's 

any different when you transpose the situation to the --

to the arbitration situation. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Scalia, let me take on 

the premise and then we get -- then also say where 

really the concern comes in for the differential 

treatment. 

I would take issue with the premise, which 

is, sure, there wasn't a Sherman Act -- there wasn't a 

class action Rule 23 back when the Sherman Act was first 

passed.  But there were procedures in like joinder that 

allowed for multiple claims to be litigated together; 

there were not confidentiality agreements that came in 

and limited your ability to share information from one 

claim to another, and, of course, back in the good old 

days, you didn't necessarily need a $300,000 expert to 

bring a Sherman Act claim. 

But what I think is the problem is when you 

have a difference, and that is the assumption on which 

this case comes to the Court, where you could vindicate 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  this claim in court because there are mechanisms to 

2  share or shift costs and you cannot vindicate them in 

3  the arbitration because of a combination of features of 

4  the arbitration agreement that prevent any sharing or 

5

6

shifting of costs. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Before you get to that, I 

7  have two questions.  One is on the point you've just 

8  made because I -- I agree, I understand it is fairly 

9  well established, this doctrine, but I don't see quite 

10

11

how it works. 

 Suppose there's a Tyler claim, a Truth in 

12  Lending Act -- you know, something like that, and the 

13  claim is a fairly -- it's worth about $10,000 or so. 

14  And so the plaintiff says you violated the act, pay me 

15

the $10,000.  Now, he happens to come up with a theory 

16  that is really far out; and the more far out the theory, 

17  the harder it is to prove.  And the harder it is to 

18  prove, the more you need expensive experts. 

19

20

 And do we go case by case, saying -- you 

know, where you have a really weird theory that's going to 

21  require 17 experts and endless studies, you don't have 

22  to have an arbitration claim, or you don't have to 

23  follow it in this instance, but everybody else does. 

24

25

 Now -- now, is -- is that something, in 

other words, we're supposed to look at case by case,

which would produce the odd result I suggested?  Or do 

we do it by categories?  How does the doctrine work? 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, you could do it by 

category, and I suppose you could treat antitrust claims 

differently, but I think there's an answer that's 

already built into the Court's cases, which is Randolph, 

and it's putting the burden on the plaintiff to make a 

nonspeculative showing. 

And in the case you've described, I would 

think you would say, boy, that's speculative.  I mean --

you know, you don't need that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, what I'll do because I 

work with my own hypothetical, I'll have a far-out case, 

but yet not quite speculative.  In other words, what I'm 

trying to suggest is it's an odd doctrine that just 

says, plaintiff by plaintiff, you can ignore an 

arbitration clause if you can get a case that's 

expensive enough, and there we are. 

I haven't seen it work, and I haven't seen 

enough to know how it does work.  And I guess you 

haven't either, but -- but I'm concerned about that. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well -- well, don't be too 

concerned, Justice Breyer.  First of all, if you look at 

the cases where the doctrine's been applied, it's 

largely been in antitrust cases.  The First Circuit 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  Kristian case is an antitrust case.  And I don't think 

2  that's an accident. 

3

 I mean, if you look at the Hovenkamp amicus 

4  brief, it make clear that you just can't bring this type 

5

6

of claim without an expert --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that doesn't seem right to 

7  me.  Now, Hovenkamp would be the person I would hire as 

8  the arbitrator.  So surely he does know -- or Phil 

9  Arita -- a blessed memory.  And they're under the 

10

instruction to get this done cheap.  Well, I think that 

11  might be possible. 

12

 That might be possible because it's only the 

13  question of damages that's tough here because if you 

14  don't have the double -- there's only one monopoly 

15

profit at the two levels, da, da, da, and we don't need 

16  to go through that. 

17

 But I can think of a way of getting it done 

18  pretty cheap.  But regardless, your expert here didn't 

19  talk about the cost of arbitration.  He did use the word 

20

once.  But as I read pages 88 through 92, it seemed to 

21  me he was talking about the cost of litigation, not the 

22  cost of arbitration.  And -- and I wouldn't proceed 

23  necessarily with all those reports he does to impress to 

24  the jury, or even the judge.

impress him.  And -- so, so, so -- hasn't the Second 

Circuit looked, assuming your doctrine's in place, to 

the wrong set of costs:  The cost of litigation?  Even 

though they use the word "arbitration," that isn't what 

your expert told me. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I mean, Justice Breyer, 

none of us can know for sure what Professor Arita would 

say.  But we know what Professor Hovenkamp says, and he 

says to bring these claims you need an expert.  Now, 

in --

JUSTICE BREYER:  In arbitration or in court? 

MR. CLEMENT:  He says in arbitration or 

anywhere.  He assumes that anywhere you bring these 

claims, you're going to need a market power expert. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Does he take into account 

the fact that the arbitrator can be him?  And moreover, 

could, in fact, work under an instruction keep these 

costs down? 

MR. CLEMENT:  And what I would say, 

Justice Breyer, is the place for that debate, if it were 

going to take place, was in the district court.  Because 

we made our case, as Randolph requires -- and it was a 

nonspeculative case.  We said it's going to cost 

$300,000 to $500,000 or even a million dollars to get a 

market power expert.  They didn't come back and say, no,

in arbitration, I think you can do it for 50,000. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, that isn't the point. 

If I were doing this offhand, I would say everything is 

conceded, but for one thing:  Since there is no double 

monopoly power, there is only one monopoly power at the 

two levels which can be exercised, the only way the 

person is damaged is if in fact you've raised entry 

barriers.  So you'd say to the plaintiff, how are you 

going to prove that?  And you'd read it and submit a 

report. 

Now, I'm not saying this is the right way to 

go about it.  All I'm saying is it's hard for me to 

figure out on the basis of that affidavit, which talks 

about courts, why this has to be so expensive.  So what 

do I do? 

MR. CLEMENT:  I think what you do is you, 

with all due respect, fault Petitioners for that. 

Because we put in that report -- they could have 

criticized it exactly the way you are and we'd have a 

different case.  But they argued before the district 

court and the court of appeals just what they argued to 

you, Justice Kennedy, it doesn't matter if you can do 

it. 

It doesn't matter if it's too expensive.  We 

don't think this doctrine exists, or we don't think it

extends to this kind of cases, and having put their --

their money on that extreme position that the effective 

vindication doctrine doesn't exist, I think it's --

JUSTICE BREYER:  One other thing which I 

didn't understand, and that's why I am asking.  What 

they chose as the remedy here was sever the arbitration 

clause if you want, it seemed to be, and go to court. 

All right. 

Now, I don't know where that power comes 

from.  So if you were going to improve this contract in 

the direction that you would like, why couldn't you 

sever the part about the confidentiality, or why 

couldn't you require -- you have some awfully big 

merchants. 

Like, I don't know -- probably, you have 

maybe Costco, maybe Walmart, maybe -- you know, these 

people are not without money.  Though your client, 

may be.  But -- go get these contributions.  Go for --

there are many ways you can treat this particular set of 

words in the arbitration clause, short of severing it 

entirely. 

And -- and what about that?  What's your 

view on that?  What do you think? 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, our -- our view on that 

is -- you know, the Court is balancing two things here.

It's trying to apply the effective vindication doctrine, 

but it's also trying to honor the principle of this 

Court that you treat the parties to the bargain that 

they have committed. 

Now, if they would have come in and said in 

the district court -- which they didn't -- that we'll 

get rid of the confidentiality -- they said you could 

share costs, but they -- you know, the confidentiality 

was the problem. 

It was the problem the Second Circuit saw. 

You can look at 92a of the Petition appendix.  And they 

didn't petition on that issue, so I don't know how they 

get to say, well, the Second Circuit was wrong about 

that, but isn't that a shame.  I mean, if they thought 

that was wrong, they should have petitioned. 

And that just shows you, these issues were 

in front of the Court.  Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you -- I don't 

understand.  You think they could have appealed on 

that -- on that issue? 

MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  I don't think this 

Court would have necessarily granted it because it's not 

very cert-worthy.  But it's also -- I don't know how 

they can keep that issue in their back pocket and then 

say well, we got cert -- we got cert on the cert-worthy

issue and now we have this factual finding where the 

Second Circuit held that the confidentiality agreement 

precludes the sharing of this information from 

arbitration to arbitration. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let me ask you.  Your 

effective vindicability principle depends upon a 

comparison with what you could do in Court. 

MR. CLEMENT:  It doesn't, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't? 

MR. CLEMENT:  It doesn't.  It's a simple 

comparison of the necessary unrecoupable costs of 

bringing the claim in arbitration compared to the 

maximum recovery. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but if you couldn't do 

it -- if you couldn't do it either -- even if there had 

been no arbitration agreement, how could the arbitration 

agreement be -- be harming you?  I don't understand 

that. 

MR. CLEMENT:  If you have -- if you have a 

claim, Justice Scalia, that can't be vindicated in 

arbitration or in court, that claim's not going --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or in court. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  But that's --

MR. CLEMENT:  No you don't. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you couldn't do it in 

court, you don't have to be able to do it in 

arbitration, it seems to me. 

MR. CLEMENT:  With respect, Justice Scalia, 

you don't have to make that comparison part of the 

test because the cases that can't be vindicated in 

either place won't show up at the courthouse door.  So 

once you show up at the courthouse door, you've got a 

plaintiff's lawyer.  They may be crazy, but you have a 

plaintiff's lawyer that thinks I can do this in the 

litigation system. 

And so at that point, the only question is, 

all right, I think I can do this in the litigation 

system.  If the only thing that's precluding me from 

doing it is this arbitration agreement -- so this 

arbitration agreement is not operating as a real 

arbitration agreement, it's operating as a de facto 

as-applied exculpatory clause.  If they can make that 

showing, then -- and the option is not arbitration or 

litigation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  No.  It's saying that 

there's an alternate mechanism for resolving disputes. 

It's called arbitration.  And arbitration does not 

necessarily or even as a matter of fact often as a

practical matter involve the costs and the formalities of 

litigation. 

MR. CLEMENT:  And -- and God bless it, 

Justice Kennedy -- when it does that, and it can 

effectively address claims that can't be addressed in 

the litigation system, that's exactly what we want 

arbitration to do. 

But there are some cases where the 

arbitration system -- not generally -- I mean, if you 

have the kind of pro-vindication agreement you had in 

Concepcion, or that Sovereign Bank has that we mentioned 

in our brief, then you can vindicate these claims in 

arbitration. 

But when you have a specific arbitration 

agreement that has a variety of clauses that don't allow 

for any mechanism to shift or share the costs, so you 

know it's not litigation versus arbitration, of course 

we'll go with arbitration.  It's litigation or nothing. 

In those circumstances, this Court has always said that 

we'll have --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I mean maybe it is 

litigation if you need a $300,000 report.  But why do 

you need a $300,000 report?  That's what we're asking. 

And I just can't -- it seems to me that I have to engage 

in speculation about the limits of arbitration in order

Now, to be sure, they took a -- a more rigid 

view below, so we don't have much of a record. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well -- and, Justice Kennedy, 

I would say that -- I mean, shame on them, with all due 

respect.  Because there was an opportunity in the 

district court to make an apples to apples comparison, 

and they could have said, no, $300,000 is way off; you 

can do this for $25,000, and here's how.  But they 

didn't make that showing.  They said -- you know, we 

don't think the effective vindication doctrine applies 

in these circumstances at all. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's a little much 

to expect them to come back and say, oh no, no, no, you 

don't have to prove all this.  The only thing you've got 

to prove is it's going to cost you $25,000.  That's an 

odd position to put them in. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't think it is, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  I -- they don't have to say -- you 

know -- they don't have to tell us how to prove our case 

to the lowest possible price.  They just have to show us 

something that will allow us to vindicate our claim --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There is no authority that 

I could find for the prop -- I mean, if in fact it costs 

you $10,000 to buy the arbitrator -- system -- you know,

you buy the system --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Sorry.  But I mean -- you 

know, hire -- whatever it is, if those are obstacles, 

it's pretty well established, I think, that that 

arbitration is not something that you can use to 

vindicate the Federal claim.  And the part that's 

bothering me about this, though, is that those aren't 

obstacles. 

It's just you brought a very expensive 

claim.  And the real problem here is the reason they can 

go into court is they can get a class action in court. 

And then this Court has said, you can't get the class 

action in arbitration.  There we have it. 

So -- so the -- the question in my mind is, 

well, is there a way that some of the beneficial aspects 

of class action can be used in an arbitration that does 

not formally have a class action?  And there it seems 

yours is a good case because a lot of them can.  You 

say, well, the one part that can't is getting this 

private information. 

So maybe we should send it back and say, 

well, why do you need the private information?  On a 

good theory of antitrust, you're going to show that the 

price of the Tide product was higher than what it would

have been had the entry barriers not been raised from 

the Tide.  That's a general entry question, which I 

don't think you need private information from them to 

answer.  But that's -- and now we're really into the 

depths of the merits. 

So I thought of sending it back and saying, 

let's -- let them explore this kind of thing about other 

ways of trying to get some of these advantages of class 

action into your -- you're going to say I'm too far out 

on this. 

Justice --

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, what I'm going to say, 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They could write a treatise 

on it, maybe. 

MR. CLEMENT:  But -- but what I was going to 

say is look, I mean, take a step back.  You know, one of 

the great things about the effective vindication 

doctrine is it gets the incentives rights.  It gives 

companies incentives to draft clauses that will allow 

for the maximum vindication of Federal rights. 

And so there are lots of clauses out there 

that would allow for even this claim because they have 

cost shifting of expert costs or they don't have 

confidentiality agreements or they'll waive the 

confidentiality -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose this class could 

not -- could not qualify for certification in Federal 

court.  Are you asserting that there is some arbitration 

principle that -- that allows you to create some new 

class? 

MR. CLEMENT:  No, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you have to make -- you 

have to make a comparison to what can be done in Federal 

court, don't you? 

MR. CLEMENT:  No, it's not part of the 

inquiry because --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It isn't.  So that any 

class that the arbitrator thinks is okay is required. 

MR. CLEMENT:  No, it's just that if by virtue 

of showing up in court and saying, I want to litigate my 

claim, the lawyer has already made a judgment that I can 

vindicate it in Federal court. 

Maybe it's because of class action, maybe 

it's just because of joinder, maybe it's because there's 

no confidentiality rule in the Federal proceedings, so 

it can bring a lot of these claims, maybe it's a 

difference in collateral estoppel.  Whatever it is, that 

lawyer has already spoken that I can make this claim 

work in litigation.

3

 MR. CLEMENT:  That might be what they most 

4  want, but they don't get that.  They just get some way 

5

to vindicate the claim.  And if this had a cost-shifting 

6  provisions that the expert costs were shifted, that 

7  would get the job done, that's the Sovereign Bank 

8  example we talked about in our brief.  There are more 

9  than one way.  We're not trying to get a guarantee for

arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not 

permit class arbitration of a Federal law claim. 

Now, you're saying that -- that whether they 

permit class arbitration is not going to be decided on 

the basis of whether you could certify a class under 

Rule 23, but just what? 

And -- and -- and if it does depend on that, 

what is the Court supposed to do?  Before it can -- it 

can give you your claim, it has to -- it has to decide 

whether this class would be certifiable, wouldn't it? 

My goodness --

MR. CLEMENT:  No, it would not --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- this is a very 

complicated procedure. 

MR. CLEMENT:  -- Your Honor.  You just have 

to answer the question, is there a problem with the 

arbitration, is there something with this specific 

agreement that precludes this claim going forward.  Here 

it's a combination of no class arbitration, no way to 

shift costs because they don't provide cost shifting, 

and no way to share costs because of the 

confidentiality. 

Whatever they put in the question presented, 

they can't make the Second Circuit's holding that the 

confidentiality provision blocks the sharing of

information to go away.  They're stuck with that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is -- tell me 

how the no -- no sharing of information and 

confidentiality, how does that work again?  You can't, 

if you're a trade association, get together and say, I 

think we should have a study of Amex's whatever.  And 

then you put together the study, and then one of your 

members says -- you know, that's a good study, I'm going 

to go -- go to arbitration.  They can't do that? 

MR. CLEMENT:  They -- they could do that 

much, Mr. Chief Justice.  The critical point at which 

the confidentiality provision creates a practical 

problem is you're trying to get all the information, 

you're trying to get a single expert report in order to 

share the costs, and you're trying to do not just the 

market survey, but do a damage calculation, have a 

damage formula. 

Because when you have a market like this 

where the allegations are they've distorted the market, 

so we can't rely on the market price, we need to know 

the sales volumes of all the individual stores.  Their 

confidentiality agreement protects that and doesn't 

allow that to be shared.  That's not that unusual. 

This Court in Nielsen and Concepcion both 

remarked that one of the features of arbitration is you

generally keep it confidential.  And that's something 

that the Second Circuit said because of that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what if you 

do -- I mean, what if you do it, is that just part of 

your trade associations, they think this is -- you know, 

they're not talking about particular arbitration or 

anything.  They just prepare a -- a report, and then 

once you see the report, you say, my gosh, I had no 

idea, and then you file your claim for arbitration. 

MR. CLEMENT:  With all due respect, Mr. --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me my 

point is simply that there's no sharing, confidence, it 

seems like an awfully amorphous provision that would be 

very difficult to enforce. 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I mean, I don't think 

it's that difficult, Mr. Chief Justice.  Certainly, cost 

shifting is not difficult, and there are other ways to 

solve this problem.  But the Amex agreement forecloses 

all of them. 

And the question for this Court is, do you 

say, well, tough or do you say what you've said every 

time you've confronted this problem, the effective 

vindication doctrine provides the solution. 

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. MALCOLM L. STEWART, 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS 

MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

At the beginning of the argument, 

Justice Kagan asked whether a pure exculpatory clause, a 

provision in a contract that simply said, we promise not 

to seek relief under the arbitration -- under the 

antitrust clause period would be enforceable, and 

Mr. Kellogg replied that it would not. 

And I think the unenforceability of such a 

provision would not depend on any analysis of what was 

likely to happen if the suit was brought in court; that 

is, a pure exculpatory clause could be set aside and the

plaintiff could still lose for any number of reasons. 

The plaintiff could be denied class certification and 

decide it's uneconomical to proceed with an individual 

suit. 

He could lose on a threshold ground like the 

statute of limitations or he could lose on the merits. 

But the unenforceability of the pure exculpatory clause 

wouldn't require the Court to make a comparison between 

being kicked out of court on that basis and what would 

likely happen if the suit were able to be brought. 

And we would submit that the same mode of 

analysis applies when the arbitration agreement can be 

shown to have the same practical effect as an 

exculpatory clause; that is, if it is the case that 

given the amount of money at stake, the arbitration 

procedure specified in the contract and the modes of 

proof that would be necessary in arbitration, if it can 

be shown persuasively by the plaintiff who bears the 

burden that no reasonable plaintiff would find it 

economically feasible to proceed, then the arbitration 

agreement can't be enforced --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would that be the case even 

before Rule 23 was -- was adopted? 

MR. STEWART:  Yes.  And it would be --

vindicate it in the Federal courts, you must be able to 

vindicate it in arbitration? 

MR. STEWART:  The question would be whether 

the arbitration agreement could be enforced. 

And before Rule 23 was adopted, if there had 

been a pure exculpatory clause, it would have been 

unenforceable and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not even talking about 

a pure exculpatory clause.  I'm talking about the mere 

fact that as a practical matter, it's impossible to 

bring it in arbitration.  In a context in which it is 

also impossible to bring it in Federal court. 

And you would say, still, you must permit it 

to be brought in arbitration, even though it can't be 

brought in Federal court. 

MR. STEWART:  In the same way that we would 

say a pure exculpatory clause would be invalid and 

unenforceable, even if it were clear from the 

plaintiff's complaint that he was not entitled to relief 

on the merits. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, 

isn't that also consistent with the way the Court 

addressed the issue in Randolph?  Because what the Court 

said there was it might be that these arbitration fees 

are prohibitive.  And if those arbitration fees are

prohibitive, then this doctrine kicks in. 

And it didn't look to say, well, let's 

compare how these fees relate to whatever costs you 

would wind up with in litigation.  It just said, if the 

arbitration fees are prohibitive, in such -- in such a 

manner that it prevents you from vindicating your 

Federal claim in arbitration, that's enough. 

MR. STEWART:  That's correct.  And I would 

make two real world --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what are the 

arbitration fees?  It's not -- not -- not lawyers' fees. 

Do they include lawyers' fees? 

MR. STEWART:  No, the attorneys' fees would 

be recoupable under the substantive law. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So I don't know, 

what do you --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Expert costs. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what are you comparing 

it to in court litigation? 

MR. STEWART:  We are not really --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  A filing fee? 

MR. STEWART:  No, I think we are not 

comparing it to anything.  That is, our -- our position 

is in determining whether the arbitration agreement has 

the same practical effect as an exculpatory clause, we 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  asked could any reasonable plaintiff proceed under the 

2  terms and conditions that are set up?  And if the answer 

3  to that is no, then the arbitration agreement is 

4  unenforceable. 

5

Now, I would make two real-world points, one 

6  of which Mr. Clement has already alluded to.  The first 

7  is the only cases that are going to wind up in court are 

8  those in which the plaintiff at least believes that it 

9  would be feasible to vindicate the claim in court, and 

10

so they are likely to be those in which there is at least a 

11  potential difference between the outcome in court and 

12  the outcome in arbitration. 

13

 The other is, even if a plaintiff believes 

14  wrongly that he can proceed in court through a class 

15

action mechanism and class action -- class certification 

16  is denied under Rule 23, presumably at that point the 

17  plaintiff is going to give up and the outcome at the end 

18  of the day is going to be the same as if the arbitration 

19  agreement had been enforced. 

20

JUSTICE BREYER:  This is exactly -- I found 

21  no authority for the proposition that what hinders --

22  plenty of authority, you can't make the person go to 

23  arbitration if the fees involved are too high because 

24  he's blocked. 

25

But you're quite an advance over that.  You

are saying the thing that keeps him out is his own 

theory of wrong, which will involve hiring a lot of 

experts and others. 

Now, once that's adopted, it seems to me in 

practice we have reversed in many, many cases the 

proposition that you can, in fact, require Federal 

causes of action to be arbitrated because all you have 

to do to get -- out of the arbitration is to allege a 

theory of your case which is hard and complicated to 

prove.  Now, you are back in court. 

Now, that's a significant erosion, it seems 

to me.  So I want to know if you have any standard 

there, if we're just supposed to accept that, if in fact 

you are trying to reverse in practice what was the 

holding that you can arbitrate these Federal causes of 

action.  What is going on here? 

And an addendum to that is if you are going 

to convince me, which you might, that, well, that's 

okay, do it, do it, do it, is it a possible remedy to 

monkey with the arbitration clause and provide for a 

sharing of costs, say if you win, the loser will pay the 

expert fees, which is of course a much more 

pro-arbitration way than just throwing it out entirely? 

MR. STEWART:  Well, let me start --

do you see what I'm driving at? 

Official 

MR. STEWART:  Let me start with your last 

question and work backwards.  It is possible and it 

sometimes has happened in the lower court cases that a 

plaintiff will come into court and say, I can't proceed 

through arbitration because the arbitral fees are too 

high in relation to my likely recovery. 

And the defendant at that point will say, we 

offer to waive the fees or we offer to pay your share of 

the arbitral fees, and a court will be persuaded that, 

given that consensual modification of the contract, it 

is feasible for the claims to be brought in arbitration 

and the plaintiff is kicked out of court. 

Now, this is consensual.  This is something 

that the court has -- that the court has done at the 

company's behest, and it would be different question of 

whether the court could do that over the company's 

objection.  But another thing that the company could do 

is put in a severability clause in the contract that 

would specify what results should obtain if one 

provision of the contract were held to be invalid. 

I guess another thing I would say in 

response to your question is we do have one data point, 

the First Circuit's decision in Kristian, which I 

believe Mr. Clement referred to, in 2006, which

essentially held on facts similar to these that the 

arbitration clause as written was not enforceable 

because the cost of the expert fees in an antitrust case 

would dwarf any potential recovery, and we haven't seen 

the floodgates opened. 

The last thing I would say is if this is the 

concern, Petitioner's proposed rule really doesn't match 

the argument in its favor.  That is, Petitioner is not 

just arguing for a rule that would cover cases in which 

the relevant costs are those of experts or similar 

authorities. 

Petitioner's rule would say even if the 

contract provides for a non-recoupable $500 filing fee 

and the amount of the claim at stake is $200, so it's 

absolutely apparent on the face of the contract that the 

claim can't be brought, the agreement is still 

enforceable and the plaintiff is deprived of his day in 

court. 

The other thing I would say about 

Petitioner's argument is the challenge to the Second 

Circuit's decision has really changed drastically since 

the cert petition was filed; that is, the Second Circuit 

took it as essentially undisputed that the costs of the 

expert report would render it economically infeasible to 

proceed in arbitration, and it took the further step of

saying, therefore the arbitration agreement is 

unenforceable. 

Now, the cert petition challenged only the 

"therefore" part of the Second Circuit's analysis. 

There wasn't a suggestion that the Petitioner intended 

to challenge the antecedent determination that these 

claims couldn't feasibly have been brought in 

individualized proceedings. 

And I think as Paul -- Mr. Clement said, the 

likely reason is that wouldn't look like a cert-worthy 

issue.  That sort of fact-specific inquiry wouldn't seem 

like a wise use of this Court's resources. 

So having gotten cert granted on the 

important legal question whether the inefficacy of 

arbitration procedures is a basis for invalidating the 

agreement, Petitioners are now spending a great deal of 

time arguing that it would in fact have been feasible to 

pursue these claims through individualized arbitration. 

And one thing we would say in response, as 

Mr. Clement said --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  They didn't get 

cert granted on that question at all.  As I pointed out 

before, they got it granted on whether the mere fact 

that the arbitration agreement did not permit class 

arbitration renders it invalid.

MR. STEWART:  But they did get cert --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I thought the 

question before us. 

MR. STEWART:  They got cert granted on that 

question, but neither the question as so framed or the 

body of the cert petition suggests any challenge to the 

Second Circuit's factual determination that these claims 

could not feasibly have been brought in individualized 

arbitration. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Stewart, is it -- the 

arbitration agreement is a one-on-one, right?  They 

can't, or can they have -- they have the 12 similarly 

situated people, not a class, join in the arbitration, 

or is it one on one? 

MR. STEWART:  That's correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which is correct? 

MR. STEWART:  It is correct that it has to 

be one on one, that the agreement requires only --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And even in the days 

before we had Rule 23, when you were bringing a suit in 

Federal court you could have multiple plaintiffs joining 

together. 

MR. STEWART:  That's correct.  The agreement 

prohibits even the types of joinder mechanisms that 

might have been available when the Sherman Act was

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 

MR. KELLOGG:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Let me focus on what the court of appeals 

held below.  At 3a of our appendix, the court said. 

"The only issue before us is the narrow question of 

whether the class action waiver provision contained in 

the contract between the parties should be enforced." 

That is the question on which we sought certiorari. 

That is the question that the Court granted. 

It is Respondents who have now tried to 

rewrite that question by talking about other possible 

ways of vindicating their rights that they claim are 

foreclosed, that they claim wrongly are foreclosed by 

the contract at issue here. 

This is not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do we have a factual 

record?  Suppose, I think, based in substantial part on 

Justice Breyer's suggestion, that we could have an 

arbitration that's effective and we could have a trade 

association prepare a report, and we could do one

arbitration and then see if it applies to others. 

Suppose I think that. 

Do I -- doesn't that bear on this question? 

And if it does, I don't have a factual record to support 

my assumptions. 

MR. KELLOGG:  I don't think you need a 

factual record because as Respondents acknowledge the 

burden is on them to show that the arbitration-specific 

costs would preclude them from pursuing their claim. 

And they have not done that by putting in an 

affidavit saying, well, in litigation we have to do --

get 5 million documents and spend $300,000 processing 

them and get an expert report which could cost up to $1 

million. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But suppose we answer --

MR. KELLOGG:  That is not --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- the question -- the 

answer is yes, a class action waiver can be enforced. 

MR. KELLOGG:  Correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what are the 

circumstances here?  The record leaves us uncertain, we 

remand it for further consideration of what they are. 

MR. KELLOGG:  Well, the court could 

certainly --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because that isn't the

issue they decided, whether it could be enforced.  They 

decided whether you can -- whether the whole arbitration 

agreement could be enforced. 

MR. KELLOGG:  The holding of the court of 

appeals is the arbitration agreement cannot be enforced 

because it has a class action waiver.  That is clearly 

reversible error.  I don't even hear --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It was because -- it was 

because Judge Pooler said, "I have been instructed by 

the Supreme Court that I may not require class 

arbitration."  That's -- and she was bound by our 

decision that a court can't order class arbitration, 

isn't that correct?  So that was not an option for her. 

MR. KELLOGG:  But the Court also in 

Concepcion said you can condition the enforceability of 

an arbitration agreement on the availability of class 

procedures, and that is what the Court below violated. 

So the decision below has to be vacated. 

I do not think you should remand for a 

detailed factual showing on just how they are going to 

vindicate their rights in arbitration because most of 

those questions, what evidence is required, et cetera, 

are for the arbitrator in the first instance. 

That said, we made -- we did respond to 

their showing below.  We did not put in a dueling

affidavit saying, no, in litigation, it only requires a 

$200,000 report or a $25,000 report.  We said, that's 

irrelevant because we're talking about 

arbitration-specific costs.  And there's lots of ways 

that they can proceed with their claims. 

One is by sharing the costs of an expert, 

and they specifically rejected that.  They said, even if 

we could shift the costs of the experts to the other 

side, that wouldn't be good enough because then all we'd 

be doing is expending much money to get it back. 

We need aggregated damages of the sort 

available in class suit --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Or you have to do without. 

I -- you just said what -- I thought that the expert 

talked about litigation costs, not about arbitration 

costs. 

So how is that handled? 

MR. KELLOGG:  That is how I read -- that is 

how I read the report.  And certainly with an expert 

arbitrator --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You said you waived that 

point, whatever -- however it is.  You waived it.  Never 

raised it.  The Court of Appeals took it as if it were 

arbitration costs. 

MR. KELLOGG:  No, we raised -- we've argued

that all along.  In fact, I can refer the Court to page 

27 of our -- the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Second Circuit never 

said anything about, this is what it would cost in 

court.  The court -- the Court of Appeals said, this is 

what it would cost to prove this kind of tying, right? 

It didn't say one word distinguishing what 

it would cost in litigation from what it would cost in 

arbitration.  It was simply what it was going to cost. 

MR. KELLOGG:  We did, in fact.  But let me 

answer Justice Breyer's question first, at page 27 of 

our Court of Appeals --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I believe you. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'd like to hear the 

answer, if nobody --

(Laughter.) 

MR. KELLOGG:  We specifically said, "The 

declaration of merchant's expert is similarly 

un-illuminating, as he too studiously avoided projecting 

the costs for an individual arbitration of these 

disputes." 

So we did argue against that point.  This is 

not an exculpatory clause.  The Court has made clear 

that a class action waiver is not an exculpatory clause. 

This Court has also made clear that you cannot assume

that the arbitral forum will be inadequate to vindicate 

Federal substantive rights. 

And they cannot now change the nature of the 

question presented by arguing that well, there should 

have been another provision to allow -- specifically 

allow cost-sharing, or specifically allow cost-shifting. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Kellogg, it does 

seem like both of the parties have changed what they're 

saying a bit.  And -- you know, if this case as 

presented to us was presented to us in the first 

instance that the premise was that if you go into 

arbitration, it would not provide an effective way to 

vindicate the claim. 

And, now, people are saying different things 

about the confidentiality clause, and people may be 

saying different things about the necessity of an 

expert.  It suggests that the premise on which this case 

was presented to us was not quite right. 

MR. KELLOGG:  Well, I -- I don't believe 

that's the case.  The premise on which the Court 

accepted the case, presumably, is that the decision 

below which conditioned the enforceability of the 

arbitration agreement on a -- on the availability of 

class procedures, was wrong under Concepcion.
