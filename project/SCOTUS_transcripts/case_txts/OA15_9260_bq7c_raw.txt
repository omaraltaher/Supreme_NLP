CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this morning in Case 15-9260, Dean v. United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Stoler. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN G. STOLER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The question confronting this Court is 

 

 

 

 

 

whether a judge can exercise discretion at sentencing in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

light of congressional directives in Section 924(c) that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a 30-year mandatory minimum must be imposed as part of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the total sentence. 

 

 

            

Throughout the Sentencing Reform Act, in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

myriad of factors set forth for a judge to consider at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arriving at an aggregate sentence that meets the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overarching goals of being sufficient, but not greater 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than necessary.  And we submit that there's nothing in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the language of Section 924(c) that prevents the judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from reducing the portion of the sentence for crimes of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence. 

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We don't have --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We don't doubt that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if the -- the mandatory minimums were out of the picture

and all we had was the underlying offense here, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

this sentence would be reversed on appeal, do you? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  I would -- I would submit, yes. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

That would -- that would be accurate, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But in addition --

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said nothing in 

  

 

 

 

 

924(c), but there is a bar on concurrent sentencing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And reading the statute the way you do would shrink the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrency to the vanishing point if we add only one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day to the 924(c) sentence. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Well, the concurrent provision 

  

 

 

 

 

requires that it does not -- it runs in addition to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate offense.  But the concurrent language in there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the same language that we would find, for example, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1028A of the statutes, which has that same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language, but it goes farther.  When you look at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language in 1028A, it follows the same roadmap that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

924(c) has. 

 

            

right? 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's 20 years later, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  It's 20 years later, but -- but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

924(c) has -- has been recalibrated over time starting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 1968.  And even after 1028A came into existence in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two separate times, Congress has changed provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 10 -- excuse me in 924(c) to change the types of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

guns --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But just --

  

 

 

 

5 

MR. STOLER:  -- and things of that nature. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just assume the 1028 for a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

moment didn't exist and say you had to argue from this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language, and this essentially repeats Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg's point, but this language says, "It shall run 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consecutively, it shall not run concurrently."  And your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

version of this statute essentially allows a district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

court to negate that language.  It's as if that language 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were not there in terms of what the -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court can do. 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Well, we -- we submit that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court has to give some sentence for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying crimes of violence, and then they --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, "some sentence," you 

  

 

 

 

 

know, a day, six hours, whatever it is, but can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially make that -- that disappear.  I mean, you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, it's concurrent plus a day.  I mean, that couldn't 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

have been what Congress meant, concurrent plus a day, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it said, "It shall only be consecutive." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Well, Congress, we assume, 

  

 

 

 

 

knows how to write the laws that they write.  And they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the ability to strictly limit -- and they have in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

924(c) to some extent, as far as it having to be --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you're right.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

6 

Congress did not say you -- it did not say what it said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in fact, in 1028A.  But, you know, sometimes, sometimes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way we try to understand statutes is to say any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading that utterly eviscerates something that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly did say can't be a good reading. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Well, we would submit that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"in addition to" language is making sure that a separate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime is being separately punished, that being the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

924(c) crimes that carry the mandatory minimums, in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case of 30 years.  But the -- the language that -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says consecutive also is -- is meant to say that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it can't run with those -- those nine -- those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying predicate offenses. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, during the time 

  

 

 

 

 

the guidelines were mandatory, but afterwards, many, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many court of appeals basically told district courts you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't impose a sentence simply because you disagree with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the guideline.  You can impose it for independent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons to ensure a just result, but you can't impose it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merely because you don't like the guideline.  And they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monitored that pretty well. 

 

 

 

            

That's basically what -- this district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't say it didn't like the mandatory minimum.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said instead that it thought a fair sentence was, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

7 

that -- that would have been one day, if it could have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done it, given that the rest of the sentence, 30 years, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was even further beyond what the judge thought was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate for punishment, deterrence, and all the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors under 3553, correct? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. STOLER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's not negating 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress's purpose if a district court gives one day; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct? 

            

            

MR. STOLER:  I would -- I would say not, no. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And one day is a day of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

punishment, isn't it? 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  No question as to that, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  Yes. 

  

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that your point? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  Basically it is that.  And the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

-- we also have to take into consideration you have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parsimony guideline -- or requirement that pervades the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole Sentencing Reform Act.  We find in it 3551.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find it twice in 3553A that the parsimony provisions are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's considered as to the total sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And when you look at the factors that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set forth within 3553A, within 3551, which talks about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the circumstances of the case, in -- in 3661, which says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no limitation as to what can be considered by a

court in determining an appropriate sentence.  In light 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that parsimony requirement, that ends up in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

results that we have. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is -- is the -- 924(c) is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a statute, it's nothing to do with the guidelines, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it does say sentences have to be consecutive.  So I go 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to the point I opened with.  You are, in effect, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking for a concurrent sentence. 

   

 

 

            

            

            

MR. STOLER:  Well, just -- just --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Just adding one day. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  Well, as Justice Kagan and I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussed, one day is an additional punishment.  And one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day --

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  She's Justice Sotomayor. 

  

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  I'm sorry.  Wrong end. 

  

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  She was the one helping you. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

            

MR. STOLER:  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is the --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I was the one who wasn't. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

sorry. 

            

MR. STOLER:  I got my ends mixed up.  I'm

additional sentence.  That is additional punishment that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is provided for according to the statutory provisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

924(c) limits as to it having to be a consecutive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

sentence, in this case 30 years, but it does not tell as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the underlying crime of violence predicate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses --

 

            

you --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it seems to me that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  -- to which is something that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be decided. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to concede that your position completely negates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- or can completely negate the effect of 924, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there are other reasons why Congress probably would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have allowed that.  And I suppose that's 3553 to take 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

into account all of those factors. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So you're saying, basically, that 3553 

 

 

 

 

 

overrides 924(c), but that -- that -- that's hard to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read the statute that way. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  And I'm not -- I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting that it should be read that way.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they're -- they're read together.  But 924(c) does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have restrictions that require the "in addition to" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language and it requires it be consecutive.  But there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no way -- there's nothing in 924(c) that limits what the

those crimes of violence.

JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought that you were -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought that your answer to the Chief Justice was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps telling, because you said that you thought that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were it not for 924(c), this would be an unreasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence under -- under 3551 and 3553. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Isn't -- wasn't that your answer? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And doesn't that show that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress, although it generally conferred on district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts the authority under those provisions to determine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what is a reasonable sentence in light of the enumerated 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors, withdrew that discretion with respect to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

component that is covered by 924(c)? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So if that's what the -- if that's what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress was doing, then why shouldn't that entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence be ruled out in determining the sentence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is reasonable under the count that is not governed by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

924(c)? 

            

MR. STOLER:  Because we don't read 924(c) as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

being in conflict with -- with 3553(a); you read all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes together.  And Congress knows -- I believe they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

know how to -- how to set constraints and set 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations, and they then did so in 924(c) to ensure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

that a violent crime such as -- as carrying guns in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

commission of a predicate offense is going to carry a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long period of sentence and a severe sentence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And they wanted to ensure, if you look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the history of 924(c) and its -- and its evolution, its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recalibration over time, it has made it -- I mean, when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we first started off in 924(c), there could still be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- there could still be a suspended sentence or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parole.  Sentencing Reform Act took those away.  So they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

recalibrated 924(c) to reflect that, and they've done so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over time. 

 

            

And they, again, had the -- the ability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after 1028A came into existence to say that you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider, you can't compensate for, you can't take into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account that -- that, in that case, an aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identity theft, but that mandatory minimum sentence when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're making a determination as to that underlying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

crime of violence.  They could --

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

didn't. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what about --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  -- have done something; they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what about Judge 

  

 

 

 

 

Lucero's point that Congress can do a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belt-and-suspenders operation, as if -- that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- there was additional insurance in 1028, doesn't

mean that 924(c) shouldn't be read to have a real 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

sentence for the predicate offense? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  We would answer that the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress had the opportunity to do so, and they didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do so, when they amended 924(c) at least two times since 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the advent of 1028A.  And it's not a redundancy issue, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there, they went forward and said this is how --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they used all the language in 924(c), and they went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

farther and then put that additional restriction on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing court to make a determination as to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying predicate offense that you can't consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that mandatory minimum in doing so. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress has that ability to do so.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know how to write the laws and they know how to limit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing discretion, and they did so to the extent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they did in 924(c). 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And you think that's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

realistic -- a realistic assessment of the way a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative body works?  They -- so we put this in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

924(c).  Then we put stronger language in 1028, and now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're amending 924.  And, well, maybe we better 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

strengthen 924 to make it in line with 1028. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Did they have any reason to think about that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the time when they amended 924? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  We would submit that Congress

has --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A circuit court's 

    

 

 

13 

ruling -- there's at least one, the Tenth, that had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruled in your favor. 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Had it done so by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

time 924(c) was amended? 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Yes.  The decision in Smith 

  

  

 

 

 

 

came down in 2014.  There's also a Sixth Circuit case, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States v. Franklin, that I believe came down in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2007 that -- that postdated the changes in 9 -- in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1028 --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Postdated or predated 

  

 

 

 

the changes in 924 --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Came out -- came out -- it came 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after the changes. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'll pick up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito's question, then. 

 

 

 

            

Is there any indication that Congress was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aware of those court of appeals decisions? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Well, Congress in the past has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

made changes to 924(c) based upon what courts have done. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If we look at the Busic opinion, for example.  They --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts had interpreted that there was no requirement for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the consecutive or additional sentence, and they went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

and they changed 924(c) in -- in response to what this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court had done in Busic.  So I submit that the Court --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

that -- that the Congress has that ability.  If they do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make changes to 924(c) in the future, obviously, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be in -- in relationship to what they feel is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the appropriate punishments that must be imposed for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the crimes that have been committed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How old was your 

  

 

 

 

 

defendant?  Do you know? 

  

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  He was 24 years old.  His --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

his co-defendant brother was 23 years old.  That was --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

something? 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So he would be 50-odd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  He would -- he -- under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current sentence, he would serve more time than he's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually lived.  And if he had --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  This is something that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

direct answer to, because the statutes have changed so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quickly that I may have lost track.  But the -- but the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3553(b) is what I'm looking at, and that talks about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

departures.  And I take it that the sentence for robbery 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a departure.  The -- the guideline recommendation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

for -- and you did sentence the judge under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines; correct? 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  The judge calculated the

guidelines, right. 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  He didn't 

  

  

 

 

 

depart from the guidelines.  He didn't -- but he did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depart from the guideline sentence, which was 48 months 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or 44 months. 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  40 months in this case --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right. 

  

 

            

MR. STOLER:  -- Your Honor, yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And he went 

  

  

 

 

 

 

from there to one day. 

 

 

 

 

            

And 3553(b) says you have to -- I don't know 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it's still law -- have to impose a guideline sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless the court finds there exists here a mitigating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance of a kind or to a degree not adequately 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formulating the guideline. 

 

 

            

So you'd look and see their guideline says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 months, and they departed down to a day for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason that there was this add-on sentence, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory. 

            

Now, is there anything that suggests that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the commission did not have that in -- take that into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account?  In other words, is it a proper factor for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

departure, viewed not now from what Congress intended, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not viewed from the point of view of the statutes you've

been referring to, but viewed simply from the view of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the commission and the Congress as to when you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depart downward? 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Your Honor, I would submit that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

this is not really a guideline analysis in that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge made a determination --

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  This is a statute. 

   

  

  

 

 

And the statute says, Judge, if you want to depart 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

downward, you can do so if you're applying the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines only for a reason -- the words are, to repeat 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them, a mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

not adequately taken into consideration by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'm not giving you an answer.  It's not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hostile question; it's not a friendly question.  It's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

question I'd like to know the answer to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- the sentencing 

  

 

 

 

 

judge did depart downward considerably, because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guideline range was --

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. STOLER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- here, as in --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what was suggested.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

departed downward to 40 from -- what was the range? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  It was 84 to 105 months without

guidelines if the guns were present. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it was a 

  

 

 

 

 

significant -- it was a significant departure. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  And he -- he gave various 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons for making that departure, that variance --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But the basic reason was he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought that the mandatory was long enough. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Well, he also -- the judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicated that the -- the reasons he was considering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was the role that he had -- the role that Levon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dean, Jr., had played compared to the role that his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother had played.  He determined that based upon his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal history and the nature of those convictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he had.  He articulated numerous reasons as to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

--

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But the basic reason, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think it's fair to say, is he thought the mandatories 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were long enough. 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  If he could -- if he could have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gone to --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let -- let me assume that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then.  And it seems to me as if I hadn't thought that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through till this moment, and I still haven't, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

relation of 50 -- 3553(b).  It may be you haven't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

thought it through either.  Maybe nobody has, but -- but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

I mean -- and maybe there isn't one, but -- but I -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to learn as much as I could if there is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevance of that. 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Well, and I looked at the --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the factors that are set forth under 3553(a), in which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the guidelines are one of those factors, the same as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy statements are one of those factors, and they go, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I submit, to the overall sentence that the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposes.  And when a judge in this case, it's not a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guideline sentence that he's -- he's deciding.  He's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

varying, based upon these 3553(a) factors, those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tapestry of factors that the thread of parsimony runs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through in which he makes those -- those determinations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let's look at -- at what those four main 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tenets of -- of parsimony are.  For example, the term --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I know 3553(a).  That 

    

   

  

 

 

isn't a problem for me. 

   

 

 

            

What I'm trying to think of is maybe this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a matter that lies in the hands of the commission. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maybe you could say, well, the commission didn't say you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't depart for that reason and, therefore, it is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor, a mitigating factor not considered by the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

commission, but maybe the commission, should it choose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do so, could consider it and could say when it could

and when it couldn't be, in which case the judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't depart downward.  You see, that -- that's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

that's what's going through my mind and there's no point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repeating myself.  You thought -- you might have thought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it, you might not have.  It's a little bit of a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side issue. 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Well, I -- I -- I'd like to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

think I've thought about it from the context of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at the guidelines as a -- as a starting point 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and as a -- as a determination that helps to -- to guide 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a court to consider sentencing.  But it's just a factor 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the Court to consider, and the overall factors that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are set forth in 3553(a), as well as 3661, as well as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3551, leads us to consider all of those factors in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining what total sentence should be imposed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case. 

 

            

The court varied in this instance based upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what he found the guidelines to be, but then there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional things that he considered, those factors that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he looked at to make the determination as to what would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be the appropriate sentence to impose on -- on -- on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner in this case. 

 

 

 

            

And any -- any total sentence is obviously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to appellate review for substantial -- for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive reasonableness under abuse of discretion

stand -- standpoint.  So the government, if in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

instance, felt that the court could then impose a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence of -- of one day with the additional 30 years, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mandatory minimums required, and the government felt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that was not a substantive -- substantively 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable sentence, that's still subject to review by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the appellate courts. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How -- how does that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

normally work, not in a mandatory minimum way, but if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've got three different offenses and -- and you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be sentenced on each of them?  On appellate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review, how is that reviewed?  Is it the total sentence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or do they go by one -- one, two, and three and say, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think you abused your discretion in only giving, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, five months for this and then that doesn't affect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the three years you gave for that.  How -- how does that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually happen? 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  I -- my understanding is that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the -- the appellate review is based upon the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness of the total sentence that's imposed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now, if there is a portion of that sentence that -- that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court felt that the -- that it wasn't dealt with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly by the sentencing court, then they would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address that either for clear error in -- in what was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked at and how the guidelines were applied or de novo

as to the applications of the guidelines themselves. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

So there are those -- those considerations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be made from appellate review standpoint, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over -- overriding consideration, I would submit, would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

be the substantive reasonableness for abuse of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In first looking at this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case, my thought was that it would be very difficult for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judge to determine what the sentence should be for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the underlying crime without looking at what he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require -- or he or she was required to do under 924. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But then it occurred to me that judges and lawyers do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this all the time.  We -- we think of a hypothetical 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

Suppose 924 did not exist.  What sentence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would I give?  Judges do this all the time in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

condemnation cases.  We don't look at the value of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

improvement.  We -- we -- we can look at a problem in --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in an abstract way.  So I think nothing that prevents 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judge from making the -- quite a proper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination for the underlying offense and said --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then saying, but looking at the statute, it has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consecutive and the consecutive sentence has been -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

length of the consecutive sentence has been set forth. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So I -- I see nothing analytically difficult about the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

government's position. 

 

22 

            

MR. STOLER:  Well, that -- I -- I submit, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Your Honor, that -- that turns around the determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be made.  The independence -- the -- the separate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime, the separate punishment goes to 924(c).  It has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to happen.  I mean, it has to be put on to that.  But 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the consideration overall as to the underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes of violence still lends itself to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion by the sentencing --

 

 

 

 

            

that's --

 

            

            

us. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's -- that's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  Keep that in mind --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's the question before 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  And I -- and I believe the --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

the Court in Smith, United States v. Smith, the Tenth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit case that we're relying upon, talks about that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You -- you can't have judges having blinders to look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just the underlying crimes of violence and then -- then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing so as the government is suggesting in this case --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

1028A. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you couldn't under 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  But 1028A has the additional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

requirement.

can't have this, but you can if we interpret the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

the way the government wants. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  My argument is that the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress could have written the statute to include what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they included in 1028A.  They didn't do so in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, in terms of that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

analytical difficulty, there is inherent in this scheme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a bit of double -- a lot of double counting, because the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive crimes almost always, in trying to judge the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

severity of punishment for that, you're always thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the gun, and -- and that always adds to whatever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analytically separate punishment you think should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given for the substantive crime. 

 

 

 

 

            

So there is a little bit of twisting of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge by saying you have to somehow put yourself in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position of punishing this person without knowing that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's going to be punished for the gun anyway for 30 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years, and think of what the punishment should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without that punishment.  Because the gun is present in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both crimes, correct? 

 

 

            

            

MR. STOLER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The identity theft 

  

 

 

 

add-ons, one is -- for every crime except terrorism is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only two years, correct?

MR. STOLER:  Correct, the aggravated 

  

 

 

 

identity theft. 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And in many ways it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

punishing for a separate activity than merely the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

possession of identity theft items. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  Well, there are -- listed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

within the statute are the specified crimes that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would apply to, yes. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.  So the five 

  

  

 

 

 

years is for the terrorism. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  In -- in those -- in those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances, yes.  I -- I would agree -- I would agree 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

with that, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

            

If there are no further questions, I would

MR. YANG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

Petitioner asked the district court for a

felonies, that Petitioner now concedes would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

unreasonable without the 924(c).  Accepting his position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would directly circumvent 924(c)'s longstanding 

 

 

 

 

requirement that courts would impose a specified 

   

 

 

 

 

additional and consecutive sentence beyond the 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment for the predicate solely for the choice to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring a gun. 

   

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It -- it would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumvent it.  On the other hand, it seems to me that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you're talking about 30 years for an offense that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge thinks merits a lot less, if Congress wanted to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent circumvention, they should have written the law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a lot more carefully. 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, I think it's true that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Congress could have written it more clearly, but we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that Congress here, when you take a look at both 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the provisions of 924(c) and then read them in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conjunction with the provisions of the Sentencing Reform 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act makes sufficiently clear Congress's intent that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not sure -- I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not sure "sufficiently clear" is enough.  I think maybe 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

"indisputably clear." 

 

              

I mean, in your -- in your brief you quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be fair, that -- that this is contrary to the thrust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of 924(c), and I'm not sure when you're talking about

this amount of punishment a -- a thrust is enough. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

26 

            

            

MR. YANG:  Well, if --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Congress doesn't 

  

 

 

 

pass thrusts, they pass language, and there's nothing in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the language that prevents the judge from imposing a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence recognizing that the defendant faces 30 years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already. 

            

MR. YANG:  I agree that thrusts are not a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing.  We -- we were quoting the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

quoting. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know what you're 

    

 

 

 

 

MR. YANG:  -- the decision in Abbott.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the Court's decision in Abbot also says that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language compels the imposition of an additional -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I believe this is on 25 of the opinion, this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unanimous opinion of the Court. 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think the Court recognized that when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you look at 924(c), it -- particularly when you look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the drafting history, from 1971 onward where Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was taking step after step after step to restrict the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing instructions --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It didn't say --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's --

you can tell me there's a guideline on this particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

application of the mandatory minimum.  And the statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the guidelines both say a judge can depart for a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason not taken adequately into consideration by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commission. 

            

So unless you can point to me someplace 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where they take this into consideration, although they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might in the future, I would say they didn't take it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into consideration at all. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  I -- I think the --

    

   

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And therefore the language 

  

 

 

 

 

allows it.  The language allows it, and indeed the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory allows it, because the theory is you could have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person there who's convicted of 19 multiple counts, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, and -- and the judge is given considerable power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to work all this out so that you have overall a fair 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence.  All right?  That's the whole argument. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

So what's your response? 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, I guess to the whole 

   

  

 

 

 

 

argument, we have a few responses. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I know you do. 

    

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  But -- but I think -- first of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all, on the -- on the guidelines point, the guidelines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have taken this into account since the very beginning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you were on the Sentencing Commission.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where? 

  

 

28 

MR. YANG:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where did you take this? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. YANG:  Well, the guidelines specifically 

  

 

 

 

 

address in Section 2K2.4, comment note 4, they talk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about how you -- and as well as in Chapter 5 about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining a total sentence based on aggregate 

   

 

 

 

 

sentences, multiple terms of imprisonment.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

guidelines said that what you do with the predicate is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you determine the predicate under the guidelines, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't include the specific offense --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's --

  

 

 

MR. YANG:  -- characteristic of --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm -- I'm going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

let you get back to a fuller answer to Justice Breyer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But that certainly cuts against you, the idea that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize that, yes, you do have to look to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory minimums.  You should take that into account 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in imposing the sentence.  And now you say when it gets 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down to what the actual sentence is, you can't look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mandatory minimums at all. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  I don't think it cuts against us,

about these various factors. 

 

 

 

29 

            

First, I don't think the guidelines shed a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

lot of light on the statutory question here.  If you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were to disagree with our understanding of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines, that would not mean that the statute's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong; it means that the guidelines would have to give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  We are defending the commentary in the guidelines, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which, again, have existed since the very beginning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You look at 2.4.  I missed 

    

  

 

 

 

 

it.  Where -- where is the place on --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  2K2.4, comment note 4.  And --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

and then subsequently, this is also cited in our brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back in the pages around the 40s when we discussed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines. 

            

But about the guidelines in the statute, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines would have to give way.  And we are defending 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the commentary because we think, not only have this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commentary been around since 1987 when the guidelines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were first sent to Congress, and had since been there, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we think this is a sensible distinction between the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct that the court considers when determining the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing of the predicate, and knowing that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct is accounted for separately in the 924(c), and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering the total aggregate sentence.  That is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

something different. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

Congress specified where courts look to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

total aggregate sentence in Section 3584.  In Section 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3584, Congress said, "When there are multiple terms of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imprisonment, the court shall, with respect to each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense, consider the 3554 -- 3553A factors when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding whether to make the total sentence by making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them concurrent or consecutive." 

 

 

 

            

But we know that Section 924(c) wholly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removed that power.  And in doing so, it removed the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power of the court to tailor the total aggregate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence, which is a power that was set to --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the government must 

  

 

 

 

 

recognize that 924(c) can influence the sentence on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate offense because -- I think I'm correct in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying the government takes the position if 924(c) drops 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out if it's not proved, then when it goes back to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court --

 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the district court can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

enlarge the original sentence for the predicate offense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  And because we think -- and this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is what happens in -- in courts, courts are applying the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines.  And the guideline says when you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

calculating the sentence for the predicate, you ignore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the offense conduct with respect to the gun because we

don't want to double-count it.  But if you drop the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

924(c), it should -- it should go back for the court to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider the offense conduct as it considers the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

-- the sentence for the predicate. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

This is a --

   

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where?  Where?  I mean, 

    

  

  

 

I -- my quick reading of 4, I promise I didn't memorize 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the guidelines.  I used to know them pretty well, but I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know them perfectly, by any means, and never did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But it seems to me that comment 4 in 2K2.4 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is saying that -- that defendant, you have committed a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime, and in our guideline as punishment for the crime, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of it is increased because you had a gun.  And so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we're going to apply the mandatory over here, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is our special statute here, don't apply that.  But I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't see anything there that says you can't subtract. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, when you go to 5G1.2, which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governs the total sentence, the -- when you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple offenses with terms of imprisonment, it says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- you calculate the total sentence with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the non-924(c)'s and then you tack on --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  5G? 

  

 

MR. YANG:  1.2, I believe.  This is

MR. YANG:  I think around page 42 of our 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  43.  Nope.  42. 

  

  

  

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe I'll find it. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. YANG:  So the -- the point is the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

this is the way that the guidelines have been applied, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they were applied, in fact, in this way in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  The district court calculated the sentencing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines range, which is 84 to 105 months, based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the guidelines. 

 

            

No one is disputing that's what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines required.  In fact, they conceded that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the proper guideline sentence in district court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then the district court then varied downward, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the provision that you're talking about, about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3553(b) --

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

  

  

 

MR. YANG:  -- part of that was, of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rendered inoperative under --

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's --

  

  

  

 

 

MR. YANG:  -- under Booker -- Booker.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

then -- and what the court did here is a post-Booker 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing, vary.  It's not a technical departure, it's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

variance because he is applying --

 

 

 

 

 

            

varied. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  He varied here.  He

MR. YANG:  He varied.  He varied down to 40 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

months.  And then he additionally said, if I had 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

33 

discretion, I'd go down to one day because I think 30 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years is enough.  But that is essentially a -- just a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagreement with the policy judgment. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  And that's harder for 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you.  It's harder for you, because after all, if it's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variance, he's not applying the guidelines.  If he's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying the guidelines, all this stuff in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines that supports you is out the window.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- including the sentence I read.  And if it's out 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the window, all we're trying to do is back where we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

started, is the statute -- does the statute, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't mention this, forbid it, or is it otherwise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfair? 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, I would, I guess -- first 

   

   

  

 

 

 

of all, we're not relying on the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  My fault, not your fault. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. YANG:  We're not relying on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines as an affirmative.  We just wanted to point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out in our brief we think the guidelines are consistent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what are you suggesting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ought to happen?  I mean, presumably, the guidelines 

    

 

 

 

 

 

reflect an idea that there shouldn't be any

does the court do the -- the sentence on the underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

crime, taking away the fact of the gun? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In other words, most robberies have guns in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them, and the sentences are written to reflect that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have guns in them, don't they?  Aren't they? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  No, actually.  The guidelines 

  

  

 

 

 

take into account things like Hobbs Act robbery and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separately account for the gun with a two-level 

   

 

 

 

 

 

enhancement.  And so the guidelines range, when you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

commit a Hobbs Act robbery without a gun, will just be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the standard Hobbs Act robbery range. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, there are going to be other offense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristics if you injure someone or -- you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these things can affect --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What you think ought to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happen is that the -- is that the judge should say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay, imagine a robbery without a gun, what would be a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable sentence for that. 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  I think the judge should do --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

take into account what judges normally do under a real 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense sentencing approach, which is you look at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense conduct, you look at the history and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristics of the defender --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, offense conduct, does 

  

 

 

 

 

that mean without a gun?

MR. YANG:  But -- but without the gun.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

say -- we think the judge has discretion, ultimately, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either consider it with the gun or -- or not because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress hasn't expressly prohibited that.  But the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines approach, which we think is permissible, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to consider it; you consider it without the gun and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- the reason for that is the guidelines say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress has separately provided -- remember, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative history, I think, there are -- Senator 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Mansfield, that kind of was the -- the main proponent of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the relevant text, the very stringent sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions, made clear that the whole purpose of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was to impose this additional sentence and require 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional time in prison solely for the choice to use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the gun, so the guidelines --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that -- that's an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

excerpt from the legislative history that, it seems to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me, is unimportant in light of what 3553 says.  3553(a) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, you know, well, that the judge at the end of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day has to consider the need for the sentence imposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reflect the serious of the offense and so forth. And --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  But the 3553 --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it seems to me you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking us to say that 924(c) really supersedes 3553.

apply on its own terms.  It doesn't apply on its own 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

terms.  If you look through the Sentencing Reform Act, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are at least nine provisions, all of which, when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're looking at them, fine or imprisonment or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probation or whatever it might be, the court -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision says, the court shall, in setting this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence, consider the 3553(a) factors. 

 

 

 

 

            

In addition, with respect to multiple terms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of imprisonment -- and this is on page -- I believe it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5A of our -- excuse me -- 11A of our appendix.  If you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at 3584(b), it says, "The court, in determining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether terms imposed to be" -- "are to be ordered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrently or consecutively, shall consider for each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense" -- remember, this is multiple offenses -- "each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense for which a term of imprisonment is being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed the factors set forth in 3553(a)." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, normally, what happens is the courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will determine individual sentences.  So you could have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a sentence of seven years and a sentence of another 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seven years, and then maybe one is capped at five.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then the court says, I've got these individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences.  I sentence for each offense.  What's the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

total sentence?  You could make that five and seven and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seven.  You could make it 19.  Or you could just make it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seven.  It depends on whether you make them consecutive

or concurrent. 

 

37 

            

So the question about the total imprisonment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you have multiple terms of -- of -- with multiple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses with terms of imprisonment is 3554(b) affects 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, and it says that's where you apply the 3553(a) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors to determine the total length.  But Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

took that power away.  Congress took that power away 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

totally in 924(c) by directing that you cannot do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You must impose them consecutively. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well that's where I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

understand your -- your answer to Justice Kennedy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because you said, no, you're not saying that 924 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supersedes 3553.  I think you have to be saying that. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You might still be right, but you have to be saying that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's this background principle, which is 3553, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is this parsimony principle and all these factors, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then 924 comes along and says, but not here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  I guess in a sense we are saying 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

that, but I don't think it -- it operates directly on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3553(a), because I don't think 3553(a) operates as a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

freestanding -- freestanding provision.  It comes into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

play at various points in the Sentencing Reform Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the court -- the Congress has said, you consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors in making this determination.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

setting -- deciding whether to set on the amount of a

38 

fine, you look at the 35 --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  One way you might look at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, and this goes back to what the Chief Justice said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he said, well, when there's a 30-year sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

implicated, you better be pretty clear.  And also when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're legislating against a fairly strong background 

   

 

 

 

 

principle of 3553, you better be pretty clear that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're displacing that background principle. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  But the --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And here, you're just not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you just have not been clear enough.  You were clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough in 1028(a).  We know what that looks like.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, you just haven't been clear enough to upset this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background presumption. 

 

            

MR. YANG:  We think that it's clear enough 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because 3553(a) applies by -- when you -- for purposes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of setting the total term of imprisonment, the only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason 3553(a) applies is because Congress provided that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are to be considered in 3584(b) in setting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consecutive or concurrent sentence.  And so that has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been removed.  That has been removed. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

If it were true that 3553(a) just generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a free-floating provision that applied everywhere, 

   

 

 

 

 

then all the nine provisions of the Sentencing Reform 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act that specifically say you must consider the 353 --

53 factors with respect to these specific types of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences would be superfluous. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  If this case had arisen 

  

 

 

 

 

 

39 

before the Sentencing Reform Act was adopted, I -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that Dean's argument would certainly be correct, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would it not? 

 

 

            

difficult --

 

            

MR. YANG:  I think we would have a more 

    

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  The judge would have 

  

 

 

 

 

complied with the statute, the term wasn't consecutive, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and other than that, it was discretionary.  So it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely within the judge's discretion. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  I think what we would have to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

argue in that case is that the Congress would have known 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the traditional place that judges determine the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggregate length of a sentence, when there are multiple 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses carrying terms of imprisonment, is in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination that -- of whether the sentences run 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrently or consecutively. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  At a minimum, you would have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

had a very tough argument.  On the other hand, if this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case had arisen before we decided Booker, if you read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the guidelines correctly -- and it does seem to be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they do seem to say what you say they say -- then you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would clearly be correct. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. YANG:  Yeah. 

  

 

40 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So we're in this kind of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

weird -- we're -- we're in this weird world that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has created where the guidelines are advisory, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then they're not advisory, and so that's why we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this problem; is that correct? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

because --

 

MR. YANG:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  You don't want to say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

with you. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- nobody but me would agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. YANG:  We -- we -- we obviously accept 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Booker as the proper interpretation of the law -- of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution.  But I think what I would say is that the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines -- there might be a slightly different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

analysis.  And I think the guidelines would then provide 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

yet an additional --

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Yang --

  

 

 

 

MR. YANG:  -- reason that we're correct. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- I mean, the lack of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

beauty of the guidelines is they're so artificial on so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many levels; all right?  What differentiates a normal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

theft from a robbery is the use of force.  And the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines, in defining the guidelines range for a

theft, starts at a much, much lower base level.  Starts 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at a seven, okay?  For a robbery, it starts at a base 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

level of 20. 

 

 

41 

            

Once you start with that huge difference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the use of force and the nonuse of force, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously, the robbery guideline is always going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include the use of force.  The fact that it might be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a gun as opposed to a knife as opposed to a threat 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of violence or whatever else you want to define it, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use of force is inherent already in the guideline 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculation because, otherwise, that -- there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason.  They could have just had one table and said, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you rob someone, if it was a pure calculation, as you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggest it, without thinking about the gun, it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been $20,000 is taken, we're all going to start at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a offense level of five years and build up from there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's not what the guidelines do. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So when you're taking discretion away from a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge, I think that's one of the reasons we often 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require specificity, because the guidelines are 

 

 

 

 

 

artificial in so many different ways.  And there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gyrations that we go through as judges to comply with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dictates that are not very often very clear. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, I think -- I'm not here to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

criticize the guidelines.  I think the guidelines have

worked for quite some time and have brought some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationality to sentencing that didn't previously exist, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which was an important thing.  The guidelines post 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Booker, of course, advisory -- are advisory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- that's what I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

trying -- I'm not criticizing, not criticizing.  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to figure out what's the right system, putting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case aside. 

 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  Well, we --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, if we had the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines there -- try this.  If the guidelines were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, it wouldn't be such a problem, because they would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have -- the commission could look into this and it could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take the factor into account.  And then we'd have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3553(b) and we'd follow that in the future unless it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrational. 

            

But they're out the window.  Okay.  They're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

out the window because it was a variance.  So now we're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left with 924(c), you know, the statute, and we're also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left with the provision that says that a -- a court of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals has to look at a departure or a variance and see 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it's reasonable.  Is that the right word?  Reasonable 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

or rational or something.  What's the word?

MR. YANG:  -- that you'd have to look to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness of the sentence overall. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Over -- what -- what is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

it -- there's a word in the appellate part when they're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing the review.  Is it reasonable or -- you know, I'll 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look it up. 

 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  I think it is reasonable. 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, I think it is too. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Okay.  So now --

  

 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  Reasonable always is a good word. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Correct, correct, correct. 

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So that's the -- that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the question in this case beyond the case is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really, how do we do that?  And so -- so what I would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try out is, it would be obvious if you're right and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute is clear; okay?  The -- the 924(c).  Then you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

win.  That's the end of it.  That's what you think.  I 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think it's clear. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

If it's not clear, what do we do? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. YANG:  Well, I think --

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And now -- now, what about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking -- looking to see what the commission said about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, noting that this is an individual case, not general,

other things.  Now you tell me.  Those are floating 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

around in my mind.  I'd like to know what's floating 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around in your mind. 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  I -- I don't believe the 

    

   

 

 

 

commission gets any deference with respect to construing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal statutes. 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I --

   

  

 

 

MR. YANG:  With respect to the guidelines, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

yes, but with respect to construing Federal statutes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I don't think so.  And so what we're back to is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

924(c) and its interaction to the various provisions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Sentencing Reform Act. 

 

 

 

            

The -- the key provisions, they rely on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3553(a) and they say look, you have to consider all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors, but 3553(a) applies in very specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

places of the Sentencing Reform Act, including when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are multiple terms of imprisonment and a court has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide what the total imprisonment is going to be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Counsel --

  

 

 

MR. YANG:  That's 3584, and that's been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

taken away because Congress took away the power to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have concurrent sentences. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you think the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case is resolved at a higher level, it seems to me that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your -- your friend has a very good technical argument 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

that says these sentences have to run concurrently.  One 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

day, they run concurrently, end of case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And your argument is, you know, you look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the drafting history, the commentary to 2K2.4, all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other arguments you got and you make -- make -- and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic one is well, that's technically correct, but it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously not what Congress had in mind.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously had in mind adding the mandatory onto a normal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence, one way or another, under -- under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines in 30 and all the provisions we've been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about. 

 

            

So if you view the case that way, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

technically correct, you know, contrary to the obvious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy, what -- what case can you give me that tells us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how to approach a conflict like that? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  Well, our --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's your --

  

 

 

 

 

what's your best case when you have a very significant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanction in the balance, and you have technical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compliance on one hand, but clearly contrary to purpose? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  We don't think that the -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're technically correct. 

 

 

            

that. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I understand 

   

  

 

 

MR. YANG:  We -- we think that there is a

plausible argument that they make on the text, but we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that the proper approach is you always have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach statutes holistically.  You look at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statutory text; you look at the Congress's text 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

structure, the context --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but then there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are also these basic rules they -- I mean, you insist 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when citizens deal with the government that they turn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

square corners, and I think it's right for a criminal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

defendant when they're facing 30 additional years to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insist that the government turn square corners. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, I think what you might be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

referring to is the principle of lenity.  But the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has repeatedly emphasized -- I think Abramski; one of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan's recent opinions explains this -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lenity applies only if there's a grievous ambiguity that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you might -- at the end of the day you --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I don't think you have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to go to a principle of lenity for Mr. Stoler to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  I mean, you were just saying this is very much 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along the lines of what the Chief Justice was saying. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You would just say something like, look, if we're going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be strictly textualist here, this does not have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of requirement you wish it had, which is to say it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have the language that's in 1028A.  Your

essential argument is that, read Mr. Stoler's way, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

would utterly eviscerate (c)(1)(D)(ii), the consecutive 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement.  And I'm quite sympathetic to that.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's still this question of when a statute doesn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say what you would like it to say and you're reduced to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying if you read it the other guy's way, it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eviscerate what we -- what we meant when we passed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another provision, you know, what -- what should we do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and where do you point us? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  I would say that it's true that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- it eviscerates the purpose and the whole structure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the statute, but the statute says a lot by removing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  So the question is what authority was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

removed.  I -- I think it's helpful to look at page 11A 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the government's appendix, 3584.  3584(b) governs the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary decision of a judge when there are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

multiple terms of imprisonment, how do you decide the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total length.  The total length is set by making them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrent or consecutive, and 3554(b) -- or 3584(b), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry, specifically says that in deciding the total 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

length by making consecutive or concurrent, you apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the factors set forth in 3553(a).  That's what they rely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on. 

            

But 924(c) removes that authority.  924(c) 

  

 

 

 

 

removes the authority to be able to set the total length

of imprisonment when there are multiple terms of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imprisonment. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you're saying that in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this case, the judge says I can't look at 3553(a)? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  No, he does.  The -- the judge --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are various other places, but for the total --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but -- but other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

than for the initial downward departure. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  But -- but -- but for the total. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You -- for -- you can look at 3553(a) in setting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual terms, but Congress separately addressed how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you make those terms, how you add them, make them -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total, it depends on the aggregate; right?  You --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether you add them or run them concurrently or with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each other.  So that is what 3554(b) -- or 3584(b) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addresses, and that's where the 3553(a) factors are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied, but Congress took that authority away. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's -- that's what I think speaks 

   

 

 

 

 

volumes.  And -- and when you look at the structure of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Sentencing Reform Act, the -- the Sentencing Reform 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act kind of has a modified real offense sentencing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach.  You take a look at the -- the offender, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristics of the offender, the history.  Not only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the offense conduct, you look beyond this particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense, conduct broadly, what's all the relevant

conduct, critic conduct --

 

 

 

49 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're -- you're asking 

  

 

 

 

 

the judge to say, in calculating the sentence for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying offense, I'm going to look at all these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors.  Frankly, it's meaningless, because what I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

going to do in the 924(c), but I'll do something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaningless. 

            

MR. YANG:  No, no, no, not at all.  If --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if, for instance, a judge would say, as in this case, an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate sentence is 40 months, right?  The judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says an appropriate sentence for this -- each of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four has a 40-month term.  In a normal world, if there 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

was also a five-year sentence, the judge would then go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to 3584(b) and say I'm going to consider the 3553 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors to decide if I'm going to add the 40 to the five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years, or I'm going to just run them concurrently so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's five years total.  That's what normally happens. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Section 924(c) says you can't do that.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to add it.  It is add -- in addition to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment, the punishment for the predicate offense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so we think that simply underscores what -- what has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always been the -- the thrust, the understanding of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of 924(c). 

 

            

It is a harsh provision.  There is no doubt. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

But Congress intended that to be harsh because of the

extreme danger presented when you add a gun to either a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress made that determination that it's going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least five additional years for the gun, and if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a second or subsequent, 25 years.  Disagreement 

   

  

 

 

 

 

with that length of an imprisonment simply circumvents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Congress was doing in 924(c). 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If -- if you -- if you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the realm of what's reasonable and the judge is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at, well, you are under the appellate provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because he's varied from the guidelines, of course, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to give the mandatory minimum, there it is, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gun, 25 years.  And now the judge thinks, you know, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is way beyond what this guy did.  It's fine for the gun, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but his total conduct here was -- doesn't warrant such a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long sentence. 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  On appellate --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's in -- it's in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other part, it's a reasonable thing given this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

individual who may suffer certain individual things, da, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

da, da. 

 

            

            

MR. YANG:  Congress --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  A reasonable thing to give 

    

 

 

 

 

him one day.

You don't do a reasonable --

   

 

 

 

51 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, yeah. 

  

 

 

MR. YANG:  -- analysis. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  If think that, then you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

win; that's the end of it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  And -- and that's why, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you have a predicate offense that Congress said add 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this additional mandatory on, you don't look to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

length of the total, because maybe -- maybe 30 years, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judge's view, is not reasonable, but Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required that. 

 

            

That is a separate -- that is for Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide what the minimum is going to be for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

924(c).  What would be reasonable is when you take a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at the predicate offense and you say would this be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a reasonable -- one day for four felonies, would that be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable?  And the answer to that is of course not, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as -- as my brother conceded at -- in his argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, again, I think the whole -- the idea 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a judge would go down to one day because of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagreement with the length of the mandatory minimum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply circumvents the statute and is inconsistent with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

924(c)'s text.

Five minutes, Mr. Stoler.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN G. STOLER 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  There's no affirmative ban in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

district courts considering 924(c) sentencing when 

 

 

 

 

 

considering the predicate offenses, and given the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overarching theme of -- of discretion and parsimony 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pervades. 

            

The -- the -- counsel for the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to indicate that we look at 3584(b), we agree that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it limits -- that there has to be that 30-year 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consecutive sentence, but it just guides the court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion with respect to the 3553(a) factors.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't say that they only apply to each count, not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggregate sentence.  And you look at 3584 and you read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the third provision, it talks about the aggregate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence in itself. 

 

 

            

So the -- the reliance by the government on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3584 is -- we -- we say is misplaced and does not affect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not the -- the total sentencing scheme that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the parsimony requirements put on ends the result of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court determining what sentence is sufficient, but not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greater than necessary. 

 

 

            

We don't quarrel that 30 years must be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed under the mandatory minimums.  What we do

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

quarrel with is whether or not the court should be able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to take that -- those factors into consideration, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53 

well as all those other factors that are set forth in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3553(a), 3551, 3661, which gives us the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination to be made as to what the -- what should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be the appropriate sentence in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

If there's no other questions. 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I was thinking of at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a deep level of what Thomas Reed Powell said about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  He wants us to think of this second part, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, as related, but really no.  Look at the second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part, keep it totally separate, and the statute means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the part about robbery has to be done separately. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reed Powell said if the -- you can think of a thing that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is inextricably related to another thing without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking of the thing to which it is inextricably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

related, you then have the legal mind. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what he wants us to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do.  He says that's what the statute requires. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STOLER:  We submit that the statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't be read that way in this instance, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think it matters that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a 30-year mandatory minimum?  What if it was a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one-year mandatory minimum.  Would the result be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

different? 

            

court's --

 

            

            

54 

MR. STOLER:  It may.  I mean, that's the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  It would?  Really? 

  

  

 

 

MR. STOLER:  Well, it -- it may be different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the standpoint -- no.  The one-year has to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed. 

            

okay? 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  A year and a day would be 

    

   

 

 

 

 

MR. STOLER:  If, under the -- the total test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of reasonableness and applying the factors the court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed to apply, makes that decision that he thinks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that that -- he or she thinks that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate sentence, that -- that may be right, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's going to be subject to the test of substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness on appeal.  And the -- here in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance, it's -- it's a different scenario because it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 years, Your Honor, and that's what we're saying. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
