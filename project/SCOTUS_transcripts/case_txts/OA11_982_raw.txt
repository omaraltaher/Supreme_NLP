 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If -- if I were to write 
7  an -- an opinion indicating that there's a chill here 
8  because distributors and retailers will see that there's 
9  been this suit against the -- your client and they will 
be reluctant to distribute, would there -- would I just 
10
11 
make that up?  Or is there something I can read to find 
12 
out -- to find that out, or --
13
14  fact, and injury in fact is based on evidence. 
15
16 
17 
18
19
20
21
22  in this case.  The first is that the Petitioner's cost 
23  of operation is increased because the disputed claim was 
24  not expunged.  When the Petitioner designs and sells new 
25

here was that they did need investors, and investors 
were reluctant. 

 MR. DABNEY:  That's correct. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It wasn't specific 

evidence, but then I -- anything besides that? 

 MR. DABNEY:  There are three forms of injury 

 MR. DABNEY:  Injury in fact is a question of 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the -- the evidence 

products, it has to go through an incredibly costly

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. DABNEY:  It certainly is.  The 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When you said it's 

incredibly costly to do this and so forth, is that in 
the record? 

 MR. DABNEY:  That specific statement is not 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, it makes sense, 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay.  Is that -- is that 

1  process to determine whether or not its next line of 
2  shoes might give rise to a plausible claim --
3
4  in the record? 
5
6  Petitioner says, through its president, on page 173 of 
7  the Joint Appendix, that he's engaged in new --
8  development of new shoe lines, which by definition are 
9  outside the scope of the covenant document. 
10
11 
12 
13
14  in the record. 
15
16 
17 
18
19  brought that up because, under the mootness doctrine, 
20
21  relevant to mootness fell on the Respondent.  Under this 
22  Court's precedents, the Respondent in this case, in 
23  order to oust the district court of jurisdiction, had to 
24  show two things to a high degree of probability.  The 
first thing the Respondent had to show is that it was 
25

but I -- I'm a little reluctant to take judicial notice 
of the shoe business.  I mean --

the burden of proof on that and every other fact 

 MR. DABNEY:  Your Honor, I'm glad you 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You're right, that's the 


 So I would like you to refer me to the 

perhaps more calmly about this than I might feel is 

1  absolutely clear that the Petitioner could not 

2  reasonably be expected --

3
4  standard.  And so you said that -- I mean, I feel 

5
6  warranted, but the -- the question is, is there anything 
7  here that you -- so you said, by definition, we're going 
8  to produce some new shoes, which new shoes are not -- do 
9  not have the appearance of any current and/or previous 
footwear product designs and any colorable imitations 
10
11 
thereof. 
12
13  record where your president of your client or somebody 
14  else says, we are intending to produce some new shoes 
that fall outside that definition, and of course, I will 
15
16  look at that, because your opponent says we can find no 
17  reasonable likelihood that they are going to produce 
18  anything or they have any present intent of showing --
19  of producing something that falls outside that 
20
21
22  definitely going to.  So just refer me to those pages in 
23  the record that shows that because, of course, you win, 
24  if that's true. 
25

MR. DABNEY:  Page 173A of the record, of the 

definition. 

 But now, you just said, oh, no, we're 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but that isn't the 
point.  The point is, is the new footwear that you're 

1  Joint Appendix, states that, "The Petitioner is" 
2  intending -- "is regularly engaged in the design of new 
3  footwear." 
4
5
6  designing footwear that is not -- does not have the 
7  appearance of any current or previous footwear product 
8  designs or any colorable imitation thereof?  And so to 
9  say you are in the business of producing new footwear, 
at least, to me, suggests nothing because the question 
10
11  is what the footwear looks like, not that you're 
12  producing new footwear. 
13
14  a business competitor --
15
16 
17
 MR. DABNEY:  The record does not show that 
18  the Petitioner lacks any concrete interest in entering 
19  the line of commerce that --
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

JUSTICE BREYER:  And does it show anything 
at all in respect that would support the claim that you 
are going to produce new footwear that doesn't either 
resemble, nor is a colorable imitation of anything that 
you have previously produced or is the subject of the 
case? 

 MR. DABNEY:  Your Honor, in the real world, 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I'm not interested in 

the real world.  I am interested in the record. 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. DABNEY:  Your Honor, what the record 

the new footwear will be -- look like under a new 
standard, or is there enough here already to say, well, 
really, the judges could conclude that there is no real 
likelihood that you're going to produce something that 
won't look like what's already been produced. 

MR. DABNEY:  We would respectfully submit 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Period? 
 MR. DABNEY:  Period. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So I take it that 

1
2  shows -- and it is what it is -- is that the petitioner 
3  is actively engaged in designing and bringing out new 
4  footwear products and --
5
6
7
8  this case really boils down to should you have -- should 
9  they have or you both have another chance to say what

15

17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22 
23
24  your point, that you shouldn't be put through the 
25

that, when you apply the mootness doctrine, since we're 
not talking about picking a fight here, we're talking 
about someone who was sued once -- once bitten, twice 
shy -- that when someone has been sued for alleged 
infringement has asked for a judgment that would 
eliminate any need to think about whether or not a new 
shoe will attract --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, and I assume that was 

trouble of figuring out whether the new shoes that you

 MR. DABNEY:  That would itself be --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, again, there's -- do 

MR. DABNEY:  The law is that, as I stand 

1  produce are close enough to the old one to be covered or 
2  are not.  You're at risk --
 MR. DABNEY:  Exactly. 
3
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- right? 
4
MR. DABNEY:  Exactly. 
5
6
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I would think that you 
7  would add this as well, that, for a competitor to demand 
8  that the other competitor tell its plans, its marketing, 
9  is, to say the least, patronizing, and -- and probably 
10
11
12
13  I just know that because I'm a judge?  Or is there 
14  someplace I can look for that?

16 
17

19

here today, the government has registered a claim that 
the Petitioner is duty-bound not to bring out the shoe 
shown in the registration, number one, which according 
to the Respondent is one of the best-selling, most 
profitable shoe styles of all time; and also, as I stand 
here today, the law is that Petitioner is at risk if it 
brings out a shoe that is going to be giving rise to a 
plausible claim --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, Mr. Dabney, are you 
saying that this device of the unilateral covenant is no 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

say, judge, this covenant doesn't give us adequate 
protection, it should be amended, and then say what you 
think you need to be adequately covered? 

1  good, unless it says that you will never be sued for any 
2  shoe that you ever produce?  Is -- are you saying that 
3  the covenant is no good or that this covenant is 
4  deficient? 
MR. DABNEY:  I'm saying that the Respondent 
5
6  bore the burden of proving that the covenant completely 
7  and irrevocably eradicated all of that. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So -- if -- if you are 
8
9  uneasy about the covenant as it exists, why didn't you 
10
11 
12 
13
 MR. DABNEY:  Because the Petitioner asks for 
14  judgment in accordance with law, and it would prefer not 
15
16  sued it. 
17
18  that, if they gave you a covenant that said, vis-à-vis 
19  your company, our trademark, the form of this shoe, is 
invalid, we won't sue you for anything, either an exact 
20
21  duplicate or any colorable imitation thereof with 
22  respect to this design; would that be enough for you? 
23
24
25

to be the involuntary licensee of the Respondent that 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, does that mean 

 MR. DABNEY:  Your Honor, again --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know you want to help 

everybody else -­

the marketplace have to react to official government 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You get a lot of 

 MR. DABNEY:  That's -- that's not actually 

right.  The reason why -- 70 years ago, Learned Hand 

 MR. DABNEY:  Not -- no --
 JUDGE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but why wouldn't that 

1
2
3  be --
4
5
6  created the metaphor, "the scarecrow patent."  And the 
7  reason scarecrows are effective is not because they are 
8  likely to climb down from the pole, but because, from a 
9  distance and being looked at quickly, the way people in 
10
11  records of claims, they're deceptive.  So --
12
13  what this extra stuff -- you know, that you say, well, 
14  even if this is all right, they're not going to sue me 
for that, there's all the collateral damage.  You get a 
15
16  significant amount of that by the covenant not to sue. 
17  Nike can't go around giving out these covenants left and 
18  right because, if they do, they will undermine their own 
19  trademark. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

actually reasserts the allegation that these shoes 
infringe.  The covenant does nothing more than purport 
to waive --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where does it --

where does it do that? 

MR. DABNEY:  Your Honor, the -- the covenant 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So if you 

MR. DABNEY:  There would be one small little 

less bit of injury in this case.  That's --

 MR. DABNEY:  It says it right on the -- on 

1
2  page -- I believe it is 96 of -- of the record, where it 
3  says, in the second whereas, "the actions complained of 
4  no longer infringe or dilute at a level sufficient to 
warrant the substantial time and expense."  I mean, it 
5
6  libels --
7
8  take -- if that were taken out, is your case the same or 
9  not? 
10
11 
12
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess maybe 
13  this is the same question Justice Ginsburg was asking. 
14  You're -- you're a lawyer in this area.  You want to 
write a covenant that will satisfy the fellow on the 
15
16  other side, but what does it say?  Can you do that?  Or 
17  do you have to say, the only way this case can be 
18  rendered moot is if the trademark is totally 
19  invalidated? 
20
21
22  of a yes or no answer.  Can you write a covenant that 
23  says something other than the trademark is totally 
24  invalidated? 
25

MR. DABNEY:  When someone seeks --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, that's kind 

MR. DABNEY:  No. 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company

you --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're saying 

unheard of, nobody -- nobody can do this? 

 MR. DABNEY:  The practice in this case dates 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why? 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- what you're saying is 

1
2
3
4
5
6
7  that, in this case, there's no way -- I mean, I thought 
8  it was a practice that was not unprecedented for parties 
9  to grant covenants of this sort.  You're saying this is 
10
11
12  to 1995.  This is a totally recent, controversial 
13  practice that has never been embraced by this Court at 
14  all.  In fact, it was articulated in a case two years 
15
16
17  Mr. Dabney.  The question is:  Is there any covenant 
18  that exists in the world that would make you feel 
19  secure?  And I suppose I'm having a little bit of 
difficulty with the answer, with an answer that says, 
20
21  no, there is no covenant that you can write that would 
22  make us feel secure. 
23
24  Honor, that the registration causes informational 
25

injury.  And what the Respondent is trying to do is to 

after --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's not the question, 

 MR. DABNEY:  The -- the reason is, Your 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. DABNEY:  The question the trademark 

another trademark.  But that's not the issue.  The issue 
is whether you're infringing this design. 

1  hang on to government action that disadvantages its 
2  competitor, while --
3
4  my solution was that they would give you a covenant 
5
6  vis-à-vis you, you can imitate, counterfeit, use this 
7  design, only vis-à-vis you.  Why doesn't that protect 
8  you fully?  Because what they're saying to you is, copy 
9  the design if you want, so long as you're not using 
10
11 
12
13  practitioners get asked every day is whether something 
14  is available.  And so long as that question is asked, a 
covenant that's in the file of a company is not going to 
15
16  prevent deception and confusion of people who look and 
17  say, oh, this is a protected design. 
18
19  different answer than the one you gave me when I asked 
20
21  an involuntary licensee of Nike. 
 MR. DABNEY:  That is a second form of injury 
22
23  that we have now, as Justice Scalia pointed out.  Right 
24  now, we cannot just ignore the claim and bring out 
25

the same question.  You said because we don't want to be

3  blanche that -- that Nike would give you.  What is the 
4  significance of your being an involuntary licensee?

1  its voluntary compliance moots a case, and what they're 
2  claiming is that this -- a covenant moots the case, 
3  moots the case, the covenant they gave, there's the 
4  formidable burden -- you know, it's formidable, you're 
5  quite right -- of showing it is absolutely clear, 
6  correct, that the allegedly wrongful behavior, namely, 
7  their suing, but their suing in respect to this kind of 
8  shoe, could not reasonably be expected to recur. 
9
 And they say, since we promised in an 
10  enforceable promise not to repeat this behavior ever --
11  100 years, how could it be expected reasonably to recur? 
12  How could our behavior, namely suing for infringement in 
13  respect to a shoe like this, be reasonably expected to 
14  recur, given our covenant?  And your response to that 
15  is? 
16
17  seeks to extinguish is not simply the particular rights 
18  of action that they have covenanted not to exert.  The 
19  claim that is sought to be extinguished is the much 
20  broader government-registered claim of right to exclude 
21  competition in the sale of shoes that embody that design.

1  the various interests that you're asserting now -- we're 
2  not talking about mootness, but we're talking about 
3  Article III standing. 
4
5
6  you're alleging, that you have plans to introduce 
7  particular shoes.  People are considering investing in 
8  your company.  Your opponent has intimidated retailers. 
9  If you brought a suit by yourself, is that sufficient to 
establish Article III standings?  Are those the sort of 
10
11 
concrete and tangible injuries that we've required? 
12
13  distinct and concrete and palpable injury in that --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just because you 
14
plan to introduce a particular line of shoes, you can 
15
16  bring a lawsuit? 
17
18
19  because people are considering investing -- somebody who 
20
21  thinking of investing in it, and therefore, you want to 
22  proceed with your lawsuit? 
 MR. DABNEY:  It is undeniable, by law, that

 MR. DABNEY:  Yes, but we're a direct 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Dabney, suppose there 

had been no infringement claim, could you have -- but 

1
2  would not establish Article III standings.  Everybody's 
3  cost of operation is increased whenever there's any 
4  trademark at all because you have to check and see 
5

8  unlawful restraint on our freedom to operate. 
9
10
11  you're in the shoe business and you're -- you're 
12  worried -- could you have brought a declaratory action 
13  or an action for an injunction to have the trademark 
14  declared invalid?

25

MR. DABNEY:  When our shoes were launched, 
it obviously never even occurred to the petitioner that 
they could be deemed an infringement of any rights of 
this respondent.  So the answer is we were not injured 
at that point.  But now, that we've been sued -- once

But since we're in a mootness case and we've been sued 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if that's the case -- if 
the difference is that you've been sued, then it should 
be adequate protection, if you know that you won't be 
sued again.  And that's why there's the question of what 
kind of covenant would give you adequate protection that 
you won't be sued again? 

1  injury-in-fact is universally applicable.  So we did not 
2  allege -- and I don't believe we had injury-in-fact when 
3  our shoes were launched.  So, no, of course, there would 
4  not have been a suit that could be brought at that time.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I read this affidavit as 
7  saying, we're in the shoe industry, we're going to make 
8  new shoes regularly, we want to copy their shoe, we 
9  don't think it's protected by trademark, we want to copy 
it -- they don't say -- and that's something on rebuttal 
10
11 
that maybe Petitioner will explain -- that we want to 
copy it exactly.  But what they're saying is, we want to 
12 
13 
copy it because it's a free form.  That's really what I 
read their affidavit as saying. 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  they have to state that they intend to make products 
20
21
22  That's what I thought their affidavit said, and I 
23  thought the court below said, no, you've got to show us 
24  the product. 
25

So if -- why do they have to actually -- do 
they have to produce their design to prove they're doing 
that? 

 MS. ANDERS:  I think what they have to do is 

that may be outside the covenant.  And now --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But saying it is enough? 

MS. ANDERS:  I think the -- the affidavit 

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  says that they intend to produce new shoes as a general 
2  matter.  It doesn't tell us what those shoes may be, 
3  whether they -- it doesn't give us a way of knowing 
4  whether they might fall outside the covenant. 
And I --
5
6
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Please, now go back to 
7  my question.  Is it enough to just say it?  Or do they 
8  have to produce the designs, so that the Court and Nike 
9  can decide -- it is Nike, right? -- the Court and Nike 
can decide whether the shoe is a colorable imitation or 
10
11 
an exact copy. 
12
 MS. ANDERS:  I think that could depend on 
13  the breadth of the covenant.  I think, in some cases, 
14  for instance, if the covenant doesn't cover any future 
15
16  allege, we intend to make future products that aren't 
17  covered.

correct? 

1  going to say anything particular.  We're just going to 
2  say that we're in the business of making shoes, and we 
3  might make a shoe.  Would that -- would that -- that 
4  would not be enough under your standard; is that 
5
6
 MS. ANDERS:  I think that's right.  I think 
7  if the parties went back on remand in this case -- and 
8  we do think there should be a remand here -- but if the 
9  parties went back and we had the exact same facts, and 
Nike said that anything that was a colorable imitation 
10
11 
of Already's shoes was covered by the covenant, and 
Already came back and said, just generally, we're making 
12 
13 
new shoes, I think, in that situation, it would be 
relatively easy for Nike to show that the possibility 
14 
that Already would be impacted by the covenant -- or 
15
impacted by the trademark, I'm sorry -- would be 
16 
17 
speculative. 
18
19
20
21  remand?  I mean, it sounds as though we're remanding for 
22  no purpose, given what Already has said throughout the 
23  course of the litigation and, indeed, in this Court 
24  today. 
25

 So that --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Given what Already has said 

in this case, why is it that you think that we should 

MS. ANDERS:  I think there are two reasons.

And the second is that there was some

1  The first is that, when this Court establishes a new 

2  standard, it often -- it traditionally will remand to 

3  allow the courts -- the lower courts to apply that 

4  standard in the first instance. 

5
6  uncertainty about what the covenant meant below.  So 
7  Nike represented that the covenant covered the existing 
8  shoes, and Already said, in its motion to dismiss 
9  briefing, that it thought that the covenant did not --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
for Nike to try to establish that -- that the dispute is 
20
21  not reasonably likely to recur.  It could get discovery 
22  into --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So then -- so then the 
23
24  covenant not to sue gives Nike an advantage that no 
25

future shoes are clearly -- and I thought the counsel 
for the Petitioner might have -- might have added this 
in his answer to Justice Sotomayor, that its future 
shoes are not covered by this.  And the -- if -- if Nike 
has the heavy burden of proof, can it have discovery and 
take depositions on what their plans are, what their 
marketing plans are, what designs they're thinking 
about? 

 MS. ANDERS:  I think that would be one way 

other manufacturer has.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you mean any 

 MS. ANDERS:  Well, we think it makes sense 

1
2  the --
3
4  manufacturer without -- without any litigation can ask 
Already, well, tell us your plans, what shoes are you 
5
6  thinking about? 
7
 MS. ANDERS:  Well, once Already produces --
8  once Already identifies what its future activities may 
9  be --
10
11 
12
13  for Already to have to -- have to at least identify here 
14  what activities it thinks may not be outside the 
covenant.  And I don't think that hurts Already, and the 
15
16  reason is that if -- if Already's evidence convinces the 
17  court that the case isn't moot, then Already gets its 
18  adjudication on the related --
19
20
21  demand what its future plans are. 
 MS. ANDERS:  Well, it will get -- the 
22
23  trademark will be -- will be adjudicated if -- if 
24  Already convinces the Court the action isn't --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So Nike has an advantage 
over Already that no other manufacturers had.  It can

1  question on that, and it's a little bit off of what 
2  we've been talking about.  You say, in your brief, well, 
3  now, don't worry, what you can do is you can go to the 
4  trademark -- the PTO board, and they'll -- they'll 
adjudicate this mark.  And so -- you know, you can 
5
6  really go out of the courts and go to the 
7  administrators. 
 Suppose Already goes to the administrative 
8
9  agency and loses.  Can it have judicial review?  And is 
there -- is standing easier to show, once there has been 
10
11 
an adverse action in the administrative office?  Or are 
we right back where we started?  So once you go to the 
12 
13 
agency and you try to appeal, the Court says, well, this 
is an Article III court, we need a case of controversy, 
14 
and you're right back where we are now? 
15
16
17  that.  The first is that we are not proposing that the 
18  Court should dismiss discretionarily every action just 
19  because the TTAB exists and can adjudicate --
20
21 
22 
 MS. ANDERS:  What we're proposing here is 
23
24  that, as a function of the Court's broader discretion 
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That was a big part of 
your argument.  You were telling us, oh, don't worry, 
you can always go to the patent level. 

 MS. ANDERS:  Well, a couple of points on 

under the Declaratory Judgment Act and United States v.

Alderson Reporting Company

discretionarily dismiss. 

 So that would be a situation in which there 

in this case as it would be if they sought judicial 
review from an adverse order of the administrative 
agency? 

1  W. T. Grant, is that when the Court believes that it 
2  probably does -- does have jurisdiction but it doesn't 
3  think that the likelihood of a dispute is -- is really 
4  that great, that in that situation, it can

6
7  is Article III --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  My -- my question is: 
8
9  Is the Article III requirement that Already has the same 
10
11 
12 
13
14  standing rules are broader than Article III, so it 
15
16
17  court. 
 MS. ANDERS:  And so once it goes to court, 
18
19  there may be rare cases in which Already, as the party 
that lost, if it isn't injured in fact by the TTAB's 
20
21  decision itself, that it would not have the necessary 
22  Article III injury to seek judicial review.  That 
23  hasn't -- to our knowledge, that has not occurred, but 
24  it is possible that that could happen because 15 U.S.C. 
1064 makes the TTAB standing requirements broader than 
25

 MS. ANDERS:  The administrative agency's 

would -- it is easier to get --

1  in Article III. 
2
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Anders, you did say, 
3  if I recall correctly, that Congress regarded the PTO as 
4  the preferred form for cancellation proceedings.  The --
the statute sets up the PTO proceeding, but it also 

5
6  allows the claim to be brought in -- in court.  So 

7  what -- what shows that Congress meant these claims to 

8  be -- to go to the agency in preference to the court? 

9
 MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think Congress didn't 

set it up as an exhaustion requirement, so I don't think 
10
11  it's preferred for all of these claims to go to the TTAB. 
12  But the TTAB is the expert body that -- that adjudicates 
13  cancellation of validity issues all the time.  So we think 
14  there could be circumstances in which it would be 
15
16  the existence of the TTAB proceeding. 
17
 For instance, if there's a related 
18  proceeding pending before the TTAB or there's a 
19  concurrent proceeding, something like that, we think it 
would make sense for the district court in considering 
20
21  whether to dismiss the action to take that into account. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought your 
22
23  answer to Justice Kennedy's question might be that 
24  the -- an adverse decision from the agency covering you 
is an additional injury in fact that gives you Article 
25

particularly appropriate for a district court to consider 

30

 MS. ANDERS:  I think there could be some

1  III standing, unless the -- unless the basis for the 
2  agency's decision is you don't have any injury. 
3
4  circumstances in which the TTAB's decision would create 
injury in fact if it said something about the scope of 
5
6  the trademark, something like that.  So there could be 
7  situations in which 1071 would then allow the losing 
8  party to get judicial review. 
9
10
11
12
13
14  very much, may it please the Court: 
15
16 
17 
 In our submission, the Court needs to adopt 
18
19  a rule that has balance to it, and that is there -- it 
20
21  a covenant not to sue of appropriate breadth, but it 
22  also has to be the case that a covenant not to sue can't 
23  just always eliminate the other side's injury.  And so 
24  it's going to depend on the covenant and it's going to

 And our point --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you deal with the

What entitles you to that showing? 

1
2  should adopt the following rule:  And that is, if you 
3  have a covenant not to sue and it covers everything that 
4  the other side alleges an intent to produce, then there 
is no more injury.  If it doesn't cover that, then there 
5
6  may well be injury. 
7
8
9  point that's been discussed with your adversary, they 
10
11 
12
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Absolutely.  So one thing 
13  that's very important to recognize -- two things about 
14  trademark practice.  First is that, in all of these 
cases -- remember, most of the time the question of 
15
16  trademark or patent validity will just be a suit for 
17  invalidity.  It might be a counterclaim.  This happens 
18  all the time. 
 And in all of these cases, including this 
19
case, there is a protective order, and there is one in 
20
21  this case.  And the protective order says that a party 
22  can designate its material, so that it's lawyers' eyes 
23  only, and so that no businessperson from the other side 
24  is entitled to see it. 
25

So that, Justice Kennedy, with respect, it's

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- you have the

 In every single patent or trademark

4  invalidity case, after this Court's decision in

7  product that is regarded as potentially infringing. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What if they simply

10
11
12  trademark, we think it's invalid, we want to copy your 
13  shoe?  We want to copy just the form of your shoe 
14  because that's what the trademark involves. 
15
16
17  invalidity, that's what we're going to do. 
18

20
21  trademark stopped us from having the plans, but the 
22  minute your trademark is -- isn't validated, for sure,

24  sales if we put our name on it, rather than your name.

2  The first is -- because I really want to focus on 
3  precisely what you said.  You said first, what did they 
4  simply say? 
5
6  could be a factual inquiry into whether they're telling 
7  the truth or not.  We could debate -- we could have a 
8  fight about the actual evidence.  But let's assume they 
9  could prove it, and that is, the district judge was told

affirmatively granted them a covenant not to sue that 
covered not only their existing products.  But, Justice

We have -- we have promised not to sue them, 
and I'm five lines down from the top, on account of any 
possible action based on or involving trademark 
infringement, unfair competition or dilution, under 
state or Federal law, based on the appearance of 
Already's current -- okay, that's not future -- or 

And its premise was that the registrant 

promises not to assert its mark against the party's then 
existing commercial activities.  So now, I'm in the 
covenant itself, on page 97A, and this is what we 
promised not to sue them about.

 Our point is not that it covers every future

4  You are absolutely right, Justice Kennedy, that there

7  injury about that. 
8
9  and how the case was developed and how we might have 
modified the covenant, if they had told us anything, 
10
11 
suggesting -- suggested anything outside the covenant 
they might want to make, is let's look at what they 
12 
13 
actually told the district court and the court of 
appeals about what their intentions were.

15
16

18 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  It is not a deficiency 
19
in the pleading.  It's a deficiency in the proof.  So my 
20
21  point about this -- it's very important for the Court to 
22  understand that this case was not dismissed just on the 
23  pleadings.  It wasn't just an insufficiency in their 
24  allegation.

9  to copy Nike's shoe --

11
12  happened then, in your view? 
13
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  So I do -- I would 
14  love to return to what actually happened.  But in that 
hypothetical, what would happen is that our motion to 
15
16  dismiss would be denied, unless and until we could prove 
17  that what they were saying wasn't true because it is 
18  absolutely the case -- and it is a strong point in our 
19  favor -- that you can't evade an attempt to invalidate

22  because you are in real risk of being deemed to have 
23  abandoned the mark because you're just --

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's correct.

1  you -- if you say the -- the whole world can copy it, 

2  but this covenant would give it to only one 

3  manufacturer. 

4
5
6  abandon -- why would giving a covenant to Already amount 
7  to abandonment of your mark? 
8
9  question in the law.  There is no case that has 
considered this question.  What a party claiming 
10
11 
abandonment would say is that we would have licensed 
Already then to increase its production and its 
12 
13 
distribution. 
14
15
16  you can't continually evade an attempt to invalidate 
17  your mark because, certainly, the agree -- we would 
18  agree that if you give a second one of these things out 
19  or the third one, you would be abandoning the mark.  I 
have some actual facts for you about this, and that --

point is this:  Already has told the district court, the

we looked at YUMS and Jelly Bean, and they're sort of 
like our shoe, but we didn't think enough, but you did 
think enough, and are some of these changes that could 
happen at a mile a minute -- is there any reason to 
think -- you know, that they won't look really colorably 
even like what you just did, but nonetheless, is a 
pretty good point that they might infringe our -- our

that has been asked in three separate courts. 
 I said I had a jurisprudential --

1  court of appeals, and this Court everything that it 
2  wants to say about its intentions. 
 It has had every opportunity in every court 
3
4  to have its lawyers simply say, Justice Sotomayor, this 
is not an accident.  The reason they are not saying that 
5
6  they want to make a covenant of the -- a copy of the Air 
7  Force 1 is that they don't want to make a copy of the 
8  Air Force 1.  There is no reason in the world to send 
9  this back to give -- ask Already, again, the question

7  can go and find out the competitor's plans is true, but 
8  it exists whenever a -- a -- a manufacturer brings a

has to show he is now making the product; or, if not, he

23  while you can go to the TTAB, they wouldn't be able to 
24  appeal to an Article III court.  I think that's a point 
25

understand the government's petition.  Is the standing 
burden any less after there is a -- an administrative 
adjudication and you go to court for judicial review? 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, I understand --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- I didn't quite 

in their favor.

 A point in our favor, however, is this 

the trademark hanging out there. 

1
2  notion of scarecrow trademarks hanging out there on the 
3  fields is inaccurate because of the ability to go to the 
4  TTAB in the first instance; they're experts.  And 
second, remember what I said to Justice Sotomayor, 
5
6  anybody in this market can say we want to counterfeit 
7  the Air Force 1 -- we just want to make a copy of it, 
8  it's not complicated -- and they will have the right to 
9  bring a claim to invalidate the mark.  So we can't leave 
10
11
 I have kept trying to come back -- and if I 
12  could, in my remaining time, to the understanding of the 
13  lower courts about the record because I said, Justice 
14  Breyer, I think it would be much better for you to 
resolve the case because they had the opportunity to 
15
16  build a record, the case came to you on two courts' 
17  understanding of the record, and so if I could take you 
18  back to 14(a) and 15(a) of the petition appendix? 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I interject just one 
19
thing that I would like you to clarify?  Justice Breyer 
20
21  started out by saying the standard comes from Friends of 
22  the Earth.  Do you agree?  Because, as I recall, your 
23  brief doesn't -- doesn't even cite Friends of the Earth.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's not correct, Justice 
25

Ginsburg.  So on -- we do disagree because of the

1  Court's decision in Deakins, that this a voluntary 
2  cessation case, but we accept for present purposes, so 
3  you don't think I'm fighting the hypothetical. 
4
 Assuming that voluntary cessation principles 
apply, here's how they apply:  When you not just dismiss 
5
6  the case, but you grant the covenant not to sue, and the 
7  covenant not to sue says, I won't sue you over what 
8  you're doing now or anything that I can imagine you 
9  doing in the future because you haven't told me anything 
10
11  arise again, and you've met the Voluntary Cessation 
12  Doctrine. 
13
 If, on the other hand, the other side comes 
14  forward with a declaration from an officer or some other 
15
16  something outside the covenant, I would definitely want 
17  to make a counterfeit, then the case is going to go on. 
 But this case is not that hypothetical case. 
18
19  On 14(a), the first full paragraph, seven lines from the 
20
21  '905 mark and the breadth of the covenant, it is hard to 
22  imagine a scenario that would potentially infringe the 
23  '905 mark and yet not fall under the covenant.  YUMS has 
24  not asserted any intention to market any such shoe." 
25

1  absence of record evidence that YUMS intends to make any 
2  arguably infringing shoe that is not unambiguously 
3  covered by the covenant, this hypothetical possibility 
4  does not create a definite and concrete dispute." 
5
6  should say, yes, there can be other cases where the 
7  covenant is too narrow; yes, there can be other cases 
8  where someone does allege a desire to make a

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. DABNEY:  Your Honor, the covenant --

 Thank you very much. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 Mr. Dabney, you have four minutes remaining. 

1  and say, actually, we want to make something that might 
2  be outside the covenant, then it was -- that's -- that's 
3  when we won the case. 
4

6
7
8
9
the -- the affidavits in this case were prepared about 
10
11  five weeks after this completely unexpected development 
12  in the middle of a hard-pressed litigation was made. 
13
 And the position that the Petitioner made to 
14  the district court was there is obviously subject matter 
15
16  point, but that you can't say, well, we have a case that 
17  raises these three issues.  You could, say, enter a 
18  single judgment right now, the plaintiff's claims are 
19  waived because they've waived them, the trademark is 
20
21  should be granted. 
22
23  alternative holdings all the time.  And the only reason 
24  why we're even talking about this is that Judge Sullivan 
25

invalid, and the registration was unlawfully issued and 

bifurcated the proceedings so that we dealt with this 

jurisdiction here, not just because of the Rule 41 

 Courts issue judgments on the basis of 

57

 So there's no question, but that if -- if it 

registration and other things that could have been 

1  one issue in isolation, and then the other thing came up 
2  separately.  So we said, we think there's a case right 
3  now, but if you doubt it, we request leave to amend our 
4  counterclaim to assert claims for invalid procurement of 
5
6  asserted. 
7
 So the -- the state of the record reflects 
8  the -- the suddenness with which the -- the plaintiff 
9  most unexpectedly did what it now says, in public, it's 
never done before and dropped its claim so unexpectedly 
10
11 
in the case. 
12
13  turns out that it's not enough to say that we're 
14  actively engaged, and we want to do all of the things 
15
16  have a concrete interest, the -- the defendant can 
17  certainly allege more than what it has been alleged. 
18  The -- the --
19
you had the chance in three different courts to say 
20
21  directly and unequivocally, if the mark is invalid, 
22  we're going to imitate, and you haven't been willing to 
23  do that.  You --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's your commercial 

the Respondent's evidence shows in this case. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So are you willing to 

1  its right to do that.  It was not our understanding 
2  that, under the law, as it stood, that the -- in 
3  addition to staying we have an enormous commercial 
4  interest in doing this, and we are seeking the right to 
5

7  interest? 
 MR. DABNEY:  The commercial interest is to

10
11
12  make the statement he's asked you for?  You keep 
13  equivocating on the answer. 
14
15
16
 MR. DABNEY:  I -- I think it is -- first of 
17  all, the -- the Petitioner, up until now, has said what 
18  he said.  I could stand here and say I believe that, if 
19  the registration were cancelled, it is highly likely 
20
21
22  you hurt then?  Because suppose he wins here.  Now, you, 
23  if you have the president of the company say, hey, I'm 
24  going to do an exact copy, go bring a -- go bring a

 If you can't quite say that -- you know, you

incorrect.

well, then, maybe you should lose.  I mean, that's --
5
6  that's -- what's the practical problem with that?

 MR. DABNEY:  The practical problem here is

alleged now is not enough, we request leave to amend our
