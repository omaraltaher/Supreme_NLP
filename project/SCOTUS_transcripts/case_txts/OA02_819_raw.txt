CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-819, Andrew J. Kontrick v. Robert A. Ryan.


Mr. Poor.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. KING POOR


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. POOR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


This case presents a single question: Can the


deadline for objecting to a bankruptcy discharge be


altered by equitable exceptions?  To answer that question,


we start with the language of the rules.  Bankruptcy Rule


4004 states that an objection to discharge must be filed


no later than 60 days after the first date set for the 

meeting of creditors.  This rule also allows for an


extension of the time, but only by motion and only if that


motion is filed, quote, before the time expires.


QUESTION: Mr. Poor, may I suggest that the


question you have raised is not the one that I understood


this case to involve.  It's not whether the provision


allows for equitable exceptions, it's whether you


forfeited that claim, the claim that it does not - whether


you forfeited it by letting the thing go past your answer. 


You didn't raise it in your answer.  You let the case go

off on summary judgment on the merits and remained silent


until after there was an adverse judgment against you.  So


at least in my thinking, the forfeiture question, whether


you forfeited, the argument that you would now like us to


treat as the question presented, that is the threshold


question.


MR. POOR: And I - and I would agree with Your


Honor that the question of waiver, or sometimes referred


to as forfeiture, is - is part of - that is the question


that's before your Court, whether that - the fact that we


had not raised it until some later date is something that


can be waived or forfeited.


QUESTION: Well, Mr. Poor -


QUESTION: I - I would agree with Justice


Ginsburg that that's the way that the question reads on 

the petition for writ of certiorari.  It's helpful that


you did set forth, that the parties did set forth in the


joint appendix the chronology here.  I take it that the


first time your client raised the late filing issue was


June 23, 2000, or am I wrong about that?


MR. POOR: No, Your Honor.  We raised it in March


of 2000 in a motion to reconsider, but we also have


maintained -


QUESTION: Oh, that was in the motion to


reconsider?

 MR. POOR: Correct, but I would hasten to add


that we have steadfastly maintained that we raised it in


opposition to the motion for summary judgment in that we


specifically said that the family account claim was not in


the original complaint, and that to be timely, a claim had


to be in that - that original complaint. 


QUESTION: But in that very pleading you asked


the court to strike a number of things in the complaint,


and yet you did not ask to strike the family account


claim.


MR. POOR: Well, Your Honor, we have maintained


that we did and in the context of this -


QUESTION: But you didn't - did you expressly say


that you wanted those certain allegations struck?


MR. POOR: Well, we did as best we could at the 

time because this was part of a -


QUESTION: Did you - did you say, court, strike


these allegations?


MR. POOR: Yes.


QUESTION: Yes, the answer is yes?


MR. POOR: Yes, we believe we - we did, Your


Honor.


QUESTION: And you did not say, strike with


respect to this allegation?


MR. POOR: Not specifically as to that, and

that's - and that's what the - what the bankruptcy court


found.  However, at the time this was part of a mass of


other allegations, and we felt that we had raised it


sufficiently by -


QUESTION: What was your reason for


distinguishing the two, for saying strike others, but as


to this one all that you did was mention that it wasn't in


the original complaint?


MR. POOR: Well, we felt that that was - at the -


in the opposition we raised the 4004 untimeliness issue. 


There were just a number of others that were not even in


the - any complaint.


QUESTION: Well, if we're going to get into all


of that, then they would say there's a relation back and


none of those issues are really before. 


We took the issue 

on the pure question of whether or not, assuming that you


were late in objecting that that - that that's a bar.


MR. POOR: That's correct, Your Honor, and I -


QUESTION: Mr. Poor, there are cases with which


I'm sure you're familiar where a statute of limitations


has been held to be deemed waived, even though there's


nothing in the statute itself talking about waiver.


MR. POOR: That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION: And this is much like that, is it not? 


There's a provision in the rules for a deadline for making

a claim, but perhaps as in a statute of limitations case,


it's not an extension of time to find a waiver.  It's -


it's a different concept, and maybe should be viewed much


like a waiver of a statute of limitations.


MR. POOR: Well, in this case, Your Honor, this


deadline is very much unlike a classic statute of


limitations where you have a, say, a 2-year statute.  This


is different because here the language of the 60 days is


modified or altered by Bankruptcy Rule 4 - 9006(b).  The


rulemakers didn't stop with the 60-day deadline.  They


stated that this rule will be incorporated into a special


subgroup of other rules that may only be extended, quote,


to the extent and under the conditions stated.


QUESTION: But what's your answer to the argument


that a waiver is not an extension, it's a waiver? 

That's


a different kettle of fish.


MR. POOR: Well, it - any - any attempt to excuse


a late filing, whether it is waiver, equitable estoppel,


and it could be waiver in the sense of it's an implied


waiver where a debtor, by inaction, does not raise it, or


it could be a situation where there's a stipulation by the


debtor to - with the creditor and says, after the deadline


the creditor goes to the debtor and says, I want you to


stipulate to a late time period.  In the language here, if


you take the plain language of 4004 and 9006(b), that

plain language simply does not allow for any type of


equitable exceptions, whether they're deemed to be waiver


or forfeiture or if -


QUESTION: But you could make the same argument


for an ordinary statute of limitations that doesn't talk


about waiver or equitable alteration.


MR. POOR: You - and that's correct, Your Honor,


for an ordinary statute of limitations.  This one is


different for this reason, that the presumption here is


that when the drafters adopted 9006, what they did was


they patterned it after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure


6(b), almost - almost virtually identically, and the


language of 6(b), on which 9006(b) is patterned, has had a


long history of being - had an established meaning as


setting jurisdictional deadlines and - for its own 

subgroup of rules, and those rules, as this Court held in


the Robinson case, we must presume that rules that are


based on that 6(b) rule are presumed to be - to have the


same meaning, that is, in the words of the Robinson case,


as mandatory and jurisdictional.


QUESTION: Well, do you think that Rule 4004(a)


limits the Court's subject matter jurisdiction?


MR. POOR: Not in the least, Your Honor, and I


think that's a very important distinction in this case,


because I think that's where the court below got off the

trail in focusing on the concept of subject matter


jurisdiction.  This case does not deal with subject matter


jurisdiction.  That's the idea that - whether the court


has the competency.  We're not saying that the, for


instance, the Circuit Court of Cook County was the proper


court to hear this objection.


In this case we're talking about an entirely


different concept, and that is jurisdiction used in the


sense that a court may not extend a deadline beyond the


plain meaning of the rule with any type of equitable


exception, whether it's called -


QUESTION: Why do you pin the word jurisdiction


on it at all when rules, whether bankruptcy rules or


creditor rules, cannot alter or affect the Court's


jurisdiction? 


That's what both rules' enabling acts say, 

so whatever it is, it - if it is jurisdiction, then it


violates - the rule violates the statute.  The rule isn't


passed by Congress.


MR. POOR: I - and I - I, Your Honor, and as I


recall in Your Honor's concurrence in the Carlisle case,


you pointed out that to use the term subject matter


jurisdiction for something like this, for a time


prescription, is - is anomalous, where in - in this case


if we're not - we're not dealing with subject matter


jurisdiction, we're talking about jurisdiction as a

shorthand for a time -


QUESTION: You're talking about a rigid time


limit, a time limit that cannot be extended for good


cause.


MR. POOR: Exactly, and I - I know there are a


number of courts that decline to even use the term


jurisdiction, because they think that that's probably not


the best term to use.  It's used by many courts.


QUESTION: Could you - could you have, according


to your analysis of what this animal is, here you made


your motion to reconsider after the summary judgment


motion was granted, but before judgment was entered -


MR. POOR: Correct.


QUESTION:  - final judgment was entered. 


Suppose final judgment had been entered. 


Could you then 

come into the court and say, sorry, court, I forgot to


tell you that you couldn't enter any judgment here because


an unalterable time bar had passed?


MR. POOR: I think, so long as it's within the


same proceeding, Your Honor, you could, and that's - that


was the holding in the Kirsch case, which the Seventh -


QUESTION: How about initially on appeal? 


Suppose you - you suffered the adverse judgment in the


bankruptcy court and then you want to raise that, after


all, the complaint was untimely, on appeal for the first

time?


MR. POOR: I think that that would probably be a


rare instance, but I think that in - if it is


jurisdictional or unalterable, then so long as it's within


the same proceeding that's just - that is part of what a


jurisdictional rule is.


QUESTION: Do you have any authority with respect


to this kind of rule, a rigid time limit, that it's okay


to untimely bring that to the court's attention?  I mean,


all the precedent that your brief cites are cases where


the party who opposes the time extension timely brings up


that the complaint was untimely.


MR. POOR: We have cited a number of those, Your


Honor, in our - both our opening brief and our reply


brief, and I would invite the Court's attention to -

QUESTION: Where the defendant was untimely -


that -


MR. POOR: Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: - where as here?


MR. POOR: Yes, and - and even more extreme, a


more extreme example, if I would invite the Court's


attention to the Dollar case, where after the time limit


had passed, the creditor went to the debtor and says -


said I want you to extend the time limit, and for whatever


reason, the debtor said, okay, I'll agree to that, and

then they brought that to the bankruptcy court for


approval and the bankruptcy court said, no, this is a


jurisdictional time limit, you can't have a side deal with


a creditor -


QUESTION: That was a case where the court made


an - an initial ruling without having expended any time in


adjudicating the case.  Here, you present the situation


where the court grants a motion for summary judgment and


then the debtor says, sorry, court, you never should have


adjudicated this.  We didn't tell you, but now you have to


erase all - everything that you did. 


MR. POOR: Well -


QUESTION: I did - was not aware of such a case.


MR. POOR: Well, there - there are a number of


them where they're not raised in the - there's a whole 

spectrum.  They're not raised in the answer -


QUESTION: Raised after the case is adjudicated


on the merits?


MR. POOR: Yes.  The Kirsch case is one case


where it - actually after trial, in Kirsch, the court


found that since the rule - and I - it was not alterable


under the plain meaning of the twin here, this 4004, 4007,


that that could not be altered, even after a trial, and as


I recall, the Poskanzer case is yet another one of those


where -

 QUESTION: Who made those decision where the -


MR. POOR: The - the Kirsch case is from the


bankruptcy court in the Northern District of Illinois, and


- and the Poskanzer case is from New Jersey and we cite a


number of them in page 16 and in our footnote on that -


QUESTION: The - the law - like - like the time


limit here, the law is unalterable, and if you fail to


make a legal argument at the trial level, you're not


normally permitted to raise that argument on appeal where


you haven't raised the objection below. 


MR. POOR: That -


QUESTION: The court - the court doesn't say,


well, the law is unalterable so you're entitled to - to


raise this point at any stage in the proceeding.  That's -


that's just not the way we do things, and that's why we 

do have this terminology jurisdictional.  There is


something special about that, but the mere fact that


something is unalterable certainly doesn't allow you to


raise it whenever you like.


MR. POOR: Well, Your Honor, the - to go back to


the - the concept of - of waiver or - or forfeiture, if


the rule is - is truly jurisdictional, using the shorthand


that it cannot be altered, then -


QUESTION: No, no, no.  That was the point of -


of my question.  It is not a synonym for - for the term

jurisdictional that it can't be altered.  There are a lot


of things that - that can't be altered which you're not


allowed to raise late.


MR. POOR: But if - if the rule itself, for


instance, does not allow a - a debtor and a creditor to


extend this time line themselves, then it would be, I


submit, anomalous to allow the debtor to do, by inaction,


what the Court could never do on its own or - or permit a


rule that says that -


QUESTION: Well, that - that's like saying you


cannot let the defendant change the law by merely failing


to raise a legal objection that was fully available.  He's


not changing the law, he's just forfeited the - that - the


benefit of that provision of law.


MR. POOR: Well, if it can be forfeited, Your 

Honor, then I would submit that it can also be waived.  It


could be - and -


QUESTION: What's - what's the citation of that? 


I mean, you refer to Rule 6, and Rule 6 governs a whole


lot of famous time limits, new trials, 60(b) motions, et


cetera.  So, therefore, there must be a lot of cases where


the following thing happened: Somebody made a motion under


Rule 59, or whatever it is, out of time, all right, a day


late -


MR. POOR: A day -

 QUESTION: A day late.


MR. POOR: Right.


QUESTION: And then nobody said a word about it. 


Then one year later, for the first time on appeal, the


other side says, oh, I agree we never said a word about


this before so we're raising it now for the first time,


and the court said, fine, you can raise it for the first


time.  Now, what are the cases that hold that?  I mean,


I'm not saying there aren't any, I haven't faced this


before, but I would have thought it comes up million - you


know, quite a lot of times where people forget to - or


they don't care or whatever it is, and they raise


something very late.  What are those cases?


MR. POOR: Well, I - I would invite the Court's


attention to the cases that we cite on pages 16 and 17, 

such as the - the Rinde case, debtor failed to plead -


QUESTION: No, I'm not talking about bankruptcy. 


I'm talking about Rule 6, ordinary civil cases.


MR. POOR: Well, I can - I can point the Court to


a case that is in that 6(b) family, in the Criminal Rule


45(b).


QUESTION: I'm talking about civil rules of


procedure, ordinary civil cases.  Probably there are, I


would guess conservatively 100,000 cases a year that may


fall into this category.  In a certain percentage of

percentage, the other side will have said nothing -

MR. POOR: And in -


QUESTION: And then there must be a lot of cases,


if you're right, that would say, that's okay.  I'm just


repeating myself because I think there are no cases and I


think, to me, that shows you're wrong, but now I'm open to


hearing that there are a lot or even one.


MR. POOR: Well, I would - I would invite the


Court to the Kirsch case that we cite in our brief.


QUESTION: Is Kirsch a bankruptcy case? 

I'm not


talking about a bankruptcy case.


QUESTION: District court - that's a district


court case.


MR. POOR: In - in Kirsch, the court relied upon


that 6(b) analysis in a case called Hulson from the


Seventh Circuit, where just such a thing happened where


after the - after trial the - the party did not - did not


file his Rule 59 motion on time and actually the other


side - they stipulated to an untimely rule - they


stipulated to it, and then on appeal in that case they -

support you, and what's the name of that case?


MR. POOR: That's Hulson, H-u-l-s-o-n.


QUESTION: All right.


MR. POOR: And that's - and that was the basis -


that was the basis of this whole analysis in the Kirsch


case.


QUESTION: Under your - your view of the law,


could the respondent here, the creditor have argued that


this amendment relates back to the complaint?


MR. POOR: Relation back has never been in our -


QUESTION: Could he - could he have made that 

argument under your view of the law, post-judgment, after


you - March 2000, it was decided in 1980 - 90 - 99, March


2000, you object.  At that point, could the creditor say,


oh, well, this relates back, it's okay?


MR. POOR: He - he could have, Your Honor.


QUESTION: All right.  Well, then what you're


doing is you're putting this issue potentially in the


appellate courts.  We don't do that sort of thing.  It's -


it's for the trial judge to say it relates back or not.


MR. POOR: Well -

 QUESTION: And that's - that's - you put all of


the parties in a very difficult position by your rule.


QUESTION: Didn't the court of appeals said - say


you didn't suggest that it related back, therefore,


they're assuming it didn't?


MR. POOR: That's correct, that we - we - we've


never argued the - there's never - the relation back issue


was never before the Seventh Circuit.


QUESTION: I'm not saying it is before, but I'm


saying under your view, under your framework, it would be


very difficult to handle that at such a late point, and


it's a legitimate argument that they could have made.


MR. POOR: If they - they raised it on appeal, as


it might be a - an issue.  I think it's probably more


likely in the trial court, but yes, I would agree with 

Your Honor on that.


QUESTION: Mr. Poor, I'm still looking for that


case that you cited, because at least the two cases that


you relied on principally, Taylor and Carlisle, those were


both cases where the untimeliness point was timely raised.


MR. POOR: That is true, Your Honor, both in


Taylor and Carlisle it was raised, but I would suggest


that in Taylor, if the Court did not allow a late


extension based upon a bad faith claim of exemption -


QUESTION: Well, the rule says good faith isn't

an excuse, so -


MR. POOR: And -


QUESTION: But - but you are arguing that an


untimely raising of the lack of timeliness is okay, and


neither Carlisle nor Taylor stand for that proposition.


MR. POOR: Well, they do in a broader sense, Your


Honors, that they do not - I would submit that they do not


allow any kind of equitable -


QUESTION: They were both cases where the


objection to the untimeliness was timely made, right?


MR. POOR: That's correct.


QUESTION: So then they could not have considered


the case such as this one where the objection is untimely 


made?


MR. POOR: And that - what that gets - what that 

gets back to our point in our brief that in the Santos


case that the Seventh Circuit relied upon most heavily


here, they did what I would call a pick and choose of


different type of equitable exceptions.  In -


QUESTION: I didn't think that forfeiture was an


equitable exception.


MR. POOR: Well, in -


QUESTION: There is a difference between waiver,


which is a conscious act, and forfeiture, which is rule


that says, if you don't raise the point, which is the

ordinary consequence of not raising a defense, if you


don't raise it and the time to amend passes and you have a


judgment on the merits, you can't go back to square one


and said, oh, sorry, I should have put it in my answer,


but -


MR. POOR: Well, our - our biggest point here,


Your Honor, is that either these rules set time limits


that cannot be altered by any type of equitable doctrine,


be it forfeiture, waiver, or equitable estoppel, I mean,


either all of those are in or -


QUESTION: I didn't think that forfeiture was an


equitable doctrine.


MR. POOR: Well, I - I guess in this case we've


always talked about waiver as - as what we're talking


about here in terms of - it was an implied waiver in terms 

of - it was inaction - inaction by the debtor -


QUESTION: Well, you're - you're talking about


the same thing as implied exceptions to the statute of


limitations that, you know, the statute may have run but


there are certain exceptions where the thing will still be


considered.


MR. POOR: That's - that's correct, Your Honor. 


If - a tolling type, and I think that's what we're getting


at here is are there tolling-type exceptions to this


language and I come back - we come back to the point that

if this rule was designed by the rulemakers to track the


language of 6(b) and not allow any type of exception,


whether it's equitable tolling or - or whatever, then


either - either all those exceptions come in or they - or


they don't, because -


QUESTION: But - but you cite only - in response


to Justice Breyer, you cite only one 6(b) case that you're


aware of that applied the principle you're arguing for


here, namely that a late-raised objection will - will be


heard, right?


QUESTION: It isn't an exception.  The point is,


I think some of us have been pointing out to you, is our


belief, which you could try to disabuse us of, that this


has nothing to do with exceptions.  We'll assume there are


no exceptions no matter what, but there can be a rule of 

law that you win and there are no exceptions, but still,


because you didn't raise the point, you lose it.  That has


nothing to do with exceptions.  It has to do with the


normal rule, in a court you have to raise a point.  Now


that's what I'm interested in.


MR. POOR: And -


QUESTION: And that's what I wonder - I'm asking


because Rule 6, I think, would be analogous to that and so


if you - there are some cases -


MR. POOR: And I would - the Hulson case is an

excellent example.


QUESTION: Which case?  Because I'm looking for


it in your brief.


MR. POOR: No, it's in the - the Kirsch - the


Kirsch -


QUESTION: Cited by another case, right?


MR. POOR: That's correct.


QUESTION: It's cited in Kirsch?


MR. POOR: Yeah, but - and the - the other point


I would make, though, is that the - the overall concept


here is this case is really no different than the Carlisle


case in that if the claimant Carlisle, one day late, or


the - the motion one day late could not be extended


because of attorney error -


QUESTION: But Mr. Poor, it can't be like 

Carlisle because the Government timely made that


objection.


MR. POOR: But the - the question, Your Honor, is


- I would come back to this: Could the Government waive


the - the objection deadline in 45(b)?  And I think the


answer, and I think this is where this all comes together,


all of this comes together in this point, is that the


Government could not waive that 45(b) deadline, and that


45(b) deadline is the same as 6(b) and it's the -


QUESTION: So you think that case stands for the

proposition that the Government had said nothing and the


court had said, I considered this, I grant the motion to


acquit, that the Government could then come in and say, oh


sorry, we forgot to tell you that this was one day late


and so you couldn't consider it.


MR. POOR: If there are - I would submit, Your


Honor, that if these - if these deadlines are such that


they may not be -


QUESTION: But the - the opinion of this Court


certainly doesn't give any basis for that - for such a


judgment.


MR. POOR: Well, it dealt with the idea it was


their inherent power to do that, but if - if the Court


allows a rule that says the Government can waive this or


the Government can - if the Government can stipulate to 

it, which is, in effect, a waiver-type argument, then I


think that that pretty much unravels Carlisle.  If the


Government is able to stipulate to a late - a late time


period by either action or inaction, then I think that


unravels Carlisle and all these 6(b) family of cases.


QUESTION: Do you wish to reserve the balance of


your time, Mr. Poor?


MR. POOR: I do, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION: Very well. 


Mr. Figliulo we'll hear from.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. FIGLIULO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The best way for me to understand this case is


just to walk through the case.  This is a - an adversary


proceeding.  Rule 4004 deals with the time for filing a


complaint objecting to discharge, and that specifically is


provided as an adversary proceeding.  Once we move into


the realm or the arena of an adversary proceeding, the


rules are pretty clear.  If - if the complaint is late,


the plaintiff runs the risk of losing his case if the


defense is timely raised, but there's obligations that


shift to the defendant once we're in the adversary


proceeding.  The defendant has to answer -


QUESTION: Mr. Figliulo, do you know of any case 

in which an objection could be waived and yet prior to the


time of waiver, the parties could not, by stipulation,


eliminate the objection?


MR. FIGLIULO: There's a - a bankruptcy case that


holds that, but I don't think - I don't think that's


right.  I think the -


QUESTION: Well -


MR. FIGLIULO:  I think you can't agree -


QUESTION: - that - that holds what?  You - you


think - you think the parties can waive the limitation of

QUESTION: The parties, if they get together, can


waive it?


that.


MR. FIGLIULO: Yes, I - I believe they can.


QUESTION: All right.


MR. FIGLIULO: And I think - I think -


QUESTION: I have trouble - I have trouble with


MR. FIGLIULO: Here - here's - here's -


QUESTION: I can't imagine that - that you're


unable to, by stipulation, agree to eliminate it, but you


can - one of the parties can nonetheless waive it.  That ­


that'd be a very unusual -


MR. FIGLIULO: I think the statute of limitations 

is a personal defense and -


QUESTION: It can be waived.


MR. FIGLIULO: - therefore, it can be waived, and


there's tolling agreements that are entered into regularly


-


QUESTION: Exactly.


MR. FIGLIULO: - with respect to statute of


limitations -


QUESTION: Right.


MR. FIGLIULO: - and I think it could apply to

QUESTION: So you think the what's his case is


wrong - what was the name of the one that -


MR. FIGLIULO: I think it was Barley, In re


Barley, Your Honor.  I think that case said that the


stipulation was not -


QUESTION: And was that a case in which the - in


which the court expressly addressed the issue and say -


and said, I'm not going to allow - I'm not going to permit


the extension of time?


MR. FIGLIULO: I think that was.


QUESTION: That - that's - that's far different


than just a waiver.


MR. FIGLIULO: I do understand.


QUESTION: There the judges said, you're - we're 

not going to allow you to delay the processes of this


court, and that's quite different than parties simply


doing it on their own without the judges' intervention.


MR. FIGLIULO: I agree, Your Honor, and the rule,


like Rule 6(b) or 9000(6)(b) focuses on motions for


extension and enlargement and it is strict and it does


provide the guidelines for the court to follow, but I -


QUESTION: I - I'm not sure what you're saying


now.  You -


MR. FIGLIULO: Well -

 QUESTION: - you think in Barley, when the


parties signed an agreement to extend the time limit, the


court should have accepted?


MR. FIGLIULO: I believe that, yes.


QUESTION: Okay.


MR. FIGLIULO: But I think the court - the reason


in the court, as I understood it, was that they could not


agree to do that because extensions and enlargement of


time is governed by the rule and that it wasn't permitted


by the rule.  But in this case I think we have a classic


situation where we have a limitations period that's the -


it should have been raised in the answer.  It was not


raised in the answer.  It wasn't raised until after the


court granted summary judgment.  That's a classic case of


an implied waiver of a limitations defense and the court 

recognized that at the bankruptcy level, it's been


recognized that way at the district court level, it's been


recognized that way by the Seventh Circuit, and it's a, I


think, 100 percent right.


It's also directly in accord with the background


principles of waiver that apply to a civil-type action.


QUESTION: Would you agree - do you agree with


the Government that if the statute in question, not the


bankruptcy rule, but at 157(b)(2)(J), if that required


timely objection as some other statutes in the bankruptcy

realm do, then you would lose, if the statute rather than


the rule required timely objection?


MR. FIGLIULO: I think if the statute provided -


if Section 157 provided timely, like it does for


abstention, I think that would make the rules more of an


exercise of the code and perhaps a stronger basis for


arguing the mandatory strictness of the rules.  I do not


think it would make it jurisdictional.


QUESTION: Well, many - many statute of


limitations are, of course, enacted by the legislature


rather than by rule, and nonetheless you have tolling


there, do you not?


MR. FIGLIULO: Exactly, Your Honor.  In fact,


traditionally, and as this Court has recognized from time


to time, that statute of limitations, which are phrased in 

mandatory terms, are silent with respect to whether


certain exceptions or defenses traditionally apply, but


regularly apply those, and that would apply particularly


here where the bankruptcy court is a court of equity, and


waiver is one of those principles.


QUESTION: In the typical case there's not a


whole bunch of people who are hanging on the resolution of


this issue.  I mean, what's involved here is, I mean, it -


it says no later than 60 days after the first date set


for meeting of creditors.  The problem is you have a whole

bunch of people who don't know what their rights are going


to be until this matter is settled and it - it seems to me


that it's - it's quite reasonable to insist upon


compliance with that time limit no matter what, because


there are other people's interests involved.


MR. FIGLIULO: Your Honor, I don't quarrel with


the fact that the time limit is important and it serves a


valid purpose, but when we look at waiver - and we're not


talking about exceptions to extend time here, we're


looking at the defendant's obligation to - to assert a


timely objection to the untimeliness of the complaint. 


That promotes finality because that brings the issue to a


head and it - it conserves judicial resources - it does


everything waivers should do.


QUESTION: But are you -


QUESTION: Except - except that it does not lead


to the conclusion that they should be able voluntarily to


agree to extend the time period, which - which is a


position you support?


MR. FIGLIULO: It's a position I support but it's


not critical to the -


QUESTION: Well -


MR. FIGLIULO: - position that we advocate, but I


do think it's right, because I do think -


QUESTION: Well, would you - would you agree that

a district court could override that determination of the


parties, say I'm not going to allow the late filing? 


Other - the rights of other persons are involved and the


district court in the hypothetical case says, I know this


is not jurisdictional but it is within my control.


MR. FIGLIULO: I think the - the bankruptcy court


level, that probably would be within the court's


discretion, but I - my view is that it's - it's like a


tolling agreement and it should be permitted, because a


statute of limitations or a limitations period is a


personal defense.  Now, if there's extraordinary


circumstances where the court refuses to enforce the


agreement, I can't conceive of why that would be


permitted.


QUESTION: Isn't the difference between the 

statute of limitations and the case we've got here that in


the statute of limitations case we make the assumption


that the only two interested parties are the plaintiff and


the defendant, and if they don't care, why should anybody


else?  In this case, however, there are other interested


parties and there is a pretty well-articulated


governmental interest in wrapping this up quickly.  So it


seems to me that in - in the bankruptcy case, the court


would have every reason, if it was brought to its


attention, e.g., in the form of a stipulation, to say, no,

I'm going to keep the ball rolling fast.  Isn't that the


distinction?


MR. FIGLIULO: Your Honor, I think that's a sound


distinction.  I - I happen to believe that


dischargeability is a complaint for objecting to


dischargeability primarily affects the objecting party and


the debtor, and while there may be other rights of people


implicated, it's still very personal with respect to the


debtor and the creditor who's making the objection to


discharge.  And that would also be even more true with


respect to dischargeability of particular debts as in


4007.


So I understand the policy consideration, there


is a distinction there.  I - I've probably bitten off more


than I should have with respect to whether that can be 

agreed on or not -


QUESTION: You don't have to maintain that.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: Why don't you recognize that -


MR. FIGLIULO: But I do -


QUESTION: - that this is simply - the question


is essentially, where does one draw the line?  And one


might say, even if the objection to the timeliness isn't


raised in the initial answer, it could be raised in an


amendment to the answer.  It could even be raised in

opposition to the summary judgment motion.  But there


comes a point where it's too late to make that objection,


and that's essentially the question for us: Where do you


draw the line when it's too late?  Now, it could be on


appeal, it could be after adjudication on the merits in


the trial court.  So on that question of where do we draw


the line about raising this objection, what is your


position?


MR. FIGLIULO: I know that in this case, once -


once the court adjudicates the merits, it is waived, it's


over, it's too late.  I would -


QUESTION: And that's all you have to maintain to


prevail here?


MR. FIGLIULO: I do believe - I do believe that


whether there's been an implied waiver or a waiver has 

some of a fact inquiry that's necessary.  It can be as


early as the failure to raise it in the answer, but I do


recognize the liberal rules of amendment to answers and


that may be permitted it by the court in its discretion,


so it's not a bright line before judgment, it's not bright


line where you draw the line, in my judgement, but in -


and certainly once the court rules, it's too late.


QUESTION: I have one question of bankruptcy


practice.  You just - you can tell me how it works.  Is


the - is the order for the first meeting of creditors,

which is what triggers the - the time limit here, is -


does that date often fluctuate the - the order of the


first meeting of creditor and then they'll - and then


they'll change it?


MR. FIGLIULO: No, that - it's pretty set, Your


Honor.  That - it can happen, but that's unusual.  The


date is - the set - there's notice that goes out and it's


a relatively fixed point in time from which these


deadlines then are calculated.


QUESTION: There was a timely complaint filed and


it is a little odd that it was never argued that, well,


this is really within the - within the frame of the


original complaint, so it - it should relate back.  Why


didn't you argue that?


MR. FIGLIULO: Your Honor, that was argued before 

the bankruptcy court.  The bankruptcy court did not


discuss it at all in its opinion.  It was argued before


the district court.  It wasn't discussed by the district


court at all.  My client represented himself pro se before


the Seventh Circuit.  It was not raised in the briefs on


appeal, so with respect to whether that's an alternative


grounds for affirmance, that's been waived, somewhat


ironically, but I think it has been.


QUESTION: If you're through I'd like to ask you


an irrelevant question.  I don't want to take your time.

I noticed Judge Schwartz ordered a special hearing on


sanctions at the end of the proceeding.  What happened at


that hearing?


MR. FIGLIULO: Your Honor, I wasn't involved at


that time.  My - my understanding is that there was a lot


of stuff going back and forth and there was a sanction of


attorneys' fees of $1,000 or $1,500 assessed.  That's -


that's what my recollection is.


QUESTION: I gather it was a pretty acrimonious


proceeding in the district court.


MR. FIGLIULO: It - it was, Your Honor.  It's


former partners and we know that -


QUESTION: Is your view on this as a bankruptcy


attorney thinking, I mean, I don't see that it affects


your client one way or the other, but, I mean, obviously 

the Solicitor General in this case has suggested an


affirmance on the very narrow ground that maybe they're


quite right about what the rule should be interpreted, but


still they lost the chance to raise the rule because they


didn't raise it.  All right, that's a very narrow ground. 


On the other hand, the split in the circuits is more on


the broader question of how absolute are these rules in -


how absolute are the deadlines in this particular rule,


and that's a broader question, which is also a possible


ground for affirmance, so either way your client would

win.  But, as a bankruptcy lawyer, what's your opinion?


MR. FIGLIULO: My - and I approach this with


little trepidation, but I believe equitable exceptions,


the traditional equitable exceptions of tolling and


equitable estoppel, continue to apply and should apply to


Rule 4004(a) and 4007.  I don't think they've been


expressly abrogated.  I think they're such a powerful part


-


QUESTION: A problem then about the other part


that says you can't extend the deadlines in this main part


except for the reasons that are there given, which is good


cause, et cetera, what do we do about that?


MR. FIGLIULO: I - I think the - the - Rule


9006(b) or 6(b), it eliminates excusable neglect as a


grounds for extending time for a late-filed motion, but I 

don't think it eliminates equitable tolling.  I think it's


different.  I think tolling and excusable neglect overlap


some cases, and to the extent it's excusable neglect, it's


not grounds for extension, but a - a true tolling -


QUESTION: What would be a cause for tolling if


excusable neglect is out of it?  It seems to me that this


rule is saying there are no exceptions, period, and to say


that even if you can show good cause you don't get it


extended, but there's some other equitable.


MR. FIGLIULO: I - it's a relatively - I think

equitable tolling, in the context of this rule, is


relatively narrow exception, it's not - it's little


broader than the unique circumstances that relate to if a


party's misled by a rule of court.  But I do think that it


can - there can be circumstances, for example, if a


client's lawyer dies right before the deadline is -


passes, and there's -


QUESTION: Why isn't that excusable neglect?


MR. FIGLIULO: I don't think it's neglect.  I - I


think there's equitable tolling and - and that - that's


why I do think it survives in some way, but I - it's not


critical to our position.  Our position is waiver.  I


think we're classically correct.  It's approached under


the adversary proceeding rules, which engage all the rules


of civil procedure, which we all know about, it's a 

familiar arena, and it should apply as - as it has been


applied by the lower courts, and I ask that this Court


affirm it.  Thank you very much.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Figliulo.


Mr. Jones, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


MR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:

 I have very little to add to what's already been


said because basically what's been said by respondent is


our view as well, which is that this is a question of


waiver, not a question of enlargement or extension of the


time to file a timely complaint, and the one thing I do


want to add, though, is that the court of appeals, it


seems to us, correctly pointed out that there is a rules-


based answer to the waiver question as well as the general


principles that we have articulated.


The rules-based answer is alluded to by


respondent, which is the Rule 4004(d) expressly


incorporates through Part 7 of the bankruptcy code the


pleading requirements of 8(c) of the Federal Rules of


Civil Procedure.  Now, that means that the - the debtor


has an obligation to plead his affirmative defenses at the 

answer or they would be treated as waived.  This was an


affirmative defense, and so just by applying the rules it


was subject to waiver when it was not raised in the


answer.  We think the court was right in exercising its


discretion to determine that when it's not raised until


after the trial, or in this case after summary judgment


was entered, it's plainly too late, and it was waived.


QUESTION: Mr. Jones, when - at what point in


that spectrum would it have been tiled permissible to


allow it?

 MR. JONES: The broad answer to that question -


well, the first answer is, that's not been raised. 


They've - they've suggested it can't be waived, not that


the court abused its discretion.  The answer to your


question, though, is that it's - if it would not be too


late to amend the answer, then it's not forfeited or


waived.


answer?


QUESTION: Well, when is it too late to amend the


MR. JONES: That's - there's a - a whole body of


precedent about that, and as respondent correctly says,


it's clearly too late once the judgment has been


determined.  If -


QUESTION: Now wait, do you mean judgment is - is


determined, or judgment is entered?


MR. JONES: In this case judgment was announced


after the trial.  I - let me back up.  I think that it's -


the court retains discretion to allow an amendment up to


the pre-trial stage.  Up to the pre-trial answer, the


court sometimes allows complaints to be amended in its


discretion, and -


QUESTION: Well, quite frequently, does it not,


at pre-trial?


MR. JONES: Not infrequently, but it's also the


case that sometimes amendments are denied at that point

because of the particularity, facts of the case.  But my


point is simply, at this stage of the case it's clearly


have been waived and - and -


QUESTION: Well, now, at this stage of the case,


judgment had not yet been entered, but the motion for


summary judgment had been granted.  You - are you saying


it can never be done at that stage?


MR. JONES: It would be - I - I think that it -


it might be not an abusive direction - there's a lot of


nots there.  A court might be able to exercise discretion


if it thought in the circumstances it was appropriate, but


it is a matter committed to the discretion of the trial


court, and certainly at that stage it was well within its


discretion, and again, that issue hasn't been presented or


raised. 


What was raised is the idea you can't waive it, 

and the reason that it was raised in that fashion is they


said it's jurisdictional.  But it's - but they've


conceded, both in their reply brief and in - and in court


today, that it doesn't affect the subject matter


jurisdiction of the court.  And the cases are clear that -


QUESTION: How do you - how do you reconcile your


view about the court having such broad discretion with -


with the wording of 4004(b), which says that on motion,


the court may for cause extend the time, but the motion

shall be filed before the time has expired?  And what


you're saying is, well, it really doesn't matter, the


court has discretion to go ahead even though the motion


wasn't filed before the time has expired.


MR. JONES: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.  The


question that I was answering was whether the court had


discretion to accept the late-raised objection to the late


complaint.


QUESTION: I'm sorry.


MR. JONES: And that's a different - and I do


think the court has that discretion.  Whether it had -


would have had discretion to allow a late complaint at


that - at some later point really isn't before the Court,


because they haven't claimed that there is any equitable


grounds for enlarging or extending the deadline, so that 

question isn't presented.


QUESTION: I don't - you're distinguishing


between granting - I'm sorry - granting -


MR. JONES: The -


QUESTION: - granting a late-raised objection and


granting a late-filed complaint?


MR. JONES: Correct.


QUESTION: Okay.


MR. JONES: Under ordinary principles of 8(c) and


the Rules of Federal Procedure which are applicable here.

My point is that a court could allow the late-raised


defense that it - that the complaint was untimely, up to


some point it would have discretion to do that, but it


exercised its discretion not to allow that late-raised


objection, late-raised defense in this case.


QUESTION: Well, the rule on amendment, which the


pleading rules, the Federal rules would apply, says that


it should be - if after you miss the time limit in which


you are allowed to amend as a matter of right, then you


may amend - and with the court's permission, and leave


shall be freely given when justice so requires.


MR. JONES: That's the discretionary standard and


I don't - I will be frank, I do not know if there's a case


that says that discretion stops at this point.  That's not


before the Court. 


It would just be odd for the Court to 

exercise such discretion after it had already determined


that the judgment should be awarded to one of the parties. 


That's all I was trying to say.


QUESTION: At the outset you said there's a text-


based or a rule-based -


MR. JONES: Rule-based.


QUESTION: And that's 4000(e)?


MR. JONES: 4004(b).


QUESTION: 4004(e)?


MR. JONES: B.

 QUESTION: Where is - where is that?


MR. JONES: It's at -


QUESTION: Was that in - did you make that


argument in your brief?


MR. JONES: We did not make that argument.  The


respondent made the argument and the court of appeals made


the point.  That provision is quoted in footnote 3 of


respondent's brief.  It's a very short provision.  It just


says that the - the procedures of Part 7 will have


governed, and then Rule 7008 says that incorporates Rule


8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.


Now, we have not addressed the question of


whether equitable exceptions would be available under this


rule, but we do think that the Court's decision in the


Santos case provides a sensible explanation of how to 

address that question.  In Santos, the Court made the


point that the rules appear to say you cannot extend by


excusable neglect, but that doesn't preclude equitable


estoppel, because estoppel is based on the misconduct of


the debtor, excusable neglect is the neglect of the


creditor.  So not allowing an extension for neglect


doesn't preclude allowing an extension for estoppel.


QUESTION: So you think this is a totally


different issue and it's a much broader issue and more


important -

had come in and said, hey, we - I've been taking all the


money out of wife's account, putting - put it in - you


know, I put it all in her name, ha ha ha, and I had hired


people to prevent the creditor from ever finding out, that


then the correct defense there would be equitable


estoppel, which is an enlargement of the time period?


MR. JONES: If the - if I understood your


hypothetical, if the basis of the estoppel was that -


QUESTION: I'm - I'm assuming they acted very


inequitably.


MR. JONES: - that we were unable to find - they


hid from us what they were doing -


QUESTION: Yes, yes.


MR. JONES: - yes, I think that would apply.  But


I should also point out that in that specific factual


scenario, 727(d) of the bankruptcy code would allow the


discharge to be reopened in -


QUESTION: You see, that - that's the argument


the other way.  The argument the other way is you don't


really need to import these defenses into the rule itself


because there are other ways in the bankruptcy law that an


unfair kind of conduct that can be dealt with.


MR. JONES: If, to the extent that there are

other ways to deal with it, then equity doesn't need to


step in if there's an adequate legal remedy.  But if -


when there's not an adequate answer in the code to this -


to whatever facts come up about the estoppel situation,


we would think that the rules don't preclude the court -


QUESTION: Mr. Kent, as I remember the - this


case itself, the debtor was never secretive about what he


had done.  He told the creditors, he told everybody, yeah,


I took my name off the account -


MR. JONES: Yes. 


QUESTION: - but I continued to deposit my salary


in it, I continued to pay the family expenses from it.  It


wasn't concealed.


MR. JONES: It's a hypothetical -


QUESTION: It's a hypothetical case.  I'm trying


to get to the issue the - that's bothering me.  Can you


just give me one word about whether my belief about the


Rule 6 - it refers to a new trial motion in a civil case,


motion to amend the opinion, JNOV, all those time limits


it says are absolute.  Now, I take it it's never been held


or isn't at least normally held that a lawyer can sit


there, notice that the time limits weren't complied with,


wait to see if he wins, and then if he loses, bring it up


for the first time on appeal.  Am I right about that? 


Because they're saying, no, I'm not right about it.

 MR. JONES: Well, I - I think you're right about


that that you can waive an argument of any - based on


those rules in - in the trial court, but let me -


QUESTION: Is it - do you know of any case, Mr.


Kent, because those are all motions that are brought after


the trial, after the adjudication, and I can't imagine a


scenario where a lawyer who won would then - and the other


party moves for a new trial - would then say nothing.


MR. JONES: I'm not familiar with a case of that


type, but there - I can imagine that there's a case out


there that says something along the following, that this


Court's jurisdiction, by statute, is based on the


requirement, for example, that there be a notice of appeal


filed within 30 days.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Jones.


Mr. Poor, you have 2 minutes remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. KING POOR


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. POOR: I'd like to return to the - the


fundamental point is when these were adopted, 9006(b) was


patterned after 6(b), and that identical language, as this


Court instructed in the Robinson case, should be read to


be mandatory and jurisdictional, that is, not waiveable. 


And if we look at a case like Santos, there's nothing in


the language that allows Santos to pick and choose between

- between saying equitable estoppel would - would not


apply but waiver would apply.  The only possible way you


can get there in Santos is not through the text, not


through the language, which Robinson has told us is


mandatory and jurisdictional.  The only way you can get


there is through the - a policy argument that says, we


think it's a good idea not to have equitable estoppel, but


on the other hand, yeah, for policy reasons, we - we


should allow waiver to apply.


And if you allow waiver, whether it is waiver in


the implied sense of inaction or waiver in the express


sense of allowing a stipulation, in that case, you will


have really taken what is in the text and these are no


longer jurisdictional rules without exception.  Rather,


they have become rules that the parties themselves may 

change, and this deadline has never been like a statute of


limitations.  It has always been different.  It allows the


parties to, before there's any - before there's any


adjudication, any deadline, to take discovery and move the


deadline along.  That's not like a typical statute of


limitation, and the reason for that is the text.  The text


says it may only be extended to the extent and under the


conditions stated, the exact language that was at issue in


Carlisle and in Robinson, and we would submit that you


have to read the same language in the same way, whether


46 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005

based on the same language.
