 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. BOUTROUS, JR., 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 The mandatory nationwide class in this case 

was improperly certified for two fundamental reasons. 

First, plaintiffs failed to satisfy Rule 23(a)'s 

cohesion requirements as reflected in the commonality, 

typicality, and adequacy requirements of the rule. 

Second, plaintiffs' highly individualized claims for 

monetary relief failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(2)'s 

requirements for certification of a mandatory 

non-opt-out class.

 Regarding Rule 23(a), because the 

plaintiffs' claims in this case hinge on the delegation 

of discretion to individual managers throughout the 

country, they cannot meet the cohesion requirements that 

are reflected in -- in Rule 23(a).  The delegation of 

discretion in some ways is the opposite of cohesive

claims that are common to everyone in the class.  The 

common policies that the plaintiffs point to are either 

neutral and not argued to be discriminatory or they are 

affirmatively nondiscriminatory.  The company has a very 

strong policy against discrimination and in favor of 

6 

diversity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose if 

corporate headquarters had learned that the subjective 

decisionmaking or the delegation of decisionmaking to 

the field was resulting in several discriminatory 

practices or a pattern of discrimination -- in other 

words, the decentralized process was leading to 

discrimination -- then I suppose the company -- that 

that could be attributed to the policy adopted by -- at 

headquarters? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  No, Your Honor.  I think that 

in this situation, if there was a pattern, for example, 

at a particular store where the decisionmaking unit -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I'm talking 

about -- so, they've got thousands of stores, and, you 

know, every week they get a report from another store 

saying that, you know, there's an allegation of gender 

discrimination.  At some point, can't they conclude that 

it is their policy of decentralizing decisionmaking that 

is causing or permitting that discrimination to take

 MR. BOUTROUS:  That -- I think that would be 

an inquiry, Your Honor.  I don't think it would rise to 

a pattern or practice or a common policy that affects 

everyone in the same way.  Certainly, companies do look 

at the -- the situation throughout the company and seek 

to root out discrimination, but it would take more than 

some reports, especially in -- in a company that has so 

many stores and so many units.

 And here, the plaintiffs' claims simply 

aren't typical.  If the three named plaintiffs stand 

before the court, they are supposed to represent 500,000 

or a million or more people and stand in judgment -­

that's the words the Court used in Hansberry v. Lee -­

to represent all those other people.  And the claim is 

that the individual decisionmakers in those other cases 

exercised their discretion in a way that was biased, and 

there's no proof of that. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The Chief Justice's 

question reminds me somewhat of our rule in Monell under 

1983:  A city is not liable for a -- a constitutional 

violation unless it has a policy.  Would you think that 

we could use that as an analogue to determine whether or 

not there is a common question here?

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think the 

analogue is that if a company had a policy, a general 

policy, of discrimination as opposed to here, where it's 

a general policy against discrimination, and it was -­

in the words of the Court in Feeney, saw patterns 

throughout the company and because of sex, because of 

gender, continued to allow the patterns to exist, that 

would raise a different question. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose, following the 

Monell analogue, there's -- it's a -- there's a showing 

of deliberate indifference to the violation.  Would that 

be a policy? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, I think 

14 

deliberate indifference raises a different question.

Under a disparate treatment claim, again, in Feeney, the 

test would be, was the company allowing the 

discrimination to occur because of gender, because it 

wanted there to be discrimination?  There's no evidence 

of that here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there any 

responsibility if you -- the numbers are what has been 

left out so far.  The company gets reports month after 

month showing that women are disproportionately passed 

over for promotion, and there is a pay gap between men 

and women doing the same job.  It happens not once, but

twice.  Isn't there some responsibility on the company 

to say, is gender discrimination at work, and if it is, 

isn't there an obligation to stop it? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, yes, there is an 

obligation to ensure -- for a company to do its best to 

ensure there are not wage gaps and discrimination.  But 

here, for example, if one looks at the aggregated 

statistics that the plaintiffs have pointed to, it 

points to a completely different issue.  It does not 

show that there were gender gaps at the stores among 

comparable people.  That's really the fundamental flaw 

in their case. 

 Their argument is that individual 

14 

decisionmakers throughout the country were making

18 

19

stereotyped decisions and that that had a common effect, 

but they just added everything together.  They haven't 

shown a pattern across the map.  They've added all the 

data together and pointed to disparities, some of which 

mirror some of the -- the statistics that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I thought their 

expert didn't aggregate them together.  He did it 

regionally, not store by store, as your expert did, 

number one; and, number two, that he performed, as 

accepted by the district court, and affirmed by the 

circuit court, any number of controlled variable 

7

Official - Subject to Final Review

comparisons, including job history, job ratings, and 

other things, and found that the disparity could not be 

explained on any of the normal variables that one would 

expect and that the disparity was significantly much 

higher than the 10 competitors of Wal-Mart and what they 

6 

were paying their labor force.

 So, what is speculative about that, number 

one?  And, two, why is that kind of statistical analysis 

inadequate to show that a policy of some sort exists?

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Justice Sotomayor, first, 

plaintiffs' expert did a national regression and then 

simply estimated the regional results.  He did not do a 

regional regression.  But even if he had, these 

statistics go more to the merits.  We think we have 

strong arguments on the merits responding to those 

16 

statistical arguments -­

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that begs the 

legal question, which is -- you're right.  Ultimately, 

you may win and prove to a factfinder that this analysis 

is fatally flawed, but what the district court concluded 

was that on the basis of your expert, whom he discounted 

because your expert was -- was basing analysis on -- on 

premises that the court found not acceptable, that there 

was enough here after a rigorous analysis.

 What's the standard that the court should 

8

use in upsetting that factual conclusion?

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, the district 

judge did not discount Wal-Mart's expert.  The district 

court found that it wasn't the stage at which to make a 

determination between the two.  The standard that we 

think would govern would be the standard that the Second 

Circuit adopted in the IPO case, which says there needs 

to be a choice. 

 When you're talking about discretionary 

decision around the country by different decisionmakers, 

there has to be some demonstration that there's a common 

effect throughout the system.  Our expert's report and 

testimony showed that at 90 percent of the stores, there 

was no pay disparity.  And that's the kind of -- and 

even putting that aside, the plaintiffs needed to come 

forward with something that showed that there was this 

miraculous recurrence at every decision across every 

store of stereotyping, and the evidence simply doesn't 

show that.

 The -- the other problem on the -- on the 

cohesion analysis is that -- again, the typicality 

inquiry.  Each of the plaintiffs have very different 

stories.  One of them was promoted into a managerial 

position.  One was terminated for disciplinary 

violations.  One was promoted and then had a

disciplinary problem and then was demoted.  In each of 

these cases, if this were an individual case, they would 

have to show that they were treated differently than 

people who were situated just like them, with the same 

supervisor, the same department, the same situation. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you think is the 

difference between the standard that the district court 

was required to apply at the certification stage on the 

question whether there was a company-wide policy and the 

-- the standard that would be applied on the merits? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  At the certification stage, 

Justice Alito, the plaintiffs did not have to prove that 

there was an actual policy of discrimination and that 

that was the company's policy, but they at least needed 

to point to a policy that was common and that linked all 

of these disparate individuals and disparate locations 

and different people together.  And -- and one -- their 

argument is that the common policy is giving tens of 

thousands of individuals discretion to do whatever they 

want.  That is not commonality.  It's the opposite. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't think that's quite 

fair, Mr. Boutrous.  I think their argument was that the 

common policy was one of complete subjectivity, was one 

of using factors that allowed gender discrimination to 

come into all employment decisions.  And in Watson, we 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

suggested that that was a policy, a policy of using 

subjective factors only, when making employment 

decisions.  That's exactly the policy that was alleged 

here.

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Justice Kagan, they do not 

argue that it was an entirely subjective process.  As 

the Court suggested in Falcon, entirely subjective 

would -- would be a different issue.  They argue that it 

was excessive subjectivity and that there were general 

overarching company standards that exerted control. 

 On page -- I think it's on page 13 of their 

brief, they say the discretion was unguided.  Three 

pages later they say it was guided by these 

nondiscriminatory policies.  So, it's really an 

incoherent theory that does not have -- pose the kind of

situation you're suggesting. 

17

18 

19 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I guess I'm just a 

little -- a little bit confused as to why excessive 

subjectivity is not a policy that can be alleged in a 

Title VII pattern and practice suit or in a Title VII 

21 

disparate impact suit. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, in Watson, the 

Court did suggest -- did state and -- and hold that 

subjective decisionmaking could be challenged in a 

disparate impact case, but Justice O'Connor's opinion 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

went on to say there needs to be the identification of a 

specific practice within that policy. 

 As the Court said in Falcon, Title VII does 

4 

not govern policies; it governs practices.  And

subjectivity is not a practice if it were a policy.  And 

there was a -- like most companies, Wal-Mart has a 

combination of objective and subjective standards. 

Within that, the plaintiffs -- if they had pointed to 

some particular criteria, people with a great 

personality, they're going to -- they're -- they're the 

ones we're going -- we're going to push up, and they -­

they were trying to tie that to a disparate impact or 

disparate treatment, that would be -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Boutrous, there was a 

case, it was in the '70s, and it was a class action 

against AT&T for, I think, promotion into middle 

management.  What was at issue there was a part -- a 

test, part objective, but then in the end, the final 

step was a so-called total person test, and women 

disproportionately flunked at that total person. 

 And the idea wasn't at all complicated.  It 

was that most people prefer themselves; and so, a 

decisionmaker, all other things being equal, would 

prefer someone that looked like him.  And that was 

found, that total -- the application of that total

person concept was found to be a violation of Title VII.

 This sounds quite similar.  I mean, it's not 

just -- it's not subjective.  You have an expert -- I 

know you have some questions about that expert -- but 

the expert saying that gender bias can creep into a 

system like that simply because of the natural 

phenomenon that people tend to feel comfortable with 

people like themselves. 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, this -- this is 

not like the total person test, but I think that is a 

very good example of something that could be a -- a 

practice inside the -- the overarching policies, and if 

you had a case where a particular decisionmaking unit 

applied the total practice test, and you had disparate 

results in that particular unit, that group of people 

could -- could -- would have a much stronger case for a 

class action. 

 But as Your Honor points out, the -- the 

19 

sociologist here, who is the glue that's supposed to 

20

21 

22 

23

hold this class together, said he couldn't tell if 

stereotyping was occurring one-half of 1 percent or 95 

percent or at all. 

 And this is a class action.  The question 

24 

here is whether that we can assume that every 

25

decisionmaker acted in the same manner in a way that had

in this Court's words the same injury, caused -- the 

plaintiffs had the same interest and the same injury, 

that's the way the Court put it in Amchem, by their own 

expert accepting all of their proof, the answer is no. 

That assumption is not supported by the record.  That's 

why there's not the kind of cohesion that's necessary to 

protect the rights of the absent class members and the 

defendant. 

 The -- the -- the other -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Boutrous, I think that 

that suggests that the plaintiffs would have to 

demonstrate discrimination in every individual case, and 

that's never been the law.  All that the plaintiffs have 

to demonstrate and, especially at this stage in the 

proceedings, is that there is a practice, a policy of 

subjectivity that on the whole results in discrimination 

against women, not that each one of these women in the 

class were themselves discriminated against. 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

At the phase one, we're not arguing that a plaintiff 

would have to come forward and show that every class 

member was discriminated at that point.  Under the 

Teamsters' analysis, there must be proof of a standard 

operating procedure of discrimination.

 Here, it's undisputed that Wal-Mart's 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

policy -- and it wasn't just a written policy; it was 

implemented and enforced rigorously -- that was 

antidiscrimination.  But, Your Honor, you're correct, 

that each person doesn't have to come forward in phase 

one. 

 The big -- the other big problem here is 

that the district judge said in phase two, under 

Teamsters, Wal-Mart would not be entitled to put on its 

individual defenses.  Women who thought they had a claim 

would not be able to come forward if a -- in this 

process, the paper records suggested they didn't have a 

claim, and come into court and have their day in court 

and argue that they should be compensated. 

 The plaintiffs are trying to cut off half of 

the Teamsters' framework, which is fundamental both to 

due process and to Title VII because Title VII's section 

706(g) states very clearly that only victims of 

discrimination may recover.

 MR. BOUTROUS:  If the class prevails, then

claims for themselves but waived those for the class

is a fundamental, crucial violation. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.  But

would -- would the -- would the women with a claim for

she could have not received notice and not had an 

opportunity to opt out? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  That's the -- that's the 

24 

problem -- that goes to the problem with this (b)(2)

certification, that this case, if it -- if it were going

to be certified at all, needed to be looked at under 

Rule 23(b)(3).  Rule 23(b)(3) was -- was created for 

precisely this sort of circumstance, the growing edge of 

the law where individualized monetary claims are at 

stake.  The -- the language of Rule 23(b)(2) speaks of 

6 

injunctive and declaratory relief.

either; is that correct? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Our view is the plaintiffs 

will -- will not be able to satisfy those -- those 

provisions, but that's why they brought it under Rule 

23(b)(2), to circumvent the procedural protections of 

superiority, predominance, and the like. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would that bar the 

(b)(2) class?  Meaning if their claim is, as they state 

it, that they're seeking injunctive and declaratory 

relief against a discriminatory impact or -- case or a 

pattern and practice case, wouldn't that have value and 

wouldn't that value be, standing alone without the 

damages component, be that the plaintiffs who come in 

later have a presumption that discrimination affected 

them and the burden shifts to Wal-Mart to prove that 

there was a nondiscriminatory reason?

 MR. BOUTROUS:  There certainly could be a 

benefit from an injunction if -- if the plaintiffs met 

all the standards.  The problem here is that the -- the 

individualized damage claims, the back pay claims, 

engulfed and overwhelm the injunctive relief -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even if they did, why 

couldn't you separate out the (b)(2) issue from the 

(b)(3) question of whether monetary damages have enough 

common facts and law to warrant a certification under 

(b)(3)? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, some courts have 

done that, looked at the injunctive relief claims under 

-- under the (b)(2) standard and the monetary reliefs 

under a (b)(3) standard.  That can raise other 

complications, especially here the plaintiffs are 

seeking punitive damages as well, but that's at least a 

possibility.  It would certainly be better than this, 

shoe-horning these monetary relief claims that are so 

individualized.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, would you address 

the -- address them separately for me, and tell me why a 

(b)(2) class couldn't exist only on injunctive relief? 

And if it can, if you're conceding it can, then is your 

attack merely that the monetary component of this, the 

back pay -- which, you know, I know the dispute on

whether that's equitable relief or compensatory relief 

or not -- why that just can't be separated out and put 

into the (b)(3) claim? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, our view is that 

the injunctive relief claim still has significant 

problems concerning cohesion, adequacy, typicality, 

commonality.  On the adequacy point, this case includes 

at least 544 store managers who are alleged to be 

discriminators and victims.  If that's not a conflict 

under Amchem and the adequacy test in Hansberry v. Lee, 

I don't know what is.  The -- the women who are 

compelled to be in the class -- they can't opt out, 

they're current employees, they're former employees, 

they cut across every position in the country, and 

there's no demonstration that they're being affected in 

a common way.  So, I think there would still be those 

commonality, typicality, cohesion problems because of 

the nature of the plaintiffs' case here, the notion of 

the common policy being giving -- giving discretion and 

-- and independent judgment. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that -- correct 

me if I'm wrong, but I thought that this district judge 

said that -- that the absent class members would get 

notice and have an opportunity to -- to opt out.  So, a 

-- a plaintiff, a member of the class who wants to go 

19

for compensation instead of just back pay could opt out.

 MR. BOUTROUS:  The district court, Justice 

Ginsburg, limited that ruling to the punitive damage 

claim, and the Ninth Circuit made clear it was viewing 

it that way.  It said under its ruling, which sent 

punitive damages back, that would simplify things 

because then there wouldn't have to be notice and an 

opportunity to opt out under back pay.  And back pay is 

monetary relief for individuals.  To bind people based 

on a balancing test under (b)(2) to a judgment to which 

they were not a party -- in Taylor v. Sturgell, this 

Court talked about the fundamental rule that an 

individual is not bound by a judgment to which they're 

not a party and said we need crisp rules with sharp 

corners in this area where such a fundamental right is 

at stake.  And that's why we think it needs to be Rule 

23(b)(3) when individual monetary relief is at stake. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That begs my question. 

19 

Are you talking about any monetary relief?  You're -­

20

you're claiming, I'm assuming, that monetary relief 

21 

includes equitable relief. 

22

23

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Yes, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The Fifth Circuit has 

24 

described a test where it doesn't use the predominant 

25

question; it uses the incidental test.  What's wrong 

20

 MR. BOUTROUS:  That test is much better than 

the test that was applied below.  The plaintiffs have 

walked away from the two tests that were applied in the 

lower court.  They have never contended they could meet 

the incidental damages test.  And under the Fifth 

Circuit's case, the Allison case, only automatic back 

pay that goes to the group as a whole would qualify for 

that.  Here, this is individualized relief.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- that's where I'm 

going to.  Would you accept that incidental test as 

appropriate to the question of when monetary damages 

predominate or don't? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, the text of Rule 

23(b)(2) is very clear.  It talks about injunctive and 

declaratory relief.  The only ambiguity that's created 

is from the advisory committee note, and as this Court 

said three weeks ago in the Milner case, we don't look 

to legislative history to try to create ambiguities. 

The -- the other parts of the advisory committee notes 

make very clear that the drafters were concerned about 

the historical antecedents where it was an 

injunctive-only case to -- of -- to desegregate and the 

like.  I think the drafters of Rule 23(b)(2) would have 

been shocked if they had learned that this case that 

21

involves millions of claims for individualized monetary 

relief were -- were being sought to be included in a 

(b)(2) class. 

 That said, Your Honor, the incidental damage 

test is -- is I think far superior because it's at least 

clearer and would be closer to a sharp, bright-line 

rule, which is required in this context. 

 I'd like to go back briefly to the point I

made earlier about individual relief and taking away the

rights of both Wal-Mart and the absent class members. 

The procedures that would be used here -- the Ninth 

Circuit proposed a statistical sampling method.  The 

plaintiffs do not defend that.  They do not mention 

the Hilao case, which was the cornerstone of the -- the 

Ninth Circuit's ruling, which would allow sort of a 

prediction about who might have been hurt, how many 

people might have been hurt, and then a divvying up of 

-- of moneys based on that. 

 The district court precluded the fundamental 

Teamsters hearings, which would allow, once a 

presumption, if one was to arise, of discrimination 

occurred in a pattern of practice -- would allow the 

defendant to then show that it didn't discriminate on -­

on an individual basis, and it would allow the 

individuals to come in and have their day in court.

That violates Title VII.  It violates the Rules Enabling 

Act, and -- and we think it really shows some of the 

core flaws in this case. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the class 

does -- does not prevail; it loses?  Does that bar an 

individual woman at a particular Wal-Mart from bringing 

these same claims? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Yes, Your Honor.  There's a 

9 

presumption in -- in the world of class actions -­

19

there's two that I think the plaintiffs are -- are 

relying on.  One is that class actions are always good, 

and the bigger the class action, the better, and that 

the class will win.  None of those presumptions can be 

counted on.  If the plaintiffs lose, and they -- and 

here their compensatory damages claims, I think, would 

be gone because the named plaintiffs are asserting them. 

If they tried to bring a case as pattern or practice or 

pay or promotion, there would be significant questions 

of res judicata and collateral estoppel.  And it's not 

fair to anyone to put this all into one big class. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you're not suggesting 

that they would be precluded on individual 

discrimination claims, are you? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  No, Your Honor, if they had 

individual claims that were separate from the nucleus of 

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company

operative facts here, that might pose a different 

question. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what if it were

5

discriminate was because he had total subjective 

6 

discretion in his hiring?

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Then I -- then there would be

a series of remedial measures that would direct Wal-Mart 

to provide for detailed criteria by which to make pay 

and promotion decisions that are job-related in a way 

that hasn't been true up until now.  It would provide 

for it to hold managers accountable for the decisions 

they make; it would ensure effective oversight of the -­

of these pay and promotion decisions in a way that the 

company had -- while the company did have, by the way, 

information regularly submitted to it about pay

decisions, it took no action, and it did not effectively

monitor -- allowed these problems to fester. 

12

can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad 

actors?  I assume with three -- however many thousands

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Surely it won't be 

-- if somebody sends one letter in saying the guy at 

this plant -- is -- plant -- this store is 

discriminating, that can't be enough to support your 

theory. 

 MR. SELLERS:  That's correct.  We don't 

submit that.  There is no minimum number that this Court 

has ever set.  Teamsters, as an example in Teamsters, 

the Court had before it about 40 examples, but 

significantly they weren't required.  In order to 

establish a pattern and practice of liability -- and we 

have more than that, of course -- but in order to 

establish a pattern and practice of liability or at 

least a prima facie case, Teamsters holds that what you 

need to do is show that there were disparities 

sufficiently substantial to create an inference of 

discrimination with respect to a discrete practice. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it -- is it true 

24 

that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was 

25

less than the national average? 

26
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 MR. SELLERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, the 

position -- I don't know that that's a fair comparison. 

The position that Wal-Mart has advanced makes no -- the 

comparison it makes is with the general population, not 

with people in retail. 

 Wal-Mart's obligation under Title VII is to 

ensure that its managers do not make pay decisions 

because of sex, and the comparison that's relevant is 

between men and women at Wal-Mart, not the general 

population that includes people in retail, but includes 

railroad workers and all kinds of other people.  That's 

not the appropriate comparison.

22 

23

under your theory of the case? 

 MR. SELLERS:  Justice Kennedy, our theory is 

that Wal-Mart provided to its managers unchecked 

discretion in the way that this Court's Watson decision 

addressed that was used to pay women less than men who 

were doing the same work in the same -- the same 

facilities at the same time, even though -- though those 

women had more seniority and higher performance, and 

provided fewer opportunities for promotion than women 

because of sex.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's -- it's hard for me

to see that the -- your complaint faces in two 

directions.  Number one, you said this is a culture 

where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything 

that's going on.  Then in the next breath, you say, 

well, now these supervisors have too much discretion. 

It seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm 

just not sure what the unlawful policy is. 

 MR. SELLERS:  Well, Justice Kennedy, there 

9 

is no inconsistency any more than it's inconsistent 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

within Wal-Mart's own personnel procedures.  The company 

provides to its managers this discretion, which, by the 

way, is very discrete.  It is not the broad kind of -­

we're not attacking every facet of the pay and promotion 

decisions.  The District Court found specific features 

of the pay and promotion process that are totally 

discretionary.  There's no guidance whatsoever about how 

to make those decisions. 

 But with respect to the discretion, every 

19 

store, the District Court found, is provided -- managers 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

are provided with the same level of discretion.  But the 

company also has a very strong corporate culture that 

ensures that managers, not just with respect to the 

practices we're challenging, but in all respects, what 

they call the Wal-Mart way, and the purpose of that is 

to ensure that in these various stores that, contrary to

 MR. SELLERS:  It is disparate treatment.  It 

is a form of disparate treatment because they are making 

these decisions because of sex, and they -- and they are 

doing so with -- we have evidence that we think, through 

the stereotyping evidence we have here, as well as the 

statistical results -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I'm getting

whipsawed here.  On the one hand, you say the problem is 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand 

you say there is a -- a strong corporate culture that 

guides all of this.  Well, which is it?  It's either the 

individual supervisors are left on their own, or else 

there is a strong corporate culture that tells them what 

to do. 

 MR. SELLERS:  Well, Justice Scalia, there is 

22 

this broad discretion given the managers. 

23

24

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 

 MR. SELLERS:  But they do not make these 

decisions in a vacuum.  They make the decisions within a

 MR. SELLERS:  No, I'm not.  I'm suggesting 

they are given this discretion, but they are informed by 

the company about how to exercise that discretion.  So, 

it's effectively saying -­

to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion.

another -- it's certainly -- the bottom line is, they 

didn't, and the results show it.  There was consistent 

disparities in every one of the regions, 41 regions. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you know about -­

about the unchallenged fact that the central company had 

a policy, an announced policy, against sex 

discrimination, so that it wasn't totally subjective at 

the managerial level?  It was, you make these hiring 

decisions, but you do not make them on the basis of sex. 

Wasn't that the central policy of the company? 

 MR. SELLERS:  That was a written policy. 

That was not the policy that was effectively 

communicated to the managers. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, how was -- how was 

that established?

 MR. SELLERS:  Well, what we have, as I said 

before, is evidence of -- for instance, at the -- at the 

Sam Walton Institute, where every manager has to be 

trained before they become a manager, they provide as a 

question -- a response to a standard question:  Why are 

women so underrepresented, or so few women in 

management?  And the response given was, because men 

seek advancement, are more aggressive in seeking 

advancement.

 Now, that's a typical, stereotypical 

statement provided to every person going through the 

management training program, that they then go off and 

inform -- that informs their decisions when they make -­

when they have this discretion to make promotions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that causes them 

16 

intentionally to discriminate on the basis of sex?

stereotype about that women are less aggressive when it 

comes to assessing their suitability for promotions.

Scalia, first of all, we think that that is -- the 

questions you are raising are ones that Wal-Mart can 

raise at trial.  The question at this juncture is 

whether there are -- there are questions common to the 

class. 

 We've identified what has been recognized as 

a -- a common policy, that there's no dispute this 

policy applies throughout the company.  And the fact 

that we, at this juncture, are -- I mean, and we have 

shown, as we think we have to in order to satisfy 

commonality, that there are disparities adverse to 

women.  And we have the means to show, through the

How are they going to calculate the back pay? 

 MR. SELLERS:  Well, the -- the approach that 

the District Court endorsed, an approach we recommended, 

and which has been endorsed by seven circuits over a 

period of 40 years, is in circumstances here -- like 

here, which are, admittedly, the exception to the rule, 

where the company had no standards by which to make 

promotion and pay decisions, they had kept no records of 

who -- the reasons for people being promoted and the 

reasons why they pay people certain amounts, that as a 

consequence of that, the Albemarle decision and the 

Teamsters decision make clear that the obligation of the 

District Court upon finding of liability is to attempt 

to reconstruct the decisions that would have been made 

in the absence of discrimination. 

 And the District Court found here -- and we 

19 

submit it's not clearly erroneous -- that the more 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

reliable method for doing so is to use a formula relying 

on Wal-Mart's robust database in which it captures 

performance, seniority, and a host of other job-related 

variables, factors that bear on pay and promotion 

decisions, and permits a comparison, a very precise 

comparison, in a way that having individual hearings 

34

relying on hazy memories, post hoc rationalizations, 

doesn't.

policy in favor of equal treatment of men and women? 

You know, the answer to your -- the answer to your 

question was women don't have as many positions because 

managers discriminate against them in -- in hiring and 

in promotion, yet you still have the same subjective 

delegation system. 

 Could you have a class of women who were 

harmed by this subjective policy, even though it was 

clear that the policy of the corporation favored equal 

employment opportunity?

 MR. SELLERS:  Well, I think if the -- if 

there were -- as clear as your hypothetical suggest, 

that the company had a policy of that sort, it would be 

appropriate for it to seek summary judgment. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, no, they 

still -- well, then you're saying it is not enough that 

it be a subjective decision.  This company has a 

thousand stores, and sure enough in a thousand stores 

you're going to be able to find a goodly number who 

aren't following the company's policy, who are 

exercising their subjective judgment in a way that 

35

 Couldn't you bring a class of people

subjective policy?

 MR. SELLERS:  You could bring a class case 

on behalf -- if I understand your hypothetical -- on 

behalf of women -- I'm sorry -- who were subject to 

discrimination as a consequence of that unchecked 

discretion.

 I -- I want to be clear that we shouldn't 

lose sight of the fact that we have evidence here of 

results from this that are, that are really 

extraordinary. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is the -- is the common

19 

what people say and how they behave, many of which 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

central management knew, and given the results which 

central management knew or should have known, should 

central management under the law have withdrawn some of 

the subjective discretion in order to stop these 

results?

 MR. SELLERS:  That -- that is a fair way to

put it.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If that is a fair way to 

put it, is that a question that every one of the women 

in this class shares in common?

 MR. SELLERS:  I -- I believe so, Justice 

Breyer, because they've all been the subject in every 

one of these stores to this very broad discretion. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The district judge didn't 

9 

think so.  Didn't the district judge say that in 

10

awarding back pay some would get a windfall and others 

11 

would be uncompensated? 

12

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

 MR. SELLERS:  Actually, Justice Ginsburg, 

I -- I think the district judge did not find that.  What 

he found was that the formula, and I can assure you the 

formula we intend -- would tend -- tend to use is a 

regression analysis that would permit a comparison 

between each woman and the amount she was paid and 

similarly situated men, taking into account, as I said, 

performance and seniority and the like, and you will 

find there are women that were not underpaid and the 

21 

formula will show that they should get no back pay. 

22

23

 I think that the district court -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought -- I thought 

24 

his point was not simply that some women were not 

25

underpaid, but women, if you had an individual case, the

employer might show this person could have been fired, 

disciplined, and wasn't owed any back pay, not that she 

compares favorably to a -- a male peer, but that she 

wouldn't have gotten any pay at all.

 MR. SELLERS:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

kind of factors that are entered into this -- this 

economic model, performance in particular, should 

capture whether somebody should have been fired. 

That -- that is a very important part of the model here 

that permits people to -- and we found -- the evidence 

shows that women were, in fact -- had higher performance 

than men and were nonetheless still underpaid. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can I just say something 

14 

here?  Doesn't your class include both those women who 

15

were underpaid and both -- and those women who weren't 

16 

underpaid? 

17

both?

 MR. SELLERS:  That's -­

 MR. SELLERS:  As every -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that commonality? 

 MR. SELLERS:  As every class does, Justice 

Scalia.  Every class has some portion of its members who 

are not harmed by the discrimination.  As the Teamsters 

case recognized, what is common about them is they were 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company

3 

4

5

all subject to the same highly discretionary 

decisionmaking, even if some of them weren't harmed by 

it.  That still presents a question common to the class. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, correct me if I'm 

wrong, I thought the Teamsters case was an action by the 

6 

government that wasn't a class action case. 

7

8 

9 

10

11

 MR. SELLERS:  That -- that is correct, but 

it -- it -- it is the paradigm we use for determining 

what you need to establish a pattern or practice of 

discrimination. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Pattern or practice, 

12 

that's correct. 

13

 Help me, if you can, with this.  Let's -­

14 

let's suppose that experts' testimony, sociologists and 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

so forth, establish that in industry generally and in 

retail industry generally, women still are discriminated 

against by a mathematical factor of X.  You have a 

company that has a very specific policy against 

discrimination, and you look at their -- the way their 

employees are treatment -- are treated, and you find a 

disparity by that same mathematical factor X, does that 

give you a cause of action? 

 MR. SELLERS:  If the -- I'm sorry -- if

disparity with -- that women are subjected to are the 

same in the company as they are -­

 MR. SELLERS:  Outside the company. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- society wide, but the 

company does have a policy against discrimination. 

 MR. SELLERS:  Right.  I -- I would say that 

the company's responsibility under Title VII is to 

ensure its managers do not make pay and promotion 

decisions because of sex.  If the comparison between the 

pay women receive, for instance, who are similarly 

situated to men within the company is such that they are 

underpaid compared to similarly situated men in the 

company, then -- then the company would have legal 

responsibility under Title VII, regardless of what 

happens in the rest of the industry, what happens in the 

16 

rest of the world. 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would that be true even if 

18 

you could not show deliberate indifference? 

19

20

 MR. SELLERS:  Well, I don't know that the -­

indifference.  I think that under this Court's decision 

in Heller -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Where there's no 

24 

deliberate indifference and a specific policy 

25

prohibiting the discrimination, can you still proceed?

 MR. SELLERS:  I -- well, I would submit you 

still can proceed.  If -- if the policy -- announcing a 

policy saying don't discriminate were to be effective 

in -- in immunizing companies against liability in class 

actions, imagine every company in the country would 

publish that policy and have free license to go 

discriminate as much as it wanted to. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I understand your answer to 

9 

Justice Kennedy's question to be that this typical 

10

company would be in violation of Title VII; is that 

11 

correct? 

12

13

 MR. SELLERS:  That's correct. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  That's what the -- and 

14 

that's what the academic literature on which your theory 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

is based includes; isn't that right? 

 MR. SELLERS:  With -- Justice Alito, I think 

it's not just academic literature, I think it's the 

precedents from this Court.  I think that's the -­

that's the premise behind Teamsters, that the -- you 

look to in Hazelwood, which makes very clear that you 

don't look to populations outside the company in making 

comparisons. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So, you have the company 

24 

that is absolutely typical of the entire American 

25

workforce, and let's say every single -- there weren't 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

any variations.  Every single company had exactly the 

same profile.  Then you would say every single company 

is in violation of Title VII? 

 MR. SELLERS:  It -- that could very well be 

the case.  If -- if the -- I think that Title VII holds 

companies responsible for the actions they take with 

respect to their employees.  There certainly are 

industries, and there were 30 years -- many more 30 or 

40 years ago when Teamsters was decided, where the 

entire industry might have had evidence of 

discrimination.  That would not -- there is not a 

negligence standard under this statute that immunizes 

companies because they follow the same standards as 

others.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what -- what -­

what's -- what's your answer assumes is if there is a 

disparity between the advancement of women and the 

advancement of men, it can only be attributed to sex 

discrimination -­

MR. SELLERS:  No. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, otherwise, how could 

you say that all -- all of the companies are -- are -­

are presumptively engaging in sex discrimination? 

 MR. SELLERS:  Well, Justice Scalia, I --

I -- I want to deal with the -- in this instance, we

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  See, I wasn't talking about 

this case.  I was talking about your answer to Justice 

Alito -­

 MR. SELLERS:  I'm sorry. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- which said that, you 

10

know, it may well be that every industry in the United 

11

 MR. SELLERS:  No, I -- I don't -- I don't

to make clear is that the fact that there are other 

companies in the same industry where the same problems 

may arise, which, by the way, wasn't true here, where 

Wal-Mart was behind the other large retailers, doesn't 

mean that a company is any less liable for the 

discrimination practiced in its own workplace. 

 I can't speak for the rest of society, I 

don't have any reason to think the entire society is

described a kind of formula that you would use.  When -­

when -- when is the formula approach right and when is 

the individual hearings approach right? 

 MR. SELLERS:  Well, I think it's a -- it's a 

call that, of course, we leave -- we should leave to the 

district court in the first instance, but factors that 

could weigh in the balance would include whether or not 

you have available the kind of information that we do 

here from database with which to be able to more 

reliably construct the -- the kinds of decisions that 

would have been made in the absence of discrimination. 

 Likewise, there may be companies where they 

have kept better records or kept any records or have 

more substantial standards that would permit the 

reconstruction of those decisions through individual 

hearings.  I don't think this is something that -- I'm 

not contending that under -- that you could always use a 

formula-like approach in connection with these cases. 

44

couldn't possibly have the hearing in each case on

 MR. SELLERS:  The district -- I'm sorry, the 

9 

district court did make the comment that the sheer 

10

11 

12

number of class members would make the administration of 

individual hearings difficult, but the district court 

went on, very importantly -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought he said

"impossible."

 MR. SELLERS:  Sorry? 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought he said more

impossible, but the important point is that he went -­

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

the district court went ahead and made specific findings 

about the extent to which the -- the particular record 

here shows that the use of a formula would be more 

reliable than individualized hearings. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm -- I'm a 

little confused, all right? 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 MR. SELLERS:  Okay. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because you're saying an 

individualized hearing is impossible, but that's exactly 

what you're saying you're going to do, only through 

statistics. 

 MR. SELLERS:  That's -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're going to say 

through my statistical model, I will be able to identify 

those women in the class who are deserving of pay 

raises.  What that doesn't answer is when in this 

process is the defendant going to be given an 

opportunity to defend against that finding? 

 MR. SELLERS:  Right. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because you're -- are 

you suggesting that the district court would 

appropriately bar a defendant where there's no proof of 

intentionality with respect to not keeping records, that 

it was intended to stop these women from collecting 

money, et cetera?  When are they going to get a chance?

of -- in a way that's consistent with a reliable 

determination of who should have been paid what and

 MR. SELLERS:  I -- I'm -- let me answer you 

directly.  I'm not saying that.  Wal-Mart has an 

opportunity to make the case that with whatever showing 

it wishes to make it can reconstruct these decisions 

more reliably, and in an entirely subjective 

environment, and if it does, it can offer evidence in 

certain circumstances; but it hasn't done so; and I 

don't submit it's going to be able to do so here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This -- this takes 

evidence, to establish that -- that it's more reliable 

to have a hearing with evidence on the particular 

promotion or dismissal of the individual, that that is 

more reliable than using -- I don't care how admirable a 

statistical guess you make; I mean is that really a 

16 

question?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  We must have a pretty bad

 MR. SELLERS:  Well, I think it's not the 

judicial system, it's the recordkeeping of the company, 

and the standardlessness of its -- of the pay and 

promotion processes that basically mean 10 years later, 

these managers are going to be coming forward to 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company

speculate about what they did 10 years earlier, with no 

records to cross-examine them on.  That is not the -­

the model for a reliable adjudication. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We should use that in jury 

trials, too, for really old cases.  We should just put a

 MR. SELLERS:  I -- Justice Scalia, I submit 

it is; and the circuits that have been considering this 

for 40 years have so held.  In the narrow set of 

circumstances that we have here, where there are 

16 

standardless, recordless decisions at issue. 

17

18 

19 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if it's standardless 

and -- and recordless, then why is there commonality? 

It seems to me that what you -- your answer that you 

just gave really is a -- shows a flaw in your case on 

21 

commonality. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. SELLERS:  No, Justice Kennedy, the -­

the standardless and recordless aspect is with respect 

to trying to reconstruct these decisions years later. 

As I said before, we have a common policy here; it 

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

presents a common question.  We've shown evidence that 

would probably create a prima facie case of pattern or 

practice under Teamsters, and we think we've satisfied 

the three components of commonality that we think need 

to be addressed. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One thing you haven't 

touched on is to -- to have, first of all the question 

of whether (b)(2) is limited to injunction and 

declaratory relief.

 MR. SELLERS:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if -- if you follow 

the advisory committee's note, then if dollars -- if 

damages predominates -- if damages predominate, then you 

can't use (b)(2).  You have to make your case under 

(b)(3); and the one factor here is that about half the 

class is gone, so -- they're not interested in 

injunctive relief, but everybody's interested in money. 

So, why isn't the money -- why do you say that the -­

that the injunction -- injunctive relief is the thing 

and the damages are lesser, rather than the other way

that, because they continue to have more employees 

adding -- added at the company.  So, I wouldn't 

presume -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But nobody's leaving yet.

 MR. SELLERS:  Well, there are people 

leaving, but the point -- but more importantly, the 

advisory committee note with respect to Rule 23(b)(2) 

makes clear that there is a -- that the -- whether or 

not an action or inaction is taken with respect to the 

class which is the predicate to (b)(2) certification, it 

depends on -- it doesn't depend on the number of people 

who are adversely affected by that action. 

 And so, as a consequence where the former 

14 

employees are -- that they -- if they would be included 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21

in the class under (b)(2) because that -- the question 

is not on a day-to-day basis who should have been in a 

position to seek injunctive relief and who's employed 

and who's not. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 MR. SELLERS:  Thank you.

 Let me begin with this question of back pay 

because Mr. Sellers has made clear under their vision 

Wal-Mart would never have an opportunity to prove that 

it didn't discriminate against a woman who was seeking 

back pay; and the district court did not suggest that it 

might be difficult, as Mr. Sellers suggested.  The 

district court, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, said that 

he found it would be impossible; not just because of the 

number of people, but because of the nature of the 

claims, that discretionary decisions were being 

implemented in a way that affected different people 

differently. 

 The -- the problem here Mr. Sellers says is 

14 

that the records are not available.  Then he says we're 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

going to have a -- a proceeding where the district judge 

relies only on the records, that he says are inadequate, 

to allow a reconstruction of the decision.  That is not 

a process known to our jurisprudence.  It doesn't 

comport with due process.  It takes away Wal-Mart's 

rights under Title VII; it injures the rights of the 

21 

individual women, who the record -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't -- you don't 

seriously contend that if a plaintiff, if a policy were 

found or practice of discrimination that a woman 

couldn't come in and say they put X in, I had a longer

history at Wal-Mart, I had far superior job ratings, I 

had no criticisms of my work, and I wasn't promoted. 

Wouldn't that be enough for her to show that that policy 

influenced her lack of selection?

 MR. BOUTROUS:  I agree with you, Justice

Sotomayor.  Except -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And your personal 

database has all that information.  So, why is it 

impossible to try these cases other than because of 

their large numbers?  That's a different issue. 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Yes, Your Honor, what you've 

just outlined, we agree that a woman should be able to 

come in and say that, and she may say well, the records 

don't show what really happened.  I -- I had more 

experience; I was a much better employee than the guy 

working next to me.  Under the plaintiff's theory in 

order to get a class here, they have thrown that out the 

window; that woman would not be able to come and 

testify.  Wal-Mart wouldn't be able to say this person 

was a terrible employee, this person was a great 

employee.  On the record, it's not impossible to 

recreate these decisions.  The record is filled with 

declarations from managers who remember very well that 

Ms. Dukes violated company policy, that Ms. Arana was 

fired for infractions regarding how she kept her hours.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If you just spend one 

second, remember my question.  We've got a common issue. 

Why isn't that enough at least to support a (b)(2) 

injunctive action?

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, the -- the 

scenario you outline -- there's no dispute about the 

policies that existed at the time, that there were -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That sounds like the merits 

9 

you're getting to.  His point, remember, is this is just 

10

11 

12 

13

certification.  So, my question is:  Assuming they can 

support it with evidence, why can't they have their 

(b)(2) class, at least on an injunctive relief? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Because, Your Honor, the -­

14 

the common policy is one that affects everyone 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22

24

differently by definition.  Therefore, these plaintiffs 

are not typical, and they are not arguing that everyone 

was affected the same way by the common policy.  Many 

women thrived.  Maybe some men stereotyped or some women 

stereotyped the other direction.  Five hundred and 

forty-four of the plaintiffs are female store managers. 

So, it's impossible to make these sweeping 

generalizations, which, of course, is what stereotyping 

is supposed to prevent.  And so, it's -- there's 

absolutely no way there can be a fair process here.

 On the policy question, the policy -- the

plaintiffs point to the general policies and the central 

control, but the one policy they do not want to confront 

is the policy against discrimination.  It was not just a 

written policy on paper.

 In fact, the -- there's a declaration at 

page 1576 of the Joint Appendix that lays out the very 

aggressive efforts the company -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about the vice 

9 

president that said it was just window dressing or 

10

11

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

something like that? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  I'm glad you asked about 

that, Justice Scalia.  Here's what he said.  He 

testified about the diversity goals of the company at 

the time, the effort to get more women into management, 

and he said in his view, until the company linked 

diversity goals to compensation of managers, it would be 

lip service. 

 He wasn't saying the whole program was lip 

19 

service.  He was one of the advocates for diversity in 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

the company.  He wanted to be more aggressive.  He said 

his -- his goals were 20 percent and other people's were 

10.  So -- so, it's completely misleading to suggest he 

was -- he was denigrating the entire policy. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think he's just making 

your -- their point, which is if they started paying 

55

women the same as men, they might get more diversity. 

2

 MR. BOUTROUS:  They do pay the same as men, 

3 

Your Honor.  The record reflects that. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's the whole 

issue that's in dispute. 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Thank you. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

 The case is submitted.
