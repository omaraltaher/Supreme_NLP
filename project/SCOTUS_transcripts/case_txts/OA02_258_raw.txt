CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-258, Susan Jinks v. Richland County.


Mr. Peck.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PECK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


In enacting section 1367, Congress took up this


Court's invitation in Finley to manage the boundaries of


supplemental jurisdiction.  It had two goals in doing so. 


It sought to provide a Federal forum for plaintiffs that


so chose to use it, and for -- for reasons of respect for


the interests of comity and federalism, it provided a 

mechanism by which those cases may be returned to State


court. 


They knew that there was a dilemma, a dilemma


caused by the operation of statutes of limitations, and so


they sought to find and found a simple, practical,


workable solution that traveled down a well-trod path. 


It's a path that was traveled down by the Soldier and


Sailors' Relief Act, a act that also tolls State statutes


of limitations even when exigent circumstances do not


exist.  And in the case in 1993 holding that, Conroy, this

Court found that it was applicable in that instance to a


defendant who was a town. 


It also traveled down that road in section 108


of the Bankruptcy Act.  This too provides that kind of 30-


day window after dismissal of the automatic stay or


lifting of the automatic stay for a plaintiff to file an


action which is otherwise purely a State matter in State


court. 


This Court found in Stewart v. Kahn that there


is no federalism bar to congressional authority as long as


that authority exists someplace in the Constitution. 


Throughout its history, pursuant to Article I, which has a


cognate provision duplicative of the authority it derives


also from Article III, Congress has used its jurisdiction-


setting authority as a traffic cop over the area of 

concurrent State and Federal jurisdiction.  It has done so


almost from the beginning in the Anti-Injunction Act, the


removal statute, and has always found this to be a


necessary incident of maintaining a dual-court system. 


QUESTION:  Well, the Anti-Injunction Act just


applies to Federal courts, doesn't it? 


MR. PECK:  The -- it gives Federal courts the


authority, though, to stay a State action when it


interferes with the jurisdiction of the Federal court.


QUESTION:  It's an -- that -- that's an

exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.


MR. PECK:  That's an exception contained in the


Anti-Injunction Act, and another exception is when an act


of Congress so provides. 


The choice of tolling did not attempt to give


longer life in State court than it would have enjoyed in


Federal court.  It did not eliminate defenses that were


available in Federal court, have the matter remain there. 


It did not change the State's policy on waiver of


municipal liability or alter its statute of limitations. 


It simply said that the case, as it stood in Federal


court, is now available to be heard in State court.  The


State is free to change both its waiver of immunity, its


statute of limitations, and Congress accepts those changes


regardless of the application of the supplemental 

jurisdiction statute.


Once that jurisdiction attaches, once the


Federal court has authority to hear the State action, then


even after the Federal -- Federal claim has fallen away,


the court still has the jurisdiction to hear what


otherwise would have been a purely State claim. 


This is unusual in a diversity case.  When


complete diversity is broken, the jurisdiction ends.  But


here no one, not the Supreme Court of South Carolina, not


the respondents, not the amici, questioned Congress'

authority to say that this remains a Federal matter


because a Federal interest has attached because the matter


has now been heard.


QUESTION:  I didn't understand it that way, I


thought South Carolina said, Federal court, you want to


take this and deal with this stale claim?  That's all


right with us.  It's one of the ironies of the case that


the State's position is the Federal court can have it if


you keep it.  The only thing they can't do is give it back


to us when we don't want it because that would be


commandeering the use of our courts.  South Carolina's


position is the Federal court can keep our State claim in


Federal court.  Indeed, it must if it wants the claim to


remain alive.


MR. PECK: 


That -- that is correct, and even at 

this late date, rule 60(b) would enable a plaintiff like


Susan Jinks to seek to reopen that Federal case, to -- to


reconsider its judgment and allow this case to still live


if -- if the tolling provision is ineffective. 


So here what we're saying is that there's a


continuing Federal interest in this matter.  There's --


there's been a Federal attachment to what otherwise would


have been a purely State matter.  In a removal situation,


for example, South Carolina could not refuse a remand and


we contend that that authority which is contained in the

removal statute is the same kind of authority that


Congress is exercising here because what Congress has


effectively done is define the legal effect of the


appearance of this matter in Federal court and the Federal


disposition of it.  And the State courts of South Carolina


or any other State is not equipped, it's not authorized to


refuse that definition because Congress is the supreme


sovereign of Federal law.  So --


QUESTION:  We -- we know what Congress has --


has -- has defined.  Why is it important?  I mean, what is


the -- how would you define the important interest to the


Federal courts in -- in our seeing the constitutional


issue your way?


MR. PECK:  Well, first of all, Congress wanted


to provide this Federal forum. 


They clearly had the 

authority to do that.  But they also wanted to take in the


interest of comity which this Court has always referred to


as a vital consideration. 


QUESTION:  The State says, we don't want this


kind of comity.  Keep it. 


MR. PECK:  It's -- it's very nice for the State


to have that interest, but the federalist design of our


Constitution provides that impetus that Congress was


acting on.


QUESTION:  No, but I -- I want to get down to

specifically what's important to the Federal courts and to


Congress. 


MR. PECK:  Well --


QUESTION:  Why would it hurt the Federal courts


if you lose this case?  What's -- practically what's --


what's at stake?


MR. PECK:  I -- I think there are -- there are


several things that might happen.  Right now what we call


supplemental jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion.  It


would be turned into a doctrine of plaintiffs' rights,


that if the State courts are refusing to receive these


case -- cases, then the Federal courts will be obligated


to hear these State matters even if they were novel and


complex matters in which only the State courts have the


appropriate expertise to hear it. 


And I think that would 

cause some problems. 


QUESTION:  What difference does complexity make


if the State Federal court's position is we don't want to


clutter up Federal courts with a lot of State tort --


garden variety, simple State tort claims?  We don't want


to be a fender bender court.


MR. PECK:  And I think it is perfectly


legitimate in Congress' jurisdiction-setting authority for


them to make that determination.  These are matters that


are --

 QUESTION:  The -- the idea is that Federal


courts should be occupied with Federal cases and not with


State cases. 


MR. PECK:  And I -- I think that is an


appropriate -- appropriate reason for Congress to adopt


this kind of a statute to assure that that happens.


The other -- Justice Souter, the other possible


consequence is that plaintiffs, fearful that a Federal


court will not hear their matter, will not take it back if


the -- the State courts will not accept the matter, may be


left without a cause of action on their State claim, that


they will suddenly be shut out the door.  And in order


to --


QUESTION:  And how is that going to hurt the


Federal courts?


MR. PECK:  That does not necessarily hurt the


Federal courts, but Congress certainly has a right to be


concerned for those litigants and try to --


QUESTION:  Why -- why isn't the person to be


concerned for those litigants the State courts under whose


law the litigants want to sue?


MR. PECK:  Because -- because, Justice Souter,


here the State courts have -- have -- Congress has


basically done one thing.  They've -- they've looked at


the idea of comity that this Court had talked about in


9

Guaranty Trust, in Ragan, and -- and what they said is


that comity is a reciprocal process.  It's got to have a


two-way street.


And so what we're doing is we're not giving


longer life in Federal court to what's in State court.  We


have the authority to assign to the State courts a matter


that is purely Federal in nature.  Now we have a matter


that has a Federal interest because of the intervention of


its arrival in Federal court, and because of that, we have


enough authority also to say that this is a matter that


the State courts can't refuse.  They can't suddenly say


that we do not recognize the authority here --


QUESTION:  But comity is traditionally a matter


of consent rather than having one sovereign impress its --


its law on the other. 
 I mean, it's consensual. 

MR. PECK:  It is consensual, but then again, the


-- the idea behind comity is tied up with our -- our


federalism and our idea that we have a dual court system. 


That dual court system recognizes that there will be


conflicts.  There will be some -- some difficulties


between the Federal and State systems.  Those difficulties


is what Congress is trying to police. 


It's a -- it's a function that they have


performed repeatedly, and the removal statute is a very


good example of that.  And certainly Congress could insist

-- could insist that the State courts receive back even a


matter that the Federal court erroneously dismissed rather


than remand it.


And here they're not asking the South Carolina


courts to do anything that they don't normally do.  If a


-- a matter is --


QUESTION:  Well, they're asking the South


Carolina courts to grant relief in a case that is outside


the statute of limitations.  I take it they don't -- the


South Carolina courts don't normally do that.


MR. PECK:  South Carolina courts, as -- as we


cited in the -- the Hilton Head and Moriarty decisions,


has said that they will sometimes waive the statute of


limitations in the interest of justice. 


Another instance in which they waive that issue 

is when venue has been misapplied.  When -- when they


demand that venue be placed in one particular place, you


file in that wrong place, the statute of limitations


expires before that court acts on it, they say it has


jurisdiction to transfer it to the proper venue.


QUESTION:  Well, would this case come out


differently in the State?  Supposing Georgia, a


neighboring State, had no such waiver.  Would this case


come out differently there?


MR. PECK:  I don't think so, and the reason I

don't think so is because when all that is left in the


Federal court is a matter that is otherwise a State-based


claim, that Federal court sits as just another court of


that jurisdiction, another court within that State's


system.  And for that reason -- for that reason, it ought


to be treated, when Congress so authorizes -- and


Congress, exercising that Article III, that necessary and


proper powers that it had, utilizing the Supremacy Clause,


authorizes that this be treated essentially by tolling as


meeting the statute of limitations. 


They have the right to define the meaning of


what the Federal law is here, and that is simply what


they've done.  They've done it by adopting a tolling


provision that is not unlike other tolling provisions


throughout the law. 


And here it's clear that they --

they've done something that they have the authority to do.


Tolling comports completely with the federalist


design of the Constitution, enables the court's


consideration of what court is best positioned to


adjudicate.  That is decidedly a jurisdictional decision. 


Here -- and it's -- and it -- it is doing that by allowing


the courts to control their own borders of what is


appropriate to them and what is not.


QUESTION:  I thought the South Carolina Supreme


Court agreed that as far as the Federal courts are

concerned, this is all fine.  So it was necessary to spare


the Federal courts having to sit on a case that no longer


has a Federal element.  That's fine.  It serves a


legitimate Federal purpose. 


But, says South Carolina, you can't -- it isn't


proper to tell us then -- they can dump it.  That's fine. 


They can't tell us that we have to pick it up.


MR. PECK:  That is indeed what they've said. 


But Stewart v. Kahn says otherwise.


QUESTION:  That was a -- that was a Civil War


tolling of the statute of limitations. 


MR. PECK:  That is correct.  It found that


within the war power, Congress had the authority to toll


the statute of limitations in a State action brought in


State court. 


Obviously then there is no Tenth Amendment 

overlay that prevents the use of that war powers


authority. 


Here they have similar authority, both in


Article I, section 8, to establish the inferior courts, as


well as Article III where there's a cognate phrase, and


that authority has to be equivalent.  They've used that


authority also with respect to bankruptcy, again deriving


from section 8. 


And so here again there's no question that these


other tolling provisions have been properly used.  No one

has questioned their constitutionality in recent times,


and this simply adopts a longstanding congressional


approach to this issue.  It's one that this Court has


previously approved.


If -- if the respondent has his way, enormous


mischief will result.  You leave the courts with a


Hobbesian choice, a choice that they have been


uncomfortable with in which you've seen courts granting


motions for reconsideration, courts requiring waivers of a


statute of limitations, so having much the same effect --


and clearly when tolling does that, it is clearly


appropriate to the judicial power -- and in other


instances, simply holding onto a case they would otherwise


allow the State courts to do, again in the interest of the


federalist overlay in our Constitution.


QUESTION:  Well -- well, isn't it -- if --


suppose you should not prevail here.  Well, then you just


bring -- the plaintiff would bring two actions, bring --


bring a protective action in the State court within the


statute of limitations and then that would solve the


problem, wouldn't it?


MR. PECK:  But that -- that's an unworkable


solution.  Congress sought to avoid that.  Congress wanted


to give a Federal forum capable of hearing all matters


that a plaintiff would expect a single court to hear.  And

by filing a protective action of that sort, first of all,


you could not stop the State court from continuing to


proceed, possibly eclipsing in speed the Federal court and


coming up with res judicata on their Federal claim, as


well as the fact that you may be signaling the Federal


court that on the State matter we have a preference to be


in State court when that really isn't the case.


I -- I would -- if there are no further


questions, I would like to reserve the rest of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Peck.


Mr. Lamken, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS INTERVENOR


MR. LAMKEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The tolling provision at issue here is within


Congress' constitutional powers for two reasons. 


First, it establishes the legal effect of a


distinctly Federal set of events:  the filing, pendency,


and dismissal of an action in Federal court over a


defendant over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction.


Second, it serves legitimate Federal interests,


ensuring that if plaintiffs are held harmless for having


selected a Federal forum in the first instance and


ensuring that Federal courts are not required to exercise

jurisdiction and decide cases that involve potentially


sensitive issues of State law that are more reliably and


more appropriately decided in the State court.


Because municipalities are not States or arms of


the States, sovereign immunity does not prevent them from


being hailed into Federal court and it doesn't prevent the


Federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over cases


against them, including supplemental State law claims.


Congress can establish the rules for when


Federal courts should hear such claims and the rules for


when they should not.  Congress has corresponding


authority to establish reasonable rules about the legal


consequences of the pendency of the Federal action, of the


filing of the claim, its pendency, and the court's


decision to dismiss it under specified rules that Congress 

itself has established. 


The rule established here falls within the


tradition of Federal control over the effect of Federal


proceedings.  It falls in the tradition of, for example,


legal effect of the filing of a bankruptcy petition which


stays all the actions that are against the debtor and


tolls the State limitations periods during the pendency of


the automatic stay. 


Or the removal provision which takes cases out


of State courts, stays the proceedings in State courts,

and thus prevents the State courts from proceeding in a


way such as by deeming the case constructively dismissed


that might have the effect of causing the statute of


limitations to continue to run.


And the effect of a Federal -- a judgment of a


Federal court case. 


All these are matters that are controlled by


Federal law, and that Federal law is no less binding on


State courts adjudicating State causes of action,


including against municipalities, than they are on Federal


courts.


The rule in this case serves twin Federal


interests. 


First, it holds plaintiffs harmless for having


selected a forum -- a State -- excuse me -- a Federal 

rather than a State forum in the first instance.  Absent


this sort of rule, plaintiffs would face the risk, if they


chose a Federal forum, of having the statute of


limitations run on their State law claims.  If the Federal


court then chose to dismiss, those State law claims would


be barred.  And plaintiffs would have an artificial


incentive to avoid Federal court, including for the


assertion of their Federal law claims. 


It also serves the interests of Federal courts


in ensuring that they don't have to decide State law

claims that are potentially sensitive, that under the


standards this Court articulated in Gibbs that Congress


has codified in section 1367(c) and it reflects sensible


notions of division between State and Federal authority


more appropriately belong in State court and can be more


reliably adjudicated there.


This Court's decision in Stewart v. Kahn


establishes that there is no constitutional impediment to


congressional preemption of State tolling rules if it


serves a legitimate Federal interest, the tolling 


provision here, like the social -- excuse me -- like the


Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act, the bankruptcy


automatic stay tolling rule, following that tradition.


Finally, the tolling rule here intrudes only


modestly on State interests. 


The timely filing of the 

State claims in Federal court serves all of the statute of


limitations purposes as the claim -- as the timely filing


of those same claims in State court. 


Accordingly, we ask that the judgment of the


State supreme court be reversed.


If there are no further questions. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Lamken.


Mr. Lindemann, we'll hear from you.

 MR. LINDEMANN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


By enacting section 1367(d), Congress has


intruded on principles of State sovereignty.  This case


involves more than just the tolling of a State law statute


of limitations.  It involves, in this particular instance


where a political subdivision is involved and South


Carolina law is involved, specifically the South Carolina


Tort Claims Act -- this case involves a -- a waiver of


State law sovereign immunity, State law governmental


immunity.


QUESTION:  What about examples cited by the


representative of the Solicitor General of the Soldiers'


and Sailors' Civil Relief Act and other Federal laws that


have a similar effect on South Carolina and other States? 

MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, I would submit to the


Court that, first of all, the issue has never come up,


never been litigated in this Court, and as far as I'm


aware, has never been litigated in any court whether or


not the Soldiers' and Sailors' Act in any application is


-- is constitutional. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  So you think, as far as you're


concerned, it would be the same problem and the same


result.


MR. LINDEMANN:  No, I do not necessarily believe

it will be the same result.  I believe it would be a much


more difficult question for this Court than what was


facing the South Carolina Supreme Court and is presently


before this Court.


QUESTION:  Why? 


MR. LINDEMANN:  Because you have different


Federal interests that are involved.  And obviously, in


determining whether or not the -- a statute is proper


under the Necessary and Proper Clause and to do a Tenth


Amendment analysis, you have to look at -- you have to


weigh the various Federal and State interests that are


involved.


In this particular case, which I'll elaborate


more momentarily, you have very superficial, I would


submit, Federal interests involved compared to a very 

substantial State interest of determining whether or not


the State and its political subdivisions are subject to


suit under State law. 


QUESTION:  But is it not -- is it not correct --


is it not correct that the intrusion on State sovereignty


-- forget the Federal side of the balance for a moment --


the intrusion on State sovereignty is precisely the same


under all these other statutes?


MR. LINDEMANN:  I would disagree, Justice


Stevens.

 QUESTION:  Why is the intrusion in the Soldiers'


and Sailors' Civil Relief Act any different than this one?


MR. LINDEMANN:  The Soldiers' and Sailors' Act


-- it would be a very similar intrusion on the -- on the


State sovereignty.


QUESTION:  And how about the bankruptcy statute?


MR. LINDEMANN:  The bankruptcy -- the actual --


any -- any of these statutes that have been cited by the


petitioners and by the Government that actually provide


for a stay of a State court action I think are


substantially different because I would submit to the


Court that a stay of a State court action, whether it's


pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to the removal


statutes, any of -- Anti-Injunction Act, any of those does


not have the same effect upon State sovereignty because 

it's not changing the actual liability of the defendant,


in this particular case, Richland --


QUESTION:  Well, neither does this statute


change the liability.  It just preserves the cause of


action.


statute.


MR. LINDEMANN:  I --


QUESTION:  Just like the Soldiers' and Sailors'


MR. LINDEMANN:  I -- I would respectfully


disagree, Justice Stevens, because what has occurred in

this particular case is Richland County was entitled to


State law sovereign immunity once 2 years passed from the


date of the loss.  And at -- at the point that this


lawsuit was filed in State court --


QUESTION:  Wouldn't it be entitled to sovereign


immunity if a sailor had -- had sued them too?


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, that's why I was trying to


distinguish the stay cases from the Soldiers' and Sailors'


Act.  I think the Soldiers' and Sailors' Act issue is a


much closer question and there what you're weighing is


much more substantial Federal interests. 


QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm just looking at it from


the State's point of view in the point of my questions. 


It did not seem to me that the State interest in it being


immune was any different in any of those situations. 

MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, I would -- I would submit


that there is no difference in the Soldiers' and Sailors'


context, but there would be a major difference in any of


the situations involving a stay.


QUESTION:  Mr. Lindemann, I don't -- I don't see


what difference it makes that the statute of limitations


in this case was applied to -- to what you call State


sovereign immunity.  That is, you -- you acknowledge that


this entity, Richmond -- Richland County, was -- was not


entitled to sovereign immunity as we know it under Federal

law.


MR. LINDEMANN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  But you're saying that the State


wished to confer upon Richland County a shorter statute of


limitations for suit against it than -- than this Federal


statute permits. 


Why is that any -- any different from applying


the same statute against South Carolina's determination


that a private individual should not be suable after 2


years?  What difference does it make whether -- whether


the person being affected by it is a private individual or


Richland County?  So long as it's not the State of South


Carolina, Federal sovereign immunity law is not -- is not


at issue.  What do we care?


MR. LINDEMANN: 


Well this, Your Honor, is not a 

case involving the Eleventh Amendment. 


QUESTION:  Exactly.


MR. LINDEMANN:  This is not a case that is


involving Federal constitutional immunity.


QUESTION:  Exactly.


MR. LINDEMANN:  This is a case that was brought


-- a negligence case that was brought in State court


against a State governmental -- or a local governmental


entity in the State of South Carolina to which South


Carolina law should apply.  And the reason why we contend

that this violates the Tenth Amendment is it intrudes into


the areas of State sovereignty to determine, number one,


what South Carolina law provides; number two, how South


Carolina law determines whether or not their own


governmental entities are subject to suit.


QUESTION:  But, Mr. Lindemann, one of the


curiosities about this case is if the Federal court, once


the Federal claim dropped out, decided that it would clean


-- clean up the operation, it would keep it in Federal


court, there would be a Federal court adjudicating South


Carolina's State law case.  The only regulating rules


would be State rules.  And South Carolina says, that's


okay with us.  They can take our law into the Federal


court and apply it there and -- but we don't want it back. 


In other words, we want to force our cases to be litigated 

into -- in the Federal court.  And that doesn't make a


whole lot of sense.


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, it's not as much that


they're trying to force the Federal court to litigate the


case.  Obviously, the plaintiff chose that forum to start


with.  And Congress has deemed -- has provided for


supplemental jurisdiction.  So obviously Congress has


provided a forum in Federal court for the litigation of


these State law claims.  And so South Carolina has not


said, you can't give it back to us, but what South

Carolina had said is that in the interim, if there's a


dismissal without prejudice of the State law claims in


another court, whether it be the Federal district court or


whether it be in a court of another State, if there's a


dismissal without prejudice under South Carolina law,


that's considered as if the suit had never been brought in


the first place.


QUESTION:  In other words, you're saying it's


all right with us if the Federal court adjudicates this


purely State claim.  The State isn't offended by that, but


it is offended by getting it back even though everyone had


notice in ample time within the -- the county had ample


notice because they received a Federal summons and


complaint.  So there was no question of -- of repose


involved.


But there's one -- another aspect of this, it


seems to me, passing strange.  Are you suggesting that the


removal statute would be vulnerable to a similar attack? 


Because that's really -- if you're talking about State


court, this is wrenching a case out of the State court,


ousting the State court of jurisdiction, putting it into


the Federal court.  I would think if you're right about


sending it back, then you'd certainly object to lifting it


out.


MR. LINDEMANN:  I don't believe the interest

here is that South Carolina has a problem with -- with the


Federal court deciding issues of State law, and I don't


think South Carolina has a problem with deciding those


issues itself.  The problem South Carolina has in this


particular case is with Congress expanding upon State law


that actually set the boundaries as to when and how a


political subdivision can be sued.


QUESTION:  What difference does it make whether


it's a political subdivision or not?  Suppose South


Carolina law said, gas stations shall be immune from suit


except that you can sue them within two years, and then


the same situation occurs.  Would -- would not the Federal


court be intruding upon South Carolina's decision of


immunity just as much?


MR. LINDEMANN: 


South -- yes, the Congress would 

be intruding upon --


QUESTION:  So -- so --


MR. LINDEMANN:  -- the ability of the State of


South Carolina to set a statute of limitations for private


defendants. 


QUESTION:  That's -- and that's all we're


talking about, to set a statute of limitations whether


it's for private defendants or whether it's for Richland


County which, as far as Federal law is concerned, is a


private defendant, or whether it's for gas stations.

 I mean, I -- you -- you try to make something


different of this case by saying what it involves in -- is


Richland County, but what we, the Federal courts, say is


Richland County is not the State of South Carolina.  It is


not a State entity, and as far as we're concerned, it's a


gas station.


MR. LINDEMANN:  But I would submit to the Court


two points in response to that.  It goes beyond because


it's a governmental entity and you look at the application


of State law because again, this is a State law case


brought and adjudicated in a State court.  And you look at


the State law which actually provides a greater defense


for a governmental entity than it does for a private


citizen.


To give the Court an illustration --

QUESTION:  You would have no --


QUESTION:  You give greater defenses for gas


stations.  Would -- would that change the gas station case


simply because you give greater defenses to gas stations?


MR. LINDEMANN:  No, it would not change the


case.


QUESTION:  Of course not.


MR. LINDEMANN:  My point is it -- it actually


makes a stronger case to show the intrusion on State


sovereignty where you have a political subdivision.

 And if I may illustrate.  Prior to 1985, South


Carolina recognized absolute sovereign immunity for its


State entities as well as its political subdivisions.  And


if you looked at -- the question that comes to mind is


whether Congress, prior to 1985, could have enacted a


statute that subjects Richland County, a political


subdivision in the State of South Carolina, to a claim for


negligence in the operation of its local detention center


where South Carolina law itself provides there is no such


claim because of sovereign immunity.


QUESTION:  The answer is, of course, they could


if they had a -- if there is a basis in the Constitution


for the Federal Government to pass a law that changes


State law.  They do it every day of the week.


And so usually what you ask is, is there a basis 

here?  Of course, there is.  They say Article III.


Indeed, was there a problem Congress was trying


to cure?  Indeed, there is.  It was the mess that existed


before the statute.


Is there an infringement of what the State would


like to do?  Of course, there is but the Constitution


gives the power to the Federal Government to do that.


Now -- now, what's -- that -- like, you know,


purely I'd say hornbook.  So what -- what is the -- what


is the special thing about this infringement of the

State's power to do what it would like to do here?


MR. LINDEMANN:  I respectfully disagree with


you, Justice Breyer.  If, prior to 1985, Congress wanted


to create a situation where Richland County would be


liable for the operation of its detention center, it would


have to do so in the context of a Federal cause of action


which obviously existed at that time under section 1983. 


What I'm saying is --


QUESTION:  So Congress in your opinion doesn't


have the power to -- to interfere with State law insofar


as it creates State laws of action?  Congress couldn't


pass tort reform, for example. 


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, I believe tort reform in


certain instances would be permissible.  I -- I believe


that -- and certainly the -- the precedent set by this 

Court supports this -- that Congress has the authority


through preemption and through its properly enacted


statutes to limit the liability in State court actions --


in State law actions, but cannot create liability where


none existed previously.  And I'd submit to the Court that


I'm not aware of any single example where Congress has


stepped in and created a statute that creates a -- a State


law cause of action or expands upon a State law cause of


action to create liability where none existed.


QUESTION:  Except the Soldiers' and Sailors'

Relief Act, for example. 


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, and the Soldiers' and


Sailors' Relief Act, if it is indeed constitutional, is


based upon a different weighing of the Federal interest


versus the State interest.  You obviously in that case


have much greater Federal interest involved than the


simple convenience to litigants to have to be able to be


-- have the ability to file your Federal and State claims


in the same Federal action without concern that your State


action might ultimately be dismissed after the statute of


limitations ran. 


Obviously the Soldiers' and Sailors' Act


involves First Amendment war powers.  It involves issues


of national defense and deployment of armed services


around the country where they're not available to -- where 

they don't have the immediate availability of access to


our court system.  Those are much different rights, much


different Federal interests, and would create a much


different issue.  And how this Court would ultimately


resolve that issue I cannot say, but it would certainly


make a much stronger case for allowing that than the


simple case that is -- or the Federal interests that are


at stake in this particular instance.


The --

there any unconstitutionality in one of the things that


was done?  And the Federal judge will say, yeah, this is


really State business, but I'm not going to subject the


plaintiff to a time bar.  So, defendant, Richland County,


any defendant, would you agree that you will waive the


statute of limitations should I dismiss this case without


prejudice.  The -- the -- the State -- the county


certainly could do that. 


MR. LINDEMANN:  That -- that happened frequently


prior to 1990, and I'm actually aware of -- personally of


instances even since 1990 where that's been the case --


QUESTION:  And how about bringing --


MR. LINDEMANN:  -- and that obviously is the


solution. 


QUESTION: 


A plaintiff brings a protective 

action and says, I really want this 1983 claim to be the


front runner, but if I fail on that, I want to have these


garden variety State -- whatever it is -- assault cases. 


So the plaintiff begins a State -- a case in State court


and the State tort claims, the Federal case, including the


1983 claim.


MR. LINDEMANN:  That's right.


QUESTION:  Then that would be perfectly all


right.


MR. LINDEMANN:  That would be perfectly all

right, and in fact --


QUESTION:  And all that accomplishes is having


two cases instead of one, which is if -- if that can be


avoided, it's -- for the efficiency of the system, it's a


pretty good idea, isn't it?


MR. LINDEMANN:  But realistically looking at the


way 1367(d) operates anyway is you often do have two


separate lawsuits such as what we have in this particular


instance.


QUESTION:  But that's what 1367(d) was meant to


overcome I thought, having two lawsuits going on, just to


have the -- the State court sitting there and nothing


happening in the event that the Federal court should


dismiss the Federal claim and there's a live lawsuit to


pick up.


MR. LINDEMANN:  There are many different


alternatives that courts dealt with this issue prior to


1990.  And in fact, I'd submit that there's certainly no


authority to support any finding or any conclusion that


litigants' due process rights were violated before 1367(d)


was enacted.


QUESTION:  No.  It wasn't necessary to


litigants.  It's just that your solution to the problem


permits the two parties who want to try their case in


Federal court to confer a jurisdiction on the Federal

court that the district judge believes it doesn't have and


doesn't want.


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, and -- and that is true.


QUESTION:  So from a point of view of protecting


the State, I guess Congress dived into this mess.  I -- I


wrote an opinion.  You might -- to recall it to mind, it


happened to involve a plagiarism.  Did you read -- I had a


1st Circuit case.  It involved plagiarism of an Icelandic


poet called Franjen Gendulik. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. LINDEMANN:  I'm not aware of that --


QUESTION:  And in that -- you're not aware of


that.  Well, if you don't -- that doesn't call it to


mind --


Nogot.


QUESTION: 


It was made into a movie, wasn't it? 

(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  But the poem was Suze Sine Razmut


In any case, the -- the point was at the end of


that it seemed like a terrible mess.  There seemed like


five solutions.  Each of them had something to be said for


it, and so Congress went in to legislate in order to deal


with this procedural mess. 


Now -- now, why isn't that a legitimate interest


just as legitimate as the interest in protecting soldiers

and sailors, the interest that underlies lots of other


Federal legislation? 


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, I would submit to Your


Honor that that is certainly not a very substantial


Federal interest to the extent it is a Federal interest. 


QUESTION:  To deal with a problem of unfairness


to States, unfairness to litigants, try to have a uniform


rule?


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, I don't believe it -- it


creates unfairness necessary to litigants, and there are


obviously solutions around it -- and was dealt with by --


many courts dealt with this particular issue prior to


1990.  And I would submit that when you balance that


Federal interest with the State interests that are


involved here and -- which is obviously what -- what's the 

analysis under the Tenth Amendment, that the result should


be that the State interests involved to be able to control


State law and State law claims, to be able to control when


and how State -- States and their political subdivisions


are subject to suit under State law, that those interests


far outweigh the Federal interest.  Obviously it is a


balancing problem.


QUESTION:  Isn't -- isn't one of the questions


who should do the balancing?  Should we do it or should


Congress do it?

QUESTION:  And the branch of the Federal


Government that makes this kind of policy decision.


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, there -- there's clearly


no -- no legislative history that suggests that Congress


made that particular balancing.  In fact, there's nothing


in the legislative history --


QUESTION:  No, but I assume the State of South


Carolina was represented in Congress at the time they made


that decision and could be -- could raise all these


objections in that forum.


MR. LINDEMANN: 


Well, I would submit to the 

Court that just as this Court ruled in the Raygor case


last term in the Tenth Amendment context, just like in the


Eleventh Amendment context --


QUESTION:  The Eleventh Amendment was really


implicated there.


MR. LINDEMANN:  -- you have to look at whether


or not there's a clear statement that Congress intended to


affect Federal-State relations such as it did.


QUESTION:  No, but I think the clear statement


rule is limited to States, and of course, counties are not

considered the same as States.


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, I would -- I would submit


to the Court that if -- if Your Honor is suggesting that


only comes into play in Eleventh Amendment cases, that --


that -- I would disagree with that because Gregory versus


Ashcroft was a Tenth Amendment case and this Court ruled


based upon the clear statement rule.


Now, whether or not a party has standing to


assert --


QUESTION:  Was that -- was that a -- an


immunity --


QUESTION:  That was State officials.


QUESTION:  -- official -- an officer immunity


case?


MR. LINDEMANN:  That was a case. 


It was a -- a 

ADEA case, Your Honor, looking at the qualifications of


State judges in the State of Missouri.


QUESTION:  But the difference is that the State


is not amenable to suit in Federal court.  The


municipality is just like any other corporation.  So --


MR. LINDEMANN:  I don't disagree with that. 


That's why we are not pursuing this matter under the


Eleventh Amendment.  However, a municipality has standing


to assert a challenge under the Tenth Amendment, and this


Court in the Printz case, Printz v. United States, was

actually --


QUESTION:  It's not a kind of jurisdictional


challenge.  I mean, the State -- if the State were sued in


Federal court and there was a pending claim, the State


would say you -- we don't fit under 1367(a), and the State


not there at all.  But here this claim is properly brought


in Federal court against the city.  Is that right?


MR. LINDEMANN:  That -- that's correct, Your


Honor. 


QUESTION:  So it seems to me there's a very


large difference in that respect.


MR. LINDEMANN:  We -- we are certainly not


arguing that 1367(d) is unconstitutional as applied to --


I mean, (a) is unconstitutional as applied to Richland


County. 


What we're arguing is that the expansion of the 

State law statute of limitations and the limited waiver of


sovereign immunity under State law is what, as applied in


this particular case, violates the Tenth Amendment. 


QUESTION:  I can see in the abstract what your


argument is, but in the concrete, let's take the removal


case.  So there's a case lodged in State court.  It's


lifted up, put into Federal court, and then more than 2


years later, it gets remanded.  Practically what's the


difference in terms of South Carolina and its concern with


stale claims between those two cases?

 MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, Your Honor, obviously a


removal situation is substantially different in that


jurisdiction was first lodged in the State court, and as a


result, any type of waiver issue or any type of statute of


limitations issue would be resolved by the fact that there


was a initial filing of the State court claim in State


court.


QUESTION:  But functionally I don't see any


significant difference if the concern is we don't want


stale claims.  We don't want to adjudicate claims that


have been hanging around more than two years.  In my case,


yes, you touched base in Federal -- in State court.  What


you got was what you got in Federal court, that is, notice


that the plaintiff is suing arising out of this particular


episode. 


I don't see practically any difference if the 

State's -- the State is trying to protect its concern for


adjudicating stale claims.  The claim is still stale when


it comes back from the Federal court.


MR. LINDEMANN:  It's not so -- as Your Honor


pointed out earlier, it's not solely an issue of repose


because here because the respondent, the defendant in the


-- in the underlying case is a governmental entity, there


is a aspect of State sovereign immunity that comes into


play that doesn't come into play in -- in the other


instances.  And so you have the added interest of

preserving the right of the State in order to determine


whether it's going to waive its sovereign immunity, which


of course didn't happen until 1985, and when it does waive


sovereign immunity, the extent to which it's going to


waive it.  And again, I'm referring to State law sovereign


immunity, not Federal constitutional immunity under the


Eleventh Amendment or otherwise.  So what --


QUESTION:  I understand that.  I just don't


understand why you think we should -- we should care.


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well --


QUESTION:  If you're not talking about Federal


sovereign immunity of the State, why should we care if --


if the State chooses to create some other kind of


sovereign immunity that -- that isn't the kind that we're


concerned about?


MR. LINDEMANN:  Because it goes, Your Honor, to


the heart of exactly what the -- the State sovereignty,


the interests of State sovereignty that's involved in this


case. 


QUESTION:  No, it doesn't.  No, it doesn't.  The


-- the essence of State sovereignty is everything covered


by Federal State sovereign immunity which is States and


agencies of States.  Everything else is not central to


State sovereignty, whether -- whether they choose to make


Richland County a -- you know, give them some State

sovereignty protection or -- or choose to make a gas


station that way.


I don't -- I just don't understand why you


expect this to impress us, that the State has gone beyond


Federal State sovereign immunity and created some new


element of State sovereign immunity.  I mean, they're --


they're free to do that, but I don't see how it invokes


any new doctrine under either the Eleventh Amendment or


the Tenth Amendment or any other provision of Federal law.


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, I'm not submitting that it


creates any type of new doctrine, Your Honor.  What I'm


suggesting is that it's an aspect of State sovereignty for


a State court -- I mean, for a State legislature to


determine what the law is in that State that is applicable


purely to State law claims litigated in a State court. 

QUESTION:  Okay.  Why isn't the answer then


necessarily the same whether we have a private litigant or


whether we have a -- a political subdivision?  They said


for the private litigants, two year statute of


limitations.  Why isn't your answer exactly the same?  The


State was exercising the State's -- the same sovereign


power in each case.


MR. LINDEMANN:  Well, I believe it would also


apply to a private litigant, and I didn't try to convey to


the Court --

 QUESTION:  Okay.  I -- I hadn't understood that


was your position. 


MR. LINDEMANN:  What I'm trying to suggest to


the Court is because you have this added element of State


law sovereign immunity, which is created by a State


constitution, it makes it even a more compelling Tenth


Amendment --


QUESTION:  But you don't -- you don't need it. 


You don't need it.  The private litigant doesn't have any


sovereign immunity rights under State law, but the private


litigant would be able to insist on the two-year statute


just the way the county is insisting on it here.


MR. LINDEMANN:  I believe that would be the


case.  Now, that's not the issue, obviously, before this


Court and that's not decided by the South Carolina Supreme 

Court.  The South Carolina Supreme Court decided this case


in a very limited fashion and found that 1367(d) as


applied to political subdivisions in South Carolina, given


the South Carolina Tort Claims Act and the history of


sovereign immunity -- State law sovereign immunity in that 


State, that as a result, as applied to Richland County,


it's unconstitutional. 


QUESTION:  Suppose a judge should say -- the


Federal judge -- knowing South Carolina's position on this


question, I'll keep the case, which is now an entirely

State case, and I know that in diversity cases I'm


supposed to apply the State statute of limitations.  So if


the Federal judge keeps this case in deference to South


Carolina's position that it doesn't want it, it's too


late, and the Federal court in a diversity case must apply


the State statute of limitations, when -- when does that


limitation begin, when South Carolina said it would if the


case were reinstituted there?


MR. LINDEMANN:  No, Your Honor.  I would -- I


would submit that the statute of limitations started to --


or ran from obviously the date of loss through -- through


for the two-year period, and if the case was filed in


Federal court within that two-year period, the statute of


limitations, as well as the -- the argument that sovereign


immunity applies, would not be applicable to that case. 

But what occurred in this case is there was a


dismissal without prejudice of the State law claims. 


Under South Carolina law, a dismissal with prejudice is


treated as if the suit was never brought in the first


place.  And as a result, when the case was refiled in the


State court, it was refiled beyond the two years, at which


point the statute of limitations had run and at which


point Richland County was also entitled to absolute


immunity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.


And I would again submit to the Court that the

reason why we believe that this is a significant issue


under the Tenth Amendment for this case and why the


Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence of this Court does not


govern is -- is because of the importance of the State law


interest.  And the key to this whole argument is the point


that this is not a Federal claim litigated in Federal


court.  In fact, the cases that have been cited by the


petitioner in their briefs, the Burnett case, the Order of


Railroad Engineers case, all of those cases are


distinguishable because those are Federal causes of action


that are litigated in Federal court.


This is a State law claim that's litigated in


State court under purely State law, and we would submit


that the South Carolina General Assembly should decide


what is the applicable South Carolina law and that 

Congress does not have the power under Article III and the


Necessary and Proper Clause to override that statement of


State law and to create liability where no liability


previously existed.  And that is the key point.


Congress has the authority through a validly


enacted statute and through use of the Supremacy Clause to


limit liability in State actions by providing for


preemption, ERISA being an example, but there is no


example that I'm aware of where Congress has created


liability where none previously existed.
