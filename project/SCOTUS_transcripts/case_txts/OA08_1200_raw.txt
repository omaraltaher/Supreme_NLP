 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-1200, Jerman v. Carlisle, 
McNellie, Rini, Kramer, & Ulrich.

 Mr. Russell.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RUSSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Congress rarely makes ignorance of the law a 
defense to civil liability, and the Fair Debt Collection 
Practices Act is no exception to that rule.  While it 
may seem unfair to hold defendants in some sense 
strictly liable for legal mistakes in the civil context, 
the accumulated wisdoms of generations of legal practice 
has been that attempting to fix that unfairness through 
a mistake of law defense causes more harm than it 
prevents.

 And as a consequence, in light of that 

subtle understanding, courts should not read a Federal 
statute to establish a mistake of law defense, unless 
Congress quite plainly makes that intent to do so clear. 
And in this case, nothing in the text, structure, or the 
history of the bona fide error provision of the FDCPA

indicates such an intent.

 I could begin with the -- the text of the 
statute.  It is not enough under the bona fide error 
provision that the defendant's violation be in good 
faith, that it have been bona fide.

 There is an additional element, that the 

defendant has to show that the violation was not 
intentional.  And in common legal discourse, a violation 
is not rendered unintentional simply because the 
defendant misunderstood the legal consequences of its 
actions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think -- reading 

"intentional" the way you just articulated is absolutely 
right, but when you add -- I don't see what work "bona 
fide error" does in the statute, if "intentional" should 
be read in this case to mean what you say.

 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I think it captures the 
circumstance in which somebody makes a mistake of fact, 
but does so and with -- not in good faith.  I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you say:  Well, 

intentional means you meant to send out the document; 
you meant to serve it; in other words, no specific 
intent requirement.  But if -- a bona fide error, it 
seems, doesn't make the activity not intentional under 
the traditional understanding of intentional.

MR. RUSSELL:  But I think that's right.  I 
think both provisions do separate work, and so that if 
all it took to show that something wasn't intentional is 
that you didn't mean to violate the law, it would be 
very difficult to understand what work "bona fide" was 
doing in that circumstance.

 And I think Congress included the bona fide 

requirement in order to capture instances in which 
people make factual mistakes, but not in good faith.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I really don't think that 
the -- the word that we're wrestling with here is the --
the word "intentional."  It seems to me it's the word 
"violation," because violation -- when it says the 
violation was intentional or unintentional, does 
"violation" mean the act that constitutes a violation of 
the law, or does "violation" mean the -- the fact of 
violating the law?

 MR. RUSSELL:  I think that is the central 
question here and it is Respondents' best argument.  I 
think that the word "violation" is best understood to 
refer to the act.  That is how this Court has construed 
that word in the statutory phrase "knowing violation" in 
a number of cases, and that's how the courts of appeals 
have construed the term "intentional" -- or "intentional 
violation" in the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural

Workers Protection Act, which we cited in our brief.

 I did mention in our brief that it is a less 

usual formulation, "intentional violation," and at the 
time we wrote our briefs we weren't able to find any 
cases from this Court construing that particular term.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So what -- the part that's 

worrying me most is where the lawyer is the debt 
collector.  All right?  So he's within the act, and he 
has a client of debt collectors, and the clients all 
say:  Please go collect the debt.  And they say:  We 
want to do this, like in this -- suppose in this case, 
they say:  Tell us if you don't owe it; ask them to 
write a letter to that effect; we won't collect it; now, 
is that legal?

 And the lawyer looks up everything in sight 

and says, yes, it's legal.  And then that's what he 
thinks.  All the circuits have said this.  And then he 
asks the FTC and they say, yes, it's legal.  So there he 
is.  Everybody's told him it's legal.  And lo and 
behold, this Court, surprisingly, holds the opposite. 
Well, he shouldn't be liable.  And if he has to worry 
about that, he can never defend his client.  The only 
answer is:  Whatever the man says who is opposed to your 
client, that's what you have to do.  That can't be the 
meaning of this statute.

MR. RUSSELL:  Well, let me address the 

hypothetical, to make sure I understand it.  If we're 
talking -- well, first of all, if we are talking about a 
case in which they've asked the opinion of the FTC, they 
are entitled to the safe harbor defense, because 
Congress specifically --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  What the FTC said 

is:  We won't give you one.

 MR. RUSSELL:  Okay.  Well, in that 

circumstance, I think it's important to distinguish 
between lawyers who are simply giving advice to debt 
collector clients -- they're not covered by the act. 
It's only when the lawyer engages in debt collection 
activities himself.  And a lot of the time the debt --
the lawyer is simply --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does litigation constitute 

debt -- debt collection activity?

 MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.  This Court held in 

Heintz that litigation can be a form of --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So he is a lawyer 

litigating for a client.  That was my hypothetical.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
 MR. RUSSELL:  In that circumstance -- in 

that circumstance, I think yes, the lawyer can be held

liable for -- for mistakes.  But to the extent this 
Court --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not a mistake.  The 
point is, in a sense, that any decent lawyer would say 
that's what the law was; that sometimes lawyers get 
surprised because courts don't always act the way they 
think is reasonable.

 MR. RUSSELL:  And when that happens, their 
clients are almost never protected from liability,  for 
-- because they did what their lawyers reasonably told 
them to.  And the antitrust --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why aren't they in good 

faith?

 MR. RUSSELL:  The lawyer?
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Both.
 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, certainly, because there 

generally is a mistake of law defense.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah, but that's in your view 
of it.  I am saying that the opposite view of it is that 
your view of it puts lawyers in an impossible position, 
let alone the client.

 MR. RUSSELL:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It -- it's not just that 
it's unfair.  It's worse than unfair.  The lawyer is 
under an obligation to represent his client, and he

cannot do anything but tell the client:  Just pay money 
to this particular plaintiff whose view of the law is 
totally contrary to every circuit court that's ever 
decided it.  Now, how can you put lawyers in that 
position?

 MR. RUSSELL:  I think the lawyers are not in 
a terribly different position than is, for example, the 
executive of a company that has a fiduciary duty to its 
shareholders to maximize profits and is considering a 
venture that could violate the antitrust laws.  And in 
that circumstance, they have to make a calculated 
judgment, because the antitrust laws don't have a 
mistake of law defense.  And neither does any other 
civil --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you are sort of 
begging the question there.  I mean, the antitrust laws 
also don't have a bona fide error defense, and the 
question is whether that includes a legal mistake 
defense.

 MR. RUSSELL:  That's right.  And my -- my 

point simply is that you shouldn't read that defense as 
necessarily creating a mistake of law defense simply 
because you think it's so unfair, because that 
unfairness is simply common.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But it -- but it suggests

that you would like a -- a sensible interpretation of 
this that avoids the result I said, if possible.  And 
there is a different way of going about it, which is you 
could say that a bona fide error in respect to a lawyer 
imposes much higher standards on that lawyer than it 
does on most -- and it's simply a client -- that before 
you can call an error bona fide, that lawyer really has 
to look into it.  He has to have asked the FTC.  He has 
to have gotten -- and made an effort to get a letter 
back.  And if there are one or two circuits that hold 
the other way, well, where?  And if you don't, you are 
not bona fide.

 Now, that would get to virtually the same 

place but it would protect the lawyer against true legal 
surprise.

 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I do think that if you 

disagree with us, that's the better reading than the 
second.  That's not the reading most courts have given. 
It's not the reading that the Sixth Circuit gave in this 
case.

 But I think there is every reason to think 

that if Congress was concerned about the especially 
problematic application of this statute to lawyer 
conduct and particularly to litigation conduct, it would 
have expected courts to deal with that in different way,

and not through the bona fide error defense, which, 
after all, applies to lawyer who are engaging in the 
same conduct as lay debt collectors and to nonlawyers 
alike.  It's a very blunt instrument for dealing with 
this problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One -- one of the 

things you have to include on this initial communication 
is the name of the creditor, right?

 MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So let's say 

the bank that is the creditor is being sold or taken 
over.  And, you know, you have heard that, well, they 
have merged, but, you know, the closing date of the 
merger is two months later or whatever.  It's just not 
clear what the name of the creditor is.  So you -- you 
are not a lawyer, but you are trying to collect the 
debt, and you go -- you fill in, I -- it's either A or 
B, and you say:  I think it's A, and you fill it in and 
it turns out that it's -- it's B.  Let's say that's a 
bona fide error.  Okay?

 But if you are sitting there as the debt 
collector and you say:  I don't know if it's A or B. 
And you say:  I know; I'll call the lawyer.  You call 
the lawyer and the lawyer says:  Oh, it's -- it's B -- I 
mean, it's -- it's A.  And you put down A and it turns

out it's wrong, aren't -- you are in a worse position if 
you ask the lawyer than if you didn't, right?

 MR. RUSSELL:  No, because in either 

circumstance it would be a factual error.  It would be 
subject to the bona fide error defense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, it's a -- it's a 

legal -- the lawyer looks at it and says:  Well, you 
know, the merger is not going to close for whatever, but 
I think it's still this bank.  And it turns out his 
legal analysis of who the creditor is was wrong.

 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, again, I'm not sure that 

that's a legal -- but assuming that it is a legal 
mistake --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
 MR. RUSSELL:  -- I think that the client is 

not -- I mean, if it's a legal mistake, it's a legal 
mistake for the client as well as the lawyer, and I 
think either one of them would be in the same position.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if the client 
just says:  I'm not going to ask the lawyer; I'm just 
going to make -- I think it's A -- it's a bona fide 
error, but it's an error -- he gets the benefit of that 
position.  But if he asks the lawyer, he doesn't get the 
benefit.

 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, under our view, he

wouldn't get benefit under either circumstance, because 
it would be a mistake of law and the statute doesn't 
cover it.

 If I could finish my answer --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Who the -- who the 

creditor is is necessarily a mistake of law, rather than 
fact?

 MR. RUSSELL:  No.  That's why I -- I 

initially told you I thought it was a mistake of fact, 
and that would be a mistake of fact for the lawyer or 
the client.  And I think actually, in that scenario --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, is it a 

mistake of fact if the lawyer does legal research to 
find it out?

 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I don't think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He looks and he 

says:  Well, it depends upon the date of the closing of 
the merger, not the announcement.

 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, if the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And it turns out 

that's a legal mistake.

 MR. RUSSELL:  Then I -- I don't think the 

defense would apply and I don't think it would apply to 
the client, either.

 But I do think that if you are especially

concerned about applying the law to lawyers and to 
litigation, it's much more likely that Congress intended 
the Court to deal with that in a tailored way by 
interpreting the substantive provisions of the statute 
with that particular problem in mind.

 Knowing that Congress didn't have litigation 

conduct specifically in mind when it enacted this 
statute, because at the time lawyers were excluded from 
the act altogether, and keeping in mind in addition that 
Congress presumably didn't intend the act to 
unreasonably interfere with litigation collection 
methods, and the constitutional aspects --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So how -- how do we do 

that?  Because you see, you are quite right.  The client 
runs the same risk in antitrust law in a whole other lot 
of areas.  Absolutely right.  But once you bring the 
lawyer into it, the lawyer has what he doesn't have in 
an antitrust case under your reading, which is an 
incentive to distort the law in order to protect his own 
pocketbook.  And that is, to me, a big problem.

 So you say there is -- there is a -- a way 

around that.  And what?

 MR. RUSSELL:  And that is to recognize that, 

as this Court held in Heintz, that Congress didn't 
intend for every unsuccessful lawsuit to result in

liability under this statute.  Plaintiffs have to point 
to some particular provision of the statute that was 
violated by what the lawyer did in litigation.

 And for example, the lawyer makes a mistake 
about the statute of limitations.  Some courts have held 
that that constitutes a violation of the provisions 
against deceptive practices or unconscionable collection 
practices --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The lawyer writes a letter 
to the client.  The first thing the lawyer tries to do 
is to settle the case.  "Dear Client:  Please send me 
the money, and by the way, if you don't owe it, tell me 
in writing."

 Okay?  That's what the lawyer does.  That's 
a legal activity.  It's at the heart of practicing law, 
because nobody goes to court anymore.  And -- though he 
will, if necessary, so he's part of this.

 Now, how do we get out of this problem that 
I'm putting?  I'm really looking for an answer to that, 
because I think it's a big problem.

 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, typically -- I don't 

know that that's a uniquely lawyerly activity.  Lay debt 
collectors do that all the time.

 But to the extent you think that Congress 

could not have intended that kind of activity to be

subject to liability when somebody makes a reasonable 
legal error, I think it's more likely that Congress 
intended you to look at what provision of the statute 
are they saying was violated and construe that provision 
in a way that is consistent with your expectations about 
what Congress would have meant, rather than providing --
rather than, you know, taking the bona fide error 
provision to do that work, when the bona fide error 
provision is much broader and would apply to all kinds 
of mistakes of law, including having this consequence of 
basically giving debt collectors the opportunity to take 
the narrowest possible construction of -- of consumers' 
rights, as long as the -- the question is unsettled.
 The other reason to think that Congress 

wouldn't have intended this to be the solution to that 
problem is that at the time they wrote the bona fide 
error defense, lawyers weren't included, so this could 
not have been Congress' intended solution to that 
particular problem.

 And at the time Congress used this language, 
it was borrowing it from the Truth in Lending Act, where 
it had an established meaning in the circuit courts as 
not including the mistake of law defense, and that 
remained the interpretation of the Fair Debt Collection 
Practices Act provision as well, for -- for nearly

25 years.

 It wasn't until 2002 that the court of 

appeals first suggested that it did not extend to legal 
mistakes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, if the district 

court were to say:  You violated the act; this was a 
mistake of law not covered, but I'm not awarding 
statutory damages because --

MR. RUSSELL:  I think they --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- in this case, just 

for the reasons here, you did something the Sixth 
Circuit -- or that the circuit law said was permissible, 
so you didn't do it -- you did it intentionally because 
you did the violation of the act, but it was based on a 
mistake of law.

 MR. RUSSELL:  I do think that that's a 

perfectly permissible exercise of discretion.  Congress 
gave the district court discretion with respect to 
statutory damages, and that's another way of dealing 
with this problem.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what about 

attorneys' fees?

 MR. RUSSELL:  No, the attorneys' fees is not 

discretionary in that sense.

 And so there are other structural reasons,

though, to think that Congress knew how to make a 
mistake of law defense clearly and did not do so here.
 Congress did provide, in effect, a mistake 
of law defense to civil penalties.  The civil penalties 
provision that applies to this statute, which is at 
15 U.S.C. 45(m)(1), and that's quoted in relevant part 
on page 24 of the blue brief, provides for very serious 
civil penalties for somebody who acts with actual 
knowledge or knowledge fairly implied that the act was 
prohibited.

 And I think that provision shows two things. 

One, it shows that Congress knows how to make an 
express -- how to expressly speak to a defendant's 
knowledge of the unlawfulness of his conduct.

 And in addition, it shows that Congress 
treated knowledge of unlawfulness as an aggravating 
circumstance, as something deserving of special 
punishment, rather than, as Respondents would have it, 
most of the time being a minimum prerequisite for any 
liability at all.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Congress wrote this 

statute to -- to have a cottage industry of litigation. 
These were attorneys --

MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I -- I would not say 

that.  I would say that Congress wrote this statute, in

a way, to encourage private enforcement, to be sure.  It 
enacted statutory damages and fee shifting because it 
understood that this was an industry in which there was 
a particular risk of very aggressive and harmful 
practices, in part because debt collectors don't rely on 
the good will of the consumers they deal with in order 
to prosper.  And so all of the economic incentives in 
the industry push people to aggressive practices, and 
Congress wanted this statute to be a counterweight to 
that.

 And as in many circumstances, Congress 

enacts statutory language and puts up requirements and 
holds people to them civilly because the -- the general 
rule in our legal system is that the risk and the cost 
of a legal mistake is generally allocated to the 
lawbreaker in the civil context and not to the people's 
whose rights have been violated.  And there is no reason 
to think that Congress was acting particularly 
differently here.

 We were speaking earlier on about the words 

"intentional violation," and I wanted to bring to the 
Court's attention the fact that after we filed our 
brief, and in fact, last night, we -- we did find a case 
in which this Court construed that term, and we notified 
Respondents' counsel and the United States.  And I just

want to give you the cite so you can look at it.  It's 
Ellis v. United States, 206 U.S. 246.  The relevant 
passage is at page 257.  It's a 1907 opinion from 
Justice Holmes.

 And it's consistent with the way that the 

Court has construed the phrase "knowing violation" in a 
number of contexts, including in -- in the criminal 
context, where it's much more common for Congress to 
make a mistake of law a defense to liability.

 I mentioned before that that kind of history 

of the development of the statute -- I think it's also 
worth noting, Justice Breyer, that at the time, Congress 
withdrew the attorney exemption from the act.  It was 
the uniform opinion of the courts of appeals at that 
time and all the district courts that the language of 
the bona fide error defense did not create a mistake of 
law defense.  And again, Congress had no reason to 
expect that in subjecting the attorneys to that 
statutory regime, that the bona fide error provision 
would be the solution to any special problems.

 And Congress has also shown itself to be 

attentive to this special area of concern.  In 2006, it 
made a tailored adjustment to the statute to make clear 
that pleadings are not an initial communication 
triggering the validation notice requirement.  And I

think that demonstrates that Congress is -- is on top of 
this issue, and it stands at the ready to make 
adjustments that are necessary to make this legal system 
operate in a way that both makes sense, but nonetheless 
gives effect to their intent to treat attorney debt 
collectors on a par with regular debt collectors who are 
not attorneys.

 I should also mention, Justice Breyer, to 
the extent there are some really intractable problems 
with respect to the act application to attorneys, 
there -- there is ongoing litigation in the lower courts 
about the Noerr-Pennington doctrine about how the 
constitutional implications of regulating in-court 
activity apply to the Court's interpretation of the 
statutory provisions.

 And again, I think it's more likely that 
that is the solution Congress would have intended, an 
interpretive solution --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, maybe your colleague 
can, but how -- so they define a -- the reasonable error 
falls in is because he's a person who regularly collects 
or attempts to collect consumer debts owed to a -- you 
know, owed to another person.  That's pretty broad. 
That doesn't come about until '86.  You are saying the 
bona fide language there is before, in '77?

MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.  And at the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  But then what --
how -- but I still can't figure out how we get this 
thing to work here, and -- and you just came up with a 
new idea.

 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, no.  It's -- again, it's 
the same idea, that you construe the provisions in a way 
that avoid the most troublesome applications of it to 
attorney conduct.  So I was giving the example of state 
statutes of limitations.  I think it's very open to 
dispute whether attempting to collect a debt on which 
the limitations period has run constitutes an unfair or 
deceptive practice, because there's not a -- all it does 
is gives the -- the debtor the opportunity to raise an 
affirmative defense.

 And I think -- you know, in that 

circumstance, Congress would not have intended the 
statute to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- I get -- okay.

MR. JAY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like, if I may, to pick up with a 

point that Mr. Russell made, which is that the FDCPA is 
of a piece with most civil regulatory statutes, in that 
it makes knowledge of the law an aggravating factor and 
subjects violators who know that they are violating a 
law subject to substantial civil penalties of up to 
$16,000 per day.  But it doesn't completely excuse 
violations based on a lack of knowledge of the law.  In 
order to be excused, the violation must have resulted 
from a bona fide error and meet all three elements of 
the bona fide error defense.

 We think that two of those elements are not 

satisfied by the Respondents' error in this case.

 First, legal errors, for the reason Mr. 

Russell explained, aren't unintentional.  Justice Scalia 
asked about whether the phrase "the violation is not 
intentional" is a signal in that respect.  We think that 
the work that that phrase, "the violation was not 
intentional," does in this circumstance is to show that 
the portion of the debt collector's conduct that 
triggers the violation of the statute, it was -- is what 
must be unintentional.

 Let me illustrate that with an example.

Under the statute, a debt collector who places a call to 
a debtor at home after 9:00 at night may well violate 
the statute; likely does violate the statute.  So what 
must be unintentional for that debt collector to make 
out the bona fide error defense is not that the 
telephone call had been -- had been placed 
unintentionally, but rather that the debt collector 
didn't have knowledge, for example, because of an error 
about what time zone the debtor lives in.

 The -- the debt collector didn't know that 
the call was being placed after 9:00 at night.  That is 
an unintentional error, and it is excused under the 
statute if the debt collector can also show that it 
maintains procedures reasonably adapted to prevent any 
such errors.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And your example of that 

couldn't happen, because if you were calling debtors, 
you should certainly check what time of evening the call 
is.  So you get over the first problem, but then on the 
second problem, the second -- how could that possibly be 
careful procedure, if you don't even check to see what 
time zone the person is in?

 MR. JAY:  Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, 
if -- if you check, but due to a keyboarding error, for 
example, Arizona is entered as Alabama or an error in

time zone is entered in whatever record is being 
consulting by the debt collector, that's the kind of 
factual error, a clerical, bookkeeping type error 
that -- that Congress had in mind when it created this 
defense.  And it bears repeating that Congress has 
created this -- this defense in identical terms in a 
number of other statutes; federal agencies have 
construed the identical language in a number of other 
statutes.  And never has Congress or a federal agency 
contemplated that one of these defenses would, in fact, 
encompass legal errors.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you know why when 

Congress codified that law errors don't count, codified 
that for the Truth in Lending Act purposes, it didn't 
make the corresponding change in the others?

 MR. JAY:  We don't have a specific 

indication, Justice Ginsburg, why it didn't go back and 
revise every other statute that -- that already had such 
a defense.  But I think that the answer is simply that 
Congress was revising the Truth in Lending Act in a 
statute called the Truth in Lending Simplification Act, 
and the -- the statute in which that was passed didn't 
make any other -- any other changes to non-financial 
statutes.  It didn't reopen the Federal -- Fair Debt 
Collection Practice Act in any other way.  In fact, the

relevant portion of the FDCPA, Section 1692k, hasn't 
been amended in any way since Congress first enacted it 
in 1977.

 So we think that the relevance of the 1980 

amendment to TILA is simply this:  It's part of a 
consistent pattern by Congress and by the agencies such 
as the Department of Housing and Urban Development and 
the Federal Reserve Board that interpret statutes with 
identical or very similar bona fide error provisions to 
say:  Errors of law are not what Congress or the agency 
had in mind.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Even if the -- even if the 

error of law is completely reasonable?  Let's say in 
this case the Sixth Circuit had a case directly on 
point.  Still, it was just too bad.

 MR. JAY:  Well, I think, Justice Alito, 

that that is not uncommon under any civil statute, that 
when a court of appeals has precedent on point, that 
there is always a possibility that that precedent will 
be reversed.

 Now, of course, this statute has a very 

short statute of limitations.  It's one year.  And if 
there's some possibility that the law will change down 
the road, that short statute of limitations will prevent 
most violations from being reconsidered down the road

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It also makes it hard to 
use the safe harbor to get the -- to get advice from the 
FTC.

 MR. JAY:  I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.  You 

are saying that the statute of limitations makes it 
difficult?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That -- that if you 

have -- you can -- you are home free if you ask the FTC, 
right?

 MR. JAY:  That's correct.

only way you -- under your reading that you are home

 MR. JAY:  If you ask and they answer and 
they say that your view of the statute is the correct 
one.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How many times have 

they answered in the past decade?

 MR. JAY:  In the past decade, 

Mr. Chief Justice, they have been asked seven times for 
opinions by the debt collection industry, and they have 
answered four of them under the criteria that they 
adopted in the regulations they are cited in footnote 10

of our brief.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that's not a very 

realistic procedure to rely on, is it?

 MR. JAY:  Well, the debt collection industry 

seems to not have asked very many times, Mr. Chief 
Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And why is that? 
Because it's a little difficult dealing with the FTC 
bureaucracy and getting an answer from them in a 
reasonable time?

 MR. JAY:  I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that 

first, even if this were relevant to what Congress 
intended the -- how Congress intended the adviser 
opinion process to work when it wrote this provision in 
1977, that the debt collection industry, as we pointed 
out in our brief -- if you ask the FTC for an adviser 
opinion, and it sides against the requester, which, 
incidentally, in none of these four opinions has it ever 
done -- in each case it sided with the requester -- but 
if it sides against, then the requester is on notice of 
the law.  And the requester is going to be -- as I 
mentioned at the outset, the requester is going to be in 
the category of -- for heightened penalties, because it 
will be very difficult to suggest that you don't know 
the law.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you are saying 
that the debt collection industry doesn't does ask the 
FTC, which would be a safe harbor for them, because if 
they get a bad answer, they may not follow it and then 
they may be subject to heightened penalties?

 MR. JAY:  Well, I'm saying, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that the -- that they would 
understandably prefer to ask their own lawyer for an 
opinion if the -- if this Court were to agree with the 
Respondent's position and affirm the Sixth Circuit. 
They would be able to ask their own lawyer, get a 
private opinion, and if the opinion is favorable, then 
they are home free under the bona fide error defense.

 If -- if it's an -- if it's adverse advice, 
they may need -- even if they disregard the advice, they 
may never need to disclose the opinion at all, whereas 
the FTC advisory opinion process clarifies the law for 
the benefit of the entire field.  Those opinions are 
public.  They are published and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but there are 
four of them.  I don't care how public they are.  There 
are four of them over the past 10 years.  It's not a 
very reliable or usable effort to clarify the law and 
address the problem that the statute presents.

 MR. JAY:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I submit

that you can't look simply at the number of responses 
without looking at the number of inquiries.  And I am 
confident that if this Court, as we urge that it do, 
reverses the Sixth Circuit and makes clear that asking 
your own lawyer for an opinion is not going to be a safe 
harbor defense under Subsection C, that there will be 
increased use of the -- of the safe harbor defense that 
Congress actually wrote into the statute in Subsection 
E.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we know what the time 

interval was?  You said there were seven requests for 
affirmative responses.  How long did it take from when 
the request was made until the FTC responded?

 MR. JAY:  In the four that were granted, 

three of them took three to four months.  The fourth is 
an exception, and that -- that's the one cited in the 
retail collection attorneys' amicus brief.

 That is an exception because the request was 

originally submitted as a comment in a pending 
rulemaking conducted by the FTC and a number of other 
agencies.  The FTC agreed to take that comment in the 
rulemaking and act on it an advisory opinion under the 
FDCPA so that it wouldn't have to wait for the other 
agencies to agree with its view, and so that one took 
considerably longer.  But the average processing time is

three to four months.

 And of course the FTC makes a number of 

other informal guidance avenues available, if what the 
debt collector wants is simply a quick answer and not a 
formal safe harbor with the imprimatur of the 
Commission.  One can -- the Commission staff has 
published guidance, and indeed, the Commission staff is 
available over the telephone --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And if that's wrong, 

it doesn't do you any good.

 MR. JAY:  If that's wrong, it doesn't confer 

the safe harbor.  But that's up to the debt collector, 
Mr. Chief Justice.  If you -- if you want an informal 
opinion, you can get one very quickly.  If you want the 
safe harbor, that requires the imprimatur of the 
commissioners, and that takes a bit longer.

 We don't think that's at all inconsistent 

with what Congress intended, and we do think that 
Congress intended that this be the primary avenue.  And 
if you look at the advisory opinion provision of the 
Truth in Lending Act, we think that illustrates it.

 At the time Congress enacted the FDCPA, the 
Truth in Lending Act advisory opinion provision had only 
been on the books for a couple of years, but it had 
already filled more than 100 pages of the Code of

Federal Regulations with advisory opinions.  And we 
think that that's how Congress intended for the law 
under this statute to be clarified as well, not in a way 
that effectively confers qualified immunity on debt 
collectors whenever there is an ambiguity in the law.

 We think that that is reinforced as well by 

a substantive aspect of the statute, which is that 
Congress recognized -- and this is in particular in the 
legislative history at page 18 in footnote 9 of our 
brief -- that the debt collection industry is extremely 
aggressive and looks for loopholes whenever they exist.

 So the substantive prohibitions of the 

statute, especially 1692d, e, and f, are written in such 
a way that they contain broad, substantive prohibitions 
that are illustrated by examples, but those examples 
expressly are illustrative and not exclusive.  Congress 
would not have wanted a debt collector to be able to 
say:  Well, gee, this -- this practice is not expressly 
addressed by the statute and has not yet expressly been 
addressed by any judicial opinion, and to say:  Well, 
that law is not clearly established.

 We think it's -- may I finish the 

sentence Mr. Chief Justice?  We think, instead, that 
Congress would have recognized that the purpose of this 
statute is to protect the unsophisticated debtor, and

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. COAKLEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. COAKLEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The starting point for discerning 

congressional intent is the text of the statute.  The 
Respondents submit that in a review of the text of this 
statute, all of the components may be read plainly to 
include the bona fide error defense, to include legal 
error, starting with the words that the Court was 
discussing with Mr. Russell and Mr. Jay, "violation not 
intentional," moving on to "violation resulting from a 
bona fide error," then "the maintenance of procedures 
reasonably adapted."

 The Sixth Circuit and the trial court and --
have construed this statute in a plain-meaning analysis; 
that is to say, they start with the plain meaning of 
each of those words and construe them in their context. 
They did not find an ambiguity.  They did not find an

absurdity.  They found that each of those -- each of 
those components may be squared with a -- with a legal 
error analysis.

 Petitioner even concedes with respect to the 

element of "violation not intentional" that our 
interpretation is, quote, "not linguistically 
impossible," end quote.

 What -- what Petitioner has done is to avoid 

the conventional standards of -- of congressional -- I 
mean, of statutory interpretation, which is the 
plain meaning from Lamie, and moving, then, outward if 
necessary.  And they have opted instead for looking at 
unrelated statutes such as TILA, then going to the safe 
harbor, and then pulling the words "violation" and 
"intentional" out of the first prong, taking them out of 
context, taking them out of order, and then applying 
them to this maxim, "ignorance of the law."  Even --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And also saying -- and 
then this sentence is what I would like to have your 
response on, that there is no statute -- Federal statute 
that makes mistake of law a defense.  So this would be 
highly extraordinary, and if that's what Congress meant 
to do, to make something that ordinarily is no defense a 
defense, we would expect Congress to do so expressly.

their argument, that it is unprecedented.  But their 
unprecedented argument gets them nowhere.  That is one 
of the panoply of arguments that is outside the plain 
meaning that they go to to say well, this is 
unprecedented; Congress couldn't have intended this.

 There are reports that read the TILA bona 

fide error to mean legal error at one point in time, so 
it wasn't unprecedented to the extent of that, and what 
did Congress do with respect to TILA?  In 1980, they 
didn't like the interpretation that they were getting 
with respect to legal error from the TILA error, which 
is a totally different statute, and so they reacted by 
amending TILA to say no legal error in TILA.

 They did not correspondingly amend the 

FDCPA, which shows Congress's intent to distinguish the 
two statutes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think before our 
Heintz decision, that they intended for debt collectors 
to have an automatic defense if they just called up a 
lawyer?  And so a lawyer's opinion would give them 
absolute immunity from liability?

 MR. COAKLEY:  Absolutely not, Justice 

Sotomayor.  This --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I think part of the 

difficulty in this case, isn't it, is the -- is our

Heintz decision which made lawyers debt collectors, and 
so now we are in this quandary about a lawyer's good 
faith.  But -- but if we start with what was understood 
at the time, do you think that this language was 
intended to give debt collectors immunity by simply 
calling a lawyer?

 MR. COAKLEY:  Well -- it was absolutely 

meant to protect debt collectors, however, that term was 
defined in 1977, which included lay debt collectors.  In 
1986 it went up a level when we added lawyers, and the 
exemption went out and in 1995 it went up another level 
when we added litigating lawyers.

 But most certainly it went back to 1977 and 

included lay debt collectors, and lay debt collectors 
didn't get a "get out of jail free" card here by just 
pulling up the bona fide error defense and saying I'm 
done.  They are subject to the three rigors of the bona 
fide error defense.  They have to prove that the 
violation was not intentional -- that the violation --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Call a lawyer.
 MR. COAKLEY:  Pardon?
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Call a lawyer.
 MR. COAKLEY:  How --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just have a lawyer sign 

off.

MR. COAKLEY:  No, but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even if the lawyer made 

a mistake, if the debt collector relies, you know, I 
have a reputable law firm, they are well educated, they 
tell me they do legal research, that -- I can assume 
that, so why don't I have a "get out of jail" card?

 MR. COAKLEY:  The unfairness of this 

statute, as Justice Breyer indicated in his commentary 
with Mr. Russell, is -- is exemplified by your question. 
If a lay debt collector calls a lawyer in the 1977 to 
1986 round and asks a lawyer for an interpretation of 
this act, and he base -- he relies upon that and acts 
accordingly, per their interpretation only applying to 
clerical error, that lay debt collector who relied upon 
advice of counsel is out of luck if the decision goes 
against the lay debt collector, because he or she has no 
error of law as a defense.  So it goes up, the levels of 
unfairness go up as the time goes on.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true of antitrust 

defendants, too.

 MR. COAKLEY:  But in this, Your Honor, there 
is a -- there is a bona fide error defense that has been 
crafted into this statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I see that.  Is it --

is it -- what do you think of the idea that your

opponent here has suggested that the way to deal with 
the lawyer's problem that I mentioned is simply read the 
substantive provisions, so that there is no violation 
for ordinary legal activity where they have gone and 
asked the FTC or you know, all the things that are 
against them?  What you would have to do.

 That isn't so hard to do as I first thought, 
because the words that seem to make -- the primary words 
of what is outlawed are the words "unfair or 
unconscionable means."  Now I -- I doubt -- you would 
know -- I doubt that there are other words in the 
statute that forbid lawyers from doing anything that 
really shouldn't be forbidden.  I mean, they shouldn't 
call people up in the middle of the night and harass 
them and so forth.

 But -- but you could read unfair and 

unconscionable means to say that where a lawyer is 
really hit by surprise, you know, all the circuits were 
against him, the FTC wouldn't give him an opinion, that 
he no longer is acting unfairly and unconscionably. 
What about that?

 MR. COAKLEY:  Justice Breyer, I don't think 
that gives credence to the 1977 focus when lawyers were 
not part of the statute.  Certainly your example 
heightens the unfairness of it once lawyers come in in

1995 through Heintz as a litigating lawyer.  Certainly a 
lawyer has -- it creates this irreconcilable conflict of 
interest that you alluded to in your discussion with Mr. 
Russell.  That puts the lawyer between the proverbial 
rock and a hard place.  He either -- he or she either 
chooses to follow the law and risk --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's right.  I was seeing 
a special problem with lawyers.  Call -- the unfairness 
problem that you are talking about, call that the 
antitrust problem, because it is just as much.  But I 
saw the special problem of putting the lawyer in the 
impossible situation that you've just described.

 Now it's with respect to that problem that 

he offers the cure of reading the words "unconscionable" 
and what is it?  "Unconscionable and unfair means." 
Read those words to exempt the lawyer when he's in the 
dilemma I discussed, and therefore the lawyer will not 
have an incentive to -- to skew his advice.

 MR. COAKLEY:  I believe that the lawyer 
would be just subject to the rigors of the bona fide 
error defense, the way any other debt collector as 
defined from 1977 forward would be.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose it would 
make interpretation of the act a little more difficult. 
The same practice would be unconscionable in -- not

unconscionable in one circumstance, you would have an 
opinion saying this is not unconscionable; but yet if 
somebody else does it, you know, two weeks later, that 
doesn't have the same -- he says, well, look, it's not 
unconscionable, but it turns out it is, in his case.

 And it would have to be -- the opinion would 

have to clarify the law by saying, this is normally 
unconscionable but we are going to say it's not here 
because of this activity that is unlikely to happen.

 MR. COAKLEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, I believe 

this would be part of the inquiry that a lawyer would be 
faced in trying to prove the affirmative defense of bona 
fide error in a legal situation, and that -- that would 
be part of the good faith analysis, part of the 
reasonable procedures that he would present to the 
court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could we do that in the 

context of this case?  Because we are talking on a 
highly abstract level.  This is a statute that required 
a validation notice, and for the most part the 
validation notice that was sent to the debtor is exactly 
the words of the statute.

 But the lawyer added two words that are not 

in this statute, "in writing."  Where did that come 
from?  We are told this was not the model form that was

used by the debt collectors' association.

 MR. COAKLEY:  There was a case, Graziano, 

Your Honor, that talked about the -- was construing the 
statute and specifically section 1692g(a)(3) and 
determining because g -- the second and third prong of 
the statute had the words in writing, does the first 
prong in order to be coherently read remain "in 
writing"?  Graziano says yes, you should put "in writing 
in order" to make a coherent --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It says you "should" --
MR. COAKLEY:  "Should."
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Rather than "may"?
 MR. COAKLEY:  No.  Well Graziano suggested 
"in writing" is the only effective way to construe this 
statute; otherwise, it makes no sense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That issue is still 

not settled, is it?

 MR. COAKLEY:  That's correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We still don't know 

if the lawyer here was right or wrong.

 MR. COAKLEY:  That's correct.  And that 

actually points out a -- the unfairness of this whole 
situation.  Because my clients, respondents tomorrow 
could be sued in the Southern District of Ohio by

somebody for -- because they took the words "in writing" 
out of their validation notice.  Immediately upon being 
sued in this case, they could be sued in the Southern 
District of Ohio for not following -- or not following 
Graziano, because somebody would conclude that that was 
the more effective way -- reading of that statute, and 
if they are wrong, then the lawyer has no bona fide 
error --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Coakley, one of your 
earlier statements confused me.  You relied upon the 
fact that TILA was amended in 1980 to provide that legal 
errors are not covered by the TILA defense, and I think 
you -- I think you describe that as -- as changing the 
law to -- to provide that -- that legal errors were not 
covered.

 But as I understood the situation, every 
court of appeals to have construed TILA prior to 1980 
had held that legal errors were not -- were not 
included, as -- as your opponent says, they are not 
included here.  So the amendment to TILA was just an 
affirmation of the judicial interpretation of the 
language similar to the language here.

 MR. COAKLEY:  Justice Scalia, there were 

cases, although not court of appeals cases that --

construe it had held that mistakes of law were not 
covered.  Is that accurate or not?

 MR. COAKLEY:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then -- then your 

prior statement was very misleading.

 MR. COAKLEY:  Well, to the extent that there 

were two different -- two different analyses or 
interpretations that had emerged before 1980 that led 
the Congress to -- in 1980, enact or to amend TILA, 
otherwise, as pointed out in the Herrera case in our 
brief, if everything was so settled in 1980, why would 
there be a need to clarify the definition of bona fide 
error under TILA, and -- and if it was clarified in 1980 
under the FDCPA, then why didn't they take the step and 
clarify it in the FDCPA from 1980 to 2010, especially 
when Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is no basis for 

saying that the amendment was overturning -- changing 
the prior meaning of TILA.  There is no basis for saying 
that.  All you had were just a few district court 
opinions, and all the courts of appeals have come out 
the other way.

 MR. COAKLEY:  Your Honor, the -- the 

Petitioner's position was that the case law was uniform 
at the time, and our position is the case law was not

uniform at the time.  There were cases that had taken an 
opposite approach to the court of appeals decision on --
on TILA, and that is what led to Congress reacting in 
1980 to specifically exclude legal error from the TILA 
defense and has -- Congress has --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why doesn't that just 

mean that Congress wants to confirm that the judges --
the majority of judges who -- who had held that it 
didn't -- that errors of law were not a defense, that 
they were right, it's not changing -- changing anything. 
It's just confirming that the majority view is right.
 MR. COAKLEY:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

case law says that the law has to be settled, and as we 
pointed out in our brief, it was not settled, and the 
courts, afterwards, have reflected that there was no 
settlement, and that that's one of the reasons why the 
error portion of the TILA bona fide error was -- was 
clarified, as the Petitioner puts it, to say this 
excludes any interpretations of legal -- of legal -- of 
the legal interpretations of TILA.

 And then there was no -- whether you call it 

a clarification, whether you call it a ratification, 
whether you call it an amendment, it doesn't matter, 
Congress didn't then similarly amend the FDCPA to be 
consistent with their --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why wouldn't one 
say, now, Congress has confirmed that the word in the 
Truth and Lending Act means thus and so, Congress has 
said that's what those words mean, and then go back to 
the other statutes and say the same language was used, 
so it means the same thing, the same thing that Congress 
has just confirmed?

 MR. COAKLEY:  Justice Ginsburg, I believe 

that the -- the words "bona fide error" in the TILA 
statute were being construed, although not by courts of 
appeals, to reasonably read the bona fide error 
encompasses legal error.

 There was a change -- change -- a 

clarification, whatever, in 1980, to specifically say, 
bona fide error does not include legal interpretations 
of TILA, and that was then never clarified, ratified, or 
whatever, nothing was done to the FDCPA at that time, 
and -- and the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Were there any district 
court decisions, of any kind, reading bona fide errors 
to mean legal mistakes under any of the other statutes?

 MR. COAKLEY:  I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The ones that were not 

changed, the ones that Justice Ginsburg is -- is 
describing.

Congress may or may not have acted --

MR. COAKLEY:  Okay.  But --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm talking about under 
this statute, under any other statute that uses similar 
language.

 MR. COAKLEY:  Yes --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Were there any district 
court cases that were reading those statutes to include 
mistakes of law?

 MR. COAKLEY:  Well, in this case that we are 

here on, Judge Gaughan from the U.S. District Court of 
the Northern District of Ohio read the -- read that 
TILA --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that was after the 

TILA amendment?

 MR. COAKLEY:  That was after the amendment. 

Now, you're talking about before 1980?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I was talking about the 

time that Congress was look at amending the statutes.

 MR. COAKLEY:  Under the -- well, the FDCPA 
came into effect in 1977, and the -- TILA was in 1968. 
You are asking between '68 and '77?  The were -- the

Wellmaker case did -- did construe the statute to 
include legal error.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that a -- a 
mistake of law has to be substantively reasonable in 
order to fall within this defense, and if so, where do 
you get that?  Where do you find that in the statute?

 MR. COAKLEY:  The statute doesn't refer to 

substantively or procedurally, Justice Alito, the 
statute refers to bona fide error and the maintenance of 
procedures reasonably adapted.  As a -- as a -- as 
either a lay debt collector or as a lawyer debt 
collector, they must establish good faith in attempting 
to comply with the law as it existed at the time.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose that a lawyer 
spends a whole week researching a question, but arrives 
at a conclusion that is plainly incorrect, does not, 
therefore, intend to violate the statute and proceeds in 
good faith.  Would that -- how would that work out?

 MR. COAKLEY:  Well, in proving --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It would be an unreasonable 
decision, and yet, would it -- it would fall within your 
understanding of this provision; is that correct?
 MR. COAKLEY:  Absolutely.  I mean, he 

would -- he would have -- that lawyer would have to meet 
the three prongs of the affirmative defense by a

preponderance of the evidence.  If he doesn't prove all 
of the prongs, he's out.  If he proves all of the 
prongs, he's in, and if he creates an issue of fact on 
one of the three prongs, than he's going back to the 
district court for a fact-finding analysis, which turns 
out to be the -- you know, this statute has not proved 
to be unworkable.

 And if I could follow up to Justice Scalia's 

and Justice Ginsburg's query about the -- the -- and 
Justice Sotomayor's -- about the interpretation of the 
words "TILA" versus "FDCPA," I think a review of the 
cases of the Seventh and Tenth Circuits is instructive 
because the Seventh Circuit was one of the circuits 
that, under TILA, had -- had interpreted the word to 
mean clerical error only.  The Tenth Circuit -- and the 
tenth circuit as well.

 Now, today, under interpreting the FDCPA 
bona fide error, they have abrogated that meaning in 
TILA and have come around to this means legal error 
under the FDCPA.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Could you answer one 
question -- I'm just a little confused about.  One 
statute has the defense in expressly.  The other 
doesn't.  Is there a difference in the likelihood of 
unfairness under the two statutes?  Why -- is there a

reason why Congress would have wanted to provide a 
mistake of law defense under TILA and not in this --
this -- in this case?  Why would it treat them 
differently?

 MR. COAKLEY:  There -- there are 

differences -- substantial differences, Justice Stevens, 
in the TILA and in the FDCPA statute, starting with the 
purposes of the statute, starting with the construction 
of the statute, one, TILA has a criminal liability, TILA 
has life lines that the debt collector doesn't have in 
the FDCPA, TILA dealing -- is dealing with disclosure of 
financial information, TILA has regulations, as opposed 
to no regulations --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would think all -- which 

way do these cut?  I mean, the fact that there is 
criminal liability under TILA would seem to me to cut in 
precisely the opposite direction.  You would want to 
provide excuses of bona fide errors of law, I would 
think.  Why -- am I missing something here?

 MR. COAKLEY:  The -- no, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would think --
MR. COAKLEY:  It's a -- it's a distinction 

between why -- in trying to answer Justice Stevens' 
question, it's a distinction why TILA would be 
interpreted differently by the -- than the FDCPA.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the question is -- is 

there a greater need for the mistake of law defense 
under one statute, rather than the other, I sort of --

MR. COAKLEY:  Given --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- have the same problem 

Justice Scalia expressed.

 MR. COAKLEY:  Given -- well, given the 

purpose of TILA, and TILA dealing with computational 
errors, regulation C, Truth in Lending, they -- they 
amend -- they amended TILA -- I mean, I'm sorry. 
Originally TILA didn't have a bona fide error and then 
they amended it so as to -- before it was enacted -- so 
as to cover this area to provide for the computational 
error.  Because it's so fraught with mathematical errors 
and the like.

 That is not the situation in the FDCPA.  And 
that is precisely the reasoning that is the Seventh and 
Tenth Circuit have noted, and the case of Frye that we 
have cited in our brief has noted, as the distinction 
between these two statutes, and why one could be 
interpreted this way and the FDCPA could be reasonably 
interpreted the other way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I mean, you're --
the substance of your answer is that they are just two 
very different statutes.

MR. COAKLEY:  Absolutely.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I -- but I share 

Justice Scalia's concern, I mean the -- the ways in 
which they are different would suggest you need the 
legal mistake defense more in TILA than you do in the 
FDCPA.

 MR. COAKLEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I 

don't believe that that is consistent with the purpose 
of -- of TILA.  And certainly lawyers are not -- lawyers 
are not creditors under TILA.  And -- so that's a 
distinction between the -- the two statutes.  And 
further, the -- there is an administrative penalty under 
the FDCPA that -- the $16,000 a day, but the bona fide 
error does not apply to that.  So there is no 
inconsistency between the administrative penalties under 
the FDCPA and the civil penalties under the FDCPA.

 And in -- and in truth, the -- the statutes 

are -- are significantly different.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I was wondering if you 

know, can you give me just a rough idea, of the 
percentage of instances in which people write to the FTC 
to take advantage of the safe harbor and the FTC just 
says, "Well, we won't tell you."

 MR. COAKLEY:  I do not have that empirical 

evidence, Your Honor.  I do know that the briefs are

consistent on this point, and as admitted to by the 
Petitioners, there have been four advisory opinions from 
the FDCPA -- from the FTC in 30 years.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  How many have asked?
 MR. COAKLEY:  I don't know how many have 

asked.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, it seems to me 
that's the obvious solution to the problem, that --
until you hold they are not -- they are liable for 
mistake of law, but anyone can write to the FTC ahead of 
time and -- and get a safe harbor.

 It's -- so I don't know what we could do to 

suggest maybe that mechanism, which is built into the 
statute, should be used.

 MR. COAKLEY:  I think that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Didn't Mr. Jay tell us 

there were seven requests?  Are you disputing that?
 MR. COAKLEY:  I am not disputing that, 
Justice Ginsburg.  What I am basically saying is it 
really doesn't make any difference, because the truth 
with respect to the FTC and the safe harbor defense and 
the FDCPA, that Mr. Jay does not argue that one is 
superfluous to the other; the Petitioner argues that one 
makes the other superfluous -- neither are superfluous 
to the other.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, all right.  But I 

mean, if there have been seven requests and four answers 
then all these horrible things that are going to happen 
if you do say there is -- unless you have mistake of law 
defense, aren't going to happen.  Because all that has 
to happen is that people write to the FTC and they get 
an answer.

 MR. COAKLEY:  But the safe harbor defense on 

its face applies prospectively.  The FDCPA bona fide 
error defense --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That means lawyer, if you 

are worried about this, go write before you do it.

 MR. COAKLEY:  Yes, but the bona fide error 

defense applies retrospectively.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I see I have a copy 

in the retail -- Association of Retail Collection 
Trades.  The first -- second sentence in the FTC's 
response is I apologize for the delay in responding to 
your request.

 MR. COAKLEY:  I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It is not an 

atypical issue in dealing with government agencies.

 MR. COAKLEY:  And -- yes, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and the penultimate paragraph in there:  For the 
foregoing reasons your request for advisory opinion does

not satisfy either the prerequisites described, well --
and accordingly we can't -- grant it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Coakley, why do you 

need a safe harbor if there is no store?  I mean what is 
the purpose of -- of having this procedure, however 
inefficient it may be, what is the purpose of having it 
unless you were going to be liable if you make a mistake 
of law?

 MR. COAKLEY:  The safe harbor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You are talking about a 

safe harbor rule.  Leave the harbor.

 MR. COAKLEY:  Justice Scalia, as it worked 
out the safe harbor is neither safe nor a harbor, but 
that's not the perspective that we have to look at it. 
We have to look at it from 1997, it was for a 
prospective course of conduct that gives the debt 
collector categorical --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does that have to do 

-- what does that have to do with anything, whether it's 
prospective or not?  The point is what benefit does it 
give to the person who is asking?  If the person is not 
going to be liable for a bona fide mistake, why would he 
ever use it?

 MR. COAKLEY:  Well, there are reasons why a 

debt collector may use it if he has time and he needs

the prospective letter from the FTC.  In -- in reality 
debt collector's going to go to the bona fide error 
because it's retrospective, although there is risk with 
the bona fide error, because it's not the categorical 
immunity that the safe harbor gives.  And there's --
they're not inconsistent.

 The safe harbor is not a --a statutory 

interpretation why you should drive a meaning into the 
bona fide error provision that is not apparent on its 
face.

 I would say in closing that Justice Breyer, 
your -- your comments earlier are just right.  This is 
worse -- a reading, the safe harbor, reading the bona 
fide error provision to exclude legal error is worse 
than unfair.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, now I do see -- which 
is why I asked the question, I asked to get an answer, 
and the answer now seems to be floating around the FTC 
idea.  It's -- seven letters, that isn't very much.  I 
just wonder if the -- if the bar in this area, and their 
clients, if they made an effort, might be able to get 
the financing for the FTC so they could have enough 
people to respond quickly to the letter.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. COAKLEY:  Justice Ginsburg asked the

question about unprecedented.  In -- in truth, what 
would really be unprecedented here would be for this 
Court to construe the bona fide error defense so that a 
lawyer or a debt collector who is giving advice to his 
client to follow a particular way of action, and the law 
was unsettled, for that lawyer to be subject to -- to be 
punished for personal liability.  And we think that the 
bona fide error clearly under Lamie encompasses --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are severe limits on 
the liability, aren't there?  Isn't there a thousand --
isn't it a $1,000 limit?

 MR. COAKLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not big bucks for an 

attorney, is it?

 (Laughter.)
 MR. COAKLEY:  But let that -- well, maybe 

for the prior group that was up here, but I don't --

(Laughter.)
 MR. COAKLEY:  It's big in Cleveland.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This isn't -- this is a 

class action, wasn't it?  It was brought as a class 
action?

 MR. COAKLEY:  This is definitely a class 
action.  This is a class action that wants all of the 
validation notices that were sent out by this law firm 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

to -- that included the words "in writing" in it for 
that period, and further than that, they wanted the 
financial information from the law firm, the financials 
because, under the class action provision, it's $500,000 
or 1% of the net worth of the firm, which is ever less.
 So the request was made of my client, give 

me the financials of your law firm, and for some reason, 
my client did, but this -- the statute was not meant to 
punish lay debt collectors, including lawyers.

 The bona fide error defense is the shield, 

and we ask the court to affirm the judgment of the Sixth 
Circuit Court of Appeals.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 The case is submitted.
 (Whereupon, at 12:22 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
