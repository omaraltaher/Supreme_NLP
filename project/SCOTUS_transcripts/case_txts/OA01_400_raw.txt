CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 01-400, Ricky Bell v. Gary Bradford Cone.


Mr. -- Mr. Moore.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MOORE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. MOORE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


The court of appeals was without authority to


grant habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1) on


respondent's ineffective assistance of counsel claim for


two reasons: first, because the State court decision


rejecting the claim correctly identified this Court's


decision in Strickland v. Washington as the clearly


established Federal law governing this case, not United


States v. Cronic as respondent contends; and second,


because the State court's application of Strickland to the


facts of respondent's case was not objectively


unreasonable.


Turning to the first point, respondent's


ineffective assistance claim from the outset of this case


has asserted two specific errors that his attorney


allegedly committed during the sentencing phase of his


capital trial:  first, counsel's alleged failure to

present available mitigating evidence; and second, his


counsel's decision to waive closing argument. 


This Court held in Strickland that such claims


are properly analyzed under the two-part actual deficient


performance/actual prejudice test announced in that case


itself. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Moore, I think what happened in


this sentencing proceeding, if I remember correctly, is


that the attorney made some remarks at the beginning of


the sentencing hearing? 


MR. MOORE:  Yes, Your Honor.  He delivered an


opening statement, during which he specifically called the


jury's attention, as he is permitted to do under Tennessee


State law, to guilt phase evidence, mental health


evidence, upon which he was relying in mitigation.  He


explained to the jury its mitigating significance by


relating that evidence specifically to three statutory


mitigating factors. 


In addition, during that opening statement, he


emphasized his client's remorse for his role in the


crimes.  He emphasized his client's honorable service for


his country. 


QUESTION:  Did he explain that he wouldn't be


presenting any evidence or saying anything more?


MR. MOORE:  He -- he did not indicate one way or

the other in that statement, but he specifically --


QUESTION:  Now, would you be here -- would you


still be here if he had not said anything at the opening? 


Then what rule applies?  Suppose the defense attorney just


totally remained silent in the sentencing phase.  Would


Cronic be the test? 


MR. MOORE:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  No?


MR. MOORE:  It is our -- it is our position that


if the claim focuses on counsel's conduct during the trial


and it is not alleged that any errors or omissions he made


were the result of State interference or so-called


surrounding circumstances, then such a claim is properly


analyzed under Strickland's two-part test.


QUESTION:  The attorney here did successfully


object to the presentation of some evidence during the


sentencing phase, didn't he? 


MR. MOORE:  Yes, indeed, Your Honor, he did.  He


vigorously objected and -- to the admission of some very


gruesome crime scene photographs that the prosecution


sought to introduce to establish the heinous, atrocious,


and cruel aggravating circumstance, and he succeeded in


excluding that testimony.  In addition, he -- he objected


to some hearsay evidence.  And so, the -- the Sixth


Circuit's suggestion that counsel simply sat mute at the

sentencing hearing simply is belied by this record. 


QUESTION:  Just to go back to Justice O'Connor's


question, suppose the attorney says nothing and later


says, you know, I was just -- I don't know -- stressed


out, traumatized.  I -- I really blanked out during that


proceeding.  No Cronic there? 


And -- and do you say Cronic doesn't apply


because he did participate in the earlier phase of the


case and you don't want us to bifurcate guilt phase and


sentencing?  Was -- was that the basis of your answer? 


MR. MOORE:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  It's a two-part question.


MR. MOORE:  No, Your Honor.  Our position is


that if the ineffective assistance claim asserts that the


lawyer, for whatever reason, failed to do something or did


something in error, that -- those kinds of claims are


properly analyzed under Strickland, and we think that's a


fair reading of Strickland.  Strickland itself says


conflict of interest claims aside, actual ineffectiveness


claims alleging a deficiency in attorney performance are


subject to the general requirement that the defendant


affirmatively prove prejudice. 


QUESTION:  When does Cronic apply? 


MR. MOORE:  Cronic in our view is properly read


to apply only when surrounding circumstances or State

interference renders it unlikely that any lawyer could


have rendered effective assistance of counsel.  Of course,


Cronic itself --


QUESTION:  Well, in my -- in my hypothetical, he


said I just blanked out for a minute.


MR. MOORE:  But that circumstance is the


lawyer's own problem.  For our -- for analytical purposes


in our view, it shouldn't matter whether counsel's


failure, for example, to make a critical objection or to


do something he should have done was the result of his


being asleep or his working a crossword puzzle or his


ignorance of the law.  What ought to matter is whether his


conduct, what he did or failed to do, violated prevailing


professional norms.  If -- if it did, that's deficient


performance, and then the Court under Strickland examines


the record to ascertain whether that error --


QUESTION:  Do we take it as a given in this case


that the attorney did provide -- that there was


ineffective assistance at sentencing?  Do we take that as


a -- a given?


MR. MOORE:  No, Your Honor.  No, Your Honor. 


Our petition challenges the correctness of the court of --


of appeals decision under section 2254(d)(1), and that


involves our argument that the State court's application


of Strickland to the facts of this case was not

unreasonable. 


The actual ineffectiveness claims Mr. Hutton's


client raises are twofold.  He complains that available


mitigating evidence was not presented, but the record


simply does not support that claim.  Counsel was under no


obligation to reintroduce the mental health evidence that


had been introduced during the guilt phase because


Tennessee State law specifically allows counsel to rely on


guilt phase evidence.  As I earlier indicated, counsel


specifically explained the mitigating significance of that


evidence to the jury during his opening statement and


related it to three specific statutory mitigating


circumstances. 


QUESTION:  This is not the first time in one of


these cases I've been surprised at how skimpy the


presentation is at -- by the defense counsel on


sentencing.  Maybe there's some dynamic in the courtroom: 


the jury knows how important it is; he doesn't want to


destroy a -- a certain intensity that they're bringing to


their case.  But on the cold record, it certainly seems


skimpy.


MR. MOORE:  Well --


QUESTION:  I'm tempted to ask you if this is


usual, but that -- that's probably not a fair question as


there are so many differences in so many cases.

 MR. MOORE:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


Respondent's complaint that counsel --


QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Moore, may I ask you?  On


that -- on that branch of it, it seems to me that there


was, the prosecutor's presentation to the jury was about a


match for the defense attorney's.  Neither one -- both of


them were skimpy. 


MR. MOORE:  Yes, Your Honor.  And that is --


that point is critical to our assertion that counsel's


decision to waive closing argument was not deficient


performance.


QUESTION:  But I had another question that I


wanted to ask you, and that was you presented two


questions.  One is that the Sixth Circuit never should


have reached the merits, and two, on the merits they were


wrong.


MR. MOORE:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  As a matter -- and the Sixth Circuit


proceeded just the other way.  It decided the merits first


and then it -- it said it was clearly established.  Are


you asking this Court or don't you care what -- what order


we take these up in, or do you have a preference?


MR. MOORE:  Well, it's our -- it's our position,


Your Honor, that it is not the function of this Court


under 2254(d) to reach -- to actually address the merits

as if it were deciding this claim de novo.  The only


question to be resolved here is whether the State court's


rejection of the claim was either contrary to or involved


an unreasonable application of clearly established law. 


We would suggest that the Williams v. Taylor


opinion provides the blueprint for the decision here.  The


first question is did the State court correctly identify


the governing legal principle.


QUESTION:  Don't you think it would be a little


coy for us to decide, well, it wasn't an unreasonable


application of -- of Federal law when we, in fact, know


that -- or believe that it was a correct application of


Federal law?  Do you insist that we simply say -- and go


no further than to say, oh, it was -- it was not an


unreasonable application? 


MR. MOORE:  I certainly would not begrudge the


Court's agreeing that the State court had indeed correctly


applied Strickland.  But it -- it is my assertion that


under 2254 the language of the statute contemplates that


the Federal court -- court approach the case by looking at


the bottom line decision of the State court and


ascertaining whether it is reasonable. 


QUESTION:  Indeed, if we could go no further


than -- than the coy statement that it was not an


unreasonable application, I suppose you shouldn't have had

two questions.  You should have just had one.


MR. MOORE:  That's correct, Your Honor.  I think


that's right. 


On the decision to waive closing argument --


QUESTION:  Mr. Moore, let -- let me interrupt


you.  How -- how -- does the record show how long the


penalty phase of the trial took? 


MR. MOORE:  Yes, Your Honor.  The record


reflects that opening statements started at approximately


12:07 p.m. and that the jury retired to deliberate at


about 3:05 p.m., and there was about an hour-and-ten-


minute break for lunch in there.  And they announced their


verdict somewhere along about a quarter of four.


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MR. MOORE:  And so, indeed, counsel could have


reasonably believed that all of the points he had made


during his opening statement, his plea for mercy, his


emphasis on his client's remorse, and the mitigating


significance of the guilt phase evidence, were fresh in


the jury's mind when the jury retired to deliberate


because that --


QUESTION:  What did he -- what did he say about


the Bronze Star?


MR. MOORE:  During his opening statement, he did


not specifically mention the Bronze Star because that

evidence was not elicited until his cross-examination of


one of the witnesses during the sentencing phase.  He did,


however, emphasize during his opening statement his


client's service in Vietnam and the toll that service had


taken on his client and his mental health status.


QUESTION:  So, your answer is he didn't mention


it in his argument. 


MR. MOORE:  He did not mention the Bronze Star.


Now, counsel's complaint that the Bronze Star


had some mitigating significance beyond the fact of its


award is simply not supported by the record.  No evidence


was presented to the State post-conviction court that the


Bronze Star, other than the fact of its award and the fact


that of -- that it indicated Mr. Cone had been decorated


-- no evidence elaborating on that was ever presented to


the State courts. 


Similarly, no evidence concerning Mr. Cone's


family background, social history, military record,


educational record, none of the evidence that Mr. Hutton


complains was not presented during the sentencing phase


was ever presented to the State courts during the post-


conviction hearing. 


Accordingly, under this Court's decision in


Burger v. Kemp, we say that the State courts reasonably


concluded that there was no deficient performance in -- in


12

that regard in this case because no record was ever made


in the State court concerning what the allegedly available


mitigating evidence might have been.  No testimony was


introduced indicating what these witnesses who allegedly


had knowledge concerning these matters would have said had


they been called at the sentencing. 


QUESTION:  But am I right that such evidence was


introduced in the Federal court?


MR. MOORE:  No, Your Honor.  This case was


resolved on summary judgment, and so none of -- none of


that evidence --


QUESTION:  Were allegations that such evidence


was available made in the Federal proceeding? 


MR. MOORE:  The allegation that it was available


was made in the Federal proceeding, but there was no


evidentiary --


QUESTION:  And was that allegation denied?


MR. MOORE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. MOORE:  Well, I don't know that it was


denied.  Our -- our point in the Federal court was that no


mitigating evidence was presented to the State court, and


so therefore --


QUESTION:  But if we're not deciding the case on


the basis of what that evidence would prove or disprove,

but rather on whether counsel was deficient in failing to


introduce it, should we not assume the evidence exists?


MR. MOORE:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  We should not? 


MR. MOORE:  No, Your Honor.  If -- if --


QUESTION:  Why not? 


MR. MOORE:  Because the burden rests with the


petitioner, the habeas petitioner, to demonstrate its


existence.  If -- if the State court -- if it was never


presented to the State court, there is no basis for


assuming it exists.


QUESTION:  What -- what was the -- what was the


case you just cited to us for that proposition?


MR. MOORE:  Burger v. Kemp.  In that case, Your


Honor, just as here, the complaint was that counsel was


deficient for failing to put on any mitigating evidence,


and in a couple of particulars, this Court noted that


counsel had failed to make a record in the State courts


concerning whether the -- the allegedly omitted evidence


would have had any substantial mitigating impact.  And in


that circumstance, this Court said that it could not find


deficient performance, let alone prejudice.


QUESTION:  Mr. Moore, are you done with that


point?


MR. MOORE:  Yes, sir.

 QUESTION:  It isn't stated in your brief, but I


assume that it's -- it's the Tennessee rule that if -- if


the defense doesn't make a closing -- a closing statement,


the prosecution doesn't either.  Is that it?


MR. MOORE:  That's right, and that was the --


the State court found, based on the evidence --


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. MOORE:  -- presented to it during the post-


conviction hearing that counsel made a tactical decision


to waive in -- in order to prevent the senior prosecutor


from delivering what he --


QUESTION:  The fearsome Mr. Strother.  Could --


could we get him to argue a case up here? 


(Laughter.)


MR. MOORE:  I am not -- I am not acquainted with


General Strother, so I'm not sure, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  But I gather that this isn't the only


occasion on which defense counsel have eschewed the making


of closing argument for fear that Mr. Strother would be


enabled to unleash his -- his weaponry. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. MOORE:  That's correct, Your Honor.  In


fact, one of respondent's own experts at the State post-


conviction hearing stated that he had waived closing


argument as a defense counsel for precisely the same

reason, to -- to prevent Mr. Strother from delivering what


was typically a killing rebuttal argument.  And he


pronounced that this was a -- clearly a viable trial


tactic. 


In -- in addition, both he and another expert


were asked point blank whether waiver of closing in -- in


these circumstances with these advocates amounted to


essentially a -- a breach of prevailing professional


norms.  And both refused to say whether it would or


wouldn't. 


Indeed, we think that that testimony is


absolutely critical, because surely if the only witnesses


who are actually qualified as experts and competent to


testify whether a particular decision of counsel breached


prevailing -- prevailing professional norms are unwilling


to state that they -- that there has been a breach, surely


a State court does not act unreasonably in concluding that


the defendant has failed to overcome Strickland's strong


presumption that all significant decisions of counsel are


made in -- in the exercise of reasonable professional


judgment. 


QUESTION:  Can we go back to the Bronze Star? 


It certainly did come out in the sentencing phase.  How


did it? 


MR. MOORE:  Yes, Your Honor.  During the

testimony of the criminal court clerk, who had been called


by the State merely to establish the prior violent


felonies, respondent's three convictions for armed robbery


in Oklahoma, during that -- during Mr. Dice's cross


examination, defense counsel's cross examination, of the


criminal court clerk, he had the criminal court clerk read


from, I believe it was, Mr. Cone's sentencing records or


prison records from -- prison classification records from


Oklahoma, the fact that Mr. Cone had been awarded a Bronze


Star in Vietnam.  That's how that evidence came into


being.  Indeed, it was the result of cross examination by


defense counsel during the sentencing phase of this trial.


QUESTION:  Do we have any evidence to indicate


whether Mr. Dice would have put on evidence showing the


Bronze Star if he had not been able to bring it out in


cross examination? 


MR. MOORE:  The record simply doesn't reflect


whether or not that would have been the case.  Mr. Dice


testified that he viewed that as an opening that he had


and that he -- he was actually quite pleased with himself,


if Your Honor will read his testimony about his ability to


get that accomplished without presenting direct evidence


on it. 


QUESTION:  Do you think he was entitled to be


pleased with himself for the way he got that in the

record?


MR. MOORE:  Your Honor, I --


QUESTION:  Is that the way you would have done


it if you had been the lawyer? 


MR. MOORE:  I'm not certain that -- that hearsay


evidence in a prison record is the best evidence of that


fact.  We don't really know anything about the Bronze Star


other than it is mentioned in this prison record.  We


don't know if there is a --


QUESTION:  And that's all the jury found out


about it, too.


MR. MOORE:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And we know nothing more about it


now?  Nothing came out in the Tennessee proceedings --


MR. MOORE:  No, Your Honor, and -- and --


QUESTION:  -- about the circumstances? 


MR. MOORE:  -- respondent introduced no evidence


before the State courts concerning why the -- the Bronze


Star was awarded, anything about the circumstances of its


award. 


QUESTION:  Was it -- were there any problems in


his service record?  He served in Germany and Vietnam.


MR. MOORE:  Not insofar as this record reflects,


Your Honor, no.


QUESTION:  And did the lawyer put in any

evidence about his -- what kind of a person he was before


he went to Vietnam?


MR. MOORE:  During sentencing?  No.  There was


no evidence concerning his background or character at all,


but we don't know what such evidence would have been,


because none was presented to the State court during the


post-conviction proceeding. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Moore. 


MR. MOORE:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MS. BLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The United States has addressed the second


question presented, which is whether a defendant must show


prejudice to establish a claim of ineffective assistance.


Strickland holds that to establish such a claim,


counsel's performance must be both deficient and


prejudicial.  Respondent's claims fall within Strickland


because he alleges that counsel was deficient in failing


to present mitigating evidence --


QUESTION:  Well, do you want us to assume then


that the performance was deficient and then address the

prejudice prong? 


MS. BLATT:  No.  I think the -- when the Court


addresses the section 2254, the threshold question, if the


Court uses Williams v. Taylor as a road map, is whether


Strickland is the clearly established law.  And it is the


clearly established law because this claim is an


ineffective assistance of counsel claim. 


Now, if the Court determines that Strickland is


the correct decision and that the State court correctly


identified that decision, then the remaining question is


whether the State courts unreasonably applied Strickland


on the facts of this case. 


QUESTION:  So, you don't get to question 2 at


all, then. 


MS. BLATT:  You get to -- you can -- you get to


question 2 if, in determining that Strickland and not


Cronic is the clearly established law, this Court holds


that Cronic does not apply when the claim is an actual


ineffective assistance claim.  And that is because


Strickland squarely governs claims alleging deficiencies


in attorney performance and that's -- that's what this


case is. 


Cronic did make an observation that prejudice


may be presumed when counsel entirely fails to subject the


prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.  But

that's not this case.  Counsel put on a meaningful case


for life and he did it in his opening statement.  He had


already introduced the substantial mitigation evidence


during the sentencing proceeding and the State court


procedures expressly allowed the jury to consider that


evidence in its sentencing deliberations in determining


whether to impose the death sentence. 


Now, to take a claim of ineffective assistance


and just to presume prejudice under Cronic would be


inconsistent with what the Court said in Strickland, and


that is, absent a showing of prejudice, it cannot be said


that a verdict of a death sentence resulted from an


adversarial breakdown that renders the death sentence


unreliable. 


The Court also said --


QUESTION:  What -- what if the defense counsel


presented nothing at all at the sentencing phase, do you


think that there is potential for application of Cronic in


those circumstances? 


MS. BLATT:  Yes, Justice O'Connor.  We think


Cronic is --


QUESTION:  So, you differ from Mr. Moore in that


regard. 


MS. BLATT:  We do but our difference is very


narrow.  We think Cronic refers to an extreme situation

where counsel provides absolutely no assistance at trial


and, in effect, the defendant has been denied the


assistance of counsel under Gideon v. Wainwright because


essentially the defendant lacked counsel.  And that's a


very rare situation and exceedingly narrow. 


QUESTION:  Why divide trial into, you know, the


one phase and then the -- the mitigation phase?  It's all


part of the same trial.  Couldn't you likewise divide it


into the -- the direct examination phase and the cross


examination phase and say that he totally failed to do his


job in the cross examination phase?  I mean, you -- you


know, you can cut up a -- a trial into as many little


pieces as you want --


MS. BLATT:  Right, and --


QUESTION:  -- and say counsel utterly failed to


-- to litigate this particular piece. 


MS. BLATT:  We couldn't agree with you more.  To


do that would just swallow the rule in Strickland and


would be inconsistent with the idea that counsel could


reasonably omit to cross examine a witness or fail to


produce evidence.


QUESTION:  What justification do you have for --


for separating out the mitigation phase from the other,


especially when some of the evidence that went to


mitigation was presented during -- during the direct

phase?


MS. BLATT:  Right.  And -- and the prosecution


may have a reasonable argument in many cases that counsel


did not entirely fail to provide assistance.  We just


don't take issue with the idea that when Cronic spoke of a


situation of counsel entirely failing to -- to provide


assistance, that the presumption of prejudice would be


assumed.  But I think in -- in many cases, we're talking


about the entire trial. 


QUESTION:  But you're giving up the principle. 


Once you -- once you allow that you can split it into the


-- into the guilt phase and the mitigation phase, it can


be split other ways as well, I assume.


MS. BLATT:  We don't think so, and --


QUESTION:  I mean, why wouldn't it just be


here's a counsel who litigated the case properly but he


made -- he made a mistake in -- in his litigation?  He


didn't put on any evidence in the -- in the mitigation


phase.  You don't want to do it that way.  You want to


say, no, we can look at -- look at this trial as really


two separate trials, and because he did nothing in the --


in the mitigation phase, it is not a situation of -- of


inadequate counsel, it's a -- it's a situation of no


counsel.  I -- once you've given up that principle, I


don't know why we don't split it up other ways as well.

 MS. BLATT:  We don't think so.  In this case, it


would -- it -- it reasonably could fall on the Strickland


side if there's a State procedure that allows a jury to


consider mitigation evidence, but if there is an entire


failure to do anything throughout the entire trial, it is


exceedingly unlikely that that could be the result of


any --


QUESTION:  Well, when -- when you say the entire


trial, are you talking about the penalty phase or the


whole -- the whole trial? 


MS. BLATT:  We would be talking about a penalty


phase although I agree with Justice Scalia that in the


unique situation of this case, where there's an express


procedure that allows the jury to consider the mitigation


evidence, it's critical to look at counsel's performance


during the -- the guilt phase of the trial. 


But this is not a -- a case where we think


there's reasonable dispute about whether this falls under


Cronic or Strickland.  Counsel --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Is -- is that unique?  I


mean, if -- if -- is it unique that -- you mean in -- in


other States, the jury in the mitigation phase is not


allowed to consider evidence that -- that came in during


the penalty phase? 


MS. BLATT:  I don't think that is unique and I'm

sorry if I misspoke.


QUESTION:  I don't think it is.


MS. BLATT:  I think it's --


QUESTION:  Which means the two phases are


linked.  If -- if it were unique, you -- you might have


some basis for saying the mitigation phase is so separate


that if he doesn't introduce evidence there, he is absent. 


It's like not having counsel.  But that's not my


understanding of what happens in most States.  It's one


trial. 


MS. BLATT:  Right, and if you -- if we're just


talking -- if you take it out of the capital proceeding so


you don't have the split trial, all we're saying is if


there's an entire failure, we would think that it would be


appropriate to presume prejudice.  But we won't -- there's


just not that many cases because counsel usually is


providing some assistance, and the claim is that the


assistance that was provided was ineffective for a number


of reasons.  And that is this case.  The --


QUESTION:  Why isn't the line -- is it -- you


know, that you can draw a line one place doesn't mean it's


sensible to draw it every place.  And they are discrete


phases, the trial -- and it's not a mitigation stage. 


It's a sentencing, where aggravating factors come in as


well.  Is that not so?

 MS. BLATT:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  So, if one can say, yes, I see these


are two parts, it doesn't follow from that that I have to


then separate every examination and every cross


examination.  It's a question of where you draw the line.


MS. BLATT:  Well, I think that's correct, and


however you draw the line, this case falls on the


Strickland side of the line because this is not a case


where counsel didn't do anything.  This is a case where it


is just alleged that what -- the two strategic judgments


that counsel made were unreasonable.


QUESTION:  May I ask?  Supposing you had a case


-- and I know this is not quite it -- in which there is


strong evidence that counsel was mentally disabled and


that that made him less effective throughout the entire


sentencing hearing.  Would you judge that kind of a case


under Cronic or Strickland? 


MS. BLATT:  It would be under Strickland. 


Usually counsel's --


QUESTION:  Even if there was severe mental


illness on the part of counsel?.


MS. BLATT:  Is counsel's -- things that would go


to impair counsel judgments are generally irrelevant


unless they manifest themselves -- manifest themselves in


objectively unreasonable conduct.  And so if -- if counsel

is performing objectively reasonable, that counsel is no


different than someone who makes a mistake because --


QUESTION:  And you treat the failure to make a


closing statement or the failure to put in any evidence


whatsoever exactly as if he were a fully qualified lawyer


in such a case. 


MS. BLATT:  That's right.  You'd look at whether


it's objectively reasonable, and that would be whether


counsel is inexperienced or had some substance abuse


problem.  Those cases are -- are all governed under


Strickland.


And continuing why it would be inappropriate to


-- to apply Cronic as opposed to Strickland to claims of


attorney errors, I just want to make one last point, and


that is that a test that would sort of say, well, if


counsel's performance was just not meaningful enough, that


this would be judicially unmanageable and would lack any


of the policy justifications for presuming prejudice that


the Court noticed in Strickland, because the Court would


have to look at the entire record and determine whether


counsel's performance was deficient enough so as to


warrant a presumption of prejudice.


QUESTION:  Do you agree that under Burger v.


Kemp, if the district court in this case had wanted to


inquire about the availability of other evidence, it was

precluded from doing so because it hadn't been introduced


in the State collateral proceedings? 


MS. BLATT:  The district court ruled that that


-- that those claims were procedurally barred under an


adequate and independent State procedure.  Now, if the


Court reverses the Sixth Circuit, I think respondent would


be able to argue that those weren't procedurally barred on


remand, but those -- those claims were not considered by


the district court or the State court proceedings --


QUESTION:  So, it's a State procedural bar rule


if the evidence is not adduced at the State collateral


proceeding, as opposed to Federal deference? 


MS. BLATT:  It was a procedural --


QUESTION:  Under Burger? 


MS. BLATT:  In this context, the claims were not


made until subsequent post-conviction State court


proceedings.  So, the State courts held that those --


those additional grounds for ineffective assistance were


procedurally barred. 


QUESTION:  So, it was just the failure to adduce


the -- to make the claim rather than to elicit the


evidence?


MS. BLATT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Blatt.


Mr. Hutton, we'll hear from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. HUTTON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. HUTTON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The main problem in this case is not specific


attorney errors.  The problem in this case is the failure


of John Dice to make a case for life in response to the


State's case for death in the penalty phase of a capital


trial.


QUESTION:  Well, he did say something initially,


did he not, at the sentencing phase? 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice O'Connor, he did but I


would like to clear up one thing that Mr. Moore stated.


QUESTION:  Just -- I hope you will address that


because if he actually did something but it was somehow


inadequate assistance, then perhaps Strickland is the


test.


MR. HUTTON:  Justice --


QUESTION:  But if he did absolutely nothing,


then we have to wrestle with whether you divide it from,


you know, sentencing phase from guilt/innocence phase, and


so forth. 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice O'Connor, Mr. Dice did make


an opening statement, but in that opening statement, he


also told the jury that he had a right to put on evidence


29

at the penalty phase and had a right to make a closing


argument in the penalty phase.


QUESTION:  And it's really bad performance, you


can argue, having -- especially having made that


statement, not to do it.  But that's -- you know, you --


you can prove it was bad performance, and if you can prove


that it -- that -- that it adversely affected the outcome,


then -- then you have a case.  But -- but I don't think


that it proves that he wasn't there. 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice Scalia, the problem in this


case and the reason there's a total abdication of advocacy


is because after the State made a case for death, after


the State put on proof of aggravating circumstances and


then argued to the jury that the law required the jury to


put Mr. Cone to death, there was silence.  Mr. Dice put


forth no countervailing proof and made no countervailing


argument. 


QUESTION:  Well, he had -- he had asked


questions on cross examination, and it may be that he was


satisfied that the State hadn't shown much.


MR. HUTTON:  Justice --


QUESTION:  And he wasn't going to give them an


opportunity to have some stem-winder -- and -- and this is


not standard but it is -- it is not an unknown strategy. 


It used to happen in the -- in the Court of Appeals in the

Ninth Circuit.  There'd be an attorney who'd stand up. 


He'd talk for just two or three minutes and quietly about


the law and then he'd sit down.  And -- and then he'd take


27 minutes on rebuttal to make this huge jury speech.  And


so, what they used to do with him was they'd just submit


it on the briefs.  And he couldn't say anything at all. 


It was a very effective strategy for that particular


advocate. 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice Kennedy, the only role of


an advocate in the penalty phase of a capital trial is to


make a case for life.  A case for life is made by evidence


and argument.  Those are the only two tools that a lawyer


has.  For the lawyer, after the State makes a case, to say


nothing implies to the jury that I have no good reply for


that.


QUESTION:  Or it implies to the jury that the


State has shown nothing.  That's a completely permissible


inference, and counsel does that -- has been known to do


that.


QUESTION:  We have counsel up here sometimes who


say, I -- I waive rebuttal.  I mean, you know, I do not


take that to mean I agree with what our opponent has said. 


To the contrary, I take it to mean our opponent's -- our


opponent's case -- the additional facts he's -- he's


brought up are so insignificant that I don't have anything

else to say. 


MR. HUTTON:  But Justice Scalia, if a member of


the Court asked a question of counsel and counsel stood


silent, the necessary implication of that is I have no


good reply for that question. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Hutton, this was a very short


proceeding.  The opening was no shorter than the rather


mild presentation by the prosecutor.  And one thing that


really surprised me is -- I'm looking at pages 23 to 27 of


the appendix. 


MR. HUTTON:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  It shows that Mr. Dice did -- did


something.  And his last statement to the jury -- you said


he didn't -- didn't ask for mercy.  Well, what do you make


of this statement where he said, "And I would say to you


that mercy -- if you consider life under the mitigating


circumstances, and the aggravating circumstances -- raises


you above the State, raises you above the king, if you


will.  It raises you to the level of God."  I thought that


was a pretty affecting plea for mercy. 


MR. HUTTON:  Well, Your Honor, I would submit we


know that Mr. Dice was suffering from mental illness at


the time he testified.  He was declared incompetent to


practice law in February 1986 by Dr. Hutson, his own


doctor.

 QUESTION:  I'm asking you about those words. 


That sounds like a plea for mercy to me. 


MR. HUTTON:  Your Honor, I think -- I would


submit that that's more of a statement of grandiosity, but


even if it was a plea for mercy, our position is that


after the opening statements, nothing happened to make a


case for life.


QUESTION:  I'd like you to go into that.  I had


exactly the same reaction as Justice Ginsburg.  I didn't


understand why this isn't a very competent presentation,


let alone ineffective.  What's ineffective about it? 


His whole case, which the jury heard the day


before, was that this man suffered from Vietnam Syndrome


and he had four psychiatrists testifying, and by the time


you finish reading the excerpts of it, he had a point. 


And his point was that the personality of the defendant


changed totally after he went to Vietnam, which drove him


to drugs, which led to this killing, to the point where he


was irresponsible and couldn't be held legally responsible


for the death. 


Now, the jury the day before has heard all that. 


Out of a two-hour presentation on the death penalty part,


he -- 15 minutes of it is taken up by him going back over


that.  His having reviewed the whole thing, and the


prosecution having put on three witnesses, who were

irrelevant, because they talked about his criminal


behavior after he returned from Vietnam, leads the defense


lawyer to say I'm saying nothing.  Well, why should he say


anything?  The prosecution just made his case for him. 


Now, I'm telling you my reaction after reading


it, so that I can get your response. 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice Breyer, there -- there are


two points in response.  First of all, in a weighing


State, our position is that the failure to make a case for


-- for life after the State's case for death, necessarily


implies resignation to the State's case. 


QUESTION:  In other words, you're saying on that


part --


MR. HUTTON:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- that when Paul Freund sometimes


has said, a lawyer in this Court who sits down saying


nothing makes not just a good argument, but a perfect


argument.  Now, we all know that.  Right?  I'm calling


that to your mind. 


MR. HUTTON:  Okay. 


QUESTION:  My reading this transcript led me to


think maybe it wasn't the perfect response, but it was a


good one, because in the introductory statement -- I'll


repeat myself -- he made all these arguments.  The


prosecution never refuted one of them, and the witnesses

were irrelevant to those. 


Now, my question to you is, why does he have to


come back and make a statement that he knows will elicit


an answer? 


MR. HUTTON:  Number one, Your Honor, it's not


just the failure to make a statement.  It's the failure to


put -- to make a statement and put on proof.  The guilt


phase proof was not sufficient for a couple of reasons.


The first reason it wasn't sufficient is


because, number one, the jury -- it was never explained to


the jury that evidence that they had just rejected for an


insanity defense could, nonetheless, be mitigating


evidence.


Number two, there was a problem in this record


that the State post-conviction --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Before you go on to


number two, didn't -- didn't he make that clear to the


jury in his -- in his opening statement in the -- in the


penalty phase?


MR. HUTTON:  No, Your Honor.  He never explained


to the jury.  What he explained to the jury was there


would be a jury instruction that they could consider any


evidence of aggravating circumstances or mitigating


circumstances raised by the evidence.  It was never


explained to the jury, though, that evidence that they had

rejected for an insanity defense could, nevertheless, be


used for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase.


QUESTION:  And he did not allude to that


evidence?


MR. HUTTON:  No, Your Honor.  He alluded to the


evidence, but he did not allude to the fact that they


could consider -- he did not explain to the jury that they


could consider that evidence for mitigating evidence.


QUESTION:  Well, but surely the jury would


assume that they could consider it if he referred to it.


MR. HUTTON:  Your Honor, for a jury who's just


rejected an insanity defense -- and this will -- Justice


Scalia, this plays into the second point, too.  There


was --


QUESTION:  What about this statement?  He says,


the defense has put on proof of those mitigating


circumstances during its case.  Now I'd like to review


those for you.  And at that point, he goes back over the


testimony that the psychiatrists had given the day before. 


What's that, but to present to the jury the mitigating


evidence that took place the day before? 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice Breyer, the -- the problem


with that evidence was that the post-conviction court made


a finding there was prosecutorial misconduct where the


prosecution improperly argued that the jury should not

believe the evidence with respect to drug usage.  That's


on page 81 of the joint appendix. 


There was a finding that the lawyer for the State in


the closing argument said, Gary Cone is a drug dealer. 


You can find that because of the evidence of the money in


the car.  The State court on post-conviction said they


should not have argued that because they knew the money


came from a robbery. 


But the problem was that even though that didn't


raise to a substantive claim for relief, it nonetheless


tainted the evidence for mitigation evidence because the


prosecution's misstatements led the jury to believe, oh,


he was not a drug user, he was a drug dealer.  Mr. Dice


never cleared that up in the sentencing phase. 


QUESTION:  All right.  Can you go to -- I don't


want you to lose two, though.  You were cut off.  I asked


my question and I colored the facts against you.


MR. HUTTON:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Because I want to elicit from you


what your response is.  And I've got your first, and now I


want the second. 


MR. HUTTON:  The second response is a temporal


response, Justice Breyer, that in a weighing State, when a


jury is told they have to weigh the evidence for life, a


life sentence versus the evidence for death, for the

lawyer, after the State makes a case for life, to put


forth no affirmative proof, and then when the State argues


to the jury why the evidence that just mounted a case for


death necessitates under the law a sentence of death, to


fail to respond with argument as well is an abdication of


advocacy.


QUESTION:  Well, you know, I have trouble with


that because I don't think the State put on very much, and


if I'm sitting waiting for this closing argument, I know


what I'm going to hear.  This is a brutal crime spree


where he shot a police officer, shot a citizen, robbed a


jewelry store -- I forget all of the facts.  But he goes


through a high-speed chase.  He murders an elderly,


helpless couple.  That's the kind of thing that I'd be


terrified to have the jury hear, and the State is waiting


for closing argument, and he prevents that by sitting


down.  That may be a good strategy. 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice Kennedy, the problem is


when there is no -- there was no strategy, because after


the opening statements -- it's just like another trial


where you have opening statements, argument, and closing.


After the opening statements, there was nothing that was


put on.  He failed to make a case for life when cases for


life could have been made about his being awarded with the


Bronze Star for heroic combat in Vietnam.  Even though

there was an elicit -- it was elicited on page 31 of the


joint appendix in cross examination, that there was a


Bronze Star --


QUESTION:  But then the prosecutor says, this


man with a Bronze Star killed a helpless, innocent couple. 


Is this a hero?  He avoids all of that.


MR. HUTTON:  But Justice Kennedy, at least then


the jury has something to weigh.  There's not the problem


with Mr. Dice's silence saying, now that I've heard the


State's case, I have no good reply for it. 


QUESTION:  All right.  So, what I -- I think


maybe some of us are worried about the same thing.  In


this case if Mr. Dice was following the strategy that my


question suggested, it didn't work, did it? 


MR. HUTTON:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  No.  All right. 


But there could be a future case in which a


similar strategy would work.  So, how can I write an


opinion that says to a defense lawyer in a future death


case, even though your best judgment is to keep quiet at


this moment, nonetheless the Supreme Court of the United


States has said you have to get up and say something, with


the consequence that the jury comes back death?  What do I


do about that in your opinion? 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice Breyer, put another way,

the question the Court is asking is whether or not a


lawyer can strategically decide to abandon advocacy.


QUESTION:  All he has abandoned is his closing


statement.  He put all the thing in front of the jury in


his opening statement.  So, he's abandoning his closing


statement.  Now, you want me to say that he cannot abandon


that. 


MR. HUTTON:  No, Justice Breyer.  It's the -- a


combination of abandoning the closing statement and any


case for life, any affirmative case which leads to there


being no case for life in response to the State's case for


death.


QUESTION:  No, but Mr. Hutton, the problem that


I think we're all having with your argument is -- is


illustrated by the -- the colloquy that keeps going on. 


You're saying that in these circumstances the deficiency


was so clear that it should be treated as a Cronic case,


as if the lawyer were not there at all.  But the very fact


that we're having the discussion that we are shows that it


isn't so clear. 


And -- and the point that I wish you'd address


-- and I -- I have to say that I don't know how you can


address it, but the point that you've got to address if --


if you're -- if you're going to prevail here is how can we


apply Cronic if we are to apply in -- in any intelligible

way, in any way that has a limiting principle to it, if


the application of Cronic is going to depend on


assessments of lawyers' judgments which are as disputable


as this assessment? 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice Souter, it's our position


that, in essence, the lawyer's judgments are irrelevant to


a Cronic analysis, that Cronic looks at the structure --


QUESTION:  Well, that's the whole problem,


because if we were analyzing it under Strickland, we would


have a different sort of inquiry, and maybe it fits better


here. 


Let me ask you this, Mr. Hutton.  Suppose we


disagree with you and with the Sixth Circuit that Cronic


is the test.  We have two questions here: the Williams v.


Taylor issue under section 2254, and then this


Strickland/Cronic.  Suppose we think that Strickland


provides the test.  That isn't the end of the road for


your client, presumably?


MR. HUTTON:  No, Justice O'Connor. 


QUESTION:  What would happen then?  And how


should we address it with these two questions?  Do we deal


with 2254 first as a threshold question? 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice O'Connor, if I could take


both of your questions in the order you presented them.


First of all, if this Court determines that

Strickland applies, the case would have to be remanded to


the Sixth Circuit.  We had requested an evidentiary


hearing to develop many of these facts in the district


court, which was denied.  The Sixth Circuit never


addressed the issues about the failure to afford a -- an


evidentiary hearing and many State procedural default


issues that were raised that concern a novel


interpretation of State law being raised in Mr. Cone's own


case, and whether there were adequate and independent


State grounds.


QUESTION:  You know, it's -- it puts you in a


bad position for me to ask you this, but just assume, if


you would for a minute, that we think Strickland applies. 


Then what should we do here in the face of these two


questions, and where does that leave your client? 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice O'Connor, the -- if


Strickland did apply, the 2254(d) question could not be


resolved until first the procedural default issues and the


failure to afford an evidentiary hearing questions are


resolved by the Sixth Circuit.


QUESTION:  Why do we not decide the -- the


Strickland question here? 


MR. HUTTON:  Chief Justice, there are several


issues that -- that of -- that were not developed in the


district court with respect to deficient performance and

prejudice.  Those facts would have -- would have to be


developed before this Court could make a determination of


whether or not the State court unreasonably applied


clearly established Federal law. 


QUESTION:  What were those --


QUESTION:  Were these questions dealing with the


guilt phase or the penalty phase? 


MR. HUTTON:  Your Honor, these are all questions


that apply to application of Sixth Amendment, the failure


to develop evidence --


QUESTION:  I -- I asked you a specific question. 


Were these questions devoted to the penalty phase or the


guilt phase? 


MR. HUTTON:  With respect to the penalty phase


specifically, Chief Justice Rehnquist, with respect to


developing proof as to deficient performance, why the


findings of fact should not be trusted because --


QUESTION:  Mr. Hutton, didn't the Sixth Circuit


reject your claim about the guilt phase?


MR. HUTTON:  No -- what they rejected, there was


an issue of waiver of certain claims, not the Sixth


Amendment claims, but other claims that was denied by the


district court, and the Sixth Circuit found that those


issues were waived. 


With respect to the ineffective assistance

claims, the issue has to do with in State court there was


a finding that those claim -- that those aspects of the


Sixth Amendment claim were previously determined, and in,


this case is the first time that the State court held a


finding of previous determination can act as a procedural


bar to developing those issues in -- in State court.  So,


there's a novel issue of State law that --


QUESTION:  Can you -- can you point to me where


in the Sixth Circuit opinion -- I thought in their opinion


they rejected your claim insofar as the guilt phase. 


Perhaps I'm wrong. 


MR. HUTTON:  No, Justice Ginsburg.  They


rejected the issue of waiver.  They did not address at all


in the opinion the claim in the brief with respect to why


the State court finding of previous determination with


respect to aspects of a Sixth Amendment claim raised in


the subsequent State post-conviction petition -- why we


argued that that cannot be a bar to reaching the issues on


the merits in Federal court because it was a novel rule. 


It was a rule announced for the first time in Mr. Cone's


own case. 


Secondly, there are Michael Williams v. Taylor


problems because there are facts -- when we asked for an


evidentiary hearing, we were not afforded an evidentiary


hearing to develop many of these facts with respect to the

Bronze Star.  The district court didn't give us a hearing. 


And we have cause.  It wasn't our fault for failing to


develop those in -- in State court. 


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  I -- I don't -- I don't


really understand.  If the test -- if the criterion is --


is going to be whether the -- as the statute says, whether


the State court was reasonable in what it did, what right


do you have to introduce new evidence that wasn't


presented to the State courts?


MR. HUTTON:  Because --


QUESTION:  I don't understand why we can't just


-- just look at the evidence that was available and -- and


decide the Strickland question then.


MR. HUTTON:  Justice Scalia, that fits right


into this court's decision with Michael Williams v.


Taylor.  2254(e) allows an evidentiary hearing to be held


in Federal court if it was not the defendant's fault for


failing to develop facts.  That provision would make no


sense if a Federal court couldn't look at new facts not


developed in State court to make a determination under


2254(d) as to whether or not the State court findings were


reasonable or unreasonable.  In other words, Justice --


QUESTION:  Do we have any indication here as to


whose fault it was? 


MR. HUTTON:  Your Honor, there's several

different issues, Justice Souter.  First of all, in State


court, capital defendants were not allowed experts or


investigators until 1995, years after Mr. Cone's first


post-conviction petition.  So, there's an issue about


cause with whether or not he had cause to develop that.


Number two, with the aspects of the Sixth


Amendment claim raised in a second post-conviction


petition, there are issues as to whether the State


procedural bar was clearly established, because Mr. Cone's


case was the very first case where there was a holding


that previous determination acted as a State bar to


developing facts in State court.  All of those issues go


to whether or not Mr. Cone has a right under Michael


Williams v. --


QUESTION:  What facts is it -- what facts is it


-- are they that you sought to develop --


MR. HUTTON:  Chief --


QUESTION:  -- as bearing on the ineffective


assistance claim? 


MR. HUTTON:  Chief Justice, there are several


facts, starting with the deficient performance aspect.  We


know because we were able to issue a subpoena in Federal


court to get John Dice's medical records.  He committed


suicide after the post-conviction hearing.  His own


records show at the time that he testified in post-

conviction, he was suffering from impaired memory,


confused thinking, and had been incompetent to practice


law. 


QUESTION:  well, why -- how does that bear on


whether or not the State court's finding of -- against you


on the Strickland claim was unreasonable? 


MR. HUTTON:  Because, Chief Justice, many of the


findings by the State court relied on the testimony of


John Dice, and just like under the old Townsend v. Sain --


QUESTION:  Well, Townsend against Sain is pretty


well gone. 


MR. HUTTON:  No, Your Honor, but it also comes


into Michael Williams v. Taylor, this Court's 2000 term --


year 2000 opinion, where if it's not -- if we didn't fail


to develop facts in -- in State court that are relevant,


we can develop them in Federal court. 


QUESTION:  What is -- what is the particular


thing, though, because I mean, you've mentioned three


times now that he has some mental problem that led him to


commit suicide.


MR. HUTTON:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  I gather that must have been at least


four or five years after these events. 


MR. HUTTON:  It was --


QUESTION:  He testified at the hearing in 1986.

The trial was in 1982.


MR. HUTTON:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, I've seen many bad


cases of bad representation in death cases that I think is


terrible.  But I have to say, having read through this


record, this doesn't seem to be one of them.  Now, you


obviously think it is. 


So, what is it specifically?  What is it


specifically that -- that you think was absolutely


terrible by way of representation here, other than not


making the closing statement?  I've got that one.  I


understand that.  You've made a major point of that.  But


what are the things that really went wrong in this case?


MR. HUTTON:  Justice Breyer, with respect to


your first question, we're raising the fact that he


committed suicide after the post-conviction testimony so


that -- that raises --


QUESTION:  That does not suggest that four or


five years earlier -- it might suggest a cause of bad


representation, but it doesn't suggest there was the bad


representation.  And my question is what did he do wrong? 


I'm not an experienced trial lawyer.  That's why I put


these questions to you.  I expect my objections will be


overwhelmed by you, but I want you to -- to focus you on


doing it.

 MR. HUTTON:  Justice Breyer, he failed to make a


case for life.  In the penalty phase of a capital trial,


it's like a totally new trial, and a lawyer has one goal. 


It's to mount a case for life, for the jury to have some


reason not to sentence his client to death. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Hutton, may I interrupt you with


this?  And I -- because I think we're all trying to get at


the same thing.  When you get beyond that generality, what


was it that he should have put in that he didn't put in? 


And my understanding was that there were three items that


you thought would be favorable.  One was the Bronze Star. 


One was the fact that this man's brother died when he was


young, and the third was that this man's girlfriend was


murdered.  Am I -- am I right that those are the three


points upon which you thought he was deficient in -- the


lawyer, Dice, was deficient in failing to present


evidence?


MR. HUTTON:  With -- Justice Souter, there are


many cases for life that could have been made.  It is true


that he failed to develop the Bronze Star and failed to


develop that Mr. Cone was a hero, that that is an award


for heroism in combat.  That was never presented to the


jury as a case for life. 


Number --

record that the lawyer might have been fearful about if he


pursued that beyond where he did?


MR. HUTTON:  No, Justice Ginsburg.  And that


also reminds me I'd like to clarify something.  There is


testimony in the post-conviction record at page 158 of the


post-conviction testimony -- it's not in the joint


appendix, unfortunately.  But John Dice did testify that


he would have given his right arm for a Bronze Star, that


that was an award for combat in military service. 


QUESTION:  May I just -- I've looked back at the


opinion, and twice the Sixth Circuit says that they deny


the -- they affirm the dismissal.  They affirm the


dismissal with respect to the conviction.  We now affirm


the denial of this petition with respect to the offense of


-- of conviction.  And if you missed it there, then on the


very last page of this opinion, they say again, we affirm


the district court's refusal to issue a writ of habeas


corpus with respect to the petitioner's conviction.  And


you didn't cross appeal from that. 


MR. HUTTON:  No, Your Honor.  The -- the issues


-- the issue is whether or not counsel was ineffective for


the sentencing phase.  We did not -- the -- we --


QUESTION:  I thought you -- you told me when I


asked you, no, the Sixth Circuit didn't affirm with


respect to the sentence of conviction.  I take from what I

and the only thing that's up now is the sentencing phase.


MR. HUTTON:  Oh, I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.  I


must have misunderstood your question.  The -- the


conviction of guilt was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit and


we did not file a cross petition.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. HUTTON:  Okay.  The -- so, the issues which


we are raising have to do with why Mr. Dice was


ineffective to the point that it amounted to a total


abdication of advocacy in the penalty phase of the


capital --


QUESTION:  Mr. --


QUESTION:  Is the first --


QUESTION:  Can I ask you one question following


up on Justice Souter?  He listed three things.  He said


that you argue he failed to put in.  But I thought the


most significant material that was omitted was the story


of what kind of a person this man was before he went to


Vietnam, which the lawyer said he had investigated and


described in detail at page 62 of the joint appendix. 


Now, did he explain why he didn't put all that evidence


in?


MR. HUTTON:  No.  Your Honor, there were some


references by Mr. Dice's testimony that he thought that

the mother, Valeree Cone, did not make a good witness and


that generally the family members he thought did not make


a good witness. 


QUESTION:  Did that come during the -- had that


come in during the guilt stage?


MR. HUTTON:  Your Honor, he -- when he tried to


introduce evidence in the guilt phase, there were


objections as to relevancy which were sustained by the


court, because the court found that all that was relevant


in the guilt phase was the issue of mental insanity.  So,


all the background to -- was not relevant in that


particular --


QUESTION:  Did the mother testify --


QUESTION:  Mr. Hutton, you -- you think we have


to send -- this conviction and sentence occurred in 1982. 


I am trying to think, you know, what I was like in 1982. 


It's 20 years ago, and you think it has to go back for


further fact finding, presumably back to the court of


appeals and then back to the district court?


MR. HUTTON:  Your Honor, first of all, this case


was filed --


QUESTION:  How -- how old is -- is Mr. Cone?


MR. HUTTON:  Mr. Cone was 33 in 1982, so that


would make him 50 --


QUESTION:  Yes.  Well, he may get a -- a life

sentence by default. 


MR. HUTTON:  Justice Scalia, the -- the fact of


the matter is, though, that Mr. Cone has been trying to


develop these claims.


QUESTION:  No, but when you go back to that,


what is it that you -- that you say should have gone on in


as evidence at the sentencing phase that didn't?  The


Bronze Star.  Justice Stevens mentioned the change in


personality.  Is that something that you say should have


gone in? 


MR. HUTTON:  Your Honor, that should have gone


in.  The fact about the Bronze Star and being developed


what happened in the war should have gone in.  There are


claims about Mr. Dice's --

I mentioned, the -- the death of the sister and the murder

MR. HUTTON:  Yes, Your Honor, because they would


QUESTION:  Okay.  I'm pushing you because your


time is running out.  What else?  Is there anything else?


MR. HUTTON:  Your Honor, those should have gone


in, but more importantly, those should have been woven


into an argument as to why that reasoned moral judgment --

a reasoned moral judgment called for this man not to be


put to death.  And the fact of the matter is the


combination -- we can't piecemeal the no evidence and no


argument.  It's the combined force of both of them.  The


failure to do anything in response to the State's case for


death is what makes this a total abdication of advocacy in


the context of a penalty phase of a capital trial.


So, Your Honors, in preparing for this argument,


I read an article that one of Your Honors wrote several


years ago about how important oral argument was before


this Court and how in many cases this Court -- argument


had affected the minds of members of this Court.  And if


oral argument is so important for members of this Court


who have the benefits of briefs, training, legal training,


the benefits of clerks, how much more important is


argument for a jury that's not trained in the law, that


doesn't have the benefits of briefs, that has to make the


most difficult decision they ever made as to whether


somebody should live or should die?  And how much more


devastating is it when the jury is told they have to weigh


evidence, they hear a case for death, they hear the


prosecutor argue a case for death, and then there's


silence from the defense? 


Your Honor, that amounts to a total failure in


the penalty phase to -- to subject the prosecution's case

to meaningful adversarial testing.  That's why this Court


wrote Cronic, to talk about problems just like this case. 


And Cronic has been sparingly applied by the lower courts.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you.  Thank you,


Mr. Hutton. 


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
