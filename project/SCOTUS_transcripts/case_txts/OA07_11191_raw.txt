CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We’ll hear argument 

next in Case 07-11191, Briscoe v. Virginia. 

(11:40 a.m.) 

Mr. Friedman. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

We ask the Court in this case to take no new 

ground beyond that established just last term in the 

Melendez-Diaz case, but the stakes of this case are 

high.  If the Court were to reverse Melendez-Diaz and 

hold that a State may impose on the defendant the 

burden of calling a prosecution witness to the stand, 

it would severely impair the confrontation right and 

threaten a fundamental transformation in the way 

Anglo-American trials have been conducted for hundreds 

of years. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The State court has 

interpreted their provision to give the defendant the 

choice of subpoenaing the witness or asking the State 

to bring in the witness.  Why is that overruling 

Melendez-Diaz? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Your Honor, the -- the State

courts, since the time of this case -- since the time 

that these cases were tried, raised the possibility of 

asking the -- that the defendant could ask the witness 

to bring -- that the defendant could ask the 

prosecution to bring in the witness.  It doesn't 

really change anything from a straight subpoena 

statute in any -- in either event. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, how is that 

different from a notice statute?  If --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Okay. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we take the statute 

as the State supreme court has read it --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- they say:  In my 

mind, it's a notice statute; tell the prosecutor you 

either want them to call the witness or you subpoena 

the witness.  That's what the State court has told us. 

Whether or not you had notice of that interpretation 

is a separate question. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's separate out the 

two questions. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Okay, fine, fine.  The -- the 

two aspects that Melendez-Diaz said were wrong with 

the subpoena statute are both present in this statute

even as interpreted by the -- by the State supreme 

court.  That is, nothing in Melendez-Diaz -- I'm 

sorry, nothing in the Magruder case -- the opinion 

here suggests that the prosecution would bear the 

burden of calling the witness to the stand.  I think 

the Magruder case, the decision of the State supreme 

court is very explicit and goes in accordance --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that's our first 

question --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That’s --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does the Confrontation 

Clause require, not just the ability to 

cross-examine --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That's right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but an affirmative 

obligation to place the witness on the stand? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That's correct.  That's 

correct. 

--  

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I just ask you one 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes.  Sure. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would swearing the 

witness in and saying to the witness "Is this your 

report?" and the witness saying "Yes" -- what would be 

unconstitutional about that, given our case law that

says that any prior statements by a witness are 

admissible once the witness is on the stand or 

constitutionally admissible once they are on the 

stand? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right.  Right.  The cases 

involve that were California v. Green and United 

States v. Owens.  In both cases, there were questions 

asked of the witness about what happened.  So I do 

believe -- though it hasn't been resolved in this 

Court, I do believe that the prosecution should go 

beyond simply saying "Is this your" --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no.  "Should" is 

a different question than the one I asked. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  No.  I mean, I think the 

Constitution -- I think constitutionally, the -- the 

prosecution would be compelled at least to ask:  What 

is your recollection?  Do you endorse this statement? 

But even if that's not true --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you have anything 

historically or in any case that would suggest that 

that is a constitutional requirement?  I mean, I do 

accept that there is plenty that says you have a right 

to be --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- to confront the

witness. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But what would require 

the prosecutor to actually do more than I just 

suggested?  "Is this your statement?  Is this your lab 

report?" 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Your Honor, so far as I can 

tell, it's hardly ever been tried, for the obvious 

reason that if all the prosecution does is say, "Is 

this it," and not ask a further question of the 

witness --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not terribly 

persuasive.  I don't disagree with you. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right.  It -- well, that’s --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It’s a matter of trial 

tactic, but I'm not talking about trial tactic. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes.  Right.  But I -- but 

it's something that prosecutors don't try because they 

would have to bear the -- the risk.  So part of my 

response is:  Well, let them go ahead and try it if 

they want to. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Bear what risk? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Bear what risk?  What risk? 

Bear what risk?

not even asked to recall.  Bear the cost of putting a 

witness on with no recollection. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, he says, "Is this 

your lab report and do you stand by it?" 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  “And do you stand by it?" --

that's the critical point.  That's going beyond the 

hypothetical, as I understood it from Justice 

Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I see.  So -- okay. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  But -- but --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  I understood the 

hypothetical to be -- to be otherwise, then. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  But -- no, no.  If it's "And 

do you stand by it" --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  -- then that's fine. 

But I do know of a couple of cases involving 

child witnesses where they don't ask -- they put the 

witness on the stand, and they don't ask anything 

about the events at issue.  And in those cases 

there’s -- courts have held that that's -- that’s not 

acceptable.  So --

what difference?  That's because there’s nothing in 

evidence about the incident, correct? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, no.  No, then they 

presented a former statement by the child.  So -- so I 

do think that there is some justification --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that was a --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Those were found -- I 

don't -- were those found as violations of the 

Confrontation Clause? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Those are found to be 

violations of the Confrontation Clause.  The --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or due process? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Confrontation Clause.  State 

v. Rohrich, which is cited in my brief on another 

point, and Warren, an Illinois appellate case from, I 

think, just last term. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's not clear to me what 

your answer to these questions is.  If all the 

prosecution does is call the analyst on the stand and 

admit -- have the analyst provide a foundation for the 

admission of the report, let's say, pursuant to the 

hearsay exception for recorded recollection, and does 

nothing more, would there be a Confrontation Clause 

problem?

MR. FRIEDMAN:  And there’s -- there’s the 

question, “Is this your report?  Do you stand by it?” 

Then -- then I don't think there is a Confrontation 

Clause problem, because -- because the prosecution has 

put the witness on the stand, has asked those 

questions, and then the witness -- and --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What's the difference 

between that situation and the situation in which the 

report is -- is admitted, subject to -- and the 

analyst is available, and the defense can question the 

analyst if the defense wishes to? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, I think -- I think the 

difference is that once you ask the question -- “Do 

you stand by it?” -- then the witness has testified 

one way or another.  And the prosecution, as I say, 

bears the risk that the witness will not testify in 

accordance with the prior statement.  California --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On the past recollection 

recorded, the witness doesn't stand by the statement. 

The witness says:  I made the statement,  have no 

current knowledge; I can't stand by it or not stand by 

it. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That's right.  I take 

California v. Green at its word.  California v. Green 

says and Owen follows up and says that if the witness

does not testify in accordance with the prior 

statement, then the defendant has had some of the --

has had considerable benefit of cross-examination 

already.  So -- so the prosecution has to -- has to 

put the witness through that pace to make sure that 

that happens.  Beyond that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what you 

just said.  Want to say it again? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes.  California v. Green 

says that if the witness testifies inconsistently with 

the prior statement, that the defendant has had the 

benefit of cross-examination in showing the 

inconsistency.  So -- so Justice Alito asked me what’s 

the difference, and I'm saying a difference, one 

difference is, that if the witness does not testify in 

accordance with the prior statement, that's apparent 

to -- that's apparent to the jury.  There are also all 

the practical differences that we emphasize. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are asking us now to 

state something that you admit is in really no 

constitutional case or historical case, that says the 

right to confrontation means that the witness has to 

tell the story, and the form of telling that story has 

to be a verbal recitation; it can't be past recorded 

recollection because you just said they have to tell

the story.  It can't be based on official documents or 

anything else, because it has to be their story.  Am I 

hearing you wrong? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, I don't believe so.  I'm 

saying that the -- that the witness has to take the 

stand, has to -- has to testify live, viva voce, face 

to face, in the time-honored phrases which have always 

governed testimony in an Anglo-American trial.  Then 

the -- I think the witness has to at least be asked 

what happened.  If the witness says, I don't recall, 

then the prior statement may be introduced.  I’m not

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  I’m not asking the Court to 

go beyond anything that has previously been said. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the theory of this? 

I understand in hearsay, which as we have just seen 

demonstrated, is very complicated, filled with all 

kinds of rules --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- some of which I may 

recall and others of which I certainly don't.

Confrontation Clause, I would have thought, would have 

picked out the heart of that.  So we have Sir Walter 

Raleigh and Sir Walter Raleigh says, "Bring in 

witnesses," which they wouldn't.  So why shouldn't we 

say what this clause is about is Sir Walter Raleigh? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, if --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Bring in the witnesses. 

Now, once you bring them in, the defendant can do what 

he wants.  He has had his chance to cross-examine 

them.  End of the matter, and leave the rest up to the 

hearsay law. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  I want to emphasize that the 

Confrontation Clause is about a lot more -- there were 

nearly 200 years of history between Walter Raleigh and 

the Confrontation Clause, and what was established is 

that in an Anglo-American trial witnesses give their 

testimony live, face to face, and Melendez-Diaz 

emphasized last term you can't prove the case via an 

affidavit. 

So -- so it's -- it's the fundamental 

question that -- that Crawford establishes --

fundamental principle that Crawford establishes is 

this is the way witnesses testify in our trials: 

live, in front of the jury, subject to oath and then 

cross-exam.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why -- and -- I trust 

the trial process, and much of your brief was talking 

about that process --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and the fact that 

it's much more effective when the witness tells their 

story and you get a chance to cross-examine than if 

you have to start from the platform of 

cross-examination.  Once a defendant makes it known 

that a -- he's going to cross-examine a lab 

technician, don't you think that in the vast majority 

of cases the prosecutor is going to put that witness 

on? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And if he does or 

doesn't, why shouldn't we leave it to the normal trial 

strategy and practice to leave to that prosecutor the 

burden of non-persuasion, which is what confrontation 

was about? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right.  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which is --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  If -- if the prosecutor is 

certain that the defendant is going to put the witness 

on the stand, then -- then the prosecutor has some 

reason to -- to put the witness on first.  The problem

is that the -- the defunct Virginia statute puts the 

burden on the defendant of bringing the witness in, 

and the defense --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well -- well, I was 

starting from a different proposition than you did --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right.  I'm sorry -- but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- because I think 

that’s a question for your adversaries:  How could you 

have known --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that you should have 

asked the State to bring that witness in? 

But putting that aside --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  But --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- assume we are reading 

it the way the Court has now. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right.  The -- the fact is 

that under the Virginia statute, given -- and as 

interpreted by the Commonwealth, too -- given that the 

defendant has the burden of putting the witness on the 

stand, defendants rarely exercise that right, because 

it's a corrupted right, because it isn't nearly as 

valuable, as I think Your Honor understands, as the 

right to stand up and cross-examine a witness who has 

actually just testified.

I don't think that the right given by the 

Virginia statute is -- the former Virginia statute is 

actually the right to cross-examine.  It's not in form 

cross-examination, and it's not in substance 

cross-examination.  It's a right to make the witness 

the defendant's own, and that's the way -- that's the 

way the statute is -- is worded. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Friedman, one of the 

problems that has been brought up is that this is an 

inordinate expense, and you're wasting the time of the 

analyst.  Do you recognize any economy -- for example, 

that the analyst could testify from the lab, have 

video conferencing, and so the analyst, while the 

prosecutor must call her, can testify from the lab 

instead of coming down to the courthouse? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That -- that is a --

certainly a possibility, at least on consent of the 

defendant, and some States, including my own State of 

Michigan, has been experimenting with that.  And I 

think that's a plausible possibility. 

Now, if the defendant were to insist on --

on live testimony, that is an open -- that's an open 

question as to whether video testimony would be 

acceptable.  This Court some years ago refused to 

transmit to Congress a proposed amendment to Federal

Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the majority in a 

statement by Justice Scalia said there is a virtual 

satisfaction of the confrontation right, not a real 

satisfaction. 

So the matter as to whether it could be done 

without consent hasn't been satisfied -- hasn't been 

determined.  But certainly on consent it could, and in 

many cases I believe the defendants -- that those 

defendants who do want confrontation would be 

perfectly willing to accept video. 

But I do -- I do want to respond also to the 

-- the premise.  I -- I believe that sufficient data 

is now available to show rather clearly that the 

expense is not inordinate. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  How can you say that?  We 

have an amicus brief from 26 States plus the District 

of Columbia arguing exactly the contrary. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes, I  --

JUSTICE ALITO:  They say that there is a 

very substantial category of cases in which defendants 

really have no interest whatsoever in contesting 

either the nature or the quantity of drugs involved, 

but they will refuse to stipulate to those things 

simply for the purpose of putting a financial burden 

on the prosecution, because they know, if they do

that, it may be helpful for them in getting a better 

plea bargain, plus there is a certain risk that the 

analyst will not show up, and they will get the 

benefit of that. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  So, Your Honor, I think that 

what the -- the States' amicus brief shows is that 

there are -- there are a lot of drug prosecutions, and 

there are a lot of drug analyses, and then there is 

this speculation about the type of gamesmanship that 

you have mentioned.  But if we look for hard data, 

there is nothing supporting that. 

So let's look at a couple of jurisdictions 

that have perfectly valid notice-and-demand rules. 

Ohio -- it's less than one appearance per lab analyst 

per month.  That is in the State lab.  Less than one

JUSTICE ALITO:  If this is not a burden on 

these 26 States plus the District of Columbia, why are 

they bothering to make this argument?  Just for 

amusement? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  I’m sure not for amusement. 

I think there’s a certain amount of solidarity.  I’m 

sure that they would rather not have whatever expense 

there is.  But, frankly, I think a large part is that 

they recognize that the defunct Virginia statute is an

impairment to the confrontation right and makes it 

harder for defendants.  It makes -- it makes it less 

likely that the confrontation right is going to -- is 

going to be invoked. 

Let's look at the District of Columbia.  The 

District of Columbia, it's about -- it's about a half 

a person a year in extra expense caused by lab techs 

having to come and testify. 

That's -- that is not a large burden for the 

District of Columbia, and in fact, the District of 

Columbia -- the lab that services the District of 

Columbia has gotten by with five fewer technicians 

than it did before the change. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I assume you've 

picked the best example for you.  D.C. is a small 

place.  You go to a big State, and the lab is not 

always right next door. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Your Honor, I -- I’m just 

little old me, and I just picked what I could get. 

And, frankly, the example I picked was because the 

Solicitor General's brief had data on the District of 

Columbia, so I asked some more questions.  That's why 

I got -- that's why I got the District of Columbia. 

Ohio -- I asked because they are a neighboring State, 

and I was able to get some information.

There are all kinds of categories.  And suppose, in 

your case, this hearsay of business record or --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And how often will you say: 

I understand it's admissible, but I would like as well

technician has left the job and is married and is 

reliving in a distant State, say okay, let's call her. 

And that way the prosecution really cannot present the 

case except at inordinate expense.

I quote Patrick Hagan, who says -- who says:  "The sky 

has not fallen; we can do this very well." 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then there are 

conflicting reports in the newspapers, but I don't 

know. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  It's -- and, of course, there 

can be an adjustment period, but -- but States can 

adjust.  I think the -- the simplest answer to your 

question, Justice Breyer, is the use of depositions, 

and I think prosecutors probably have been underusing 

depositions.  But -- but if a lab tech is about to 

retire and that lab tech has done a test that is about 

to be used, then take the deposition.

special part.  Each of them said --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that it was this or 

that, and in respect to each of those statements, it’s 

this or that.  That is hearsay. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right.  The problem, of 

course, isn't hearsay.  The problem is -- the only 

question is --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, it's no 

confrontation because in this instance the hearsay 

prevents the confrontation. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right.  The -- the 

prosecution has to present the testimony of witnesses. 

It has to present the testimony live.  Depending on 

how the lab is organized -- usually, labs can organize 

so that only one person needs to -- needs to present. 

In any event, of course, the State is 

acknowledging that, if the defendant brings -- demands 

they have to bring in the witnesses, that’s not at 

issue. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Your answer to my question 

is, if a laboratory is so organized so that six or 

seven people perform different steps of the operation,

now explain to me why they don't. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  But even if -- even if they 

are organized in that way, for instance, if one person 

observes all the -- all the procedures, that’s 

sufficient.  Apart from that, as Melendez-Diaz 

indicates, it's up to the -- it's up to the State to 

decide what the evidence they are going to present is, 

whether --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose one person doesn't 

observe all the procedures.  One person prepares the 

sample, another person puts it on the paper, another 

person reads the machine, another person calibrates 

the machine. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes.  Right.  Well, I think 

Melendez-Diaz indicates that it’s up to the State to 

determine what the -- the evidence that’s going to be 

presented, and there may be gaps.  I do want to 

emphasize that this is an issue that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no, no.  The evidence 

is presented, and the test comes out so -- positive, 

so that the gun fires or that it's a drug or that it's 

a DNA sample.  Can the conclusion be presented by one 

witness from the lab, when that witness did not 

observe all of the procedures? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  I think -- I think that there 

probably has to be a witness who has observed the 

procedures.  If I am -- and that's an issue that will 

be presented to the Court, we can be pretty certain. 

I think that issue is entirely orthogonal to the issue 

here because the Commonwealth is acknowledging --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That’s a bit of -- a bit of 

professorship creeping in, I suppose. 

But the Commonwealth is acknowledging that 

they have to bring in witnesses if the -- if the 

defense demands, so this is another issue as to who 

are -- who are the witnesses.  And it’s --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, in your view, it 

wouldn't satisfy the Confrontation Clause if, say, the 

supervisor shows up and said that this is -- this is 

the way the analysts operate and describes the

nothing to do with the issue here.  The issue here is 

-- is the witnesses who are going to testify and how 

much they -- they testify, and I want to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the reason that I ask 

is because floating in the back of my mind is -- is if 

-- (a) does the Confrontation Clause apply? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And if the answer to (a) is 

yes, then are there different kinds of implementation 

rules in different areas where there are other signs 

of security, where there are other reasons for 

thinking it's not bad testimony?  That line is not 

something that’s necessarily workable, and -- but I 

brought it up to try to think about it. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes.  I think -- I think it's 

an interesting question, and it’s question 3 in the 

evidence exam that I am just grading, in fact.  But I 

think that’s an issue that the Court will have to 

resolve. 

And, as I say, my views are what they --

what they are, but if you reject my views on that, it 

doesn't change this case whatsoever. 

What I think is important to recognize is 

how fundamental a transformation in the Anglo-American 

trial is threatened if -- if the Court were to hold

that the prosecution can present an affidavit and 

leave it to the defendant, if he dares, to put the 

witness on the stand. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, does that square with 

where we started out?  We have situation A, where the 

prosecutor calls the lab analyst, and the lab analyst 

says, this is my report, and I stand by it, period. 

Now, it's up to the defense to cross-examine.  That's 

situation A. 

Situation B is the report is admitted 

without the analyst present, but the defense can then 

-- without the analyst on the stand --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But the defense can then 

cross-examine the analyst. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  I wouldn't call that 

cross-exam --

JUSTICE ALITO:  There’s such a slight 

difference between those two situations.  Now, how is 

that a fundamental transformation of the way 

Anglo-American trials are conducted? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  It's fundamental 

transformation because the prosecution can present a 

stack of affidavits, and they wouldn't even have to be 

affidavits.  They could just be signed -- they could

just be statements.  It could present videotapes.  It 

could present audiotapes.  It could craft those and 

rehearse those behind the scene.  It could present 

those to the trial --

JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  Let's just not get 

beyond the facts of this case, where all -- all that 

we are dealing with is a -- an analyst's report 

relating to the -- the nature of the substance that 

was tested and, if it's a controlled substance, the 

amount.  That's it.  It doesn't extend to anything 

else, videotapes or anything more.  There’s such a 

slight difference between those two situations. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  I think there’s an enormous 

difference in -- in impact.  It's an enormous impact, 

as I've emphasized in my brief, because of the 

impairment of the ability to examine. 

I don't believe it's cross-examination.  In 

practice, it is -- if the defendant said, I don't want 

to cross-examine, but I still insist that the witness 

get up on the stand and let's see what the witness can 

do -- and the Commonwealth makes no attempt to 

distinguish between these witnesses and other 

witnesses for what is -- what is satisfactory 

confrontation.  It says:  This is good confrontation. 

He could do it with all witnesses.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McCULLOUGH 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

I think an appropriate place to start would 

be how the Supreme Court of Virginia construed the 

statute and get past that and into the confrontation 

issue. 

The first thing I would note there is that 

the Petitioners simply have not challenged the 

decision of the -- the interpretation of the Supreme 

Court of Virginia that it placed on the statute.  So I 

think, to the extent that they are now, for the first 

time in their reply brief, trying to raise a separate 

due process issue, that the construction of the court 

was so unreasonable that it violates due process, it's 

far too late in the day to do that.  So I think the 

Court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It goes -- that goes to

the waiver question. 

Official 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How did they know at 

trial that they were supposed to say to you:  I don't 

want a subpoena; you bring them in. 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  I think the -- the way the 

Supreme Court of Virginia construed the statute is 

perfectly sensible.  What it says -- and the key 

phrase is on page 2 of our brief -- that "no" --

excuse me -- "such witnesses shall be summoned and 

appear at the cost of the Commonwealth."  And unlike 

some statutes that say the defendant shall subpoena or 

shall summon -- for example, like the Idaho and the 

North Dakota statutes that the Petitioners cite --

they are express in saying it has to be the defendant 

who issues a summons.  This just says "shall be 

summoned." 

In a criminal trial at the time these 

Petitioners were being tried, there were two parties 

that have the authority to issue summons.  One was the 

clerk of court; that is, a defendant would go to the 

court and say:  These are my witnesses; have them 

produced for trial on this date.  And the other was 

the Commonwealth.  So the statute simply doesn't say 

it has to be the Commonwealth, it has to be the

defendant.  It's silent.  The Supreme Court of 

Virginia has a long history of construing statutes in 

a way that obviates a constitutional problem. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're -- you're 

still begging the question.  How -- they did what any 

reasonable defendant would do and say:  I object to 

the admission of this lab report; I have a right under 

the Confrontation Clause to have the -- the lab 

technician here.

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so did the court on 

How did they know that this was a notice­

and-demand statute as opposed to a subpoena statute? 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  I think it was incumbent on 

counsel to raise the issue exactly like counsel for 

the defendant did in the Grant case.  And I think it's 

noteworthy that in the Grant case the -- the motion 

was filed well in advance of trial, on November 2nd, 

2007, before the Supreme Court of Virginia ever 

construed the statute in this fashion.  And so the 

fact that a statute may be susceptible to more than 

one interpretation doesn't obviate the need for

counsel to take the steps that are necessary to 

protect the right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I ask you:  If we 

were to -- how do we articulate a rule, or do we need 

to, that would take care of the fears of your 

adversary that trials would become trials by 

affidavit, that the -- that prosecutors will choose to 

put all witnesses on -- by videotape, by affidavit, by 

deposition, whatever mode they choose except bringing 

them into court -- and forcing defendants then to call 

the witnesses and do a what's -- what I call a 

cold-cross? 

What rule would we announce in this case --

MR. McCULLOUGH:  I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that would avoid --

what constitutional construction of the Confrontation 

Clause would we issue that would protect against that? 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  I think there are several 

constitutional, legal, and practical considerations 

that make this --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no.  Forget the 

practical.  Talk about the legal, constitutional. 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Right.  Constitutionally, 

there are two obstacles to a wholesale type of trial 

system where the prosecution would simply present a

stack of affidavits. 

Official 

The first of those is the Due Process 

Clause, which -- for example, in these child witness 

cases, what a number of courts have held is that it's 

going to inflame the jury against the defendant if a 

videotape is introduced and then the defendant is 

called -- forced to call the witness to the stand. 

And that's simply not the case with these types of 

witness.  So the Due Process Clause itself puts the 

brakes on the type of wholesale at-trial --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're trial witnesses. 

Anything else? 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Another is the fact that 

under the Confrontation Clause, the cross-examination 

has to be effective.  And so if the prosecution on the 

day of trial dumps a series of affidavits on the 

defense, it's going to be pretty difficult for the 

defense to be in a position to effectively 

cross-examine. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, just one or two.  Just 

one or two affidavits.  Or it -- the court has a rule 

you have to provide those affidavits several weeks 

before trial.  That would be okay? 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  I think, under the --

European-type trial, right?  It would be trial by 

affidavit. 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Right.  I don't think the 

Confrontation Clause, in terms of what it's 

historically intended to protect, blocks that 

scenario. 

I think the key to the Confrontation Clause, 

what this Court has said for a long time, turning to 

the history of the clause, is that it's designed to 

protect the reliability of the government's evidence. 

And the way it does that is by subjecting that to the 

crucible of cross-examination, face to face, of live 

witnesses.  And this statute protects exactly that; 

that is, the defendant says he wants the witness there 

--   

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It does more than that.  It 

does more than that.  It is the prosecution that has 

had to place the witness on the stand.  It has not 

been up to the defense to say, oh, no, I object to 

this affidavit, I would like you to bring -- no.  The 

prosecution has to bring in the witness.  That has 

been what the Confrontation Clause has meant. 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  We agree that we have to 

produce the witness for court, but we see little 

constitutional --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, you don't agree with 

that.  You say you don't have to do it unless the 

defendant objects and issue -- gets a subpoena issued. 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Well, we agree that if the 

defendant does provide the notice, as with the notice­

and-demand statute, that it -- that it’s our burden to 

make sure that witness is there.  And if -- as the 

statute provides, the witness has to be summoned and 

appear. 

So this statute has always been strictly 

construed against the prosecution.  If it fails to do 

exactly what the statute requires, that cuts against 

the prosecution.  So the witness does have to appear. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How is that clear from the 

statute? 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How is that clear from the 

statute?  It just says that a subpoena shall issue. 

What if a subpoena issues and nobody comes? 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Right.  And it -- the fact 

that the prosecution -- excuse me, that the statute is 

interpreted strictly against the prosecution comes 

from several decades of jurisprudence from the Supreme 

Court of Virginia, and we cite those cases on page 1 

our brief.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  A strict construction of 

statutes in general, or a strict construction of this 

provision? 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  This particular -- this 

particular statutory scheme.  For example, if the --

19.2-187, the statute that precedes this, says that it 

has to be filed 7 days before the trial.  And if it's 

filed 6 days, forget it, you have to bring in a live 

witness. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm talking about the 

specific issue of the person subpoenaed not appearing. 

Do you have a case? 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  No, I don't have a case --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So we don't really know. 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  -- but I -- but I think the 

answer follows inexorably --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know how -- how 

strict construction gets you to the -- to the result 

that when it is the defendant who has to take the 

initiative to get the person brought in, if the person 

doesn't show up, it's -- it doesn't fall on the 

defendant; it falls on the prosecution.  I don't see 

how strict construction gets you there.

was simply was an application of the holding in the 

Magruder decision.  There the defendant did -- well in 

advance of trial, sent notice to the Commonwealth and 

said, I want the witness there.  The Commonwealth 

didn't get the subpoena out.  So that was the first 

part of that, "shall be summoned."  And the court of 

appeals said you should never have allowed this in, 

without the live witness being present. 

And so what -- although Grant didn't address 

the appear part, the same answer is true; that is, the 

defendant says, I want the witness there; the 

Commonwealth issues a summons, but the witness doesn't 

appear.  It's the same result. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I think that 

underlying this is a fairly simple problem, 

conceptually.  Imagine we have Sir Walter Raleigh at 

trial, and there’s an affidavit for missing witness A 

and witness B and witness C, and they are over in a 

room somewhere, whether they were treated badly or 

not, and they have written these pieces of paper.  In 

they come. 

And Walter Raleigh says:  "Bring me the 

witness."  Now, suppose they had trotted him out, and 

he cross-examined him.  Still, those pieces of paper 

came in, and they weren't cross-examined.  And so what

do we do about that?  They weren't cross-examined, and 

how did they get in here? 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  I think your question goes 

to the very heart of why we have the Confrontation 

Clause.  It wasn't because of this formalistic order 

of proof that our modern trials have.  And -- and one 

thing that makes this case conceptually difficult is 

we are so accustomed to this clean order of 

presentation -- that -- that that's how we have all 

tried our cases, that's how we are used to seeing 

them, but that's not the heart of the Confrontation 

Clause. 

The Confrontation Clause is because, for 

example, the colonists were subject to anonymous --

JUSTICE BREYER:  As I read this statute, it 

does let in that piece of paper. 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  It does.  But --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And so why then, by 

analogy, isn't the statute bad? 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Well, because --

JUSTICE BREYER:  If -- unless you -- unless 

you have some special kind -- I mean, you’d have to 

some special -- specially reliable evidence that sort 

of fell within the Confrontation Clause but not 

totally.  And that's what I -- the more I think about

MR. McCULLOUGH:  I think there are --

JUSTICE BREYERE:  So -- so --

MR. McCULLOUGH:  There are characteristics, 

of course, to this particular type of evidence that 

were debated in this Court's Melendez-Diaz opinion 

that make this procedure certainly more appropriate, 

and one of those is, these -- what -- functionally 

what you are doing when you have this witness on the 

stand is either past recollection recorded or past 

recollection refreshed, because they are doing 

approximately 900 of these certificates a year.  They 

are largely fungible things like -- like crack cocaine 

or powder cocaine.  And so we're miles from the type 

of scenario where --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, to put my chips on 

the table, which you probably understand, I thought 

the reliability of this evidence in the mine run of 

cases was such, and the distance from Sir Walter 

Raleigh was sufficiently great, that it fell outside 

the scope of the Confrontation Clause for those two 

reasons, but mine was a dissenting opinion. 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Right.  I --

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Well, I think, though, even 

-- even going back to the very heart -- the historical 

heart of this clause, the problems for these colonists 

was anonymous accusers and absentee witnesses.  That's 

-- that's why -- they were enraged because of this 

deeply unfair trial procedure.  It wasn't because, for 

example, a harbor master might be called in and 

records of what ships came in for these colonists who 

were in the vice admiralty courts, and some paper is 

introduced about what ships came in, and then they get 

an opportunity to cross-examine them before the 

prosecution has asked any questions of the -- the 

harbor master. 

That's not the problem, that the 

Confrontation -- Confrontation Clause --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the problem you 

describe, the hearsay rule would have solved that 

alone, wouldn't it?

we agree with this -- is what this Court has said for 

a long time, a face-to-face encounter with a witness 

who is cross-examined face to face, under oath. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it doesn't have to 

happen in the prosecutor's case.  In other words, the 

prosecutor puts in the reports and rests.  And the 

defendant says, there wasn't sufficient evidence; I 

move to dismiss the case.  It couldn't be dismissed at 

that point.  The prosecutor would prove its case by 

the affidavit alone. 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  Right.  But first -- a 

couple points in response. 

First of all, the statute doesn't say at 

what point the defendant gets to treat this witness as 

an adverse witness.  It just says the report comes in, 

and then the defendant can call the witness as an 

adverse witness.  And the Supreme Court of Virginia 

deliberately left the question of the order of proof 

unresolved, because it viewed those things as a due 

process issue.  So I don't think it's axiomatic under 

the statute, although it's possible, that the 

defendant would conduct a cross-examination during his 

case. 

But -- but beyond that, the Confrontation 

Clause isn't designed to constitutionalize Federal

The defendant could still -- in Virginia procedure, 

it's a motion to strike.  The defendant could still

summoned and appear.  So there’s a requirement of 

appearance.  And if the defendant asks the prosecutor 

to summon the witness, the witness then has to appear. 

And going -- and we cite some of these cases, again on 

page 1 of our brief. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't say what the 

consequence of his not appearing is.  That the -- that 

the written testimony is -- stands and is admitted,

from this line of cases, Justice Scalia, that if the

the Commonwealth doesn't do exactly what the statute 

requires, a live witness -- or excuse me, the 

certificate does not come in without the live witness. 

Just like, if you don't -- the statute says file 7

answers that.  The witness has to appear.  The statute 

says shall be summoned, and the requirement is that 

the witness appear.  If the witness does not appear --

to appear.  But what happens if he doesn't appear?

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, we’re not going in

that the witness shall appear as resolving what 

happens when he doesn't, and it doesn't resolve that. 

It just says he must appear.  And if he doesn't appear, 

what happens? 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  If he doesn't appear, the 

Commonwealth has failed to do what the statute 

requires, which is to make sure the witness appears. 

And if the Commonwealth fails to do exactly what the 

statute requires, it must -- it cannot rely on a piece 

of paper. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I don't see the 

statute requiring that.  It requires that of the 

witness, he shall appear. 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  And -- I mean, to the 

extent there’s -- there’s any question about that, I 

don't think it's a matter that this Court should 

resolve in the first instance.  I think it would be a 

matter of remand to the Supreme Court of Virginia to 

determine what -- what the statute requires in that 

instance.

we -- of course, we've repealed this statute.  This 

Court signaled in Melendez-Diaz what a safe harbor 

was, with notice and demand, and so we went there. 

And what we have seen under our new statute 

is rampant demands for the witness to appear, followed 

by:  Oh, well, he's here; I’ll stipulate.  Or no 

questions of the witness.  So our experience under 

this old statute compared to our new one is that we 

had far more -- or far less under our old statute of 

this sort of tactical demands for confrontation.

brief of -- of the Petitioners mentions that -- that 

the same thing, a spike occurred in other 

jurisdictions after Melendez-Diaz, but then the spike 

went down, after -- after 6 months or a short period. 

MR. McCULLOUGH:  The spike has plateaued 

somewhat in Virginia, but we are still seeing 

extensive gamesmanship.  And I think --

Virginia that -- or what is peculiar about Michigan or

focused statute like this one more blatantly exposes 

that type of gamesmanship and, therefore, may have a 

better deterrent value, as opposed to a garden variety 

statute. 

I do want to just say, really briefly, that 

the practical concerns, even if they are not 

constitutional concerns, are very important because 

the prosecution always bears the burden of persuasion, 

and a live witness is always more compelling than a 

piece of paper.

AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING RESPONDENT 

MS. KRUGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

A State adequately safeguards the 

confrontation right recognized in Melendez-Diaz when 

it guarantees that it will, on the defendant's 

request, bring the analyst into court for face-to-face 

confrontation and cross-examination at trial. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not what we said in 

Melendez-Diaz, unfortunately. 

MS. KRUGER:  Well, Melendez-Diaz --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We said the following: 

“More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause imposes 

a burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses, 

not on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses 

into court.  Its value to the defendant is not 

replaced by a system in which the prosecution presents 

its evidence via ex parte affidavits and waits for the

defendant to subpoena the affiants, if he chooses.” 

So you are asking us to overrule that --

that statement? 

MS. KRUGER:  No, Justice Scalia, not at all. 

We believe that a State complies with that very rule 

from Melendez-Diaz when it ensures that the analyst is 

present in court to submit to cross-examination, which 

is the core of the confrontation right.  This Court 

affirmed in its decision --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  He's present only if the 

defendant asks for him, right? 

MS. KRUGER:  That's right, and that's --

that’s because --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's exactly what 

this addressed.  It's not -- it's not replaced by a 

system in which the prosecution presents its evidence 

by -- and waits for the defendant to subpoena the 

affiants if he chooses. 

MS. KRUGER:  This Court has recognized that 

the confrontation right is designed to achieve a 

particular purpose, and that is to ensure that the 

government's evidence is subject to adversarial 

testing at trial. 

It is ultimately up to the defendant in 

every case to decide, no matter how the prosecution

presents its evidence on direct, whether or not it 

wants to confront the witness and submit that 

witness's testimony to adversarial testing --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That may be.  It's a 

perfectly reasonable argument.  I just object to your 

saying that it doesn't contradict Melendez-Diaz. 

MS. KRUGER:  I think it would be surprising 

to discover that Melendez-Diaz went quite so far. 

This Court has never before recognized a dimension of 

the Confrontation Clause that would govern the manner 

in which the prosecution presents its evidence, except 

for the rule that it affirmed it in Crawford, which is 

that so long as the government ensures that the 

witness is available for cross-examination at trial, 

the Confrontation Clause places no constraints on the 

government's use of prior testimony or statements. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So the 

statement, the sentence in this opinion, that, in your 

opinion, would have the effect of limiting 

Melendez-Diaz without overruling it, what is that 

statement? 

MS. KRUGER:  I think the statement is it 

requires only that the Court reaffirm what it already 

said in Crawford, in the context of the lab analyst 

testimony at issue in this case, which is, again, when

the analyst is available for cross-examination at 

trial, the government has complied with what the 

Confrontation Clause demands. 

It has provided a constitutionally 

sufficient opportunity for the defendants to submit 

that analyst's findings to adversarial testing --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it just doesn't --

doesn't apply just to analysts, right?  I mean, is 

there anything peculiar about analysts?  Would it not 

exist for any other witness? 

MS. KRUGER:  Well, our principal submission 

is that the Confrontation Clause provides, in every 

case, an opportunity for effective cross-examination. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay. 

MS. KRUGER:  And there may be independent 

constraints on the manner in which the prosecution 

presents its evidence under the laws of evidence in 

the jurisdiction because of the government's need to 

satisfy its burden of proof and ensure a fundamentally 

fair trial under the Due Process Clause. 

To the extent that the Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what --

is that a yes or a no? 

MS. KRUGER:  Well, it is to say that 

Confrontation Clause is not what prohibits that

practice.  What prohibits that practice are other 

equally effective sources in the law --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So as far as the 

Confrontation Clause is concerned, this would apply to 

other witnesses as well? 

MS. KRUGER:  I think that that’s right, but 

even if the Court were to disagree with that 

submission, this Court could rely on the kinds of 

distinctions that it has drawn in other cases, like 

Inadi or like White v. Illinois, which recognized that 

there is a class of hearsay evidence that’s not simply 

a weaker substitute for live testimony at trial, that 

has independent, probative significance that makes it 

somewhat irrelevant whether or not the court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Indicia of reliability --

you want us to go back to that?  Is that --

(Laughter.) 

MS. KRUGER:  No, it's not a question of the 

reliability.  What Crawford did was replace a system 

in which hearsay evidence and its admissibility was 

dependent on reliability with one in which the 

touchstone is an opportunity for cross-examination. 

And it's precisely in response to that point 

that Crawford, again, reaffirmed the rule that it 

first announced in Green, that so long as the

out-of-court declarant is present at trial to explain 

or defend his out-of-court statements, the 

Confrontation Clause is satisfied. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What if it doesn't quite 

work, that the Confrontation Clause seems to be 

expanding, just with the opportunity for 

cross-examination creating all kinds of incursions 

into areas where it’s not necessary for fairness 

purposes? 

Then does it make sense to say -- hey, 

unfortunately, to say that the only workable system is 

that you have a system which has exactly the 

confrontation point, but indicia of reliability do 

have an impact as to what the implications of the 

Confrontation Clause violation are, in terms of 

practical trial necessity. 

MS. KRUGER:  But --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, there we are, 

accepting the warnings of the dissenters in Crawford. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. KRUGER:  I don't think that the 

touchstone of this Court's analysis need return to the 

now discredited Ohio v. Roberts regime. 

It's simply a practical point.  To the 

extent the Petitioners are arguing that their

opportunity to confront and to cross-examine is 

constitutionally inadequate merely because the 

prosecution hasn't guaranteed that it would call the 

witness to the stand first, I think the court can take 

due account of the fact that that is not necessarily 

so. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what about Raleigh's 

witnesses -- you know, the hypothetical I gave you, 

for the heart of the matter, the heart of the matter, 

and they stick it in their affidavits, and you say, 

oh, don't worry, don't worry, you can cross-examine 

them later in the trial. 

MS. KRUGER:  I think, to the extent that the 

Court were otherwise inclined to invent a new body of 

Confrontation Clause jurisprudence to govern the 

manner in which the prosecution puts on its witnesses 

and questions them, this isn't the appropriate case to 

do it because, as we have seen from Petitioners’ 

submission earlier this morning, there is no 

substantive difference from a defendant's 

perspective --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you -- are you 

suggesting or are you saying even a trial by affidavit 

is okay under the Confrontation Clause?  Is that your 

position?

MS. KRUGER:  Our principal submission is 

that the Confrontation Clause allows the government to 

rely on affidavits, so long as it bring the affiants 

into court, so that the defendant can ask whatever 

questions --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you are absolutely 

saying that, under the Confrontation Clause, trial by 

affidavit of any witness would be okay. 

MS. KRUGER:  That is our principal --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So are you -- are you 

then saying that there is some other constitutional 

limit to that choice, outside of the Confrontation 

Clause?  And if you are, what would be that other 

constitutional limit? 

MS. KRUGER:  We do think that there are 

constitutional limits in the Due Process Clause, and 

it's guaranteeing the right to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, how many hundreds of 

cases will it take to identify those limits under that 

very clear Due Process Clause? 

(Laughter.) 

MS. KRUGER:  Well, it's -- it’s somewhat of 

a difficult question to answer because this is not a 

question that arises particularly frequently.  The 

laws of evidence, as a general matter, express a

strong preference for the prosecution to present its 

evidence through live testimony --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't we want clear rules 

for the presentation?  Don't we want clear rules, not 

gambling on what the Supreme Court will say about due 

process? 

MS. KRUGER:  I think that it's difficult to 

imagine that a new-found constitutional rule that 

would require the prosecution to present its evidence 

in a certain way in every case would lead to that sort 

of clarity.  It would, if anything, create --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Ms. Kruger, can I just ask 

this question?  I just want to be sure.  Supposing you 

have an eyewitness.  Can you follow the same procedure 

that you recommend for the scientific witness here --

and for an eyewitness? 

MS. KRUGER:  We think that you could, so 

long as the defendant has an adequate opportunity to 

cross-examine that eye witness about the testimonial 

statement. 

But even if you disagreed with that, we 

think that the Court can take due account of the fact 

that there is a significant difference between the 

kind of testimony that an eyewitness provides and the 

kind of testimony that a forensic analyst provides.

The forensic analyst's lab report is not 

merely a weaker substitute for live testimony.  It is, 

in fact, I think, as we see by the relative 

infrequency with which analysts were called into court 

before Melendez-Diaz, something that has been seen to 

have equal value, regardless of the manner in which 

it’s presented. 

And, for that reason, we think that, in 

order to decide this case, all this Court needs to 

decide is that, in the context of forensic lab 

analysts, what the Court said in Crawford still 

stands, so long as the government presents the analyst 

at trial for face-to-face confrontation and 

cross-examination. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why do we have to 

say anything in this case?  Why is this case here 

except as an opportunity to upset Melendez-Diaz? 

MS. KRUGER:  I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  This Virginia statute no 

longer exists, does it?  So we are pronouncing on the 

validity of a Virginia statute that is now gone, 

right?  They have adopted a statute that complies 

completely with Melendez-Diaz. 

MS. KRUGER:  That's true, and I think that 

that's because Virginia was unwilling to stake the

on the outcome of a case.  But this --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not criticizing 

Virginia; I'm criticizing us for taking the case. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. KRUGER:  I think that this -- this case 

presents, I think, an important opportunity for the 

Court to provide guidance to States that are currently 

grappling with how to respond to the practical 

problems that have been presented in the wake of 

Melendez-Diaz. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So do we say to them, 

contrary to what Melendez-Diaz is, that subpoena 

statutes -- when you read the statute, it says the 

defendant has to subpoena the witness.  On its -- on 

the face of this statute, without the Commonwealth 

court's gloss on it --

MS. KRUGER:  I don't mean to quibble, 

Justice Sotomayor, but the statute does not in fact on 

its face say the defendant must subpoena.  It says the 

witness shall be summoned.  But I think to the extent 

that you had any questions about whether or not the 

Commonwealth's interpretation of that language were 

correct, the appropriate course would be to remand to 

the Virginia Supreme Court to allow them to address

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

This is not a notice-and-demand statute.  It 

does not even provide notice to the defendant unless 

he asks for it ahead of time.  It doesn't give any 

deadline as to when he should make a demand or take 

any other action.  It just says that -- and I invite 

the Court's attention to the language of the 

statute -- it says that the defendant may cause the 

witness to be summoned. 

There’s no -- there’s no deadline.  It 

doesn't put the burden of no-shows on the prosecution. 

It's the defendant's witness, and it clearly doesn't 

call -- it doesn't provide that the prosecution should 

call the -- the witness.  Virginia --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the -- just 

the first one, the no-notice problem, that's kind of 

silly, isn't it?  Because if you are being prosecuted

for 50 grams of crack cocaine, you can expect the 

government is going to try to prove that. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That's likely, of course. 

But the fact is Virginia knows how to write a good 

notice-and-demand statute and has done it, and 

contrast the -- the new statute, which gives 28 days 

notice.  It's -- it's very glaring.  If Virginia 

wanted to write a notice-and-demand statute before, it 

could have. 

Now, I think I can explain what’s different 

about Virginia.  And what happened is after the --

after the defendants' -- after the defendants' trials 

-- let me say, after the defendants' trials, the --

the prosecution is saying, you could have subpoenaed. 

And they said this isn't testimony.  Okay?  They were 

wrong on both of those counts. 

After the defendants' trials, in a case 

called Brooks, the -- the Virginia Court of Appeals 

suggested that the defendant could ask the prosecution 

to bring the witness in.  Many defendants did that, 

including Grant, the defendant on whom -- in the case 

on whom the Commonwealth relies so heavily. 

The prosecution ignored those requests.  It 

was still taking the view that this is not -- this is 

not testimonial.  Up until the moment that this Court

decided Melendez-Diaz, the Commonwealth in Virginia 

in -- in Grant said, we don't have to bring the 

witness in; the witness -- the defendant should 

subpoena the witness if he wants. 

No court has ever held -- no court has ever 

held in Virginia that the prosecution bears the risk 

of -- of no-shows. 

Now, the Commonwealth and the United States 

suggest:  Oh, it's okay to -- to transform the way 

trials are conducted by allowing the prosecution to 

present affidavits because you can backfill with the 

Due Process Clause.  I think that goes against 

decisions of this Court that say when there’s a 

specific right addressed to a particular situation, we 

rely on that, not on the Due Process Clause. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But I take it your position 

is it wouldn't matter.  If the -- if Virginia said 

that the -- the Commonwealth bears the risk of a 

no-show, that wouldn't make any difference? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That would -- that would not 

be enough, no.  It's enough -- it's enough --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So we have to assume that 

that's the case. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, that's -- that's one 

problem.  The no-show.  But --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, would you like us --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  -- but there are two -- they 

are both problems. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you like us to grant, 

vacate, and remand in this case and say because it's 

unclear who has the risk of a no-show? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, no, no, Your --

JUSTICE ALITO:  And then Supreme Court of 

Virginia on remand could decide whether in fact the --

the prosecution bore that risk? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, Your Honor, because it's 

sufficient that the statute is very clear and the 

Commonwealth doesn't deny that it's the defendant's 

burden under the statute to call the witness to the 

stand.  So whatever the no-show issue, however that 

might stand under State law, what Melendez-Diaz called 

the more fundamental problem, which is that the 

statute imposes on the defense the burden of calling a 

witness to the stand, is clearly provided for in this 

statute.  So there's no reason --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think Melendez-Diaz 

addressed the question of the order of proof?  Where 

did it address that? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  I don't think this is a 

question of order of proof.  This is a question of who

puts the witness on the stand.  Melendez addressed 

that very explicitly in part III-E and said that an 

affidavit doesn't do, that the prosecution has to 

present prosecution witnesses. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So is the proper solution 

to grant, vacate, and remand in light of 

Melendez-Diaz? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  May -- may I respond to that? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Thank you. 

Your Honor, I think that the -- the proper 

response here is the Court has taken the case; there 

is enough without any -- resolving any ambiguities of 

the Virginia statute to say that the -- this procedure 

is unconstitutional, because it imposes -- even 

without worrying about the no-show point, it imposes 

upon the defendant the burden of putting the witness 

on the stand.  Given that all these States and the 

United States are contesting that this procedure is 

acceptable, I think it’s proper for the Court to say 

right now that it -- that it is not. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
