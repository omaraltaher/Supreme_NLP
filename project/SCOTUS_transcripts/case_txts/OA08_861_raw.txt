CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-861, Free 

Enterprise Fund and Beckstead and Watts v. The Public 

Company Accounting Oversight Board. 

Mr. Carvin. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. CARVIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The board is unique among Federal regulatory 

agencies in that the President can neither appoint nor 

remove its members, nor does he have any ability to 

designate the chairman or review the work product, so he 

is stripped of the traditional means of control that he 

has over the traditional independent agencies. 

On the other side of the balancing test, 

Congress provided no reason for stripping him of these 

traditional means of control. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why do you call it an 

independent regulatory agency?  I mean, Congress wanted 

it to be independent of the profession.  That much is 

clear.  It didn't want it to be independent of the SEC, 

so why are you characterizing it as an independent

regulatory agency? 

Official 

MR. CARVIN:  Justice Ginsburg, by making it 

public, it made it free of the accounting profession. 

So then the next question is:  Why didn't they have the 

same relationship between this agency and the President 

that the FCC and SEC have? 

And, in those instances, the President can 

appoint and remove the members.  Now, why didn't they do 

that here? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the --

MR. CARVIN:  There was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The SEC doesn't have 

another overseer.  I mean, the SEC is set up like the 

FCC, the other independent regulatory commissions, but 

this is a board that has a relationship with the SEC, 

where it can't do anything that doesn't have the SEC's 

approval. 

MR. CARVIN:  There is a buffer between the 

President and the board, and that's called the SEC, and 

the board can do many things without the approval of the 

SEC.  Most notably, it can conduct inspections and 

investigations.  There is no statutory --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It can't even issue a 

subpoena without the SEC's approval. 

MR. CARVIN:  It actually can collect

information from anyone associated with the people they 

regulate, the auditing committees.  If it seeks to get a 

subpoena from someone outside -- if it seeks information 

from someone outside --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the SEC really could 

stop anything? 

MR. CARVIN:  It cannot, for example, stop 

what happened to the Petitioners here.  There is no 

mechanism in the statute, in any way, shape, or form, 

for the SEC to stop an inspection or investigation as it 

is ongoing. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What happened to the 

Petitioners here?  I think, if you were challenging what 

happened to the Petitioners here, certainly it would be 

a question of how you would have to do that.  You 

ordinarily go through the internal proceedings.  But 

here you are bringing a facial challenge and you say, 

never mind any particular proceedings; the whole thing 

is no good. 

MR. CARVIN:  No, no, and I'm dealing with 

the inspections issue at large, not for -- for 

Petitioner or for anyone else, there is no mechanism --

no existing mechanism for the SEC, in any way, to say 

stop the investigation.  Equally important --

mechanism," could the SEC adopt a rule that would give 

the SEC authority to -- to stop it? 

MR. CARVIN:  No, it couldn't, and -- but I 

think the main point is, Your Honor, it hasn't, and 

since it hasn't, it doesn't have that authority now. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I’m --

MR. CARVIN:  But I can tell you --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure that's the 

main point.  I think the main -- the main point is 

whether the FCC could stop it -- the SEC could stop it 

if it wanted to. 

MR. CARVIN:  Yes, and right now it cannot, 

and that's because --

rule? 

MR. CARVIN:  Yes, it cannot issue such a 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It cannot issue such a 

MR. CARVIN:  Absolutely not. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not? 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, the provision they point 

to, 7217(d)(1), says it can relieve the board of 

responsibility, but there is nothing in the statute that

gives the SEC to conduct the board's statutory duties. 

For example, it couldn't say, we will now 

collect the fees that are going to the board, we will 

now conduct the registration that’s going to the board. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why -- why isn't this 

simply relieving the board of responsibility, saying, 

you no longer have responsibility for -- for 

investigation and inspection in these areas? 

MR. CARVIN:  But that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They could do that, 

couldn't they? 

MR. CARVIN:  No, it can't.  But even if it 

could, my major point is it can’t --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, let's talk about 

whether it can't or not.  Why can't it? 

MR. CARVIN:  All right.  If you turn to 39 

and 40a of the board's appendix, at the back of the red 

brief, the board's brief, it walks you through the 

statutes we have been talking about. 

And at the bottom of 39a, that's 7217(d)(1), 

and that’s where it says it can relieve the board of 

responsibilities.  And I have two points on that. 

One is there’s nothing in here that gives 

the SEC the power to assume the responsibility.  It 

simply says the board need not comply with that

obligation. 

Official 

My second point is:  This doesn't stop the 

board from doing something.  If I relieve my associate 

of the responsibility to give me a brief tomorrow, I 

haven't told him he can't do it.  If I want to impose a 

limitation on him, if I want to say stop, I have to 

enclose a limitation.  And if you will turn to the very 

next page --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't -- don't you think 

that's what it means, though, realistically? 

MR. CARVIN:  You know, Your Honor, I think 

that would be --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  When you no longer have 

responsibility to perform a government -- governmental 

act, you no longer have authority to perform it. 

MR. CARVIN:  If you viewed it in isolation, 

that would be an arguable principle.  But if you turn to 

the next page, 40a, you see a very specific provision in 

the statute that talks about how they can impose 

limitations on the board. 

And this is when they want to censure --

impose limitations upon the activities, functions, and 

operations of the board.  And what do they need to do? 

They have to have a hearing that the board has violated 

or is unable to comply with any provision of this Act or

without reasonable justification or excuse. 

So Congress has established very serious 

barriers to the SEC even limiting the board's 

responsibilities. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, they don't have to --

they can't issue a subpoena without the board's 

approval, I take it -- the commission's approval. 

MR. CARVIN:  They have very serious 

information-gathering powers totally distinct from the 

board. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What? 

MR. CARVIN:  Any -- any person who is a 

registered association or anyone who is associated with 

them has to provide documents, witness testimony, wholly 

apart from a subpoena, so anyone who is within the 

regulatory --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Or what? 

MR. CARVIN:  Or they will suffer the 

sanctions that are listed in the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And the commission can't 

change the sanctions? 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, not -- obviously the 

commission can review the sanctions.  But the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And it can't -- it can't 

pass a rule saying, we don't want you to do that?

MR. CARVIN:  Well, sanctions of course are 

done with order.  They get to review the sanctions 

after the board has done it.  I'm talk about the 

prosecutorial, investigative techniques --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So as far as -- if the 

company was ever certain it was right and that the 

Accounting Board was out of control, completely wrong, 

the company would just say:  I'm not complying --

MR. CARVIN: 

 
Well -- but --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- fine, do what you want. 

MR. CARVIN:  But --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then at that moment, 

the group that would decide whether they were right or 

the board was right would be the commission; is that 

right? 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, I don't think there ever 

would be a dispute about whether or not they would have 

access to their documents and their testimony, because 

it's written right in the statute --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It says you don’t -- you 

can get it even without a subpoena? 

MR. CARVIN:  Yes, absolutely. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where does it say that?  Or 

I'll take your word for it.  I’ll look it up.

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want to delay you, 

so forget it.  I’ll look it up later. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What happens to the 

information that the board obtains?  Can the board go 

public with that --

MR. CARVIN:  I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- or is it all 

confidential? 

MR. CARVIN:  I think there are 

certain confidentiality restrictions as part of their 

investigative and inspection thing.  It's -- it’s the 

normal kind of inspection, where you go through the 

investigation and they would review the various 

documents. 

And my -- but my basic point is that that is 

a very serious burden on American citizens.  That is 

something that is totally outside the SEC's control. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the burden of time 

of compliance? 

MR. CARVIN:  I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The burden is because it's 

difficult and expensive to comply? 

MR. CARVIN:  That would be one.  Number two 

-- and I think probably more important -- since the SEC 

doesn't review it, this board was created to make sure

that there was no more Enrons.  So let's look at it from 

the other perspective.  Let's say the board was 

negligent or sloppy in ferreting out the kind of 

auditing standards and abuses that the statute was 

enacted to do.  The SEC would have no way of knowing 

that, no way of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No -- but I'm -- I’m 

talking about the harm to your client and to the --

those similarly situated. 

MR. CARVIN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There’s the cost of 

compliance.  What other harms or dangers or risks are 

inherent in the power of the board unmonitored, 

unchecked by the SEC, to investigate? 

MR. CARVIN:  You’re right, Your Honor.  The 

burden here is the burden that Mr. Olson suffered in 

Morrison v. Olson.  He was never indicted.  There was 

never any sanctions subject to review.  But he was 

subject to a burdensome investigation and that is the 

burden that affects American citizens that is beyond the 

review of the SEC. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I've got one thing on 

my list.  I'm looking to what they control, can't 

control -- the commission.  And so far I've written that 

in your view the commission can investigate people

about it, okay?  That's one. 

MR. CARVIN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what's two? 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, I think that that is the 

main point. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So we only have one 

on our list. 

MR. CARVIN:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

MR. CARVIN:  But I do want to emphasize that 

–-

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not saying it's good or 

bad.  I just want to be sure I have a complete list. 

MR. CARVIN:  If I might elaborate slightly, 

Justice Breyer, I think it's important to understand 

that they have the ability to inspect foreign auditing 

firms, and the Cato Institute filed a brief that 

described the adverse reaction of the 27 countries where 

they are currently exercising this inspection power 

abroad.  That is totally beyond the control of the 

President, obviously, as well as the SEC, to say how 

these -- how these inspections and investigations are 

going.  The --

the Attorney General --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- what is the 

difference between what you are talking about and an 

employer who says:  Look, I can't stick my nose in every 

bit of business that goes on in my office because that's 

impossible; otherwise I’d be doing all the work and 

I just humanly can't.  I'm delegating to you the 

responsibility to do X, Y, and Z according to these 

rules of conduct. 

MR. CARVIN:  There are three fundamental 

differences, Justice --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the difference 

between that and this scheme? 

MR. CARVIN:  In your hypothetical, the 

principal has exactly the same powers as the 

subordinate.  Here the subordinate has statutory duties 

and responsibilities totally distinct from what the SEC 

can do.  In addition to inspections, they can --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well -- let's break down 

each part of your argument, please.  You are suggesting 

that Congress doesn't have the power to determine that a 

particular principal or agent of the government doesn't 

have certain responsibilities? 

MR. CARVIN:  No, obviously they do.  And

what I’m -- you were asking for -- I'm now trying to 

describe the relationship between the SEC and the board, 

and the one difference between the normal employer-

employee relationship is that the board has statutory 

authority wholly distinct from the principal. 

Number two, if that subordinate didn't do 

things the way the principal wanted in the employment 

situation, the principal could fire the subordinate. 

When can the SEC fire the board in these circumstances? 

Only when they have committed gross abuses and after 

notice and opportunity for a hearing. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And if you have a statute 

that says each Department -- Commerce, Justice -- the 

Attorney General of the United States or the secretary 

shall appoint an inspector general who will in fact 

inspect and find ethics violations and that office -- he 

cannot be removed from that office without cause.  In 

your view, that's all -- and it would be 

unconstitutional. 

MR. CARVIN:  No, no.  In the Interior 

Department, those are of course the President's alter 

egos --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Well, why?  What's 

the difference? 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, two differences.  One is

the -- the Secretary of the Interior is the President's 

alter ego, and so, therefore, the President --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So you are saying that 

the -- the chairman of the SEC does not under the 

Constitution have the authority or the SEC does not have 

the authority to appoint individuals who cannot be 

removed without cause? 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, I think there is two 

points. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Or -- or you might 

be saying they do not have the authority to appoint 

inferior officers of the United States.  I don't know 

why they wouldn't have that authority if the Secretary 

of the Interior has that authority. 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, because Freytag made it 

clear that there’s a difference between an independent 

agency, like the Tax Court.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What's an independent 

agency? 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, in that case was an 

independent agency in the Executive Branch --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what is an 

independent agency? 

MR. CARVIN:  One that is not subject to the 

President's plenary control.

serious removal restrictions on the President's ability 

to control the SEC. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you just --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The SEC.  What -- what 

restrictions?  Because, interestingly enough, my law 

clerks have been unable to find any statutory provision 

that says that the President of the United States can 

remove an SEC commissioner only for cause.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think the 

government will think it has achieved a great victory if 

it comes out of this with the proposition that the SEC 

is not an independent regulatory agency.  And I don't 

think the government is arguing that position.

position.

MR. CARVIN:  There is --

Would you refer me to that citation?  Because we

is no removal provision.  Under this Court's precedent 

in Wiener, if there is a term, you need to look at the 

function of the agency.  There was no removal 

restriction in Wiener.

MR. CARVIN:  The Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that both sides 

agreed that there is no statute, everybody agrees to 

that.  But I thought that the government, just as your 

side, agreed that the President could dismiss an SEC 

commissioner for cause. 

MR. CARVIN:  Yes, with -- pursuant -- yes, 

for cause, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though there's no 

statute that says anything either way. 

MR. CARVIN:  And the reason we --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  For cause would be short 

of the 5-year term. 

MR. CARVIN:  The reason we infer "for cause" 

is because it was modeled after the FTC, and under 

Wiener, you need to look at function of the agency to 

determine the President's removal authority, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  "For cause" doesn't mean 

for failure to obey the President's instructions, does 

it? 

MR. CARVIN:  Not under Humphrey's Executor, 

which made it quite clear that the President had no --

independent regulatory agency, because it's not subject

to presidential control. 

MR. CARVIN:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't agree with that, but 

I mean, you do agree.  I thought an independent agency 

is a function of a number of different things: where 

it is on the chart, what people's customs have grown up 

to, expectations about it -­

MR. CARVIN:  And I will --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- what the President might 

expect he can do or not.  But all those things are not 

what I'd call hard law.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well but if it's not hard 

law, then I wonder. 

MR. CARVIN:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, that's why I asked 

the question.  It's not what I have the answer to. 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, if Your Honor wants to 

infer at-will removal of the SEC, that would be 

effectively overruling Humphrey's Executor.  And if you 

want to make a --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There was a provision, 

which we know, that said the President cannot remove an 

FTC commissioner but for cause.  Have I been wrong on 

that all those years? 

MR. CARVIN:  No, you've been entirely right, 

but Humphrey's Executor didn’t focus on the removal 

provision.  It said that that removal provision was 

constitutional, and the reason it was constitutional was 

because you could make executive actors separate from 

the chief executive.  The SEC, like the FCC, has always 

been lumped in with the FTC in terms of that.  If this 

Court wants to say that -- that those people are subject 

to the President's plenary --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I’d love to say that. 

That would be wonderful. 

MR. CARVIN:  I'm not going to stand in your 

way, because that would obviously --

(Laughter.) 

MR. CARVIN:  That would obviously render the 

board unconstitutional.  I think the key point here –-

unconstitutional?

an inferior officer, which inferior officer can be 

removed only for cause -- I mean, my goodness -- I can 

-- there are lots of shapes and sizes.  I can't imagine 

what would be unconstitutional about that.  What? 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, Your Honor, if the 

President called up the head of the SEC and said, I want 

you to seek sanctions against the chairman of Exxon, 

under the traditional understanding of Humphrey's 

Executor the SEC commissioner would not be beholden to 

follow the President's direction. 

The same would be true if he called him up 

and said, fire the chairman of the PCAOB.  And if that 

is so, then the President has no ability to remove 

somebody exercising a very important executive function, 

and unless we are going to rewrite what has been 

generally understood as the independence of -- of 

independent agencies, then there is a fundamental 

difference between the President's ability to fire an 

inferior officer at the Justice Department and fire an 

inferior officer at the independent agency. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is not an argument you 

have made anyway.  Can we go on to the arguments that 

you’ve made? 

MR. CARVIN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Thank you.

MR. CARVIN:  And in terms of that basic 

argument, he cannot control, for example, the 

appointment of the board members, which he could with 

respect to officers over whom he exercises.  He can't 

tell the SEC whom to appoint to the board. 

And in terms of the question that Justice 

Scalia asked earlier, I don't think it's a statutory 

principle that you pretend --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is it unconstitutional 

for the President not to be able to appoint an inferior 

officer? 

MR. CARVIN:  Not an inferior officer.  But, 

of course, these are principal officers for three 

reasons --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Assuming we don't accept 

your characterization of them? 

MR. CARVIN:  Then I have two other 

arguments, Your Honor. 

One is:  The SEC cannot be a department 

under Freytag, because it is an independent agency 

indistinguishable from the Tax Court.  And -- and what 

the Freytag majority opinion said was, if you are unlike 

a cabinet department because you are not subject to 

political oversight, then --

rest on Freytag. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CARVIN:  So do I.  I want to take an 

opportunity to focus on the real point of Freytag, which 

was made very eloquently in the Freytag dissenting 

opinion, which was --

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the brief. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CARVIN:  The Appointments Clause is 

designed to achieve accountability, and even when you 

are not talking about presidential advice and consent 

positions, the way we achieve that accountability is by 

vesting it, in the words of the dissenting opinion, in 

“the President's direct lieutenant.”  And that's very 

important because it makes the President accountable for 

those positions, and it also makes them able to resist 

congressional encroachments. 

And this scheme, besides, embodies precisely 

the evil that was condemned by every member of the Court 

in Freytag and in Edmond, which is it creates an 

unaccountable system where a multi-member commission 

beyond the President's political oversight and control 

is making appointments.  Not one elected representative, 

in the President or the Senate, has any influence who --

over the people appointed to this board --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does that mean, Mr. 

Carvin, that the SEC cannot appoint heads of -- heads of 

its divisions?  I assume that they would fit within the 

characterization "inferior officers." 

MR. CARVIN:  That would be true, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So -- but if the SEC 

can't appoint --

MR. CARVIN:  No, they can't appoint inferior 

officers.  Now, the board with the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, so what are -- so 

what are the heads of the various divisions of the SEC? 

MR. CARVIN:  The board and the SEC say they 

are not inferior officers, because they do not under 

Freytag have any specific statutory authorization.  They 

are not, in the words of the Appointments Clause, 

"established by law."  So if they are --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Aren't there -- aren't 

there people within the independent regulatory 

commissions that have jobs comparable to people who are 

in the departments --

MR. CARVIN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- that the head of the 

department can appoint?  So who can appoint such people 

in the FEC, the FTC, the FCC, and so on?

MR. CARVIN:  There are two differences.  One 

is, for those lower-level people within the executive 

departments, they have specific statutory creation of 

those offices, the Solicitor General on down.  There is 

no statute saying that anybody below the commission 

level at the SEC has any job. 

That's totally up to the discretion of the 

commission.  They can vest them with whatever authority 

they want or not. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but the question is 

-- I assume it’s the follow-up question that Justice 

Ginsburg is interested in -- under your view of the 

case, why is that lawful? 

MR. CARVIN:  No, it would only be unlawful 

if they were inferior officers.  And if the board is 

correct that they are not inferior officers, there would 

be no constitutional problem at all with the SEC, for 

example, appointing a general counsel.  I should --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand that. 

It's okay for them to appoint principal officers, but 

not inferior officers? 

MR. CARVIN:  No, no.  Employees, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh.  Oh, I see. 

MR. CARVIN:  And the argument for them being 

employees that the board has advanced is that they're --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You’re saying they are not 

inferior officers and also not principal officers, but 

merely employees? 

MR. CARVIN:  Merely employees. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And who appoints -- who 

appoints the inferior officers at the -- at the SEC? 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, that's my other point. 

The chairman does, and so if you accept their view of 

who the head of the department is, which is the 

commission --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  All those appointments are 

presumably invalid. 

MR. CARVIN:  -- all those appointments are 

unconstitutional, so under their theory --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That would be a shame. 

MR. CARVIN:  -- since the chairman didn't 

appoint any -- the general counsel, the heads of any of 

the departments, all of them are unconstitutional.

JUSTICE BREYER:  No?  Okay. 

MR. CARVIN:  He just has --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, therefore, what you had 

said before would not apply to the chairman, that is 

to say:  The President can remove him at will --

MR. CARVIN:  Not --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There is no statute to the 

contrary; he does not serve for a fixed term, and so you 

cannot imply that.  Since the chairman cannot --

MR. CARVIN:  But this statute doesn't --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- can remove him at will 

-- you do not have what you would call the gearing into 

play, this somewhat mechanical jurisprudence, of what's 

an independent agency. 

MR. CARVIN:  No, he can remove the chairman 

at his pleasure, which -- but not a commissioner.  And 

that's our whole point.  That's a very key point. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So you are saying that the 

chairman, not the commissioner, is the person who does 

the appointing? 

MR. CARVIN:  We argue that.  They argue the 

opposite.  Under the statute --

MR. CARVIN:  -- the commissioner does the 

appointing.  And that's our key point.  Because the 

President exercises such extraordinary control over the 

chairman and therefore is able to control the SEC staff, 

Congress, in the statute, took away that traditional 

enforcement mechanism. 

All of the SEC staff you were referring to 

earlier, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg, are the 

chairman's alter egos.  And since they are the 

chairman's alter egos, they are completely 

constitutional.  And Congress, again, took away the 

chairman's powers, which was a way of limiting the 

President's ability to control the board. 

And I think they -- but our basic 

observation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So this whole thing would 

be constitutional if, instead of giving the appointing 

power to the commission, they had given it to the 

chairman? 

MR. CARVIN:  No, because we believe they are 

principal officers for three reasons under Edmond:  They 

run their own shop; the commission has no control over 

the officers on the board, since it can only remove them 

in these extraordinarily narrow situations; and as we 

have discussed at length before, it can only review part

of its work product, whereas the appeals court judges in 

Edmond, all of their work product was subject to review. 

And I think the removal provision is 

particularly important here.  The board can pursue 

policies that the SEC absolutely abhors and thinks are 

completely counterproductive, but under this 

extraordinarily narrow removal provision --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't that a highly 

unlikely scenario?  I mean, this thing won't work unless 

these two are working in harmony. 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, it would work perfectly 

if the board was an independent, autonomous entity that 

was not subject to the plenary control of the SEC, and 

that's exactly how the Senate report described it. 

No, the New York Stock Exchange works 

perfectly fine even though the SEC has oversight 

responsibility over the New York Stock Exchange directly 

analogous to the oversight responsibility it has over 

the board.  And so, no, it would work perfectly fine if 

you followed the congressional scheme, which was an 

agency with its own autonomy and power. 

And since it is an agency that has its own 

revenue sources, its own statutory authority, it has to 

be an agency composed of principal officers.  Elsewise 

very powerful agencies, including the CIA, for example,

would be considered inferior officers simply because in 

an organizational chain they report to some others. 

And I would argue, to get back to my 

original point, Justice Scalia, that that would 

absolutely confound the accountability that the Framers 

insisted upon, that either the President and the Senate 

or a direct lieutenant of the President make the kinds 

of appointments of inferior officers and that the 

important officers go through the advice and consent 

process. 

If there are no further questions, I’d 

like to reserve the remainder of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Resolution of this case follows from a 

simple syllogism, and it is this:  The President has 

constitutionally sufficient control over the SEC; the 

SEC has comprehensive control over the Accounting Board; 

therefore, the President has constitutionally sufficient

control over the Accounting Board. 

Official 

Now, Mr. Carvin has suggested that there –-

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  The President 

has adequate control over the SEC only because he can 

dismiss the chairman of the SEC.  But the activity here 

is not governed by the chairman of the SEC.  There’s no 

role whatever for the chairmanship.  The -- the 

governance of this board is by the members of the SEC. 

So that's quite different from saying -- you know, I --

I think your syllogism breaks down at that point. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I -- I think not, 

Justice Scalia.  Humphrey's Executor said 70 years ago 

the President does have constitutionally sufficient 

control over the SEC generally, including the chair. 

Now, the SEC has constitutionally -- has 

comprehensive control over the Accounting Board.  There 

is nothing that the Accounting --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The chairman, which is --

which is -- which is the -- what should I say -- the 

knife that the President has into the SEC, has no role 

in the control of this board. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  The -- the chair has the 

same role that he has with respect to pretty much 

everything else that the SEC does.  The SEC --

employees were appointed by the chairman, not by the 

commission. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Subject to the control --

subject to the approval of the commission.  So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think -- you 

think a -- a veto power is the same as an original --

original power? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, in fact, the 

commission could do the exact same thing in this case. 

The commission could delegate its control over the 

Accounting Board to the chair, subject to the control of 

the commission again. 

So I think that there is no difference with 

respect to the SEC's supervision of the board than there 

is with respect to the SEC's supervision of any of its 

other functions or any --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's say --

GENERAL KAGAN:  -- of its staff. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's say that 

the -- let's say that the board issues -- demands 

documents from a particular company.  Can the SEC direct 

them not to do that? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  The SEC has full control 

over the investigative and inspection function of the 

board.  This was what Mr. Carvin -- was the one thing

that Mr. Carvin said the SEC lacked, but in fact it does 

not, because the board's investigations and the board's 

inspections are all done according to rule.  And the SEC 

in a number of ways can change those rules. 

The SEC can reach out and abrogate any board 

rules, including rules relating to inspections and 

investigations.  The SEC also has power to promulgate 

its own rules, if --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, but, you know, 

Congress -- Congress can change the statutory authority 

of any agency just like that.  Does that mean that 

Congress is controlling the agency? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, it's certainly part of 

Congress's control mechanisms.  And this, too, is part 

of the SEC's control mechanisms with relation to the 

Accounting Board.  The Accounting Board can take no --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure that -- that 

the ability to take away responsibility for an agency --

from an agency is the same as controlling what 

authority that agency does exercise.  It seems to me 

they are two different things. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  And I think that the SEC has 

both.  It certainly has the authority to take away 

responsibility from the Accounting Board.  The 

rescission provision in 7217 makes that completely

clear.  But it also has authority to set the ground 

rules by which the Accounting Board does anything and 

everything.  It can say tomorrow -- it can promulgate a 

rule and say all inspections have to be approved by us, 

all investigations. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Will that be 

consistent -- do you think that will be consistent with 

the intent of Congress in establishing the PCAOB? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  I -- I do think it would be 

consistent with the intent of Congress, 

Mr. Chief Justice, because the intent of Congress was to 

place the Accounting Board under the extremely close and 

comprehensive supervision of the SEC.  The references to 

independence that one finds throughout the legislative 

record here are almost all references to independence 

from the accounting industry, not from the SEC. 

Quite to the contrary, Congress made it 

clear --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why did -- just out 

of -- I guess maybe it's not important, but why did 

the -- why did Congress set up a separate board if it's 

going to be entirely controlled by the SEC? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  I think it is important, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and I think that there were a few 

reasons.  First, Congress wanted to make sure that this

board did not compete with the SEC's own resources. 

Members of Congress thought that the SEC had been 

resource-strapped and wanted to create something with 

its own separate funding stream, which it was able to do 

by declaring this a kind of quasi-governmental agency. 

Second, it wanted to get the board outside 

of the normal civil service laws, because it wanted to 

attract people that it thought it could not attract on 

normal civil service salaries. 

And third, I think history and tradition 

have a great role in -- in the question that you are 

answering, because what -- the history and tradition of 

SEC regulation of the financial industry in general 

is -- is -- in -- in some part through the SROs, the 

self-regulatory organizations.  So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Before we get --

before you get too far into that, of those first two 

things, is there any reason Congress couldn't have 

achieved those same objectives by establishing the PCAOB 

as a division within the SEC? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I -- I think so.  I 

think it would have been harder to establish a separate 

funding stream to take the Accounting Board out of the 

civil service when the rest of the SEC is subject to 

normal congressional appropriations and is subject to

basic civil service laws regarding salary and so forth. 

So, this was a way to -- to have both. 

And it was also, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's -- that's the 

history and tradition of this board, which isn't very 

long.  But the history and tradition of boards like this 

is that their investigative powers are independent. 

Now, you say that there could be a rule, but that just 

isn't the way it works.  And if you refer us to history 

and tradition for other purposes, we ought to look at 

the operational principles, operational assumptions of 

this board. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I -- I -- I do think, 

Justice Kennedy, that -- that the way this board is set 

up, the statutory scheme and structure, makes it clear 

that the SEC has comprehensive authority not just over 

the rulemaking, but over the investigative and 

inspection activities of the board; that no -- no 

sanction arising from an investigation can be issued 

except if the board agrees; that no inspection report 

can be issued except if the -- excuse me -- except if 

the SEC agrees. 

And further, as I said before, that the SEC 

can reach further back into the process and say, not 

only do we have this kind of veto authority over any

sanction that comes out of an investigation or over any

change the way those inspections and investigations are 

conducted in the first place. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it have 

consequences for public companies subject to the board 

if it refuses to turn over documents requested by 

this -- this board? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, for -- for -- for 

public companies for -- not for the accounting firms in 

general, but for their public company clients, any 

subpoena would have to come, as Justice Ginsburg rightly 

said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, I know, but 

presumably you only get a subpoena when people don't 

cooperate. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  That -- that's correct. 

And -- and certainly public companies could cooperate, 

and certainly public companies have cooperated with the 

board. 

they don't? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And what happens if 

GENERAL KAGAN:  I -- I think that the board 

would go to the -- to the SEC for a subpoena, ask the 

SEC for a subpoena, and the SEC would choose whether to

grant that subpoena and whether to allow the kind of 

investigation that the board wants. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are there any 

other -- are there any consequences from the company's 

refusal short of -- that would not require the board to 

get a subpoena? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Are there any other 

consequences for the public company? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In the absence of 

the subpoena, if nothing happens? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  I -- I -- I believe that 

that’s the case.  I believe that it's the choice of the 

public company whether to comply or not.  If the public 

company chooses not to comply, the board has to go to 

the SEC and to get a subpoena. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it -- does it 

have a consequence as a practical matter for the company 

if it doesn't comply with a request from this board? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, the board does not 

regulate the public companies themselves.  The board 

only regulates the accounting firms. 

Now, the accounting firms do, as a condition 

of their registration, have to present any documents 

that the -- the -- the board wants.  And so the 

accounting companies have a real reason to comply with

the board's requests.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So there are in fact 

collateral consequences that take place without any 

involvement by the SEC? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I -- I -- I think 

again the SEC could change any of the rules that govern 

inspections, any of the rules that govern 

investigations. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if you had a 

statute here that said, look, if you don't comply with 

the board's request for documents, your authorities will 

be suspended, and if that were the statute, you would 

say, well, that's okay, because the SEC can always 

change that rule. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  I think that -- that the 

relationship between the SEC and the board has to be 

looked at as a whole.  And it's clear that the SEC has 

control over everything that the board does or could 

have control over everything the board does. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Kagan, I thought 

that -- the Chief asked a question, he posed a sanction, 

and I thought that any sanction the board wants to 

impose has to be approved by the SEC? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, that's exactly right. 

Any sanction, any final inspection --

with respect to the failure of public companies -- not 

the accounting firms, but public companies -- to turn 

over documents absent a subpoena, which the SEC needs to 

issue. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  As a practical matter, does 

the President have any ability to control what the board 

does?

President has the exact same ability that the President 

has with respect to every other aspect of the SEC's 

operations.  So, the --

remove the commissioners.  And it's the commissioners 

that govern the board, not the chairman.

chair only does what is delegated to him by the

very large salaries that the members of the board 

receive.  What are their salaries?

$500,000.

Humphrey's Executor.  Humphrey's Executor does indeed 

say that the President can't order the SEC commissioners 

in the same way that he might be able to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, yes. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  That's a 70-year-old 

precedent. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  That's 

Humphrey's Executor.  But you have to add to Humphrey's 

Executor Perkins and Morrison.  Humphrey's Executor says 

you can limit the President's removal power.  That 

doesn't get you down to the board.  You have to also say 

the principal officers -- there can be limits on their 

removal authority of the board members.

inch further because of the SEC's comprehensive control 

over the board, which makes the board function --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is -- I'm 

sorry.  What is the removal authority of the SEC with 

respect to board officers? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  The removal authority of the 

SEC with respect to -- with respect to board 

officers is a for-cause removal limitation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.  So there 

is a limitation there.  For cause does not include

failure to follow the policies of the President. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Let's assume that that's 

correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you need to rely 

on Morrison to make the limitations on what the SEC can 

do with respect to the board constitutional. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you need to rely 

on Humphrey's Executor to make the limitations on what 

the President can tell the SEC constitutional. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, removal 

is just a tool.  Removal is not the ultimate 

constitutional question.  The ultimate constitutional 

question is the level of presidential control, and the 

presidential control here is exactly the same with 

respect to the board's activities as it is with respect 

to the SEC staff's activities. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no, no, because 

you have got an extra layer there.  Let's say, I mean, 

that you have to have two violations of the for-cause 

provision.  You have got to have -- you have to meet the 

requirement in two places.  When the SEC wants to remove 

the board member, they can only do that for cause.  And 

if they decide, well, there isn't cause, I'm not going 

to do it, then the President under your theory has to

remove the SEC commissioners, all of them, not just --

not just the chairman, and he can only do that for

So you have got "for cause" squared, and 

that's -- that's a significant limitation that 

Humphrey's Executor didn't recognize and Morrison didn't 

recognize. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  But that for-cause provision 

is surrounded by a panoply of other control mechanisms. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which one are we 

talking about, the first one or the second one? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  The -- the for-cause 

provision on the board members is surrounded by a 

panoply of other control mechanisms which function as a 

complete substitute, which give the SEC --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's just 

talk -- a practical example.  The board says I want to 

get the documents of company X.  The SEC thinks they 

shouldn't do that.  Okay?  Can they remove them for that 

situation -- in that situation? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, they can pass a rule 

that says no, you can't get the -- the documents of 

company X, and then when the board members go ahead and 

try to get the documents of company X --

GENERAL KAGAN:  I think that they 

effectively can.  They would have to do it by -- I think 

that the easiest, quickest, most legally secure way 

would be to -- to do it by -- by promulgating a rule 

that says you can't do this.  And then --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The easiest way to 

do it is to pick up the phone, not by promulgating a 

rule. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  I said the most legally 

secure way to do it would be to do it that way.  I think 

that the fact that they have that formal mechanism means 

that they could pick up the phone and accomplish the 

exact same thing, because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can the President 

pick up the phone and fire the SEC commissioners? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  The President can pick up 

the phone and fire the SEC commissioners for cause, 

however "cause" has been defined. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He thinks -- he 

thinks they -- the board should be getting the documents 

from the other company, and the SEC thinks they can't.

So the SEC tells the board, don't go after that company,

Does that work under your theory? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  So now the SEC has given the 

board one order and the President doesn't like the order 

that the SEC has given to the board? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Again, the President has the 

same level of control over the SEC as he has with 

respect to anything else.  That's just Humphrey's 

Executor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not worried if 

it's the same.  I'm worried if it's enough. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, but that's Humphrey's 

Executor.  Humphrey's Executor said it was enough. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  And then --

GENERAL KAGAN:  And the question is whether 

this goes any further. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It goes further 

because you’ve got to rely on the SEC to get to the 

board.  So there you’ve got to rely on Perkins and 

Morrison. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  You always have to rely on 

the SEC to do anything, to supervise anybody in its 

field of operations, whether it's the SEC's own staff or

whether it's the board members, who stand in essentially 

the same relationship to the SEC commissioners as the 

own SEC staff does. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, do you dispute the 

proposition that the more layers of for-cause removal 

you add, the -- the less control the President has? 

Suppose there were five layers. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Alito, I think it 

all depends.  I mean, we are not saying that a double 

for-cause provision is always constitutional, just as we 

are not saying that a single for-cause provision is 

always constitutional. 

The question is, in what context does that 

for-cause provision operate?  And where it operates in a 

context like this one, where it is surrounded by a 

panoply of alternative and -- and equally effective 

control mechanisms, it simply should not matter that 

there's another for-cause provision. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what do -- what do 

you say in response to their formal argument that heads 

of departments are those people whom the President has 

at-will control over, like the Secretary of Defense, and 

Freytag is support for that.  And these aren't those 

people, so the SEC’s members must be inferior officers, 

and the Constitution says nothing about and implicitly

forbids inferior officers from appointing other inferior

All right, that's a formal argument, but I

GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, Justice Scalia, who 

doesn't much like Humphrey's Executor, nevertheless 

wrote a brilliant opinion in Freytag saying that in fact 

independent agencies were departments, and -- and -- and 

so that commissioners of the SEC would be principal 

officers, their appointees would be inferior officers, 

if -- if those appointees were subject to the direction 

and supervision of the principals in exactly the way 

Justice Scalia said was necessary in the Edmond case. 

He is --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  So I -- so we have to 

take the dissent there as opposed to taking the 

majority? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  No, no, no.  Freytag --

Freytag reserves the question --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  -- whether the independent 

agencies were departments for purposes of the 

Appointments Clause and, indeed, in reserving that 

question, suggested that they thought that the

You want us to find that that is implied in the statute?

Humphrey's Executor, is that SEC commissioners are 

subject to a for-cause removal provision.  And the 

government --

what is the authority for us to find that there is an

understanding about the SEC commissioners is that the

commissioners, which, under -- which, under Humphrey's, 

were removable only for cause, and as I believe --

statute required it. 

GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, but -- you’re exactly 

right, and it's a -- it's a perplexity of this law, but 

for many, many decades, everybody has assumed that the 

SEC commissioners are subject to the same for-cause 

removal provision, and the government has not contested 

that in this case, nor has Mr. Carvin. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  General Kagan, the 

government argues here that the head of department is 

all of the commissioners.  Elsewhere, it is the chairman 

of the SEC who -- who appoints inferior officers.  Now, 

which is it?  Are all those appointments by the chairman 

invalid? 

GENERAL KAGAN:  No, they're not, because all 

those appointments are made subject to the approval of 

the commission. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's something 

quite different.  He makes the appointments.  They can 

overturn it, but the appointment must be made by the 

head of the department, and the appointments are not

this regard has changed in different administrations, 

but if you look at the amicus brief that was filed by 

the former chairmen of the SEC, they make clear that in 

fact the commission has ultimate authority over each and 

every appointment.

removed by the President?

Mr. Chief Justice, that nobody has contested that 

question.

very broad for-cause provision, in the way that Bowsher 

suggested, not something that’s niggling and technical.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS PUBLIC 

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD, ET AL. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

The SEC has pervasive authority over every 

aspect of the board's operations.  Board rules and 

sanctions have no effect, except as the SEC allows, and 

can be changed by the SEC at any time. 

Board inspections and investigations are 

subject to plenary SEC control.  Not only are they 

conducted under rules that the SEC must approve, but the 

SEC can threaten or actually rescind the board's 

enforcement authority any time it thinks that's 

appropriate in the public interest. 

It controls the board's budget and salaries,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought -- so you 

disagree with General Kagan?  I thought she said one of 

the reasons for taking the board outside the SEC is that 

they’d have an independent funding stream. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Independent of the 

congressional appropriations process, not independent of 

the SEC.  Section 7219 is clear as water that the SEC 

controls the board budget, and the SEC in fact has used

that control to regulate down to the level of the board 

members' salaries. 

In addition, the SEC can impose rules 

requiring getting -- requiring the board, for example, 

to get SEC pre-approval for particular steps or 

particular actions. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you know any other 

agency composed of inferior officers that has the power 

to acquire its own budget, as this board does, by simply 

assessing a tax upon the people that it regulates? 

MR. LAMKEN:  In fact, this board doesn't 

have that power, because it can only do so as the SEC 

allows.  Here, as in all other contexts, it is the will 

of the SEC that controls. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The SEC can overturn it, 

but it's up to the board -- the board can do it.  Do you 

know of any parallel situation where there is a, 

supposedly, agency composed of inferior officers who 

have the power to tax the public unless it's overturned 

by somebody else? 

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, there’s a bunch of other 

similar entities, such as the SIPC and the like, that 

assess fees, and many of their officers are appointed by 

department heads, rather than the -- than the President. 

And so, yes, I think that's actually not an

decides. 

The board can propose, but it's the SEC that 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the board can 

act, and the SEC can, I suppose, retroactively veto 

their actions, but the SEC doesn't propose what actions 

the board takes, actions that can have significant, 

devastating consequences for the regulated bodies. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, precisely the opposite. 

With respect to rules, the board's rules are ineffective 

-- 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not talking 

about rules.  Agencies in the government do not act only 

in implementing a particular rule.  They have authority 

to regulate. 

And the board here, for example, can tell a 

particular entity:  You have to turn over these 

documents.  They don't have to have a rule that says, 

this company must turn over the documents. 

MR. LAMKEN:  And the SEC staff can do 

precisely the same thing.  In fact, right now they can 

issue subpoenas without asking the commission for

like it, you go to the principal officer, and you say, 

rescind the board's authority -- threaten to rescind the 

board's authority; this is out of line. 

And the SEC has broad authority in 

the public interest to rescind the -- the board's 

authority to enforce the action, enforce the law in any 

respect. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you can say the same 

-- you can say the same thing about Congress.  I 

mean, this is not the kind of control that an executive 

officer normally is supposed to have over inferior 

officers; when they do something, you can take away 

their authority.  Congress can do that. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, Congress would have to do 

that by legislation, subject to veto by the President, 

and in fact this is precisely the type of control that 

powerful executives regularly exercise.  If they don't 

like the way an inferior is doing something, they can 

take away that authority, and they can take away their 

salary as well, which is so close to being fired that I 

can't see any light between them, frankly, Your Honor. 

So the board -- the SEC controls whether --

what the scope of the board's authority is and its 

salaries --

They can't remove the PCAOB commissioners at will.  Or

but if you are going to look at formal removal 

authority, that exists throughout the United States 

government.  There are 1,100 administrative --

We list --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But we are talking -- we 

are talking about independent or quasi-independent 

agencies, and I understood Solicitor General Kagan to 

say that it's quite all right with an independent 

agency for the President to phone them on an ongoing 

basis and say, do this, and do that. 

Do you agree that that's what a President 

ought to do with an independent agency? 

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, Your Honor, I would 

think that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Call them on a routine 

basis, to supervise what they are doing? 

MR. LAMKEN:  If the -- if the response from 

the agency falled out -- falled out -- fell outside the 

range of reasonable policy responses the agency could 

adopt, then that might amount to inefficiency, neglect, 

or malfeasance.  And the SEC works --

regulates, to issue subpoenas, and so forth.

MR. LAMKEN:  Your Honor, the President has 

the same control over the SEC's supervision over the 

board that he has over everything else that falls within 

the SEC's jurisdiction.

adds nothing to Humphrey's Executor because the SEC --

Humphrey's Executor was not a specific issue.  It was 

just the general qualifications. 

MR. LAMKEN:  I'm sorry.  I believe 

Humphrey's Executor was that he couldn't remove the --

the officers --

MR. LAMKEN:  -- except for cause, and “for 

cause” --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I understand that.

But this does not depart at all from that 

standard, because the President has the same control 

over the SEC that he has over any other independent 

agency, and the SEC has pervasive control over the 

board, and it simply makes no sense to say that Congress 

can give the SEC or an independent agency --

authority is. 

So what is your position about the authority 

of the President?  Is it more than for cause or only 

for cause?

Solicitor General's, because I represent inferior 

officers whose positions are controlled by the SEC who 

are principal officers, and their lawyer is the 

Solicitor General.  So --

something done? 

MR. LAMKEN:  Justice Scalia, the Treasury 

Department --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you know of any instance 

where that has happened? 

MR. LAMKEN:  -- works closely with the SEC 

and tells the SEC precisely what it thinks the SEC 

should do on a regular basis, but the difference is the 

SEC turns around and can tell the board exactly what it 

wants the board to do and back it up by taking away 

their salaries, threatening to rescind the enforcement 

authority, announcing rules that say you may start, 

stop, alter investigations upon our direction or the 

direction of the chief accountant. 

The control of the SEC over the board is 

plenary.  This Court vindicated --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But what does the Treasury 

Department tell the SEC to do?

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the reason for 

this?  Having read this enlightening opinion of Justice 

Scalia in Freytag, which is enlightening to me if I've 

read it correctly,  I would say that the question --

there are two separate questions. 

One question is:  What is a department?  And 

this might well fit within that. 

And the second question, which is separate 

but mixed up in the cases, but not his, is:  When is it 

constitutional for Congress to limit the President in 

his ability to dismiss a -- an officer of the United 

States or -- inferior or superior -- for cause? 

And -- and what's -- if you can answer it, 

what are the justifications here for imposing that 

requirement? 

MR. LAMKEN:  I think the first half is, 

What's a department?  And the answer --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not interested in that. 

MR. LAMKEN:  Okay. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm interested in -- I'm 

developing --

MR. LAMKEN:  The justifications for the 

limitations on the removal of the officers of the board?

is that these are the standard limitations -- the 

standard removal provisions that exist throughout the 

financial area where the SEC has a subordinate entity 

under its control, and Congress presumed that because 

the SEC's -- the SEC's control was so pervasive, it 

didn't need to go back and revisit those standard 

removal provisions, because -- precisely because -- the 

SEC has power to rescind the board's enforcement 

authority, establish rules requiring it to obey 

commands, disobedience of which would be grounds for 

removal, to withdraw the salaries. 

The control is so pervasive that these 

removal provisions did not have to be reconsidered.  And 

from the board's perspective, they're just another means 

of control, one that actually taints them, as Shurtleff 

points out, with having committed misconduct.

because the President can control the SEC, somehow he 

can control those whom the SEC regulates. 

Well, the New York Stock Exchange has 

exactly the same relationship as the -- with the SEC as 

does the board, and no one would argue, I don't think, 

that he has any power -- the President, that is -- to 

direct and supervise the New York Stock Exchange.  In 

response to your question, Justice Alito, he couldn't 

complain about the excessive salary of Mr. Grasso at the 

New York Stock Exchange. 

I’d also like to knock down this myth --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is -- there is 

-- it was working okay with the Stock Exchange.  It 

wasn't working okay with the accountants. 

And there’s a problem.  There’s a problem 

that Congress had to solve.  It wanted to tighten the 

oversight of the auditing function.  And they wanted to 

have people who were not beholden to the profession, but 

who were knowledgeable and could command high salaries 

to be doing this job. 

MR. CARVIN:  No, that's entirely true, 

Justice Ginsburg, and the point is they could have 

accomplished all that and made the board members 

appointed and removable by the President, if -- if --

"approval," as earlier colloquy has suggested, is --

MR. CARVIN:  The President needs the 

unfettered ability to appoint principal officers, not to 

have some subordinate agency tell him who he can 

appoint.  That would be a severe restriction, far 

greater, for example, than was at issue in Public 

Citizen.  And that's essentially my point. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, you --

MR. CARVIN:  They can't give you -- I'm 

sorry. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You were -- I'm sorry, 

then.  I interrupted you, but I wanted you to give me 

your full picture of how this could be done, how 

Congress could accomplish its goal of having a strong, 

effective oversight body? 

MR. CARVIN:  In the same way they have 

strong, effective oversight of the communications 

industry and what the FTC does and the SEC.  Just follow

the President, removable by the President, and the 

President gets to designate the chairman.  The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it would be totally 

separate.  Then you would -- you’d say it would have to 

be a totally separate independent regulatory agency.  It 

could not be put under the wing of the SEC. 

MR. CARVIN:  You could have exactly the same 

relationship between the SEC and this agency, which I 

think is not under the wing of the SEC now.  The only 

difference is, instead of having the commissioners 

appoint them and remove them, you'd have the President 

appoint them and remove them. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I would have 

-- Judge Kavanaugh has suggested there are two ways to 

cure this problem:  One, have the President appoint and 

remove; and the other thing, make it truly subordinate 

to the SEC.  Now, I've heard the argument on the other 

side, both from the government -- well, it's an issue 

with the government -- the Solicitor General and the 

board, that the agency, the board, is completely 

subordinate to the SEC. 

Well, if Congress -- Congress could fix this 

problem by saying:  The board is subordinate to the SEC.

independence if they really wanted them to be 

subordinate?  And I really want to deal with that. 

This notion that they could pass rules to 

govern the investigative activities of the board is a 

myth.  The attorney general in Morrison had the ability 

to promulgate rules for prosecution, but he couldn't 

tell Alexia Morrison how to proceed in that individual 

case.  He couldn't say:  Anything she does with respect 

to Mr. Olsen, I need to pre-approve. 

Why?  Because the independent counsel, under 

that statute, had the prosecutorial authority.  Under 

this statute, the board has the prosecutorial authority, 

and everyone knows you can't govern the kind of manifold 

decisions that prosecutors need to make through some 

kind of bulky notice-and-comment rulemaking.  And that 

is why it is utterly mythical to pretend that they have 

this power. 

Justice Scalia, we assume that people 

exercise the powers they have, removal and the like.  We 

don't assume that they exercise powers that they don't 

have simply because they can theoretically get it.  What 

if the statute said the SEC --

SEC could transfer the board's powers to the Treasury 

instead of the SEC.  Would we assume -- would we analyze 

this case as if the Treasury was conducting the board's 

powers simply because the SEC had the theoretical 

ability to transfer it? 

This Court has emphasized countless times

MR. CARVIN:  Justice Ginsburg, we know 

exactly what the SEC and the Solicitor General think 

about the interrelationship of the Constitution and the 

statute, because they have expressed it in briefs from 

the district court on up. 

I am saying that even if you bend over 

backwards to give them this power under the statute, 

what you can't do is pretend that they have exercised 

this power under the statute.  The first might be a 

doctrine of statutory construction.  The second is 

deciding separation of powers cases on the basis of 

a fictional world that doesn't really exist. 

And I would suggest that that would give 

Congress an extraordinary blueprint for using the board 

as a model for each and every executive department. 

What would stop them from tomorrow; from transferring 

the Transportation and Labor and Energy Departments to 

a private corporation like the board, and creating some 

bipartisan commission that’s going to oversee this 

board with these fictional hypothetical realities? 

If this Court endorses this scheme, they 

have literally offered no limiting principle why that

couldn't be applied to each and every executive 

function.  To the contrary, they have emphasized that 

there is no constitutional distinction between alter 

egos and these independent commissions, and they have 

sought to justify this scheme on the basis of cases 

involving core executive functions, Perkins and 

Morrison.  So, again --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we took away -- I 

mean, one big point was the double for-cause.  So let's 

say we have said that the SEC could fire board members, 

period.  Then that would remove the double for-cause. 

Would this statute then be constitutional? 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, I don't think you can 

sever that provision from the statute, because I 

don't -- I think you’d be rewriting the statute and 

re-striking the balance that Congress did.  Moreover, of 

course, it wouldn't solve the Appointments Clause 

problem because, again, these are principal officers not 

appointed by the President, and even if they are 

inferior officers, the SEC is not a department. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, it’s not the double 

for -- the double for-cause isn't, in your judgment, 

what sinks this statute? 

MR. CARVIN:  Well, no.  It is a very 

serious -- yes, it is on my view absolutely dispositive

of why the statute is no good.  I'm saying merely fixing 

that will not fix the entire statute, because in 

addition to removal problems, we have very serious 

appointment problems under the appointments clause --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask one -- one 

narrow question?  If we assume that the members of the 

board are inferior officers, and if we -- do -- would 

you agree that if the board had unrestricted power to 

discharge them at will, the statute would be 

constitutional? 

MR. CARVIN:  Your -- I'm -- I'm to assume 

that the Appointments Clause problem -- if they are 

inferior officers, again, I have an Appointments Clause 

problem, because they are appointed by somebody who is 

not department head, i.e., the SEC commissioner. 

Do you want me to take that out and assume 

that that's okay as well? 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes. 

MR. CARVIN:  Okay.  So, if we are looking at 

it strictly from a separation of powers perspective, it 

is true that eliminating the for-cause removal provision 

goes a long way towards fixing the problem, but it 

doesn't go all the way and for one reason, which is we 

think the SEC imposes -- is at the outermost limits of 

constitutional acceptability.  And so, unless the

President has the same control over the officers that he 

has over the SEC, it would not be good. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But your answer to my 

question is that even if they are inferior officers and 

the other conditions have been met, if the Commission 

had unrestricted power of removal, the statute would 

still be unconstitutional. 

MR. CARVIN:  Principally because they are 

not subject --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The answer is yes is what 

I just --

MR. CARVIN:  I'm sorry.  Yes, Your Honor. 

May I just --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.  Sure. 

MR. CARVIN:  They are not subject to the 

chairman's control, unlike the SEC general counsel, and 

they have statutory duties entirely distinct from the 

commission. unlike the SEC general counsel. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
