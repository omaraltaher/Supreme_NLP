(10:03 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 12-126, McQuiggin v. Perkins. 

Mr. Bursch? 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

We're not dealing here with the situation 

where a prisoner is trying to gather new evidence AEDPA 

has a tolling rule to take care of that problem. 

We're also not dealing with anything that prevents 

Petitioner from filing because that's the problem you 

solved in Holland. 

What we have here is the question of when a 

petitioner must file his Federal habeas petition when he 

has the evidence and there are no barriers to filing. 

And 2244(d)(1)(D) addresses that exact question.  It 

says, "within 1 year." 

Now, Mr. Perkins asks for a fairly dramatic 

expansion of Holland.  What he wants is equitable 

abrogation with no diligence, no fault, or any other 

factor.  And our primary position is that you should 

simply apply the plain language of 2244(d)(1)(D).

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Bursch, I thought 

that -- that Perkins -- didn't he say that -- that you 

could take into account -- I'm looking for the 

brief -- you could take into account delay as a factor 

in whether his actual innocence gateway plea should be 

heard. 

MR. BURSCH:  Well, he -- he does say that, 

and we read that as a concession that, sometimes, if you 

wait too long, that can actually trump a claim of actual 

innocence.  And so, at a minimum, our alternative 

position is that you have to act with diligence. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not quite what 

he's saying.  We've had a miscarriage of justice 

exception for as long as there's been a habeas statute. 

We've applied it repeatedly. 

It's not that it trumps it, but that it puts 

into doubt the evidence you're claiming, proves your 

actual innocence.  It's not the sort of situation where, 

as reasonable -- as due diligence will do, which is to 

override even an actually innocent person. 

MR. BURSCH:  Well, we think it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What he says is it -- it 

really puts into question the validity of your claim. 

MR. BURSCH:  But, Justice Sotomayor, 

it -- it represents the same kind of principle, you've

got to act quickly, or adverse consequences can happen. 

But what diligence does that his rule doesn't do is it 

recognizes this compelling, countervailing State 

interest in having notice and an opportunity to 

investigate evidence, as soon as it's discovered. 

Now -- and the problem here -- we don't have 

any issue at all, if it takes 10, 15, 100 years to find 

new evidence, but once he has that evidence, the burden 

is on him to come forward, so that the State has the 

opportunity to investigate.  And the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's a small point and 

doesn't go to the general issues you have to discuss 

with us, but just, on the small point, he gets -- I 

forget exactly the detail -- he gets an affidavit that 

Jones did it within a year.  He has one. 

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, if I were the 

prisoner, I'd say -- you know, this one might not work. 

Maybe I can get two, and then he gets a second, which 

makes a certain amount of sense to me -- although a 

substantial period of time elapses -- and the same thing 

happens with the third. 

It makes sense to me that the prisoner might 

try to wait for the third.  How -- how does that factor 

into your diligence, assuming we get there?

MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  Justice Kennedy, there's 

a very simple solution to that problem.  If he gets 

close to the end of his year and he thinks that that 

next affidavit might be just around the corner, but he 

doesn't have it yet, all he has to do is file a 

protective habeas petition with the district court, ask 

for a stay, and say, I'm still diligently pursuing what 

I think is going to be another affidavit.  And, if he 

can't find that next affidavit, you litigate it on the 

merits, and, if he does, then he amends his petition, 

and then you hear it. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not quite -- excuse 

me -- I'm not quite sure that wouldn't mean that you 

have a whole raft of -- of petition-protective decisions 

waiting on the shelf in the district court.  That --

that -- that causes its own congestion problems in the 

district court, it seems to me. 

MR. BURSCH:  Two thoughts on that.  First, 

we already see this in the exhaustion area.  There are 

petitioners who are concerned that, notwithstanding 

statutory tolling for pursuing State remedies, that, 

while they're monkeying around in State court, they 

might somehow be time-barred from bringing their Federal 

claim. 

So we see this all the time in the Sixth

Circuit -- you know, in Michigan in particular, that 

someone will file their petition and -- and ask for a 

stay while they exhaust State remedies.  So -- you know, 

the pile really isn't going to be any different 

than it is right now. 

But the key difference between that scenario 

and the scenario that Perkins proposes is that, when you 

have him file something, the State's on notice, they 

have an opportunity to investigate. 

Now, here, we have his last affidavit from 

the dry cleaning clerk, and it's 10 years old.  So, even 

if Michigan could find that person, there's no way for 

us to meaningfully cross-examine her and investigate 

what she really knew or didn't know when she wrote that 

affidavit 10 years ago. 

And so with the file and stay, you preserve 

all of the rights, but, yet, you give the State the 

countervailing interest that the statute was meant to 

protect.  And I do want to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What would it take to --

what would it take to show diligence?  And didn't he say 

that he tried to get a lawyer, several times, and was 

unsuccessful? 

MR. BURSCH:  Sure.  And that's a very 

practical question that I'd like to address.  Most of

the habeas petitioners don't have lawyers, but filing 

the habeas petition itself is not something that takes 

great difficulty.  Every district court, on their 

website, has a place where you click for forms.  In the 

Eastern District of Michigan, when you click that, the 

very first two entries are habeas petitions for Federal 

prisoners and State prisoners. 

And it's a relatively simple form.  You 

check some boxes, say when your conviction was, and you 

write your claim.  And then every Federal district court 

in the country has full-time pro se staff attorneys who 

go through these pro se petitions. 

And, if there is a legitimate claim there, 

then they can work that up for the judge, if necessary, 

and the State will respond.  So --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I have some difficulty 

understanding what the Sixth Circuit was doing.  And 

maybe you can help me with that.  The district court, as 

I understand it, said to the Petitioner, you lose for 

two reasons.  First, you don't really have evidence of 

actual innocence, not enough anyway; and, second -- and 

I can understand that, because the evidence -- well, 

that -- the most that is suggested by the affidavits is 

that Jones was a participant in this murder, not that 

Perkins was not responsible for the murder.

But, anyway, so you lose for two reasons. 

First, you don't really have evidence of actual 

innocence; second, you weren't diligent.  The Sixth 

Circuit grants a certificate of appealability only on 

the issue of diligence, and they say, diligence doesn't 

make any difference. 

Well, where does that leave the petitioner? 

He's already lost on the question of whether there's 

evidence of actual innocence, and there was no appeal on 

that issue. 

MR. BURSCH:  Well, we're very confused about 

that, too.  They do say, in their opinion, that the case 

is remanded to the district court to determine whether 

he's got evidence of actual innocence.  Now, as you just 

pointed out, Judge Bell in the district court already 

made that determination, so maybe they're contemplating 

an evidentiary hearing or some further investigation, 

but it is curious because --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that -- that may be 

what they're contemplating, but they can't get to the 

issue of whether the district court adequately addressed 

the issue of adequate innocence -- of actual innocence, 

unless that issue is before them.  And the issue isn't 

supposed to be before them, unless -- isn't before them, 

unless the certificate of appealability was issued, and

there was no certificate of appealability on that issue. 

MR. BURSCH:  We agree with that 100 percent, 

so --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was that -- was that 

argued to the -- to the Sixth Circuit?  Did you argue in 

the Sixth Circuit that, even assuming diligence, there 

wasn't enough here, and that's what the district court 

held? 

MR. BURSCH:  I believe that is the position 

of the State of Michigan, that because he confessed to 

his friends, both before and after --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it -- it was 

explicitly made to the Sixth Circuit? 

MR. BURSCH:  I believe that the Sixth 

Circuit argument did focus on the question of diligence. 

But -- you know, our opinion would be that, even if this 

Court would use -- you know, what we call equitable 

abrogation, to kind of wipe away the 1-year limitations 

period, and you would also disagree on diligence, and we 

don't think you should do that, that you would still 

reverse because there's nothing left to be done in the 

district court. 

This is not a case that rises to the very, 

very high threshold of proving actual innocence, based 

on new evidence.  I would like to get back to the

MR. BURSCH:  I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume --

MR. BURSCH:  Well, that leaves you with a 

reversal in any of those three instances.  We think that 

you should address the circuit split, which is the 

important question of do we apply the limitations 

period.  And, to turn to that, what I would like to do 

is set up an analytical construct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's sort of an advisory 

opinion, in your judgment. 

MR. BURSCH:  Oh, no, it wouldn't be an 

advisory opinion.  It would --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sure, it would be 

because you're telling us that there is no proof of 

actual innocence. 

MR. BURSCH:  I'm saying that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why don't we just say 

that? 

MR. BURSCH:  I'm saying that's an 

alternative ground to get to the same place, but the 

Sixth Circuit's holding was, consistent with some other 

circuits, that there is no statute of limitations here,

that you can get by with equitable abrogation, as we 

call it. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It might be its holding, 

but, as Justice Alito just proved, there's no basis for 

it because they didn't grant a COA on the substantive 

merits question. 

MR. BURSCH:  Right.  I -- I think you're 

wholly within your right to address the merits question, 

and I would like to turn to that. 

The analytical construct I want to set up is 

that we've got three different categories of prisoners 

who claim actual innocence, based on new evidence.  In 

the first category, they used that new evidence only to 

try to establish innocence with no constitutional claim. 

And, in Herrera, you say no Federal habeas remedy for 

that; you have to go back to the State courts, executive 

clemency, prosecutorial discharging of verdicts, and 

things like that. 

The second category is where you have a 

prisoner who uses new evidence as a gateway.  It's not 

related to the constitutional claim that they assert --

the true Schlup gateway.  And that's not actually this 

case, either, and you could reserve that question, 

although I'm happy to talk about that. 

The case we have here is the third instance,

where the evidence of actual innocence -- the new 

evidence, is the factual predicate for the claim.  And 

you could not find a provision more on all fours with 

that category than what Congress did in 2244(d)(1)(D). 

And we know that Congress was thinking about actual 

innocence in Schlup. 

For those of you who are interested in the 

context, in the legislative debate in '95 and '96, 

before AEDPA's enactment, we have Senators Feingold and 

Kennedy and Dodd, among others, talking about how this 

new statute is going to eliminate claims of actual 

innocence based on new evidence.  In fact, Senator 

Feingold even mentioned the Schlup decision. 

And, yet, Congress adopts 2244(d)(1)(D) and 

all the rest of the provisions by a 91 to 8 vote.  So 

Congress had this Court's decision in Schlup in the back 

of its mind, it considered this particular construct and 

it said, no, we want a 1-year limitations period. 

I do want to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your -- your three-way 

classification, you began with Herrera? 

MR. BURSCH:  Correct. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and, in a way, 

you're saying that you're three loops back in the 

Herrera a bit because, here, the innocence is the

factual predicate. 

Official 

MR. BURSCH:  Right.  And, in the Herrera 

case, there is no constitutional claim, so there is no 

factual predicate.  It's just a stand-alone "I'm 

innocent" claim.  And this Court has said, appropriately 

so, that the Federal habeas remedy doesn't cover that. 

You know, if you think about the remedies 

you can get from State courts, from prosecutors, from 

executive clemency, it's a rather big circle, and AEDPA 

is a much smaller circle that's subsumed in that.  And 

you recognize, in Herrera, that, just because you don't 

fall within the habeas circle, doesn't mean that you 

can't get relief. 

In fact, if you look at the examples that 

the amici briefs cite on the Respondent's side, in 

almost every case, the final decision is motivated by 

State action.  There's a governor who grants clemency in 

a couple of cases, there's a State attorney general's 

office that dismisses charges in others, county 

prosecutors who do the same.  One, which the amicus 

brief characterizes as a habeas grant, is actually the 

Illinois Court of Appeals in a State proceeding 

reversing. 

You know, what the -- these are the best 

examples that they have for why you need an equitable

abrogation rule, and, yet, in the vast majority of those 

cases, it's the State system that's solving the problem. 

Now, I do want to go back to what I think 

is -- is the trickiest question, and that's, 

Justice Kennedy, the second category of prisoners, those 

who are using actual innocence to prove, not their 

underlying constitutional claim, but, simply, the Schlup 

gateway.  And I would respectfully submit that, even 

there, Congress has closed the door with 2244(d)(1)(D). 

And the best way to understand that is by 

looking two subprovisions earlier in the second and 

successive petitions category.  And this argument that 

I'm going to make now is a little bit different than the 

way we -- we did it in the brief, which was -- you know, 

they had it there, they -- they don't have it here. 

If you look at 2244 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before you present the 

argument --

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- you are saying that 

Congress overruled Schlup; is that what -- the point 

you're making? 

MR. BURSCH:  The -- the contextual point 

that I was making was that Congress knew about Schlup, 

it was brought up in the debate that this was,

essentially, changing the Schlup rule and allowing 

someone who claims actual innocence not to present their 

claim, and Congress swept those objections aside by a 91 

to 8 vote. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that was with 

respect to successive petitions. 

MR. BURSCH:  No, they were talking in the --

the legislative record, just generally, about actual 

innocence and claims of miscarriage of justice. 

So -- so the textual argument that I want to 

present involving successive petitions is that, when 

you're looking at 2244, you flow from successive 

petitions down to the statute of limitations. 

What that means is that, if you have a 

successive petition, Congress requires you to prove 

actual innocence and diligence, and you still have to 

prove that you satisfied the statute of limitations. 

The Seventh Circuit recognized this in the Escamilla 

case. 

So what that means is that, even when 

Congress had a situation where they knew that someone 

had presented evidence that would satisfy a heightened 

actual innocence standard, they still required that you 

satisfy the statute of limitations.

the text?  What are you relying on in the text of 2244? 

MR. BURSCH:  I'm relying on 2244(b), which 

is the successive petition provision.  It requires you 

to, first, prove that you've got evidence of actual 

innocence and then also demonstrate that you had 

diligence. 

And, after you're already gotten through 

what I'll call the actual innocence statutory gateway, 

you're still required to satisfy the statute of 

limitations.  If Congress was concerned about Schlup and 

wanted to make a situation where someone with evidence 

of actual innocence did not have to comply with the 

limitations period, they would have put an exception in 

the successive petition subprovision and they didn't do 

that, so --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you don't have 

2244(b)in your brief, do you? 

MR. BURSCH:  Unfortunately, the text is not 

there, no. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is very -- that is 

unfortunate. 

MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  Well, as we explained in 

the briefs, the fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you're relying on it, I 

mean.

have an actual innocence exception only two

didn't intend it here. 

But I'm making a different argument now,

MR. BURSCH:  Which is simply that Congress 

considered the -- the instance where you've establish a 

statutory actual innocence gateway in (b)(2), the 

successive petition, and still require that it be timely 

filed, because the State's interest in having notice and 

an opportunity to investigate is so important. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But are -- are you saying 

that this case is a fortiori from a successive petition? 

Because this isn't a successive petition. 

MR. BURSCH:  No, this is not.  What I'm 

using the successive petition provision to demonstrate 

is that, consistent with the legislative history, 

Congress is demonstrating here, in 2244(d)(1)(D), that 

there is no special actual innocence --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you're saying that 

Congress knows how to write --

MR. BURSCH:  Yes, I am --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- an exception if -- if 

they want it.  But this (b) does apply to successive 

petitions and this is really before that. 

MR. BURSCH:  Well, my -- my point is that, 

if Congress anticipated that actual innocence could be a 

gateway to circumvent the limitations period, then 

certainly they would have put that exception in the 

successive petition of (b)(2) where they said, all 

right, if you establish actual innocence, we're still 

going to make you comply with the limitations period. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, now, your 

friend on the other side, I think, argues that that --

they put that in expressly because they limited what 

would be the otherwise applicable miscarriage of justice 

provision in the question that's before us now. 

MR. BURSCH:  Right.  And if you would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is your -- what 

is your answer to that? 

MR. BURSCH:  If he was right about that, 

then in (b), you would also see another provision that 

says and anyone who satisfies this statutory actual 

innocence standard doesn't have to comply with the

limitations period.  And we think that -- that's 

dispositive. 

Now -- you know, when we --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I don't 

understand.  I mean, there is a presumption that's been 

longstanding that, at least with respect to the filing 

of your first petition, that it is a statute of 

limitations subject to exceptions, including the 

manifest injustice one. 

It would seem to me that if they intended 

not to have that apply, they would have done what they 

did with the successive petition, but they chose not to. 

MR. BURSCH:  Justice Sotomayor, the history 

of this statute and of the case law isn't quite that 

way.  And I want to draw a sharp distinction between 

this case and Holland, with respect to history.  With 

respect to equitable tolling, you did have decisions 

going back to the 1800s recognizing that Federal 

statutes of limitation in all kinds of contexts, civil 

and criminal, were subject to equitable tolling. 

And so then, in Irwin, 6 years before AEDPA, 

you actually create a presumption that, if Congress 

doesn't specifically -- you know, exclude equitable 

tolling --

that presumption. 

Official 

MR. BURSCH:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What I'm talking 

about --

MR. BURSCH:  Now, I'm going to move to 

miscarriage of justice. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- are cause and effect 

and manifest injustice. 

MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  So the cause and effect, 

the manifest injustice, the actual innocence, really 

starts to develop in 1986, and it comes to fruition in 

Schlup in 1995, right before AEDPA is passed. 

Importantly, that exception was always applied to 

court-created procedural bars, never once to a Federal 

statute of limitations. 

And, obviously, the separation of powers 

considerations are quite different when you're talking 

about a court-created exception to a court-created bar. 

The first is a bar that's enforced by Congress itself. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you're creating a world 

in which this would function as an exception to a State 

time limit, but not to the AEDPA time limit. 

MR. BURSCH:  That's correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why does that make any 

sense?

MR. BURSCH:  Because it was the Court itself 

that created the judicial exception to the State filing. 

And so then -- or, I'm sorry, that created the bar with 

respect to the State filing.  And so then it was 

completely within the Court's power to make an exception 

to that bar. 

But, again, here, the separation of powers 

considerations militate differently when you're talking 

about Congress doing the telling, and this Court has 

acknowledged, in Launcher and Dodd and other places, 

that Congress gets to set the parameters of habeas. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I thought we said, in 

Missouri v. Holland, that AEDPA was -- was enacted 

against a background rule, which stated that normal 

equitable principles, such as this one, which had been 

applied everywhere to all procedural bars, that AEDPA 

suggested that those would -- that AEDPA was 

against a background that those would continue to apply. 

MR. BURSCH:  Well, it was a very short 

background, one with no Irwin-like presumption and one 

that, again, had never ever been applied to a Federal 

statute of limitations.  And --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why is a Federal statute 

of limitations any different? 

MR. BURSCH:  Because it's Congress and

Congress is the one that's handcuffing the Court with 

respect to the scope of the --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but, again, it's 

Congress but we said, in Holland, that it's Congress 

and AEDPA has -- has -- was drafted against this 

presumption that normal equitable principles would 

apply. 

MR. BURSCH:  But here's another way to think 

about it -- you know, if you imagine the -- the template 

that you have on your Microsoft Word, when you're doing 

a document, an opinion, whatever, you've got certain 

stuff that's on the template.  And you said, in Irwin, 

that when it comes to equitable tolling, you've always 

got a subprovision Z, call it, in every Federal statute 

of limitations that appears on that template, And so 

Congress has to do something affirmatively to strike 

that out. 

Because the miscarriage of justice exception 

had never been applied to any Federal -- Federal statute 

of limitations, there wasn't a miscarriage of justice 

exception sitting on the template.  Congress was writing 

from scratch. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, again, why would 

Congress have thought that there would be any difference 

in -- with respect to a statute of limitations?

MR. BURSCH:  Well, the biggest reason is 

because of the State interest in notice and 

investigating the evidence.  When you're talking about 

the typical Schlup claim --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that applies to States, 

as well. 

MR. BURSCH:  Well, no, there -- there you 

have stale claims, but you don't have stale evidence. 

And -- you know, we -- we don't have any problem with 

litigating a claim that could have been litigated 

earlier and is going to be litigated now.  But the world 

of evidence, the record that supports the claim, is 

already defined and is not going to change. 

The world we're dealing with in 

2244(d)(1)(D) is when new stuff has come forward, and, 

if that new stuff sits in the jailhouse cell for 10, 20, 

30 years and we don't have an opportunity to talk to 

those witnesses, to do counter-investigation, then not 

only are we prejudiced with respect to delay and 

finality and things like that, but we're prejudiced with 

respect to the merits determination of what that 

evidence means. 

And, when I talked about my three 

constructs -- you know, this case, here, where you're 

using the old evidence to establish the underlying

claim, that's really the position where the State is in 

the worst possible position because, now, you've got 

a -- you know, the dry cleaning clerk affidavit -- a 

10-year-old affidavit -- we can't possibly cross-examine 

her, and, yet, not only is that their gateway, that's 

their substantive merits claim about why there is 

ineffective assistance of counsel. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why can't you 

cross-examine her?  Is it just because the lapse of time 

and she won't remember? 

MR. BURSCH:  It'll be very difficult.  And 

there are some examples in the amici briefs of the New 

York case, for example, where witnesses were completely 

unavailable.  They had died, or one was out of State 

and, because of mental infirmities, could not travel. 

You know, we all know that, as time passes, 

evidence deteriorates, whether it's because of -- of 

death or illness or simply forgetfulness.  I certainly 

can't remember what I was doing 10 years ago today.  And 

the affidavit that she submitted was quite short.  And 

that one affidavit is just a microcosm of the problem 

when you don't come forward immediately with evidence. 

One other point that I want to make, really, 

on the equities here because we're spending a lot of 

time on that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you have any idea how 

many actual innocence claims win on the underlying 

constitutional issue? 

MR. BURSCH:  Right.  The number that win is 

small.  But what this case demonstrates is that the 

number where it's claimed is very high.  In fact, in 

Michigan -- you know, where we deal with procedural 

default every day, somewhere between a third and a half 

of our petitioners claimed actual innocence, so that 

they can use Schlup to get past the -- the failure to 

prove cause and prejudice. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How many wins on the 

attempt? 

MR. BURSCH:  Well, in the Sixth Circuit, a 

little more than in some other circuits, but, generally, 

not very many --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not many. 

MR. BURSCH:  -- you know.  But this case is 

the perfect example.  When you cut the court loose from 

the statutory requirement, you end up with what 

Justice Alito is describing -- you know, a situation 

where no one thinks that Mr. Perkins is actually 

innocent based on this new evidence; at best, it proves 

that he had a co-conspirator who helped him commit the 

murder together.

And, yet, now, we've got the Sixth Circuit order, 

which purportedly sends us back to the trial court to 

do -- you know, who knows what?  I mean, how do you 

prove that he's not innocent?  Well, a jury already did 

that. 

You know, The jury heard all the evidence. 

They had a presumption of innocence.  All the 

constitutional rules that should have been were applied 

to that trial, and the jury said he's guilty, and 

there's not a presumption of innocence anymore. 

And -- and the equitable point that I wanted 

to touch on is that this is not just about prejudicing 

the State's interest.  If you allow claims like these to 

go forward, it also prejudices those who have legitimate 

claims of actual innocence, the needle in the haystack. 

And Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, in their 

Herrera concurrence, talked about the haystack problem, 

that, when you keep adding hay to that pile, not only is 

it harder to find the needle, the truly meritorious 

claim, but, at some point, the Federal judges just give 

up, and they stop looking. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why -- why is it that 

the meritorious claim is going to be the one that's 

going to be hidden? 

MR. BURSCH:  Because there are so many.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Meaning --

MR. BURSCH:  It's important to understand 

that -- that, notwithstanding the limits that Congress 

was trying to put on these habeas petitions when it 

enacted AEDPA, that we actually have more habeas filings 

on an annual basis today than we did before AEDPA was 

enacted.  It's not going to stop the filing. 

This is just one small rule to cut the 

haystack down a little bit and make it that much easier 

to find the needle.  And, if you can find that 

occasional needle -- and we submit there's not a lot of 

those -- Federal judges are going to be more inclined to 

look for those. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you would -- you 

want to keep it out altogether. 

MR. BURSCH:  No. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You want an actually --

potentially actually innocent person not to have --

MR. BURSCH:  No, that is not our position. 

And I want to be really clear about this.  First, 

they've got the year, but, if they go past the year, 

they've got the State system.  And what the examples in 

the amici briefs demonstrate is that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they don't have the 

Federal system.

explains, every State has got a process for hearing these 

claims, no matter how old they are.  You've also got 

the -- the prosecutors who look at these and they don't 

want to keep innocent people in jail. 

And then, lastly, you've got clemency, which 

this Court has always recognized as the remedy for those 

who assert true, actual innocence, but have no 

constitutional violation to assert. 

Unless there are further questions, I would 

like to reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Readler? 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHAD A. READLER 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. READLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

I would like to start with Justice Kagan's 

question regarding the important background interpretive 

principle here that's set out -- set out in Holland. 

There, the Court held that longstanding equitable rules 

in the habeas context are incorporated into AEDPA, 

barring a clear command by Congress to the contrary.

And the longstanding miscarriage of justice 

exception has had a well-settled meaning.  It has 

allowed petitioners, who can meet the high standing of 

showing actual innocence, a procedural gateway around a 

procedural bar to allow them to present their otherwise 

barred constitutional claims in Federal court. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before you proceed with 

that, can you address Justice Alito's point that the 

district court said there is no merit to this; it's not 

an actual innocence -- it's not a valid actual innocence 

claim.  And then the Sixth Circuit sends it back for the 

district court to decide something it's already decided? 

How do you overcome that the Sixth Circuit 

never reviewed the actual innocence question, the 

district court did and said this doesn't make it? 

MR. READLER:  That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.  And, with respect to Justice Alito's 

question, the reform recommendation from the magistrate 

denied this petition on statute of limitations grounds 

solely.  It said it was too late, and it missed the 

statutory period. 

At the district court level, the court held 

that the statute of limitations was missed and that 

there was no diligence; the court believed there was a 

diligence requirement, and so the petition failed for

that reason.

And then, as Justice Alito noted, the court 

added some other language, which said -- was not a 

weighing of the evidence, but the court said that it 

felt that the evidence was not new, in the sense that it 

was reasonably -- potentially reasonably known at the 

time of trial, which I think is one -- was, one, the 

wrong legal standard, but, two, was a misinterpretation 

of Schlup because Schlup allows you to consider all the 

evidence, old and new. 

And I don't think that's what the 

district -- the district court I think applied the wrong 

legal standard, so it wasn't actually getting to the 

merits.  It didn't sort of set out all the evidence and 

weigh them. 

And then, Justice Ginsburg, you are correct 

that this was not part of the certificate of 

appealability.  The certificate of appealability was 

limited on the narrow question of whether there was a 

diligence requirement. 

That factual issue was not before the Sixth 

Circuit and hasn't -- it is not before this Court as 

well, and what I think this Court should do is what it 

did in Schlup, which is announce the standard that 

would apply and then it remanded the case back to the

district court for application of the correct standards. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I don't understand 

that.  The district court -- or you seem to suggest the 

district court was wrong in saying that there wasn't 

sufficient evidence for an actual innocence claim. 

Maybe that's the case.  Maybe it was wrong. 

But, if it decided that issue and the issue 

wasn't appealed, then the issue is settled.  And that's 

the problem that I see.  Now, how do you get around 

that? 

MR. READLER:  Right.  Justice Alito, I don't 

read the Sixth -- or I don't read the district court as 

actually getting to the merits.  I think it applied a 

wrong legal rule and said, I can't even consider the 

evidence because it's not new evidence.  I think that 

was an erroneous interpretation. 

Under Schlup, the -- the Court has said many 

times that the court can consider all the evidence old 

and new.  And I think that case really turns on the --

the equitable tolling of --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Did you ask for a 

certificate -- what other issues did you ask for a 

certificate of appealability on?

contours of what he requested.  The certificate -- the 

Sixth Circuit granted it on the one narrow issue of 

whether diligence was a requirement. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, you say, on 

page 17 of your brief, that this Court has applied the 

manifest-injustice exception to limits created by 

Congress.  What's your best case for that? 

MR. READLER:  Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Those cases are on pages 36 to 38 of the red brief, and 

I think my friend and I have a disagreement here.  It's 

true that the -- the rule has never been applied to the 

statute of limitations because there was no statute of 

limitations for AEDPA before the statute, but the Court 

has applied the exception to acts of Congress.  It did 

so in Sanders. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what do you 

mean, acts of Congress?  Your sentence says, applied at 

the limits created by Congress.  I read that to mean 

statutes of limitations.  But that's wrong? 

MR. READLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, that --

statute of limitations before AEDPA, but the Court had 

applied the miscarriage of justice exception to acts of 

Congress.  So, for instance, in Sanders, the -- Congress 

had included, in 2244, an ends-of-justice provision 

which seemed to allow the Court to consider the ends of 

justice when considering whether to hear a successive 

petition, which is, essentially, the equivalent of 

miscarriage of justice. 

It did not include that language in 2255, 

and, yet, the Court read 2255 as also including the 

ends-of-justice requirement, hence the miscarriage of 

justice, even though the language wasn't there.

when you could bring a successive petition.  The -- the 

statute that applied to petitions out of State judgment, 

2254, included an ends-of-justice provision, which said 

the court could consider the ends of justice in deciding 

whether to take a second or successive petition. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so, when you 

said limits, you didn't mean time limits; you meant 

substantive limits? 

MR. READLER:  Substantive -- well, no. 

Procedural limits, procedural limits on -- procedural 

limits. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Procedural limits. 

Do you have a case that applies it to time limits? 

Which, of course, is the question we have here. 

MR. READLER:  We do.  In -- in -- now, these 

would be State time limits, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But you said 

limits created by Congress.  So just -- I mean, I should 

read "limits created by Congress" not to mean time 

limits, but procedural or other limits. 

MR. READLER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there

that's the point of my questioning and your friend's 

position.  There have never been any time limits created

by Congress that have been abrogated by a 

manifest-injustice exception. 

MR. READLER:  I think I can agree with that 

because there was never a statute of limitations before 

AEDPA.  But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  And the 

difference is, in Holland, we are dealing with equitable 

tolling, which had applied as far back as -- you know, 

whatever the law goes to limitations; in other words, 

equitable tolling, which is different from the 

abrogation, I think, that you are asking for. 

MR. READLER:  Well, I don't think so, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  Two responses, first, with respect 

to the timing issue, the Court had applied the 

miscarriage-of-justice exception to abusive petitions. 

So there is a timing concern invoked there 

because you're filing a second petition when you could 

have raised issues earlier.  And the Court has said, 

even in that timing context, not a statute of 

limitations, but it certainly invokes timing concerns, 

that even, in that instance, the miscarriage of justice 

would still overcome the rule. 

Now, what --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you are asking for 

what is, potentially, a very big exception to the 1-year

statute of limitations.  If you took a poll of all of 

the prisoners in Michigan, how many of them do you think 

would say they are actually innocent? 

MR. READLER:  Justice Alito, I suspect very 

few of them could credibly say --

JUSTICE ALITO:  "Very few" would say they 

are actually innocent? 

MR. READLER:  Well, I haven't done that 

study.  I suspect very few of them would say that 

they -- credibly say that they are actually innocent. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Oh, "credibly say."  But how 

many would say that they are actually innocent?  A lot. 

And a lot would be able to come up with evidence that is 

equal to -- to what the petition -- what the Respondent 

here has come up with. 

Now, do you think it's -- it's plausible 

that Congress, in establishing this new 1-year statute 

of limitations, because it doesn't want these things to 

drag on indefinitely, intended to create an exemption 

that broad, so that anybody who claims to be actually 

innocent can at least get over -- can get to the point 

where the Court has to decide whether the -- has to 

weigh this evidence of actual innocence, to see whether 

it -- it gets over the threshold? 

MR. READLER:  Sure -­

Official 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that plausible, given 

what Congress was trying to do in AEDPA? 

MR. READLER:  Absolutely, Justice Alito, for 

two reasons.  First of all, the background presumption, 

of course, given the established nature of this 

exception -- in fact, on Mr. Chief Justice's question, 

while this exception, as compared to equitable tolling 

in the criminal context, I think is actually more 

important because it goes to the ultimate equity, and 

that is innocence. 

But the background presumption is that 

Congress includes these foundational equitable rules, of 

which the miscarriage of justice exception is absolutely 

one of them, unless Congress expressly says otherwise. 

Now, Justice Alito, no -- no petitioner is 

going to want to find themselves in the Schlup world, 

where they missed the statute of limitations.  It is not 

a place they are going to want to be.  They are going to 

absolutely want to file within a year, if they can. 

Sometimes, they miss that -- that period, 

and what the Court has said, in those rare circumstances 

where you can make a credible, compelling showing of 

actual innocence, we will allow you around the statute 

of limitations.  But no petitioner wants to be in that 

circumstance because the Schlup standard is so high.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's -- I'm 

not sure that's right.  They don't want to definitely 

file within one year, if they don't have anything to 

say.  You know, if it takes a certain amount of time 

before they either acquire it legitimately or can find 

somebody or -- I don't know, in this case -- you know, 

the codefendant dies, everybody has no reason any 

more -- you know, to object and pin it on him. 

There are a lot of reasons that it's in some 

of these prisoners' interest to drag things out and then 

to file.  They don't have anything to say within the one 

year and need time to either, from your point of view, 

legitimately develop the evidence or, from your friend's 

point of view, to concoct it. 

MR. READLER:  Well -- and the statue speaks 

to that.  I mean, I think we do have a disagreement on 

the interpretation of the statute, but Section 

2244(d)(1)(D) does speak to the discovery of new 

evidence which goes to support a claim.  I think 

Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the statute of 

limitations would run from the discovery of the new 

evidence, not from --

MR. READLER:  That's -- that's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg, to the extent that the evidence goes

to support a claim.  Congress included a typical 

discovery rule.  If you've discovered new evidence 

that -- that supports the factual underpinnings of your 

claim, that starts the one-year period over again. 

But, critically -- and I think my friend and 

I have a disagreement here -- critically, with respect 

to that provision, if you find evidence that solely goes 

to your innocence, that provision is not triggered, 

meaning you don't get another year if you find 

completely exculpatory evidence that shows you're not 

innocent, you don't -- you don't necessarily get another 

year. 

And there's a hypothetical I can give you. 

If your underlying claim is a Batson claim, a 

structural error claim, and you fail to raise it, and 

you missed the one-year limitations period, but then, 10 

years later, you find DNA evidence that completely 

exonerates your client that was unknown to anyone, so 

it's not the basis for an IEC claim, it's not the basis 

for prosecutorial misconduct, in that instance, the 

statute doesn't start the limitations period over. 

You're entirely out of luck, which is why 

Congress had to have meant to include the absolute --

the innocence exception for just that kind of case, so 

that that petitioner at least has the ability to try to 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

meet the Schlup standard. 

Official 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But that's very odd because, 

if you have somebody who's actually innocent, then 

you're saying that person can't get out of prison, 

unless the person happens to have a good constitutional 

claim that's totally unrelated to the fact that the 

person is actually innocent. 

That's just very odd, isn't it. 

MR. READLER:  Well, I don't think so, 

Justice Alito, in the sense that all this is, is a 

gateway to allow them their first opportunity to bring a 

Federal habeas petition.  Ordinarily, they're out of 

luck. 

But, if they brought evidence that is so 

compelling, that shows that there may well have been a 

miscarriage of justice because this person has shown, 

under the Schlup standard that they're actually innocent, 

then, in that instance, the Court has always said that 

we're going to allow those claims to be heard, at least 

in the first instance, by -- by a Federal court for a 

first petition. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your friend responds 

to that point, I think, by saying that every State 

allows collateral review in that instance and that what 

we're talking about is simply preclusion of the second

bite at the apple -- or a third bite at the apple, I 

guess, by -- by assumption, in the Federal system. 

MR. READLER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm 

not sure that's practical, to the extent that we've 

already raised our underlying constitutional claims in 

the State court.  Those have been exhausted.  So the 

Michigan rule, as I read it, doesn't allow us to go back 

to State court and present our constitutional claims 

again.  They've already been adjudicated. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the 

actual innocence claim? 

MR. READLER:  The innocence evidence may --

you may be able to pursue that under -- under the --

under the State rule, but that is more akin to a 

freestanding --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that the most --

is that the most -- I thought I understood your friend 

to say -- he can correct me if I'm wrong -- that every 

State has an avenue for considering that. 

MR. READLER:  Well, two responses.  One, I 

think every State has different rules and so this -- the 

application of the exception is never turned on sort of 

what the alternative potential State rule is.  That 

wasn't -- that was true in House and true in Schlup, 

where there were State alternatives.

But, two, those State alternatives go to 

freestanding innocence claims, where you're not --

you're not alleging that there's an underlying 

constitutional violation. 

What you're saying is similar to Herrera, 

and that is that I have evidence that shows, setting 

aside any error of the trial, no errors, I have evidence 

that shows I'm innocent.  That's a completely different 

concept.  And what we're getting at here is the case 

where you wanted evidence of innocence and, two, have a 

constitutionally corrupt trial -- or at least an 

allegation of a constitutionally corrupt trial. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I see --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, assuming for the sake 

of argument that there is this exception, why shouldn't 

diligence be required?  How can it be equitable to allow 

someone to bring a claim when the person has --

involving new evidence, when the person has not been 

diligent in presenting this new evidence to the court? 

MR. READLER:  Well, Justice Alito, for 

decades, this Court has never required diligence and, in 

fact, in McCloskey, has expressly rejected it, and the 

Court has noted that diligence has not historically been 

required under the standard because, as the Court said 

in House and Calderon, that Congress raised the bar in

two places on the statute. 

Official 

But the reason why is because, as 

Justice O'Connor said in her concurring opinion with --

with -- in Withrow, with Chief Justice Rehnquist, is 

that innocence is the ultimate equity.  And it trumps --

diligence is not the ultimate equity, it's innocence. 

And if -- if a petitioner can come forward 

and make a credible showing of actual innocence, that, 

standing alone, has always been enough to allow a 

Federal court to at least go ahead and then reach the 

underlying claim. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You have a larger -- you 

have a larger category, you say miscarriage of justice, 

so one is actual innocence.  You say the category is 

well defined.  So what else would fit under this -- and 

we can bring it up very late in the -- in the day. 

Anything else other than actual innocence would be in 

this category? 

MR. READLER:  Justice Ginsburg, I think the 

Court has always treated the phrase "miscarriage of 

justice" as synonymous with actual innocence, and 

that's -- that's the one thing it's getting at.  It's a 

narrow exception, it's difficult to meet, but -- but 

it's always included cases where you can make -­

there no -- no miscarriage of justice there? 

MR. READLER:  Well, that would, presumably, 

be the basis for a habeas claim.

miscarriage of justice in the habeas setting as the

and he gives four criteria, and the four criteria,

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If that's

Petitioner can certainly be considered in the Schlup 

analysis, so --

view, if he deliberately and -- and, without cause,

MR. READLER:  Well, Justice Breyer, on those 

facts, I'm going to say he loses at the Schlup stage 

because Schlup, which is, one, an incredibly high bar to 

meet, but, two, the Court expressly said, at page 322 of 

the opinion, that it could consider the timing of the 

evidence when it's submitted.

that is, in fact, many of these people don't have 

lawyers.  They don't understand the statute of 

limitations, they don't understand what diligence might 

consist of looking later.  You agree that it's -- it 

shouldn't be a sham, shouldn't do it deliberately. 

All right.  Now, if I'm thinking about that, 

how would you advise me to write it? 

MR. READLER:  I think -- I think the Court 

can just build on the principles it's already set 

forward in Schlup and other places, and that is, that 

there's never been a diligence requirement in this 

setting. 

And Congress, by the way, did not -- the 

Congress -- the intent of Congress was not to include a 

diligence requirement here because, in two places, it 

did include a diligence requirement with respect to 

successive petitions or evidentiary hearings, so 

congressional intent was not to include diligence --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there has always 

been a laches defense until Rule 9(a) was rescinded. 

MR. READLER:  That's correct, Justice 

Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So there's 

been some form -- not of due diligence, but some form of 

check on a prisoner waiting so long that a State can't

respond, the -- Justice Breyer's hypothetical. 

So he's asking you, I think, to tell us how 

to write it.  So do we write it by saying there's no 

diligence requirement -- but there is a sort of common 

law laches, although that's a hard argument to make 

because it was based on 9(a) until recently. 

Or do we just say it's equity, and equity 

would suggest that, if it's contrived -- the delay is 

contrived, that the evidence is suspect and doesn't --

and shouldn't be credited. 

MR. READLER:  Absolutely.  Two responses. 

First, just with respect to Rule 9(a), Chief Justice 

Burger, in a concurring opinion to a dissent in 

Spalding, said that even a laches rule would give way, 

if there was a colorable showing of actual innocence. 

With respect to the rule I'd write, I would 

write the rule that is essentially already in place, and 

that is that the miscarriage of justice exception does 

not turn on diligence; it turns on whether you can show 

innocence. 

And in -- in attempting to show innocence 

under Schlup, this timing -- the timing of the 

submissions is a consideration.  So if there's -- if 

there's been a delay that, somehow, hurts the State 

because a witness has died or that it appears to be that

that's the fault -- or that the petitioner was playing 

games in that context, I think that's a fair 

consideration under Schlup. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is this 

established after -- after some kind of evidentiary 

hearing, the delay, whether he delayed for a particular 

purpose or not? 

MR. READLER:  Well, it depends.  If -- if 

the petition is filed 3 weeks after the star witness 

dies, presumably, the State will come back in their 

petition and note, one, all the evidence that they think 

goes against the -- the petitioner's claim, but, also, 

they'll note that this happened, and the court could 

resolve it at that stage, too. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why -- why did your 

client wait 5 years after the last affidavit? 

MR. READLER:  A number of reasons, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  One, he was looking for counsel to 

assist him; two, he continued to look for evidence; 

three, he didn't have access to his legal papers.  Many 

of his legal papers were lost in a prison riot and then 

a flood that occurred at this prison, so he didn't have 

access to those and had to regain those. 

For a period of time, he was denied access

to the library and to a legal writer.  So there were a 

culmination of reasons why he didn't do this, but I 

think two of the critical ones were looking for counsel 

and trying to develop more evidence. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, as your -- as your 

adversary says, there's nothing really procedurally 

complicated about filing a Federal habeas.  There --

there are forms -- I've read hundreds of them -- that 

have been filed by pro se petitioners, and there is 

nothing technical about claiming, "I'm innocent of this 

offense." 

This isn't a legal issue.  It's something 

anybody can understand.  I've got an -- I've got my 

sister's affidavit, I have an affidavit by a third 

person, I have an affidavit by -- by a person who worked 

in the dry cleaning shop that shows that I'm actually 

innocent. 

Why doesn't -- what is the reason for 

waiting 5 years to file that? 

MR. READLER:  Well, Justice Alito, no -- no 

rational petitioner is going to want to wait in that 

period because, if they file within the 1-year period, 

they go straight to review on their habeas claims, and 

they don't have to worry about any procedural gateway. 

So -- so no rational -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But I just -- I don't understand 

Official

3  from obtaining the last affidavit to the filing of the 

4  Federal habeas.  You said he couldn't get a lawyer.  He 

5

really didn't need a lawyer to do this.  He didn't have 

6  access to a library.  This isn't a legal issue -- isn't 

7  a complicated legal issue.  It's a factual issue, that 

8  anybody who watches detective shows on TV can 

9  understand. 

10

MR. READLER:  Well -- and, Justice Alito, 

11  you're right, we're not arguing for equitable tolling 

12  here, in the sense that he could have filed earlier. 

13  There wasn't -- there wasn't a State impediment that 

14  stood in his way the entire period of time.  And he 

15

should have filed it earlier, and had he filed earlier, 

16  then he would have gone straight to consideration of his 

17  underlying habeas claims and wouldn't have to worry 

18  about this high hurdle of satisfying --

19

20

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But you think that Congress, 

which, in AEDPA, was trying to speed all this up and get 

21  rid of the delay and make things simpler, intended to 

22  allow that?  You could wait 5 years, you could wait 10 

23  years, you could wait 15 years; it doesn't matter? 

24  That's what AEDPA was intended to do?

you're correct that AEDPA was intended to delay -- or to 

end delay when possible -- but, as the Court said in 

Holland, AEDPA was not meant to end every delay at all 

costs.  I think this is exactly the situation it had in 

mind. 

In Calderon, the Court recognized that the 

miscarriage of justice exception is consistent with 

AEDPA because -- because it arises so rarely that, in 

the vast majority of cases, the finality and comity 

concerns that the State has are honored because there's 

no -- there's no additional proceeding, the petitioner 

will not meet the high Schlup standard, and the case 

will end. 

But, in the rare case where a petitioner can 

satisfy Schlup, the Court has always said that the 

courthouse doors, in that circumstance, will be open to 

review of your first Federal petition.  And that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Second Circuit --

when it had a similar case, the Second Circuit itself 

said that actual innocence is rare.  This is such a 

case.  This is a case where the alibi that he had was --

it was established by forensic evidence, air-tight, he 

was someplace else.  The -- the Second Circuit didn't 

send it to the district court to decide the actual 

innocence.

It decided that itself and then said, 

district court, now you deal with the -- with the 

questions that the petitioner is raising -- the 

constitutional questions.  But the Sixth Circuit just 

seemed to be -- it didn't matter whether -- it didn't 

matter whether the actual innocence claim had any solid 

basis, when they sent it back to the district court. 

Shouldn't -- if there is an actual innocence 

gateway, shouldn't the court of appeals determine that 

before it returns the case to the district court? 

MR. READLER:  I think, ordinarily, yes.  The 

Sixth Circuit said, here, that there was a gateway, and 

it was remanding the case back to the district court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but it didn't find 

anything about whether this was -- this claim was -- was 

a good one. 

correct --

MR. READLER:  That's correct.  That's 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I'm still puzzled 

about what happens next.  The case goes back to the 

district court and the -- the district court is told, 

diligence doesn't matter.  The district court says, yes, 

but I thought -- I thought that the claim was worthless. 

MR. READLER:  Well, it's correct that the 

case should be remanded back to the district court, just

like this case -- just like the Court did in Schlup, 

where it announced the standard and remanded back to the 

district court for application. 

But, here, I disagree with that reading of 

the underlying opinion, in that the Court doesn't set 

out in sort of weighing all the evidence and saying, 

here's what I find in favor of the petitioner and here's 

what I find in favor of the State.  What the district 

court said is that -- it said the timing of the evidence 

was somehow a problem because the information was known 

at trial, which I think is, again, wrong for two 

reasons. 

I think the petitioner has -- is able to use 

the information because the problem for us was his 

attorney was told about some of these things, but didn't 

actually assert them -- or didn't interview one of the 

key witnesses.  One of the affiants was on the 

prosecution's witness list, and my client's lawyer 

didn't even interview that person, let alone call them. 

And then the court -- I think the court --

the trial court misunderstood Schlup because Schlup 

allows you to consider all the evidence, old and new, 

make appropriate credibility determinations, consider 

the timeliness of the evidence, and determine whether 

that standard has been met.

And I think that's what should happen here 

for the -- for the first time, in our view.  And there 

is a question -- there was a question, earlier, with 

respect to how often the Schlup standard is met.  In 

response to the reply brief, we did a search of circuit 

courts.  And we found, since Schlup was decided, eight 

circuits that have upheld or have found that Schlup was 

satisfied. 

If you add in House, then that adds nine 

appellate cases where Schlup was satisfied.  So it's --

it's a narrow range of cases.  It shouldn't be difficult 

to meet, but we --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but, I mean, 

the whole question -- and your friend made the -- made 

the point -- the question is how many are filed, in how 

many cases does the claim arise, not how few times it's 

upheld. 

MR. READLER:  Sure.  Mr. Chief Justice, I 

suspect, no matter the rules, there will always be 

filings by petitioners, and many of those may be 

frivolous.  But, as the Court has said in Panetti and 

other cases -- you know, unmeritorious petitions can be 

dismissed at the earliest course, and it's consistent 

with Habeas Rule 4. 

That's what should happen in this instance,

too.  But it's -- and it's awfully --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you know 

which of these are meritorious and which aren't?  Is 

this the meritorious -- I assume you think this is a 

meritorious one? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. READLER:  We -- we do, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And your friend says 

nobody can reasonably think this person is innocent. 

Maybe he has constitutional claims.  But, if you look at 

the evidence, is this something, at the -- a preliminary 

stage, you look and say, oh, this guy's clearly 

innocent, and this goes forward? 

Or is it one that you can cast aside? 

MR. READLER:  I don't think it's one you can 

cast aside.  I think you -- you have to give this more 

development.  And, by the way, he was proceeding pro se. 

I think, when he -- when the case is remanded, with 

assistance of counsel, he can present -- better present 

the evidence and better present some other things, to 

make -- make the showing stronger.  And I think we can 

meet the Schlup standard. 

If there are no further questions, we'd ask 

that the Sixth Circuit be affirmed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Bursch, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. BURSCH:  Three brief points about 

Holland and some closing thoughts about diligence. 

With respect to Holland, I want to note, 

first of all, that, there, you were dealing with 

legislative silence.  Everyone agreed that Congress had 

not said anything about equitable tolling. 

And, as I explained earlier, when you 

consider the three categories of defendants who claim 

actual innocence based on new evidence, this situation 

here, where the new evidence relates to the factual 

predicate of the constitutional claim asserted, that's 

where Congress, most clearly, meant to have the 

limitations period apply. 

So it's very different.  With respect to 

equitable tolling applying to acts of Congress, everyone 

recognizes that.  Mr. Chief Justice, you note that this 

has never been applied to limitations.  I actually have 

to take issue with my friend's statement that Sanders 

and Kuhlmann, somehow, took a different tack because, in 

both of those cases, what Congress did is it left it to 

the district judge's discretion to do or not do

something. 

Official 

And all this Court said was, well, if 

they've got discretion, then they can still have an 

equitable exception.  So, even in those cases, this 

miscarriage of justice exception has never, ever been 

used to override a congressional act. 

The last thing is that, in equitable 

tolling, you are dealing with the fault of the 

petitioner -- Hurricane Katrina or something else 

happened that wasn't their fault.  And, here, it's 

entirely within the Petitioner's control. 

All they have to do is print the form, check 

the boxes, attach the evidence, and then file the claim. 

And they have an unlimited time to find evidence and 

then, 1 year after that, to file. 

Now, with respect to diligence --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, you had suggested, 

earlier, some way out of this puzzle about why Congress 

would have put the actual innocence exception into the 

second successive petition provision and not had one for 

a first petition? 

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that seems really quite 

odd to me.  I mean, a number of my colleagues have said, 

well, can we really believe that Congress contemplated

this.  But, I mean, don't we have evidence that Congress 

contemplated it in the second and successive context, a 

slightly tighter version, wouldn't it be quite odd to 

say that Congress contemplated an actual innocence 

exception when you are on your second petition, but 

barred it when you are on your first? 

What sense would that be? 

MR. BURSCH:  Yeah, let me explain that and 

I'm glad you raised that because -- you know, besides 

the legislative history that informs what we are looking 

at here, what they did in 2244(d)(1)(D) is they made it 

broader.  They said, even if you don't claim innocence, 

if you are coming forward with new evidence, we want the 

court to hear that constitutional claim, if you bring it 

within one year. 

The reason they didn't mention it there is 

because it would have made the provision narrower, and 

they didn't want to do that.  Then they ratcheted it up 

with respect to successive petitions, making you pass 

through the successive petition actual innocence gateway 

and then comply with the limitations period, so that's 

the explanation, consistent were with legislative 

history. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess I'm just not 

sure I understand that.  I mean, they could have added a 

62
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  separate provision, just saying there's an actual 

2  innocence exception, or there is -- there's not, 

3  consistent with the way they did it in the -- in the 

4  second and successive petition. 

5

MR. BURSCH:  Right, they could have, but, 

6  again, that would have limited (d)(1)(D). 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it didn't have to. 

8  Why would it have necessarily have limited (d)(1)(D)? 

9

10

 MR. BURSCH:  Well, if they said there is an 

exception for those who claim actual innocence, the 

11  implication is, for those who don't claim actual 

12  innocence, you are out of luck. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you just you make the 

14  converse clear. 

15

MR. BURSCH:  Well, if we could rewrite 

16  congressional statutes with hindsight -- you know, maybe 

17  we could draft a perfect statute. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  All I'm suggesting is that your 

19  interpretation of the statute creates a glaring anomaly 

20

that people would be out of court on the first petition, 

21  and they could turn around on their second petition, 

22  which is usually disfavored, and get an actual innocence 

23  exception. 

24

25

 MR. BURSCH:  No, that -- that's not the way 

that we interpret this at all.  Under either provision, 

63
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

you are stuck with (d)(1)(D), you have got to file 

within a year.  All that the successive petition adds to 

it is that you do have a statutory actual innocence 

gateway to pass through first that you don't have on your 

first petition.  That's our position. 

I do want to close with some thoughts about 

diligence.  You know, looking for counsel, we've talked 

about how simple it is to -- to file these things.  The 

papers lost in the -- the prison riot and the access to 

the library are related, and it's because Defendant 

Perkins incited the prison riot, so he is hardly in an 

equitable position of -- of claiming any tolling benefit 

from that. 

And with respect to the -- the rule, 

Justice Breyer, we can't have a diligence rule if you go 

to that point, based on intent, because the interest 

that is being vindicated here is not the purpose of the 

Petitioner in --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you think about the 

words "discovered in exercise of due diligence"?  You 

know, you could manipulate those words so as to deal 

with the circumstance of the -- say, below-average IQ 

person who doesn't have a lawyer, who isn't certain 

about what to do, and what counts as diligence and 

discovery in that case.

account that the State's interest in timeliness is at 

its apex when we are dealing with new evidence that 

relates to the actual constitutional claim.  And they 

are asking for -- not equitable tolling, but 

extraordinary tolling that you should reject.
