CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in Number 000-878, Richard L. Mathias


v. WorldCom Technologies.


Mr. Bertocchi.  Am I pronouncing your name


correctly?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Yes, you are, Mr. Chief Justice.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. BERTOCCHI


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,


and may it please the Court:


The local telecommunication provisions of the


Telecommunications Act of 1996 introduced competition into


local telephone markets.  The act did so in sections 251


and 252.  Section 251 imposes the obligation to


interconnect, and requires incumbent carriers to enter


into agreements that will provide access to their


competitors to those incumbents' networks.


Section 252 prescribes procedures under which


those agreements, contracts, as they are, are negotiated,


arbitrated, approved, and filed, and the act stops there. 


It does not go on to interpret -- to discuss


interpretation or enforcement of those agreements.


From its title through its text, section 252

demonstrates that Congress was silent regarding


interpretation and enforcement.  Nonetheless,


interpretation is not unaccounted for, because into that


silence, under preexisting law, stepped the States.  That


preexisting law, still good under the 1996 act, not


preempted or repealed by it, provides that the


interpretation of these contracts is a State law process


which has been deliberately left by Congress to State


regulators, including State judges, who will apply State


contract law to those provisions.


QUESTION:  Can I ask a very preliminary, quick,


I hope -- and I hope you'll have a conclusive answer.  I


can't get an answer.  It's a procedural matter.  I take it


you won below.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  We --


QUESTION:  You won on the merits.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Yes.


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, I've always thought


that you appeal from a judgment, basically.  The judgment


now under the Seventh Circuit says, you win.  But what


you're saying is, their reason was the wrong one.  We


should have won because there was no jurisdiction or there


was a Fourth Amendment bar.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And the reason they gave for our

winning was wrong.  Well, I didn't think you could appeal


that kind of thing.  Judges make mistakes in their


reasoning all the time.  I do, too, and if you could


appeal from the reasoning of an opinion, as opposed to the


judgment, we'd be here 700 days a year, so -- and I can't


find a case where that happened, so is that -- and I hope


there's a conclusive answer to what I say, because it's


terrible if the case washes out for that reason.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I believe the


conclusive answer is that our assertion that there was no


jurisdiction over us and that we -- if there was


jurisdiction over us and over this cause of action, we are


asserting immunity as a claim that we can bring regardless


of the result on the merits.


QUESTION:  And is there any precedent at all


where that's ever happened before?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I cannot -- I'm


afraid I cannot cite you to any.  I believe that these


questions are preserved regardless of the merits.  I


cannot point you to --


QUESTION:  Does the opinion below cause you some


kind of continuing injury?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Well, it does, Your Honor, in


the sense that it is going to, if it stands, result in our


continuing to be brought to Federal court, in spite of the

immunity that we assert, and it is going to continue to


place these cases in Federal court even though we believe


that they are properly State court cases completely, and


that our State court should have the opportunity to review


these, to review all the matters that are raised, and to


fulfill both their duty to apply State law and their


obligation to consider whether their State law


construction in any way is inconsistent with Federal law.


QUESTION:  There's a patent case in 307 U.S.


that says -- where the lower court ruled both on


infringement and on the validity of the patent, and the


person who sought to -- had won on one of them.  This


Court said you could have a decision on the other point. 


That might be of some help to you.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  I appreciate that, Your Honor,


and I will have a look.


QUESTION:  Except, isn't it the ordinary rule


that when -- there may be a special consideration in that


patent context, and maybe yours is also, but I had thought


that reasons that went against the judgment winner do not


get any kind of preclusive effect, so that you would not


be bound by this jurisdictional holding which was against


you.  You prevailed on the merits, you have that judgment,


so you don't -- you're not stopped, precluded from


relitigating the case.  In other words, the two go

together.  If you can't appeal it, then you're not bound


by it.  Isn't that --


MR. BERTOCCHI:  I understand, Your Honor.  I


believe, though, that we -- that the district courts of


the Seventh Circuit would consider themselves bound by the


Seventh Circuit's decision, and we would have to go to


court to litigate that, which we believe would be a


violation of our immunity, and in addition, we believe


that the jurisdiction would not be there, and by doing


that we would essentially be being kept out, as we have


been kept out of our State courts for at least some period


of time, and in that sense I believe that there is a


continuing injury that results from this.


QUESTION:  Your injury results at least in a


formal sense from the fact that, in order to get the


review which the companies sought, they made your State


regulators defendants in a case, is that correct?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  They subjected them to -- the


individual commissioners to suit and made them defend


their rule, yes, sir.


QUESTION:  But the essence of what they were --


the essence of what the companies were claiming was not


some kind of right asserted against the State as a


sovereign entity or against these regulators in official


or individual capacity.  The essence of what was going on

was an attempt to review in effect a regulatory decision. 


Why does that implicate immunity in the sense that we


usually think of immunity in Eleventh Amendment issues to


be implicated?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I think it does so


for two reasons.  First, if you take a look at the


complaint that Ameritech filed, Ameritech asserted in its


complaint that it had been injured by the actions of the


State commissioners.


QUESTION:  Well, but that's -- anyone who loses


a case has been injured by the actions of the judge who


made a mistake of law, or by the regulator in a regulatory


case, so that in itself doesn't take it out of the usual


attempt simply to get review of a judicial or a quasi-


judicial decision that you say is wrong.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  That's correct, Your Honor, but


the result -- the other thing that the complaint does is,


it names the individual commissioners as defendants.  It


subjects them to the jurisdiction of the Federal court,


and it raises issues as to whether -- which we have argued


at great length in all of our briefs, as to whether that


violates sovereign immunity.


QUESTION:  But that's a formality.  It seems to


me that by naming them the -- those who are appealing are


doing nothing more than saying, look, these people in

their adjudicatory capacity made a mistake, we want that


mistake reviewed, in the same sense that people work their


way up through levels of appeal in the judicial system,


and that certainly is not a classic example of the kind of


implication of State sovereignty which the immunity


doctrines and the Eleventh Amendment have addressed.  I


guess I'm saying, is this really a case that implicates


Eleventh Amendment immunity?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, we believe it does. 


I will admit that as things have turned out, in light of


the fact that the district court and the Seventh Circuit


did not disagree with the decision of the commission,


there have -- none of the parade of possible bad things


have happened to us.  There has been no injunction entered


against us.  There has been no contempt proceeding.  At


this point there might not be an award of attorney's fees,


but that's because of the way the case came out.


QUESTION:  Is it your position that the private


parties could have brought the case to the district court


without naming the commission?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, not in this


interpretation case, no.  We believe we were necessary


parties, but we believe that because we believe these are


State actions and that we are -- and we are necessary


parties under State law to administrative review.

 QUESTION:  But does that, again, put you in any


different position from a State commission in a run-of-


the-mill utilities case, even within -- let's say just


within the State system, to keep it simple?  In some,


maybe all States, if there is an appeal from a rate order


the regulatory body can be represented by counsel and say,


you know, we got it right, don't reverse us, but they are


not regarded as parties to litigation in the classic


sense.


So you could have been -- I guess what I'm


saying is, you could have been heard, which is one of the


consequences of the way they went about this procedurally,


but you could have been heard without being a party in the


usual sense.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, given the fact that


this was a Federal court reviewing a State proceeding, we


might well have been able to be heard if the district


judge had allowed us in, and again, as I indicated -- and


I believe this is still in response to the question -- it


has turned out that because the district court agreed with


us, nothing has happened to us that doesn't happen to us


in State court when our decisions are affirmed.


But in State appellate proceedings from Illinois


Commerce Commission orders, when the appellate court


disagrees, it enters a decree that invalidates or in some

way amends or remands the order.  That is not the type of


relief that is contemplated in the full range of a Federal


equity suit in which commissioners are named as


individuals or even, I would submit, in a case in which


the State commission were named as a party.


In this case, Ameritech did not sue the State


commission, for reasons I'm not quite sure I understand,


but we're willing to, because we're here, assume that the


commissions are -- commissioners are an acceptable


substitute, but even in that instance, the order is


entered by the tribunal, by the appellate tribunal on the


State side against -- an order is entered that simply


supervenes the commission's order.


In this instance, Ameritech filed a complaint


asking for the Federal court to enter orders that are


specifically directed at the commissioners and, if they


had sued the commission, would have been specifically


directed at the commission.  That is relief that we don't


believe is contemplated by the statute, but we also think


it's significantly -- it could be significantly different. 


It hasn't turned out that way -- excuse me.  It hasn't


turned out that way in this case, because the district


court and the Seventh Circuit have agreed on the merits,


but it could have, and that was our concern, and that is


why we are here, because we don't know how it's going to

turn out in the next case.


Your Honors, these proceedings, interpretive of


the contracts as they were, did not take place under


section 252.  That qualifier is critical to jurisdiction


under section (e)(6) and, indeed, limits any application


of (e)(6).  It does not make any difference -- respondents


have devoted a substantial amount of energy to this, but


really it does not make any difference if we are talking


about an action, a case, a determination, whatever it is


that the commission does still must be done under 252 in


order for jurisdiction to attach under 252(e)(6), and in


that respect the text and scope of section 252 is plain. 


It goes as far as the filing, the formation and filing of


the agreement --


QUESTION:  Where do we find section 252 in the


briefs?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, if you take a look


at the blue brief in -- we've attached both sections 251


and 252 as an appendix, and 252 starts at page 12a of that


appendix.


QUESTION:  Suppose that you're in the State


court and you've won, and they've sued you in the State


court, and then suppose that their claim is the following,


the agreement as interpreted by the commission does not


meet the requirements of section 251, including the

regulations prescribed in the FCC pursuant to section 251,


and then the judge asks you this question:  Counsel, where


is the law that says it has to meet the requirements of


section 251, including the regulations prescribed by the


FCC pursuant to section 251?  Where is that law?  What was


the answer?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, if we're talking


about an interpretation case, the answer is essentially a


combination of State law, which now makes compliance with


Federal law, with the act, a requirement, and the general


requirement that in any case that a State court hears, it


not contravene Federal law.  That law --


QUESTION:  It's not in 252?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  No, Your Honor, it's not, if we


are talking about an interpretation.  To read that


language into 252 is to suggest that an interpretation is


really a modification, and I think those things are very


distinct concepts of the law.


If it happens during an approval process, that's


different, but that would be my response.  I think in the


end the result would be the same, because the State court


is clearly required in any case, and certainly in one of


these cases, to determine whether it -- its decision, its


construction of the contract follows Federal law.  That's


what the commission did in this case, and that's what the

Illinois appellate court would do.


QUESTION:  Are you saying that in a post


determination interpretation case, that the commission


doesn't look to 251 and 252, it can't look there?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  It -- well, Your Honor,


interestingly enough, in this case it can't, because this


was -- the provisions that deal with reciprocal


compensation in this case were negotiated, and they're not


required to comply with the act,  but even in a case where


there had been an arbitration, and where there was an


issue with respect to that, I believe that certainly the


commission -- certainly the court could look to Federal


law and see if there was anything that didn't comply with


251 and 252.


QUESTION:  I mean, it's just a very odd concept


that the State commission launches this vehicle having


looked at the Federal law, and then subsequent


interpretation doesn't involve Federal law.  It's just --


that's just hard for me to understand.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  I think the interpretation will


involve Federal law in many instances, Your Honor, but the


interpretation cases are going to be driven by State law,


and this case is another good example of that.


In this case, the way the commission, I think,


looked at this case is the proper way.  They construed the

contract first and then determined whether their


construction violated any Federal law, including FCC


rulings, and decided that it did not, so I am not at all


suggesting --


QUESTION:  What if they had decided that it did? 


I think that's the question. 

What if they had decided,


having construed it, well, you know, this is really what


it says, but boy, if we interpret it this way, it violates


the act?  Then what do they do?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Then I think that they would


have to construe it differently.  They would have to --


QUESTION:  How can you construe it differently? 


I mean, it says what it says.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Well, they cannot -- they are --


QUESTION:  So then they're not doing


construction any more, they're doing application of


Federal law.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  I think, Your Honor, in that


instance, if they wanted -- if the contract could survive,


what they would do is, they would say the Federal law


superseded whatever State contract principle they applied


in construing it in the first place.


QUESTION:  Well, there isn't any Federal law of


contracts.  There may be a lot of Federal law of


telecommunications, but the two could certainly be

regarded as separate, I think.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Exactly, Your Honor.  There is


not a law --


QUESTION:  And if they came to that conclusion,


that although they construe the law of contracts to have


reading A, nonetheless reading A violates or does not


violate the Federal statute, do you still maintain there


is no Federal jurisdiction to review that, neither under


the provision at issue in this case nor under 1331?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  We do maintain that, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Even though it's no longer an


interpretation question?  They are no longer interpreting


the contract.  They have interpreted it, but they say,


having interpreted it this way, we find that this way


violates Federal law, and therefore we disallow it, and


there's still no review of that --


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Yes --


QUESTION:  -- under 1331?


QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me your position 


on 252 and in response to your question from Justice -- is


very likely well-taken.  I think your position is 1331 is


harder to defend.  How do you defend that?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Well, Your Honor, with respect


to section 1331, we start our analysis back at section


252.  We believe that -- and I think that the case that

comes closest to describing the way this would work is the


Jackson Transit case.


Jackson Transit -- in Jackson Transit, the Court


seemed to assume 1331 jurisdiction but went on to say, we


have to take a look at congressional intent to determine


whether those contracts which are required to be in place


by Federal law, whether litigation over whether those


contracts are binding and what they mean should take place


in Federal or State court, and we believe, again, that the


silence regarding interpretation in section 252 and the


remedy provided in section 252(e)(6) suggests that that is


the remedy that Congress intended to be made available.


QUESTION:  But you're relying on silence


regarding interpretation, and in the hypothesis we were


just discussing, it was no longer an interpretive


question.  The State court, or the State commission had


decided the interpretation.  Having decided it, they moved


to another question, does this interpretation violate the


Federal statute?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Yes, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  You say they have to move to that


second question, and if they do, they just override their


interpretation, but that's no longer an interpretive


question, it seems to me, at that point, so your


distinguishing of section 252 doesn't --

 MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I -- it is no longer


an interpretive question, but the proceeding is still an


interpretive proceeding.  We read 252 to cover a certain


type of proceeding that leads to approval and ends at a


very particular point.


Respondents point out that this is not the end


point for disputes under the contract, and that is


certainly likely to be true, but it is the end point for


how far 252 goes, and the fact that Federal issues may


come up afterwards does not change the fact that Congress


in 252(e)(6) provided a very specific remedy that was


designed to review matters that were decided in the


approval process.  We believe that that jurisdictional


restriction operates both with respect to 252(e)(6) and


suggests that it applies under -- that a limitation should


be placed on 1331 jurisdiction as well.


QUESTION:  But it suggests there's a large


lacuna between the approval process and the interpretation


process, which is -- you know, I can understand how you


can construe 252 that way, but I think you have to read


252 as precluding 1331 jurisdiction, and I think that's a


more difficult question.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  It is more difficult, Your


Honor, but I believe that that's what it does.  We're


talking about --

 QUESTION:  Isn't it -- isn't the difficulty


this, that -- I mean, we don't lightly imply a negative on


1331 jurisdiction, and it's perfectly possible to read the


sentence in subsection (6) as simply saying, whatever the


State commission may do in applying these two sections


gets Federal court review, and going no further than


simply to make it clear that you do get Federal court


review of it, in effect as a regulatory matter.  If you


read it that way, which the text certainly allows you to


do, 1331 stands.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I believe that to


read it that way and then -- and to include


interpretation, enforcement proceedings under it would


essentially read the words under 252 under the statute. 


Certainly there is a difference between the language, the


word determination and the language in the actual


preemption provision in (e)(4) that says, approvals or


rejections, but -- and the respondents argue that that


suggests that determinations is a broader term.


Our position is that it doesn't matter whether


it's a broader term, but our -- that if it's not under


252, it doesn't matter what kind of action it is, and


interpretations and enforcements are not covered by that


statute.  It's a very particular statute that goes only so


far and no further.

 In addition, it seems that that argument and the


use of those words is somewhat inconsistent, because the


United States suggests that the more specific terms in


(e)(4) suggest that determinations must mean anything that


happens in a case related to these contracts, but it seems


to me if approvals and agreements in (e)(4) is a narrow


term, then approvals and agreements, which is all 252


addresses, is -- must be read equally as a narrow term,


and it's inconsistent to say that determinations under 252


goes beyond that.


QUESTION:  Well, approvals, agreements and


arbitration.  You would agree that would be covered, too?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And did you say -- did I understand


you correctly to say that if this particular issue had


come up at the time of approval, then there would be


Federal court review, so if something -- the character of


the issue has nothing to do with it.  It's just, if it


comes up in one proceeding, Federal court, if it doesn't


come up simultaneously, the very same question doesn't


come up simultaneously, then you have this split.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Exactly, Your Honor.  We believe


that that procedural difference is the basis for the

distinction, but we believe that that distinction is


entirely rational is in accord with what happens in the


life of contracts.


In real life, in contracts outside the context


of telecommunications, issues will come up in negotiation


and maybe there'll be a contract and maybe there won't. 


If the same issue comes up once the contract is in force


and the parties can't reach an agreement, which they have


the opportunity to do in any case, then they have to go to


court, someone has to go to court to get it enforced, so


the notion that the timing of an issue affects where it's


going to be litigated is not at all surprising, and is


entirely consistent with what we believe Congress' intent


was in 252.


QUESTION:  Yes, but in an ordinary private


contract, if the State court refuses to enforce the


contract, let's say on the ground that it would be a


contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade


and thus violate the Sherman Act, you would be able to get


review of that determination in Federal court, wouldn't


you?


But you're saying that this contract can be


overridden and disallowed by a State court on a Federal


ground with no review of that Federal ground by any


Federal court, so that you can have different

interpretations of the Sherman Act all around the country,


with no Federal court being able to review it.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, my belief is that if


a State court invalidated a contract on Federal grounds,


appeal would be to the State appellate court, and the


Federal court that would be able to review that


determination if it was wrong is this Court, so there is


always going to be a Federal court that can determine


that.  What -- and the --


QUESTION:  We can review it because there is a


Federal question involved --


MR. BERTOCCHI:  If that were --


QUESTION:  -- but for purposes of 1331 there's


no Federal question involved?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  For purposes of 1331, there may


be Federal issues involved, but we believe that there is a


specific congressional intent, reflected in the


specificity of 252 -- you can look at it as silence, or


you can look at it as specificity -- in the specificity of


252 to have these matters litigated in State court, and


again I would cite Jackson Transit for the proposition


that whether there is an arising under question under 1331


does not mean you still don't look to the question of


where the contracts are litigated.


In that case, the contracts had to be there

because of Federal law.  They had to be honored because of


Federal law, but there was a legislative intent that was


discerned by this Court to have those -- the binding -- to


have the litigation concerning those contracts take place


in State court.


QUESTION:  Why --


QUESTION:  Let's assume we can --


QUESTION:  Why would they?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  I mean, you know in order to --


QUESTION:  That's my question, too.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  I'm going to ask the same question.


QUESTION:  In order to win your 1331 point, you


have to show that Congress really wanted this


interpretation that you're giving of 252, right, it really


wanted it and had a pretty good reason for it.


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  What's the reason?  I mean, it


creates a pretty big mess, doesn't it?  We're going to get


into a new jurisprudence of what's an interpretation and


what's an approval, and you're going to start splitting


the documents apart and it sounds to me like a mess, and I


don't know why -- maybe Congress wrote those words, but


why would they want such a thing?

 MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I think they would


want such a thing because the Telecommunications Act


represents a change in the way utilities are regulated,


and although everybody agrees that that is true, I think


that the respondents misapprehend the change.  The change


is to reduce regulation over the parties to


telecommunications transactions once access is assured. 


The interest in this case was access, and once that's over


with, these are to be -- these cases are to be treated, I


believe, like regular contracts cases.


This case, again, is a good example.  It was


driven by State law and the Federal questions came up


afterwards in determining whether the construction was


proper, and in that instance I think Congress intended to


leave the matters to State -- to the State commission


under State law and to State courts.


QUESTION:  No, but that still doesn't explain --


I mean, you've still got the mess that Justice Breyer


referred to.  Why would Congress want to legislate that


kind of bifurcation that makes for all of this confusion?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I think Congress


would want to do it because it recognized that most of


these cases were going to be like this one.  This is not a


case about access, which is --


QUESTION:  And Congress would have wanted this

to happen?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Why?


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Well, Your Honor, I think --


this, in the sense of State courts deciding, construing


these contracts and then deciding any incidental Federal


law questions under their normal obligation to do so. 


Yes, we think that's what they wanted, and we think that's


what they wanted because they would recognize, as in this


case, that these cases are State-law driven.


The goal of the act is access.  This case is not


about access.  The respondent, the competing telecom


companies had had access, they will have access, they have


it today, and they will have it tomorrow.  This case is


about whether Ameritech owes them money.  That is a


contracts case.  It may implicate Federal law, as any


State contracts case theoretically could, but we believe


that Congress wanted them to be treated as contracts


cases.


I'll reserve the remainder of my time, if I may.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES


MS. McDOWELL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:


The Federal district courts have subject matter


jurisdiction over cases contending that a State public


utility commission has construed and enforced an


interconnection agreement in a manner contrary to Federal


law.  That's true whether one looks specifically at


section 252(e)(6) of the 1996 act, or more generally at --


QUESTION:  Well, let's look specifically at 252,


and 252(6), where it says in any case in which a State


commission makes a determination under this section, and


all the section talks about is approval.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, Your Honor, the section


establishes specific procedures to be followed at the


arbitration and approval stage.


QUESTION:  But it talks only about -- you agree,


don't you, that it -- substantively it deals only with the


approval?


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct, but these


agreements exist only by virtue of section 252.  The State


commissioners have authority to regulate these agreements


only by virtue of section 252.  They're subject to the


standards of section 252, and --


QUESTION:  But all it talks about is approval. 


I don't think you've answered my question.


MS. McDOWELL:  No, it doesn't speak specifically

about interpretation and enforcement.


QUESTION:  Speak specifically or any other way


about it.


MS. McDOWELL:  But this Court said in the


Ardestani case, for example, that under a statutory


provision means subject to or by authority of, and State


commissions are acting by authority of section 252 when


they're construing and enforcing interconnection


agreements.  They have no other authority under Federal


law to do that.


QUESTION:  Well, Ms --


QUESTION:  Do they have authority under State


law to do that?  If we asked the Solicitor from


Illinois -- I didn't have time to ask him -- what is the


authority by which the State commission proceeded in this


case, what would he have said, do you think, and would


you -- and is that the same as your position?


(Laughter.)


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, we don't have to guess,


because the State commission specifically said what


authority it was proceeding under, and it cited both


section 252 and Illinois law, and certainly a State


commission, whenever it takes an official act, is acting


at least in part under its own State law --

QUESTION:  So you say it -- are you saying that


necessarily the State commission must be acting under 252?


MS. McDOWELL:  When it's regulating an


interconnection agreement that's established by virtue of


section 252, yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  252 --


QUESTION:  Ms. McDowell, I -- go on, Tony,


finish.


QUESTION:  Well, I was just going to say, 252


refers to public interest, convenience, and necessity.  Is


that a Federal standard, or does that just incorporate


State standards from State to State, or is it a little bit


of both, because most States have a formulation something


like that.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, it's a Federal standard. 


It's a standard that's been incorporated in the


communications laws for many years.  The States, pursuant


to section 252(e)(3), are allowed to also impose


consistent State standards in the course of their


approval, and interpretation we would say of the


interconnection agreements as well, but it's basically a


Federal standard.  It's one under which the FCC could


promulgate regulations to instruct the State commissions

and to --


QUESTION:  Ms. McDowell, I have a problem with


other language in this (e)(6).  One of the arguments you


make is that it doesn't make any sense to bifurcate these


proceedings, that they should all be in the Federal court,


the interpretation as well as the approval.  The problem


is, the only thing that (e)(6) allows the Federal district


court to determine is not the interpretation of the


contract.  It does not give the Federal court authority to


determine what the contract says.  It only gives it


authority, I quote, to determine whether the agreement or


statement meets the requirements of section 25 and this


section.


Now, in some cases, there may be a dispute


between the parties as to whether a particular


interpretation will violate the Federal rules, but there


are going to be a lot of other contract disputes that have


nothing to do with whether there's a violation of the


Federal rules.  Now, are all of those contract cases going


to go to State court, and all of the contract cases that


somehow involve the question of whether the agreement or


statement meets the requirements of this section, do they


go to Federal court, or do you just ignore those words,


that limitation?  To determine whether the agreement or


statement meets the requirements of section 25 and this

section, that's the only authority the Federal court has.


MS. McDOWELL:  I agree with you, Your Honor, and


the --


QUESTION:  So you're still going to have some


bifurcation?  You're still going to have some contract


cases that go to the State court, and some that go to the


Federal court?  Is that --


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, you may have bifurcation,


or there are other alternatives.  For example, at the


interpretation and enforcement stage the parties would be


free to go to State court.  There's not an exclusive


direction of the parties to Federal court, as there is at


the approval stage under section (e)(4), and in some of


these cases State commissions may waive their sovereign


immunity and decide that they would rather have these


claims heard entirely in Federal court, and that would be


permissible as well under the supplemental --


QUESTION:  What about under 1331?  Would you say


everything gets into court under 1331, whether it deals


with deciding whether the agreement meets the requirements


of this section or not?  You would say the contract is a


Federal contract, so that under 1331 even the


interpretation of that contract gets into Federal court,


wouldn't you?


MS. McDOWELL:  We're not pressing that argument,

Your Honor, although Ameritech --


QUESTION:  Well, gee, you ought to, because


that's the only thing that will stop this terrible


bifurcation that you're so worried about.  It's still


going to be a mess.  You're going to have some cases in


Federal court and some in State court.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, there may be some such


cases, but as I was suggesting, there are alternatives to


that.  In addition, there may not be that many cases in


which there's a viable claim that a State commission has


interpreted an agreement contrary to Federal law.


These cases have typically come up only with


respect to this particular issue of compensation for


Internet calls, a very important issue to the carriers,


and one that they've been willing to litigate extensively,


but it's not clear at this early stage in the


implementation of the 1996 act that there are going to be


a large number of claims of this sort, so the thought that


there are going to be -- there's going to be a bifurcation


problem in every case is not clear, at least at this


stage.


QUESTION:  I'm still not entirely clear on what


your position is if the -- if there's an interpretation


dispute that doesn't raise any Federal question at all. 


Do you agree that that has to be resolved only in a State

court, or do you think they have a choice of forum?


MS. McDOWELL:  Unless there was some basis for


Federal jurisdiction, they would have to go to State court


for that --


QUESTION:  The only question is, do they have to


pay on Tuesday instead of Thursday, and that's governed by


some State common law rule or something.  That, you would


agree, could not be litigated in Federal court?


MS. McDOWELL:  We haven't yet taken a definitive


position on this question, Justice Stevens.  Ameritech is


arguing that these contracts, interconnection agreements


are pervasively Federal, similar to a Federal tariff, so


that every question that arises under them is necessarily


Federal.


We think for purposes of this case, and what the


court of appeals decided, what's relevant are only those


claims that contend that a State commission has violated


the 1996 act in its interpretation of an agreement, so


there may be a large category of cases that can come to


State court and that would present only issues of State


law.


QUESTION:  But, and could not go to Federal


court.  That's the other part of my question.  I didn't


quite get your answer to that.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, yes, unless there was a

waiver of sovereign immunity by the State commission and


diversity or some other basis for jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  Well, even if there's a waiver, I


mean, what is -- you have to have Federal jurisdiction


before you can sue in Federal court.


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct, and there may be


diversity.  Diversity was asserted, for example, in the


North Carolina case.


QUESTION:  Well, assume there's no diversity,


just a normal State law.  I'm still not quite clear


whether you say yes or no.  Do you agree with the carrier


that it is a pervasive -- like a tariff, so that anything


relating to it raises a Federal question, or do you agree


that they are a category of contract issues that could


only be regulated at State, or litigated in State court?


MS. McDOWELL:  We see it as a difficult question


on which we haven't taken a definitive position.  The


question ultimately is one of Congress' intent, and


certainly there is much in the statute to suggest that


Congress was creating federalized contracts.  These are


not simply private party agreements.  They are Federal


regulatory instruments.


On the other hand, Congress also left room for


States to apply their own consistent standards under


section (e)(5), and Congress also expressly preserved

not expressly preempted, so it's a more difficult question


whether these contracts are entirely Federal, and we have

QUESTION:  In all of the instances projected by


Justice Stevens, do you think the State would be a


necessary party, or would there be any cases in which, a


contract dispute where the State isn't a necessary party? 


The State is a necessary party because it goes first


through the commission?


MS. McDOWELL:  We don't think they're necessary


parties.  We think they're valuable parties to have


because it makes it easier to enforce the Federal court


or, indeed, a State court judgment, but we think that in


the ordinary case --


QUESTION:  Well but doesn't -- even in the case


Justice Stevens describes about paying Tuesday or


Thursday, isn't the presumption that there would have been


a State commission order which is now being set aside?


MS. McDOWELL:  Yes, or its enforcement is being


enjoined.  Typically, though, a --


QUESTION:  And they're not a necessary party,


then?


MS. McDOWELL:  No.  To the extent that there


will be two adverse parties to the proceeding, one

challenging the State commission's order and one defending


it, the party defending the order can ordinarily be


expected adequately to represent the State commission's


interest.


QUESTION:  District judges aren't parties to an


appeal from their decisions, are they?


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct, and certainly


Federal statutes are often challenged in cases in which


the United States is not involved.


QUESTION:  But if the FCC were performing this


role -- take Virginia's statement -- and you are appealing


the FCC's order, all those cases are you against the


commission.  Isn't it -- isn't that routine?


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct.  That's the


standard practice in the Federal system, and when the FCC


acts in the place of a State commission the FCC's


decisions will be reviewable in a proceeding in the court


of appeals under the Hobbs Act, in which the FCC is named


as a party.  That's the standard procedure, as we


understand it, and most States as well, that the agency


issuing a decision will be a party to proceedings


challenging it.  We don't see that as essential, though,


in this particular context.  We see no particular reason


to think the parties will not abide by the Federal court's


decision, and that the State commission also will not

abide by that.


QUESTION:  And the -- I mean, I take it the


reason you assume that is that the commission is not a


party in interest in the sense of having a personal stake. 


They have the same kind of stake, I suppose, that any


judge does when an order of his gets appealed, but that's


their only interest.


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct, Your Honor.


If I could turn briefly to the sovereign


immunity questions, as several courts of appeals have


recognized, this is a straightforward Ex parte Young case


against State officials.  The case is seeking prospective


injunctive relief to include their enforcement of orders


that are alleged to be contrary to Federal law.  Ex parte


Young itself was, the underlying action was one against


State regulatory commissioners, and there have been many


cases in this Court that have involved Federal challenges


to State regulatory decisions of this nature.


We see nothing in section 252(e)(6) or anything


else in the 1996 act that suggests a congressional intent


to preclude this sort of ex parte Young --


QUESTION:  Ex parte Young, though -- I'm trying


to recall the facts.  It was decided even before I was on


the Court.


(Laughter.)

 QUESTION:  It was enjoining a Minnesota Attorney


General, wasn't it, from doing something in the future?


MS. McDOWELL:  From enforcing rate orders issued


by the State commission.  The specific case before the


Court was contempt sanctions against the Attorney General,


but the underlying case was also against the State


regulatory commissioner.  Also, in Ex parte Young the


Court cited a number of prior decisions as authority,


including Reagan v. Farmer's Loan & Trust, which was


another similar type of action against State regulatory


commissioners.


We have --


QUESTION:  It's also -- would you correct -- as


long as we're on Ex parte Young, as I understand it, in Ex


parte Young, there was no action brought until the


executive branch of the State said, we're going to take


certain action here in accordance with this order.  In


other words, they -- Ex parte Young was not brought


immediately upon the issuance of the State rate order --


MS. McDOWELL:  I think it --


QUESTION:  -- as simply to review the order.


QUESTION:  It was brought because a -- somebody


in a different branch or agency of the Government said,


oh, now we are going to take some action under that which


is, in effect, going to hurt the person who brought the Ex

parte Young action.  Is my understanding correct?


MS. McDOWELL:  As I recall, and my understanding


may be inaccurate, the case was brought before any


enforcement action had actually been threatened or taken.


QUESTION:  But the Attorney General of the State


was going to enforce it, isn't that right?


MS. McDOWELL:  Oh, I think the Attorney General


was expected to enforce it.  There was a specific


Minnesota statute, as I recall, that --


QUESTION:  He had to.


MS. McDOWELL:  -- required him to enforce the


rate orders, but I don't think that that was critical to


the Court's holding.  There are many, many cases,


including several, in fact, against members of the


Illinois Commerce Commission, that have involved


challenges under Ex parte Young to rate orders and other


sorts of regulatory orders.


QUESTION:  Do you think it's sustainable to say


that there has been a waiver because -- by participation


in the State scheme, so that you don't need Ex parte


Young?


MS. McDOWELL:  We've argued that as well, Your


Honor.  That's dependent on whether the statute was


sufficiently clear to put the State commissioners on


notice that by exercising Federal regulatory authority

under the act they would thereby be subject to suit in

QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. McDowell.


Mr. Smith, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS WORLDCOM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.,


MCI WORLDCOM NETWORK SERVICES, INC., MCIMETRO ACCESS


SERVICES LLC, AND FOCAL COMMUNICATIONS CORP.


MR. SMITH: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The complaint that Ameritech filed in this case


in Federal court specifically alleged not only that the


ICC had misinterpreted the interconnection agreements at


issue, but also that its order requiring payment of


reciprocal compensation for a particular category of calls


violated several specific sections of the


Telecommunications Act as well as several allegedly


applicable FCC rulings.


For that reason, our position, and I'm arguing


today for WorldCom and several other companies who had


signed interconnection agreements with Ameritech and also


were sued as codefendants along with the ICC, our position


is that the complaint stated straightforward preemption


claims alleging ongoing violations of Federal law by State


officials and therefore those claims were within Federal

jurisdiction and also actionable notwithstanding the


Eleventh Amendment.


Where we differ with Ameritech and actually with


the final respondent AT&T is on the question that was


being discussed earlier, which is the scope of valid


Federal claims in enforcement cases, and specifically


whether a claim of mere misinterpretation of an


interconnection agreement raises any Federal issue or not. 


Our position is that in most cases, at least, a claim of


misinterpretation of an interconnection agreement would


raise claims only under State common law contracts and


therefore has to be treated as a State law claim, but in


terms of this case, since the contract -- the complaint


did allege violations of the statute and FCC rulings,


there certainly was jurisdiction, we believe.


Now, let me turn first to the jurisdiction


issue, and then I want to get to --


QUESTION:  Before you get into that, you're


separating interpretation of the contract from violation


of the Federal law.


MR. SMITH:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  Does that mean the State still has


control over what the contract means?  It's still a State


contract, and the ultimate determiner of what the contract


means ought to be the State, if it's State law, right?

 MR. SMITH:  Certainly it ought to be done by


virtue of some analysis of the intent of the parties, if


it's a negotiated agreement.  There also are agreements


which are imposed through arbitration, and then the


commission is essentially analyzing its own intent in


imposing --


QUESTION:  Yes, but different States have


different approaches.  They may even have different rules


of evidence and so forth.  What's going -- I don't see how


the Federal Government gets into this business without


taking on itself the burden of interpreting these


contracts.


MR. SMITH:  Well, Congress, Your Honor, very


specifically turns over responsibility for developing


these contracts, reviewing them, to State commissions, and


in the process of doing that says that while the State


commissions have to follow various substantive standards


in 251, they also are authorized in more than one place in


the act to impose their own policies that are not


inconsistent with the Federal policies, and it also said


the parties can negotiate agreements notwithstanding the


substantive provisions of the act, and that the State


commission can't overturn them unless they find that they


violate the public interest and necessity.


So what you have here is a very clear

recognition by Congress that they want these to be real


contracts, not merely orders applying Federal standards,


and that there will be lots of issues which under this


Court's ruling should be viewed as State law contract


issues that will come up in the enforcement proceedings,


so we don't see any basis under Jackson Transit and this


Court's other cases dealing with the development of


Federal common law for saying that the contract


interpretation rules, the rules for determining how the


contract ought to be read, ought to be elaborated as a


matter of Federal common law in the Federal courts rather


than through analysis of State common law which already


exists.


Now, these cases will be sometimes in Federal


court and sometimes in State court, because there will be


some times when there are Federal claims that are brought


that can sustain a motion to dismiss.  I don't happen to


think these claims would have sustained a motion to


dismiss, but --


QUESTION:  What if you have a case in which one


of the arguments made by one of the parties is that if you


interpret the contract this way, it will violate the


Federal act?  Does that stay in the State court, or is


that a Federal question?


MR. SMITH:  I see that as a Federal question,

Your Honor.  I don't think there's any question about


that.  That is essentially what Ameritech claimed here. 


The district court and the court of appeals, of course,


rejected that on the merits, but their claim was that this


interpretation was barred by the FCC's interpretation of


the act.


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, interpretation is


barred?  I mean, if a contract says something, it very


plainly on its face says something that violates the


Federal act, there's only one way to interpret it.


MR. SMITH:  Their claim was that even if that is


what the parties intended, that Federal law had evolved to


the point where that was preempted by Congress, or by the


FCC.


QUESTION:  I just don't understand how you play


that game.  I mean, you're assuming that it's always


ambiguous whether you can interpret in a -- so that you


can interpret it in a way that violates Federal law or in


a way that doesn't, and that somehow therefore that


interpretation becomes a Federal question.  Even if that's


correct, it's certainly not always true that there is the


possibility of interpreting it in a way that does not


violate Federal law, and I guess you're saying that


nonetheless, in that case, the case becomes a Federal


case.

 MR. SMITH:  I'm not sure I really meant to say


that every case becomes a Federal case.  I think there are


lots of situations in which the interpretation as done by


the commission is then a matter -- whether that's correct


or not is a State law issue.


What I meant to answer in response to your


question was then, if a party says that interpretation of


what the parties really intended has somehow brought the


contract into some inconsistency with applicable FCC


regulations, that's a Federal claim.  At the same time, if


the commission says, we think they probably intended this,


but we're not going to do that because we think Federal


law requires us to do Y instead of X, that also raises a


Federal question.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. SMITH:  But if they're merely looking at the


intent, there will be lots of situations where there isn't


any Federal preemption because the law, after all, says if


you negotiate it, the substantive provisions of 251 don't


apply.  In most of those situations, you're going to have


State law contract issues which will be then analyzed by


the State commission and, absent some additional Federal


issue that comes along, the place where that would be


appealed would be the State court, in my understanding.


QUESTION:  And it could not be appealed in the

Federal court?


MR. SMITH:  Unless there was some odd situation


involving diversity, my sense is -- my understanding is --


QUESTION:  Well, I guess the claim would be,


look, the very contract that you're interpreting is a


contract which is authorized, and authorized only by


Federal law, and that's enough to get us into Federal


court, and you reject that position.


MR. SMITH:  Our position, Your Honor, is that


under Jackson Transit, that the fact that the Federal


statute requires that a contract exists but doesn't


specify the terms of the contract, in that situation the


contract itself remains a matter of State law.


QUESTION:  Well, aren't we slightly outside of


that situation, because there are some Federal standards


here, aren't there?


MR. SMITH:  Well, actually, as to negotiated


contracts, the Federal standards --


QUESTION:  They can be --


MR. SMITH:  -- are very, very loose.


QUESTION:  I see.


MR. SMITH:  It has to either be discriminatory


or a violation of public interest, which is -- and the


specific rules of 251 don't apply.


QUESTION:  Is public interest a State concept or

a Federal concept?


MR. SMITH:  I would view that as something that


is authorizing the State commission to --


QUESTION:  It has to be State on your --


MR. SMITH:  -- to apply its -- no, obviously,


they can look at Federal policies if they want to, but I


wouldn't suggest that it's inherently Federal in the way


that the Solicitor General does.


Now, there are other situations that could come


up.  A contract could expressly incorporate Federal law,


and that might or might not create a Federal claim.  This


Court has wrestled for 100 years with the issue of when


Federal law incorporated into State law causes of action


do or don't create Federal question jurisdiction.


In other situations, the State commission might


have imposed the terms of the contract in an area where


the parties didn't agree, and in that situation, if they


are imposing it by virtue of their interpretation of the


Federal regulations, and then that particular clause is


later interpreted in some way that deviates from the


Federal regulations, that might well be a Federal claim as


well.


QUESTION:  That issue we've been wrestling with


for 100 years exists in one of these cases, doesn't it?  I


mean, don't one of these contracts refer to Federal law?

 MR. SMITH:  Well, there have been assertions,


Your Honor, that that's the case.  My reading of these


contracts is that they make -- that they -- and certainly


in this case, the Illinois case, it specifically gives a


definition of when reciprocal compensation will be paid,


and both the commission and the two lower courts all said


that this is not a case where there has been an


incorporation of Federal regulations.  This is a case


where we can divine the actual intent of the parties, that


these calls should be treated as calls where this


compensation would be paid.


And so what they said was, this is not an


incorporation case, and I believe the contract in the


Verizon case, to come next, is the same, that there was an


intent at the time that was -- that the State commissions


have said we're going to hold you to -- even though


Federal law may have moved on, every time it moves on they


say, if you agreed to something else, you're still stuck


with it, and that's what the courts in both of these cases


have said as well as the commissions.


Maybe if I could turn, then, to the Eleventh


Amendment issues, it is certainly our view that the five


circuits that have said these cases present


straightforward Ex parte Young cases, those circuits are


correct, because they do involve, in situations where

there is a Federal claim being asserted against an action


of a State commission, either an enforcement case or an


approval case, a claim seeking an order bringing the State


commission into compliance with Federal law, and it is, I


think, an ongoing violation of Federal law, because when


they approve and enforce an interconnection agreement, or


they enforce it in some way, interpret it in some way,


they are then telling the parties that they have to live


by that interpretation during the term of the agreement.


QUESTION:  You think the commission is a


necessary party, then?


MR. SMITH:  It's our position that they are a


necessary party, but to use the technical term under the


Federal rules, if there was a reason why they can't be


sued and that the case can't go forward, then they may not


be an indispensable party.  The distinction is drawn in


Rule 19 between those two.  Certainly, they've --


QUESTION:  If that's the case, then, it says


we've got an unusual action here, because we're talking


about parties who have no personal or even official


interest except as interpreters of law.


MR. SMITH:  That's true, Your Honor, but what


makes them a necessary party is that the private parties


have an interest in having the administrative body that


has told them to do X be bound by a ruling from the

QUESTION:  You're in effect saying that they


might dispute the application of the Supremacy Clause. 


That's --


MR. SMITH:  And the reason why a Federal


district court is not named as a defendant in the court of


appeals is because the court of appeals has the power in a


unitary system to direct the district court to do


something.  When a Federal court, though, is --


QUESTION:  Yes, but the State court is not named


as a party when a case gets from a State supreme court on


a Federal question here.


MR. SMITH:  Right, but I think --


QUESTION:  It's assumed that they will respect


the Supremacy Clause if there is a Federal declaration of


law, and why shouldn't the same assumption govern if there


is Federal review of a State order on, in effect, a


Federal question jurisdiction basis?


MR. SMITH:  It may be factually true that most


of the time State commissions will obey Federal courts,


but 100 years of jurisprudence under Ex parte Young and


before all follow the Federal administrative model and say


that as to Federal -- State executive officials, when they


violate Federal law, that you name them as a defendant.

 QUESTION:  Oh, I agree.  The only thing that I


have been suggesting takes this out of that simple case is


that you don't have, I think, here the classic case of the


State executive official.  You have a State regulator that


is acting in a kind of a quasi-judicial capacity, and it


seems that one way to look at it would be to think of it


more as a court than as an executive office.


MR. SMITH:  Well, Your Honor, though, the -- a


large number of these Ex parte Young cases, going back to


the Reagan v. Farmer's Loan case that Ms. McDowell


mentioned, an Ex parte Young, cases involving rate-making


commissions, railroad commissions and others that are --


have always been named as the defendants.  In their


official capacity the individuals are named, and that


Reagan case in 1894 said that's not an Eleventh Amendment


problem.


You're not really suing the State, you're suing


them to bring them into compliance with the Federal


statute.  Ex parte Young, the defendants included not just


the Attorney General but also the rate-making


commissioners, and that is just the way it's done, and I


don't think it has any, as you have suggested, any great


intrusion on the sovereign interests of the State to have


them named.


In fact, that's the essence of Ex parte Young,

that it's not an intrusion on their interests to have them


brought into compliance under the Supremacy Clause, and it


would be, I think, an odd rule to say, well, we're going


to start having review of State actions, or some category


of State actions in Federal court for compliance with


Federal law where we don't name the defendants as -- the


State as -- State individuals as defendants.


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. SMITH:  Now, there's been a number of other


arguments raised against the application of Ex parte Young


here.  I don't think any of them is very substantial. 


There's a notion that somehow there's an elaborate


remedial scheme here comparable to the one in Seminole


Tribe, but in fact there isn't any elaborate remedial


scheme in the statute.  It just says you can sue State


commissions in Federal court, or to the extent we're


relying on 1331, there's no scheme at all.


We also have an -- the invocation of the Larson


case which was discussed by this Court in detail in


Pennhurst.  Larson, I believe, is the case that you apply


in a situation where you don't have Supremacy Clause


considerations at stake.


Essentially, what the Court said in Pennhurst


is, when the Supremacy Clause is at issue, we basically


allow lawsuits to proceed against all prospective ongoing

violations of Federal law by State officials, but Larson


provides a test that says where you're suing without


Supremacy Clause considerations to enforce State law


against State officials or Federal law against Federal


officials, in that situation you try to differentiate


between mere violations of Federal law and violations that


are so serious that we won't treat the State official or


the Federal official as an agent of the State any more. 


That is not the test that ought to be applied under Ex


parte Young, and certainly has not been applied in the


past.


We also have the Fourth Circuit's analysis in


which it undertook an entire sort of ad hoc balancing test


trying to weigh State interests against Federal interests. 


I think this Court is clearly on record as saying that in


the Ex parte Young context we're not going to get into


that kind of balancing test.  The balancing test of the


Fourth Circuit I thought was particularly unfortunate,


because basically what that Court did is, it looked at the


merits of the case and said, well, we don't think that the


Federal claims are very strong here, so therefore we're


going to say there's no ability to sue the State under Ex


parte Young, and that doesn't seem like a very helpful way


to go about -- thank you, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Smith.  Mr. Bertocchi,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. BERTOCCHI


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. BERTOCCHI:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


In response to questions from Justice Souter,


adjudicative context really provides the reasoning that Ex


parte Young doesn't apply here.  Contrary to what


Mr. Smith said, the statute doesn't say you can sue State


commissioners in Federal court.  (e)(6) doesn't reference


State commissioners at all.


This case is in a sense more like Larson than


Larson.  Larson was not about whether the case -- whether


the authority for the contracting official came from


Federal or the State law.  It was about the


characterization of what he was doing, and the Court


assumed he was wrong in what he did in that instance, and


in this instance, in the adjudicative context, it makes


even more sense.


Certainly with respect to, I believe, Mr.


Smith's remark about a -- Mr. Smith referred to the fact,


or there was a question about the fact that the commission


might dispute the application of the Supremacy Clause, and


certainly, if a commission did that, if a commission


declined to follow Federal law, that would be a different


story, and undoubtedly there would be some ability to

correct that action.


But the Illinois commission isn't doing that. 


As a matter of fact, the Illinois Commerce Commission has


never tried.  This is, I think, correctly characterized as


a quasi-judicial proceeding, not executive or legislative. 


It is not accurately compared to rate-making cases, which


are much more legislative.


This is adjudication of a contract issue


regarding a particular contract, and in that respect I


would go back -- that would lead me to the last point I


want to make, which is that this is a case about a


contract to which the act does not apply.  It's


interesting, Mr. Smith said he didn't think the complaint


in this case would survive a motion to dismiss, and yet


he's here arguing that it belongs in Federal court.


I'm assuming that -- and I may be wrong.  I


don't want to speak for him.  I'm assuming that the motion


to dismiss would be an attempt to throw it out of Federal


court.  These cases, this case is a contract case


regarding a contract to which the act does not apply, and


section 252(a), which allows the courts to negotiate --


allows the parties to negotiate contracts any way they


want clearly suggests that they have the right to do so


without regard to Federal law.


In this instance, Ameritech has put Federal


54 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

allegations in the complaint.  One of them is that this


contract violates the act, but if you look in their brief,


they'll see -- you'll see that they say that this can't be


restricted to violations of Federal law because in


negotiated cases that would allow jurisdiction to move on


to the -- to move to what they call the vanishing point. 


We agree with that entirely.  Jurisdiction over


interpretation does go to the vanishing point.


The only way Federal issues are going to come up


in these cases is if State courts construe a contract in a


certain way and then disregard Federal law.  That is not


what the Illinois Commerce Commission is going to do.


Thank you, Your Honor.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Bertocchi.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
