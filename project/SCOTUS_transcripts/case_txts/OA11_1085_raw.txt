 Mr. Waxman. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4  next in Case 11-1085, Amgen, Incorporated, v. The 
5
6

11
 Our case is about whether the claim of 
12  liability is, in a fundamental sense, class-wide or 
13  individual.  The heart of a 10b-5 claim is I bought or 
14  sold in reliance on a misleading statement.  The 
question at the class cert stage is whether each 
15
16  individual will have to prove his own reliance directly 
17  on the statement, or whether every -- he can prove 
18  indirectly reliance on the statement by showing that 
19  everybody relied on a distorted market price. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

and only if the statement is material and is made 
publicly on an efficient market.  So, absent 
materiality, the market price cannot be presumed to 
reflect the statement in question.  And the 
plaintiffs --

please the Court: 

A market price will reflect a statement if

MR. WAXMAN:  That's exactly correct.  And 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why isn't that 

 MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, every one of 

the four predicates to the fraud-on-the-market theory, 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why -- why is 
1
2  that -- why is that the case?  I would suppose, if 
3  there's no materiality, that means that the effect on 
4  the market price just happens to be zero. 
5
6  the point here is --
7
8  common to all parties? 
9
10
11  which is a shortcut that -- that excuses plaintiffs from 
12  proving that I heard the statement and relied on it --
13  every one of those predicates is common. 
14
 Whether the market is efficient is common. 
Whether the statement is public is common.  Whether the 
15
16  stocks were bought and sold during the period of market 
17  distortion is common.  And materiality is common. 
18
19
20
21
 MR. WAXMAN:  The falsity of the statement is 
22  common, but it is not a predicate to whether or not you 
23  can prove reliance on a statement indirectly by relying 
24  on the integrity of the market price because, in an

 The question is not whether --

2  price.  And if you're trying to prove reliance on a

7  individual claimant ever prove it's material?

10
11  which is the type of defense that you're raising here. 
12
13  explain why. 
14
 There's no doubt that this Court's standard 
for materiality, announced in TSC v. Northway and since 
15
16  reiterated, is an objective standard.  It doesn't depend 
17  on who the relier was. 
18
19  judge that class-wide reliance can be -- that class-wide 
20
21  doesn't preclude a plaintiff like Connecticut 
22  Retirement, which has said it's going to proceed whether 
23  there's a class or not, or any other member of the 
24  class, from coming to court and saying, either, I

 MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  Either way.  Let me

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Waxman, that's just to 

1  that it's material to the trier-of-fact, because the 

2  decision that the judge makes at certification is not 

3  binding on the trier-of-fact; or even to say, I relied 

4  on the integrity of the market price, and I have proof 

5
6  three investors, they're all reasonable people, and they 

7  say that it was relevant -- important to them in the 

8  total mix of information involved.

11  say that you -- a plaintiff can always relitigate the question 
12  of materiality.  But at the class certification stage, 
13  isn't it correct that, if the Court holds that a 
14  statement is immaterial, it's immaterial for all members 
15
16  that right?

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I want to -- I'd like to 

1  think that's conceptually wrong, Justice Kagan, in the 
2  sense that all that the class certification decision 
3  says is that the putative class representative can sue 
4  on his own behalf, but he can't drag everybody else into

6
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do you mean to say 
7  that a judge, who has just ruled that a statement is 
8  immaterial, is going to keep the case in his court, 
9  litigated by an individual plaintiff, even though he's

11
12  come back to the question of why whether, even if 
13  your -- the premise of your question is correct, it 
14  doesn't matter for this case.  But let me take one more 
15
16
17  right, presumably, and the case isn't over, the class 
18  just isn't certified, is the defendant -- you know, 
19  emboldened by the judge's rule, will file a motion for 
summary judgment on the grounds that materiality -- the 
20
21  element of the substantive offense, not materiality, the 
22  predicate to class certification -- has just been 
23  determined in favor of me.  That is a very different 
24  question for the Court.

 The next thing that would happen if I'm 

Materiality, as this Court has said, is

When it comes up on summary judgment, what 

1  fact-sensitive, and it involves a balancing of 
2  credibility of witnesses or of expert opinions, and the 
3  judge at the -- at the class cert stage, has to find 
4  facts and has to make a ruling. 
5
6  the -- if there is a dispute of material facts, what the 
7  judge should do under the law is to say, look, I just 
8  held that I didn't think it was material, but I resolved 
9  disputed material facts, and that's for the jury, and 
10
11
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you're saying that a 
12  judge on a class certification stage can say, this is 
13  immaterial, the statement is immaterial; therefore, this 
14  can't proceed as a class action.  But when a summary 
judgment motion comes in, arguing the exact same thing, 
15
16  the judge will say, oh, it's not immaterial after all, 
17  or it's disputed enough, that the case can -- can 
18  continue? 
19
20
21  got a haircut at 10:30, the judge presumably can say

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought we were talking 

that, if the judge says it's immaterial, that doesn't 
end it for everybody.  Certainly, it should -- it ends 
it for the class; you said that.  Should it also end it 
for the representative of the class to say, okay, now 
I'm going to come back, and this statement, -this 
finding of the immateriality doesn't bind me. 

1  the fortunes of all the absent class members, whether 
2  they are direct reliers or indirect reliers, tie their 
3  fortunes to his fortune at trial.  And the judge simply 
4  has to say, is this a case in which reliance is a common 
5
6  in 10b-5 cases.

Amgen during the relevant period, and they -- the judge

 There is nothing whatsoever that precludes

material, it didn't distort the market price, and 

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  Materiality -- the quirk 

1
2
3  of this case is that materiality is both -- as all my 
4  friends on the other side agree, an essential predicate 
of the fraud-on-the-market theory, that is the essential 
5
6  predicate of the ability to prove indirect reliance on 
7  the statement through an assertion that the market 
8  price -- that the statement distorted the market price. 
9
 Everyone agrees that, if the statement isn't 
10
11  therefore, reliance is an individualized issue for those 
12  who actually heard and detrimentally relied on the 
13  statement. 
14
 One of the elements that has to be proven in 
a 10b-5 case is reliance, which is what we were talking 
15
16  about on the class cert stage, and there, materiality is 
17  a predicate for reliance.  But even if reliance is 
18  proven, materiality is also an element of a 10b-5(b) 
19  cause of action, and the standard for materiality is the

 The real question in this case is what is 
22  the purpose of Rule 23?  If you think that the purpose 
23  of Rule 23 is to postpone to the merits everything that

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You can say – No I know is

1  The purpose is for a court to determine whether all of 
2  the preconditions for forcing everyone into a class 
3  action are present before you certify.

5  what you said and phrase it the opposite way. 
6
7
8  it the purpose of the certification stage to try out every 
9  element of liability at that stage, rather than waiting 
10 
11
12
13
14  is, you know, it could still be material for some 
15  individual, even though there is no market reliance. 
16  And similarly, a silence going (indicating), some odd 
17  set of words or whatever it is, although it's not false 
18  for almost anybody, for some particular person, it could 
19  seem -- convey something false in some particular set of 
20  circumstances. 
21
22  certification stage, too.  In fact, let's try out 
23  everything because we could always think of a few 
24  examples where, despite the fact that -- you know, that 

 MR. WAXMAN:  No. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it's not.  Good. 
 Now, once you say that, what you have said

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but you are saying with 

1  it's only a common issue 99 percent of the time, we can 
2  dream up a situation where it's not a common issue. 
3
4  class certification is not to pre-try the merits of the 
5
6
7  a cert -- class certification here, if there is no 
8  materiality, there is no class; and you are repeatedly 
9  faced with the question, you are absolutely right; in 
fact, there is no case.  And so then what you say is, 
10
11 
and indeed, I have a few instances here in which there 
could be a case, and I’d say, I bet if we are -- you 
12

know, professorial enough, we could dream up a 
hypothetical for anything, where there still is a case.

certification, as this Court explained in Amchem and 
other cases, and as the Rules Advisory Committee notes, 
is the question of whether there is class coherence in 
the first place.  It's not the merits issue.  It's 
whether it's fair for the class representative to impose 
on the defendant the juggernaut of class action and on 
the absent class members their fortunes in his or her 
hands.  And what --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Waxman, that is exactly 

right, and that's what we said in Wal-Mart recently, that 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

material, it's not material as to everybody. 


1  the question is a question of coherence; it's a question of 
2  whether the class wins or loses together.  And here, for 
3  materiality, the class wins or loses together.  If it's 
4  material, it's material as to everybody.  If it's not 
5
6
 And that's just a function of the fact that 

7  materiality, as we've repeatedly said, is an objective 

8  test.  It doesn't have anything to do with whether a 

9  particular person finds it material.  And where that's 

the case, it seems to me that the Wal-Mart test, which 
10
11 
is -- is an issue central to the -- you know, when you 
rule on the issue, do you rule on each of the claims in 
12 
13 
one stroke?  The answer to that is yes. 
14
15
16  Amchem, that "class" -- "It is class cohesion and only 
17  class cohesion that legitimizes representative action in 
18  the first place."  And that question, quote, "preexists 
19  any settlement and therefore a fortiori any litigation." 
20
21
22  that's right. 
23
24
25

 MR. WAXMAN:  Okay. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  There is class cohesion as 

to materiality.  People win or lose on materiality

23  they were material, then the certification is proper.

 Everyone agrees that materiality, like

 MR. WAXMAN:  The answer, Justice Ginsburg,

the predominance question is the reliance element, not 
5
6  the materiality element. 
7
8  falsity, like scienter, like loss causation, are all 
9  common questions.  As this Court explained in Basic and 
reiterated last term in Halliburton, in 10b-5 actions, 
10
11 
the question at class certification is whether reliance 
needs to be proven directly; that is, individually by 
12 
13 
people who heard and acted in response; or whether the 
shortcut that this Court authorized in Basic of allowing 
14 
indirect proof by proving that the statement caused a 
15
16 
distortion of the market, is the way to go.

19  common, and a predicate to class-wide reliance.

22  statement moved or had the capability of moving the 
23  market price.  And that's why the materiality is the

8  there is an unefficient market, the case goes forward, 
9  and people have to prove individual reliance, and that 
means that the class splits apart, and you don't get a 
10

coherent class.  So the function of -- of your winning 
an argument either on publicity or on the efficient

 So in the context of Basic, the court seemed

 MR. FREDERICK:  There is a lot to said about

5

 MR. FREDERICK:  Only in a hypothetical case,

 Why do we know that in this case?  For two

2  into, that is objectively reasonable, but that does not

4
5
6  important point that I can try to make today.  In a 
7  fraud-on-the-market case, the idea of reliance -- the 
8  only theory of reliance that is being advanced is 
9  indirect reliance on the integrity of the market.  There 
10
11
12  reasons:  First, the Connecticut Retirement System could 
13  not be the class representative, if it did not meet the 
14  typicality requirement of Rule 23(a), which the district 
15
16  appendix -- and has not been challenged subsequently. 
17
 But why doesn't Connecticut have a direct 
18  reliance theory?  We know they don't because they have a 
19  fiduciary duty to their investors to apply whatever 
theory they have of securities fraud.  So we know in 
20
21  this case -- and this is, by far, clear in the 
22  run-of-the-mine fraud-on-the-market case, that the class 
23  representative will only establish reliance indirectly, 
24  by showing that the integrity of the market was

 And so their construct is an entirely

case that -- that people who are allegedly defrauded in

3  arise in the real world of fraud-on-the-market cases.

7  up again in a different context in an individual suit. 
8  Let -- let me give you a -- a case that's -- that's not 
9  flukey and hypothetical.  That is, it is usually the 
10
11  stocks rely upon the fact that they bought it at an --
12  at an inflated price or sold it at a depressed price. 
13  Both of those questions depend upon the efficiency of 
14  the market.

that has to be decided for the class certification case, 
the individual investor is not going to be able to say, 
you know, that's -- that's why I got cheated, because 
the market reflected this false statement, and I paid 
more money for the stock than I should have.  That --
that is not a flukey hypothetical.  That is what will 
happen in most individual cases.  And yet, that question 
of the efficiency of the market has to be decided at the 
class certification stage. 

If the market is not efficient, a question

 MR. FREDERICK:  They all lose on the merits, 

1  have to know are all the investors standing in the same 
2  position.  If the market is efficient and it is 
3  absorbing information into the price, all investors will 
4  have the same question with respect to materiality. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You could say the same 
5

efficiency, Justice Scalia, and the reason why it is 
advanced at class certification is because it serves a 
gatekeeping role in determining whether all the 
investors can show indirect reliance on the market.  If 
the -- if the stock is thinly traded, there are no 
public analysts, there are no stock reports given about 
it, and no one knows exactly why is the price being 
determined, that creates exactly the kind of individual 
issues that would predominate in a securities fraud 
case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so the difference you 
assert is that, with respect to the issue here, it will 
be an issue in all individual cases; whereas with regard 
to the efficiency of the market, it will only be an 
issue in -- what, 95 percent of -- of the individual 
cases? 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But in the case that you're hypothesizing, 

Justice Scalia, efficiency serves the gatekeeping 

 MR. FREDERICK:  No, the question is:  Does 
1
2  efficiency serve as a means of determining are all the 
3  investors similarly situated?  Are they a cohesive 
4  class?  If the market is not efficient -- and mind you, 
they -- they conceded this question in their answer and 
5
6  they did not challenge the expert that was put in the 
7  district court on the question of efficiency, so that 
8  question's  really not in this case. 
9
10
11  function of determining are all the investors similarly 
12  situated, so that indirect reliance can be a -- a method 
13  of showing that predicate for a common answer to be 
14  determined at trial.

17  function. 
18
19  hypothetical that I actually think could occur, which is 
not a truth-on-the-market defense, but a known truth to 
20
21  the individual person seeking certification.  So that is 
22  it's immaterial to that person because they were told 
23  this information by someone and still trading.  Would 
24  that defense be available at certification?

2  of Rule 23(a) because that person has a different 
3  factual basis for attempting to assert a securities 
4  fraud, and that person is not typical of the class and 
so therefore would not meet the typicality requirement 
5
6  of 23(a). 
7
8  other cases, there might be investors out there who do 
9  have a direct reliance theory, but they are protected by 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  I'm -- I'm trying to work out what, as I understand it 
19  now, Mr. Waxman's point is -- is basically this: 
20
21  We use it because if the market is efficient and the 
22  statement is public, then someone who bought over the 
23  market is buying in a -- in a world that reflects the 
24  false statement.  I mean, that's -- so he -- there was 
25

Rule 23 in a couple of ways.  One is they can bring 
their own case, and they can say, I directly relied on 
Amgen's misstatements and the false things that they 
said about their flagship products, and I, therefore, 
have my own 10b-5 case.  Or if the class is certified 
and they think they have a direct reliance theory, they 
can opt out of the class. 

That -- that why do we use an efficient market theory? 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  This is true, but I'm --

Official 

 Now, it is possible, certainly, that in 

sufficient reliance indirectly. 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 All right.  So I think his point is, yes, I 

it wasn't material, then our theory of market 

1
2  can see materiality is something that's relevant to 
3  everybody.  Of course, it is, a common issue in the 
4  case.  But also, it is a feature of materiality that, if 
5
6  reliance -- market -- efficient markets goes out the 
7  window because you can have all the efficiency in the 
8  world, all the publicity in the world, but still, where 
9  something to a reasonable stockbroker is irrelevant, his 
reaction is "who cares?"  And therefore, although there 
10
11 
could be special cases, the efficient market theory 
12 
plays no role. 
13
14  understand it.  And -- and I don't hope it is, if I've 
got it -- I mean, I hope I got it right.  But -- but if 
15
16  that -- so what's your direct answer to that? 
17
 MR. FREDERICK:  My direct answer to that is 
18  that materiality still serves as a common answer.  All 
19  the investors are going to lose if it is not a material 
misstatement that has any effect, and they will win or 
20
21  they will have the potential to win if it is a 
22  material --
23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that -- that --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The issue -- the issue is 
not whether -- whether it's a common question or not. 

 Now, I think that's what his theory is, if I

6
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the issue. 
7
 MR. FREDERICK:  But, Justice Scalia, I think 
8  that the issue that you want to decide or you think that 
9  you want to decide is what constitutes the efficiency of 
the market, and that is a hotly litigated issue in many 
10
11 
securities cases.  It just happens not to be at issue in

this one.

outstanding, 9 million traded a day during the class

2  are having a mini trial on the merits because the 
3  materiality question here goes into what did the 
4  executives think and mean when they were making certain 
statements about clinical trials for their drug.  What 
5
6  was --
7
8  that, if everyone loses, if it's not material, that's a 
9  common issue, and therefore, the trial court at the 
certification stage does not have to determine it. 
10
11
 MR. FREDERICK:  No, what I'm saying is that 
12  it is -- because it is a common question, it is not one 
13  to be decided at class certification.  Just like 
14  falsity --
15

answer for indirect reliance on the market is a common 
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not sure how that's 
different from what I said.  But in other -- in other 
words, you are saying that market efficiency is just 
presumed, and everybody wins or everybody loses, and so 
you can have a class action, even though the trial judge

1  down, and instead --
2
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But there is -- there is a 
3  reason for deciding it earlier, and the reason is the --
4  the enormous pressure to settle once the class is 
certified.  In most cases, that's the end of the 
5
6  lawsuit.  There's -- there's automatically a settlement. 
7
 Now, one way of -- of certifying the class 
8  is to show, well, you know, it's an efficient market,

on the market.  But that's only true if -- if the -- the 
statement was material to the market.  If it was 
immaterial to the market, that isn't true.  And you 
should not proceed any further, and you should not begin 
this -- this class action which, in -- in most cases, is 
simply the preliminary to a settlement.  There is a good 
reason for deciding it sooner.

 As several of the justices have recognized, 

common answer, and that common answer unites the class, 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But as Justice Scalia 

pointed out earlier, so is efficiency or nonefficiency. 

 MS. SHERRY:  And the difference --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that -- that 

1  requirement.  The only question is whether common issues 
2  predominate over individual issues. 
3
4  materiality is an objective inquiry, it leads to a 
5
6  rather than divides it.  If materiality is shown, the 
7  class members can proceed together on the 
8  fraud-on-the-market theory.  But --

MS. SHERRY:  I would disagree with that 
because the difference is with efficiency and with 
publicity.  If the -- depending on the common answer, 
the class may divide.  It may fragment because, even if 
the market is inefficient, individual class members can 
make out claims of direct reliance.  You can rely on an 
inefficient market and prevail.  You can rely on 
nonpublic statements --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the difference

 MS. SHERRY:  The -- the purpose of the class 

the extent the market is inefficient or to the extent 

1  on what -- what the market price was when the person 
2  bought or sold.  So -- you know, 95 percent instead of 
3  100 percent, that's -- that's the basic difference? 
4
certification stage with respect to predominance is to 
5
6  weigh the common issues against individual issues.  And 
7  with respect to market efficiency -- excuse me -- market 
8  efficiency and publicity, those are two matters that --
9  that either bind the class together or divide them.  To 
10
11  the statements are not public, they are not all getting 
12  the information from the same source. 
13
14  they are preconditions, not related to the merits, that 
15
16  theory.  Now, I've said that; of course, so is 
17  materiality. 
18

20
21  where it is a common issue in this case -- and in 
22  most -- to everybody.

 It is asking the same question that leads to 

1  Because I am getting the -- facing the problem a few 
2  minutes from now, somebody is going to say, well, why is 
3  that exactly right?  I mean, it is a precondition. 
4
 MS. SHERRY:  I am going to say it's exactly 
right because the confusion here is that materiality in 
5
6  a fraud-on-the-market case serves two purposes.  It is a 
7  predicate to the fraud-on-the-market theory, but it is 
8  also an independent, separate element.  And what

 MS. SHERRY:  The fraud-on-the-market theory,

7
 What the Court did in Basic was adapt the 
8  direct reliance concept which envisioned face-to-face 
9  transactions to the impersonal market.  And so with 
respect to actually proving a fraud on the market, 
10
11 
you're absolutely right, but what we're talking about 
here is not whether a fraud on the market can be proven;

over individual issues.

issue.  Reliance is only a common issue if you accept 
20

overgeneralization.  It could be much more subtle than 
that and so you have an advanced theory.  But you want 
us to ignore that. 

1  really do collapse into one.  Once you've proven that

8  scholarship -- I think that's how long it's been since 
9  Basic was decided -- has shown that the -- the efficient 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
 MS. SHERRY:  No, I -- a couple responses to 
that.  The first one is the one that my colleague made, 
15
16  which is that market efficiency isn't disputed here.  It 
17  was conceded in the answer at paragraph 199.  And not 
18  only is it not -- is it not contested here, Petitioners 
19  actually embrace an efficient market, in 
20
21
22  something to be addressed in this case.  And my second 
23  response is Basic didn't adopt any particular economic 
24  model of market efficiency.  If you look at footnote 24 
of Basic, if you look at footnote 28 of Basic, the Court

 And so my first response would be that's not

 Instead, it was looking at congressional 


And so, again, I wouldn't consider market 
efficiency in this case.  It's not presented.  To the 
extent there's questions about how the determinations 
should be made in terms of levels of generality, that's 
something that the lower courts can decide. 

Today, all we're talking about is the 

1  makes very clear that it's not adopting an economic 

2  theory, as far as how quickly or completely the 

3  information is incorporated into the market price. 

4
intent, it was looking at difficulties in direct proof, 
5
6  and it was looking at common sense to reach a result and 
7  again to adapt a reliance theory that was premised on 
8  face-to-face transactions to the impersonal market that 
9  exists today.

materiality component and, again, focusing on whether or 
not common issues predominate over individual issues. 
It's a comparative inquiry.  It requires comparing 
common issues on the one hand and individual issues on 
the other.  And Petitioners have not identified any 
individual issues that will actually come into play as 
the case is litigated. 

One is the one that my colleague made.  Congress 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company

causation, which this Court in Erica John, of course, 
said did not have to be proven at the class 
certification stage.  So in short, it proves too much. 

1  addressed those policy concerns in the PSLRA, in SLUSA, 
2  and it chose to address them through different means. 
3
 The second point I would make is the same 
4  argument could be made with respect to the other 
elements of the securities fraud cause of action.  If 
5
6  the argument is you should have to prove it at class 
7  certification because, otherwise, the case is going to 
8  settle, you could say the same thing with respect to 
9  scienter, with respect to falsity, with respect to loss 
10
11 
12 
13
14  countervailing policy concerns, and there are 
15
16  Rule 23 in terms of efficiency. 
17

20

24  understand why that is.  If you're trying to show

 MS. SHERRY:  As a substantive matter on the 

 The third response is that there are 

countervailing concerns that are actually tethered to 

reliance, and you show that it's an efficient market, 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or, to put it differently, 

 MS. SHERRY:  I think, in terms of 

transaction causation, what you're -- and reliance is 

information be material.  And so we accept that in terms 

1  and that the information was -- was public, doesn't that 
2  show reliance without regard to whether the statement's 
3  material or not? 
4
5
6  referred to as transaction causation -- what you're 
7  trying to show is whether or not the information 
8  affected or distorted the market price.  And in order to 
9  show price distortion, it does require that the 
10
11  of the fraud-on-the-market theory --
12
13  an efficient market is a market that takes account of 
14  material factors, right? 
15
16
17  market if it's -- you know -- it's -- who knows, random? 
18  It takes account of material factors. 
 MS. SHERRY:  I would make a minor quibble on 
19
that.  I would say that the market takes account of all 
20
21  public information, but it only -- it only moves based 
22  on material information, so that's exactly right.  And 
23  so our issue is not with the predicates for the 
24  fraud-on-the-market theory. 
25

MS. SHERRY:  I -- I would say it's --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not an efficient 

Our issue is with Petitioners equating the 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And so the problem with Petitioners' 

met.  The only one that we're talking about here is 

acknowledge, a determination at the class certification 
stage is not binding on anybody -- in that case on the 
ultimate fact-finder, or in any other case. 

1  predicates from the fraud-on-the-market theory with the 
2  actual prerequisites of Rule 23.  And this Court made it 
3  very clear, in Shady Grove, that the only question at 
4  the Rule 23 stage is whether the prerequisites have been 
5
6  predominance.  It's a comparative inquiry between common 
7  issues and individual issues. 
 And if I can quickly go back to my point 
8
9  about countervailing policy concerns, as Petitioners 
10
11 
12 
13
14  position is that it would require relitigation of the 
materiality question at the merits stage to the extent 
15
16  the class is certified or, if it's not, in every other 
17  case that is brought on the same issue.  That doesn't 
18  serve the efficiency purposes that underlie Rule 23. 
19
20
21  prejudiced, but as Your Honor, Justice Kagan, pointed 
22  out, the only prejudice is that they wouldn't be able to 
23  relitigate the very same issue.  That is protected by 
24  allowing opt out.  That is protected by Rule 23's 
25

 The -- in terms of absent class members, he 

suggests that absent class members would somehow be 

adequacy of representation requirement. 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And so that's already sufficiently 

rises or falls together.  And class certification is not 

one-way ratchet, where only the defendant was bound.  In 
the current version of Rule 23(b)(3), you want to 
certify class actions that are both meritorious and 
those that are not, so that it reaches a binding 
judgment.

2  protected.  The most efficient course is to actually 
3  focus on common issues.  Materiality is a common issue.

case -- in the paradigm case, reliance was proven by the 
fact that you heard the statement and you did something 
in reliance on it, to your detriment. 

 That is this case.  The anomaly of our -- my 
1
2  friend's position is they concede that materiality is a 
3  predicate for class reliance.  They agree that, unless 
4  the statement is material, however efficient the market, 
however loudly the statement was published, there is no 
5
6  detrimental reliance on the integrity of the market 
7  price. 
8
9  Justice Breyer, this goes to your traditional paradigm 
10
11 
12 
13
14  Basic didn't say anything about class certification 
15
16  whole reason that the question of the 
17  fraud-on-the-market theory was presented, was the 
18  inquiry about whether there could be -- whether the 
19  traditional bilateral method of proving detrimental 
reliance on a statement could be aggregated into a 
20
21  ginormous class by allowing everyone to say, well, we 
22  relied on the integrity of the market price and a 
23  material misstatement -- a material statement affected 
24  that price.

under Rule 23 is astonishing, given the fact that the 

 Reliance can only be approved -- and,

MR. WAXMAN:  Exactly right.  And what the 
10
Court in Basic could have said, Justice Breyer, was, 
11 
forget the fraud-on-the-market theory; we are going to
