CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in No. 02-469, The Black & Decker


Disability Plan v. Kenneth Nord.


Mr. Paterson.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE T. PATERSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PATERSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Ninth Circuit has adopted a treating


physician rule in ERISA cases which requires the plan


administrator to either accept the opinion of a treating


physician or to reject that opinion by specific legitimate


reasons based upon substantial evidence. 


The Ninth 

Circuit says that this rule gives special weight,


deference, and a presumption to the opinions of treating


physicians.


The failure to follow this rule has two effects. 


First, a finding that the plan administrator has a


conflict of interest which mandates de novo review, and


secondly, on de novo review, that the plan administrator's


decision was not reasonable.


The Ninth Circuit's --


QUESTION:  Now, the Secretary has adopted some

requirements of explanation of reasons where the


physicians differ in their views.  Has -- has the


Secretary done something of the sort?


MR. PATERSON:  The Secretary has adopted


regulations, which were effective in January 1 of 2002,


which require a plan administrator to obtain the opinion


of an expert medical professional to -- to advise him


regarding medical opinions and to be able to provide an


expert medical opinion to the claimant if he requests it. 


That would not apply, of course, to this case since this


claim was filed in 1997.


QUESTION:  And is there a requirement to give


reasons if there is a difference of views between the


treating physician and the expert?


MR. PATERSON:  No. 


There is no requirement to 

provide reasons to -- or between the two physicians'


opinions.  There has always been a requirement under ERISA


and the regulations that a plan administrator explain the


reasons for his denial of a claim.


QUESTION:  And this claim was denied?


MR. PATERSON:  This claim was denied.


QUESTION:  Were the reasons given in this case?


MR. PATERSON:  Yes, they were, Your Honor.  They


were given by the plan administrator in writing to the


claimant.  He told the claimant that he was, in fact,

denying the claim based on the opinion of Dr. Mitri.


He told them he was denying the claim because he


did not meet the plan definition of total -- I'm sorry --


complete inability to perform the job of a material


planner.


He told them that part of the reason for denying


the claim was the fact that the plan administrator had


asked the claimant to please have his treating physicians


comment on the opinion of Dr. Mitri.  He did that twice. 


He did it in writing.  And in neither case did the


respondent respond with any -- from the treating


physicians -- with any response from their -- the treating


physicians.


And he also did it on the basis that Janmarie


Forward's opinion, who was a human resource


representative, was not -- did not change his opinion.  So


there were those --


QUESTION:  And -- and under the Secretary's


rules, if there is in fact a conflict of interest, it can


be weighed in making that ultimate resolution by the


court?


MR. PATERSON:  No.  There's -- there's nothing


in the -- if you mean the Secretary of Labor's rules,


there's nothing in the Secretary of Labor's rules which


relates to any weighing of a conflict of interest by the

plan administrator.  There is a -- a provision in the case


of Firestone v. Bruch in which the Court in that case said


that if the plan administrator --


QUESTION:  This Court has suggested that a


conflict of interest can be weighed.


MR. PATERSON:  This Court said that in Firestone


v. Bruch.


And -- but the question in that case that has


been not -- it has not been decided in that case and which


has created a conflict of interest of -- I'm sorry -- a


conflict among the circuits is the question of what does


it mean to weigh.  Does it mean to weigh the conflict of


interest, or does it mean to conflict of interest against


the reasonableness of the decision?


The Second Circuit has said it means to weigh 

the conflict of interest as provided in Restatement 187,


and after you weigh the conflict of interest, you then


move on to the reasonableness of the decision.


The Ninth -- the Ninth and the Eleventh Circuits


have said it means that you weigh the decision, and if you


-- the conflict -- and if you find there is a conflict,


then you find that the decision of the plan administrator


is presumptively void.


And the remainder of the circuits have adopted


something called the sliding scale test where you weigh

both the conflict and the -- the reasonableness of the


decision at the same time.


This Court commented on that issue, I believe,


in Rush v. Moran when the Court said, how can you give


deference to the opinion of a treating physician -- I'm


sorry -- of a plan administrator at the same time that you


are looking for conflict of interest?


We would submit, if I may, Your Honor, that the


way to do that is to first look for conflict of interest


in -- in the -- the way that Restatement 187 does that. 


You first test for conflict of interest.  If there's no


conflict of interest, then this potential conflict of


interest, what this Court called a potential conflict of


interest, goes away.  It is a nothing.  It has no effect


whatsoever.


QUESTION:  You didn't tell us -- you didn't --


QUESTION:  As to your case, what -- what


difference does it really make?  The Ninth Circuit in a


portion of -- of its opinion which is not being reviewed


here --


MR. PATERSON:  I didn't mean to --


QUESTION:  -- and -- and in Regula seems to set


up a two-tier system or a dichotomy of an administrator


who is a fiduciary and an administrator who's not.  I


should think -- tell me, maybe I'm incorrect -- that your

position is that the treating physician rule is an


inappropriate approach in either instance.


MR. PATERSON:  There's no question about that. 


I didn't mean to argue for a difference in -- in the


standard of review.  We haven't -- we haven't brought that


to this Court on a petition.  I merely meant to respond to


Justice O'Connor's question.


QUESTION:  But I take it your point is that in


-- in either context, the treating physician rule is


inappropriate.


MR. PATERSON:  Absolutely.  There's no question


in our -- in our position to this Court that the treating


physician rule is an inappropriate rule under either -- of


any of those tests.


QUESTION:  Am -- am I --


QUESTION:  If you are correct in -- in that


regard, it would go back to the Ninth Circuit and there


would still remain the question on which you didn't seek


review, and that is, just how do you handle this conflict


of interest?  I presume the Ninth Circuit would go back to


where it was.


MR. PATERSON:  I believe that that's correct,


Your Honor.  What would happen is we would go back to


where we would have been if the treating physician rule


didn't exist.  The Ninth Circuit would be using its

presumptively void test, would look to see if the -- the


claimant had produced any probative material evidence of a


conflict of interest, which actually affected the decision


as opposed to just a potential conflict of interest.  If


they found that, they would find that the decision of the


plan administrator was presumptively void.  If they didn't


find that, then that issue would drop from the case and


they would then test the -- the decision of a plan


administrator based on abuse of discretion standard.


QUESTION:  But their analysis would be different


in one respect, I take it, and that is in -- in the case


as they considered it first, the -- the refusal to follow


a treating physician rule was taken itself as evidence of


conflict.  Is that correct?


MR. PATERSON:  Yes. 


The Ninth Circuit held that 

the refusal to follow a treating -- the treating


physician's opinion or to fail to rebut that opinion by


specific legitimate reasons was a material probative


evidence of a -- tending to prove an actual conflict of


interest which -- which affected the --


QUESTION:  So the result might be different.


MR. PATERSON:  I -- we would certainly -- we


certainly intend it to be different if -- if we can.


QUESTION:  Did -- did they say presumptively


void?  I -- I had thought that what they -- what they said

was if they found an actual conflict, they simply would


give no deference and would review de novo as though the


question was up to them.


MR. PATERSON:  The -- the test in the literature


is called the presumptively void test.  I don't believe


the Ninth Circuit calls it the presumptively void test. 


They -- they call it the Atwood test, the Atwood v.


Newmont Gold test.


QUESTION:  I don't care what they call it.  I


want to know what the consequence is.  I thought the


consequence held by the Ninth Circuit was that if they did


find the actual conflict, they would give no deference to


the plan administrator's decision and would review the


question de novo as though it was up to them.


MR. PATERSON: 


Yes, and in that sense it would 

-- they would be void.  I think the presumptively void


issue comes in this sense, Your Honor.  When the -- if the


claimant comes forward with material probative evidence of


a conflict tending to show a conflict of interest under


the Ninth Circuit's test, the Ninth Circuit says that


there is a rebuttable presumption created and that the


burden is then on the plan administrator to come forward


with evidence and to rebut that material probative


evidence that there is an actual conflict of interest.


QUESTION:  But we take the case on the theory

that that's governing in this case?  I mean, you didn't --


MR. PATERSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- seek -- seek review of it.  It's


just the treating physician rule that you want us to talk


about.


MR. PATERSON:  That's correct.  I -- I don't --


I've been asked these questions, but we're not arguing the


issue of standard --


QUESTION:  It is difficult for me to get to the


thing when I have a kind of basic confusion in my mind,


which I have.  I don't understand this conflict of


interest thing from start to finish.  That is to say, why


-- why is it -- why is it any different to have a trustee


in -- in this kind of a case who hires an insurance


company to look to see whether the people are disabled or 

not than to have a trustee who hires an insurance company


to run the whole plan?


And anyway, why is that different from a trustee


who, say, runs a classical trust and has to decide -- call


it a spendthrift trust -- whether to give the beneficiary


$1,000 this month and have less in the -- in the corpus or


to give him $800 this month and have more in the corpus,


which might, by the way, grow to help other beneficiaries?


So I -- I don't understand it basically and I've


read enough to know that I really don't.

 MR. PATERSON:  Thank you, Justice Breyer.  I --


I hope that I can -- I can help.


In section 187 of the Restatement of Trusts, it


talks about a potential conflict of interest, the


possibility of a conflict of interest.  And this -- this


Court talked about that in Firestone v. Bruch.  That


potential conflict of interest is not a conflict of


interest.  It's just the possibility.  And any court


reviewing any trustee, ERISA or not, if they thought there


might be a conflict of interest, would look for that


conflict of interest and see if there was --


QUESTION:  What could it consist of?


MR. PATERSON:  It might consist in an ERISA case


of some direction from the president of the company to the


trustee to cut back on benefit costs.


QUESTION:  I see.  I see.


MR. PATERSON:  That would be -- then he would


not be representing the -- the members of the plan and he


would be breaching his fiduciary duty.


QUESTION:  What if there's no such directive,


but the plan is set up in such a fashion that it's


employer-funded and the higher the benefit costs are, the


-- the more the employer pays, and hence the less profits


the employer has?


MR. PATERSON:  That's -- I'm sorry.

 QUESTION:  Is that just a potential conflict of


interest or is that an actual conflict of interest when


the plan administrator is -- is an agent of the employer?


MR. PATERSON:  Under this Court's rule -- or


decision in Firestone and in -- under the Ninth Circuit's


decision, that is only a potential conflict of interest. 


There has to be material probative evidence of an actual


conflict of interest which affected his decision.


QUESTION:  It's using conflict of interest in a


-- in a strange sense, it seems to me.


MR. PATERSON:  It -- well --


QUESTION:  There's certainly a conflict of


interest there.  He's supposed to represent the employees,


but he's an agent of the employer, and the more he gives


to the employees, the less there is for the employer.  I


would call that a conflict of interest, but -- but that is


not, for purposes of these cases, a conflict of interest.


That is a potential conflict.


MR. PATERSON:  That is a potential conflict of


interest.


QUESTION:  It seems to me they're not really


talking about a conflict of interest.  They're talking


about -- what should I say?  Evidence that -- that the


trustee was not acting in the -- in the employees' best


interest.

 MR. PATERSON:  And I think that should be the --


the criteria that the court has to look for in each of


these cases to decide whether the trustee is actually


conflicted or not.


QUESTION:  Can we get back to the question that


you did raise?  Why should there be a difference in the


Social Security standard, which does apply this treating


physician rule and disability?  Both -- the question in


both cases is whether this person is unable to work.


MR. PATERSON:  There is a -- I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. PATERSON:  There's a tremendous difference


in the Social Security standard as formulated by the


regulations of the Social Security Administration and the


Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule in Social Security 

cases as formulated by the Ninth Circuit and ERISA cases. 


Perhaps I can point out a couple of those things.


First, the Social Security Administration has a


regulation, which it has adopted, which provides for a set


of criteria to be reviewed by the administrative law


judge.  Those criteria include the -- looking at the


physician's -- the treating physician's opinion,


determining whether that opinion is well supported by


clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, seeing if


it's not inconsistent with other substantial evidence,


14

21

25

looking at the length of the treatment relationship and


the frequency of the examination, and other criteria.


Once the administrative law judge goes through


those criteria and determines each one of those positively


towards the treating physician, he then may, or she may


then, if they wish, provide conclusive weight to the


opinion of the treating physician.


The Ninth Circuit's rule is completely different


than that.  The Ninth Circuit's rule says that if a person


is a treating physician, then the plan administrator


either has to accept that rule -- that -- that opinion or


has to rebut it.  A treating physician under the Ninth


Circuit rule could be a -- somebody at a local well care


center and you walk in and get a shot.  That makes you a 


treating physician. 


Now you have an opinion which you --

which, under the Ninth Circuit's rule, gives you a -- a


presumptive weight.


QUESTION:  But I take it, you would not be happy


with -- if we said, well, the Ninth Circuit went too far,


but it should be set up just like the Social Security


because, as I understand it, this employee did get Social


Security disability.


MR. PATERSON:  Well, we don't know that for a


fact, Your Honor.  There is a statement in the -- in the


statement of facts by the respondent in their opposition

brief.  There is no evidence in front of this Court.  The


first time I ever knew about that was when I read the


respondent's brief.  If that is true, he should file -- he


should refile with the administrator and attempt to use


that evidence to get his claim reopened.  But there is no


evidence that I'm aware of in front of this Court on that


issue.


QUESTION:  So that's -- that is open to him to


refile and say, look, I've got Social Security?


MR. PATERSON:  Yes.  He may go back to the --


the plan administrator -- this case is still open because


it's on appeal -- and tell the plan administrator I have


this new evidence.  It shows that I have been disabled


since July the 15th of 1997 and I would like you to


consider that evidence. 


And the plan administrator will 

do that.


QUESTION:  I suppose there's something to be


said for the proposition that if you have this private


system, you don't necessarily want to bring in all the


bureaucratic trappings of the Social Security review


process.


MR. PATERSON:  Well, I think that's absolutely


right, because one of the congressional purposes in ERISA


is to encourage employers to adopt voluntary disability


plans.  And the Social Security administrative regulations

were -- are regulations which have been adopted by the


Social Security Administration.  In this case, the


Department of Labor which is the correlative to the Social


Security Administration for ERISA plans is opposed to the


ERISA, or to this --


QUESTION:  But -- but you -- you would


acknowledge that the Social Security determination is


evidence for the plan administrator to consider even


though it's using a -- a mandated standard of respect for


the treating physician's determination which does not


exist under the plan?


MR. PATERSON:  I think it is evidence.  I think


the first thing the plan administrator would do is to look


at the medical opinions which were submitted along with


that report and look at the actual decision of the 

administrative law judge.


QUESTION:  But he'd make -- make the same


decision.  I mean, if he didn't believe the treating


physician and didn't have to believe the treating


physician, as the Social Security Administrator has to, to


a greater degree anyway, he'd come out the same way.  I


just don't see how it's evidence in a -- in a proceeding


that does not give the same weight to the treating


physician.


MR. PATERSON:  It might or might not be.  But it

should be presented to the plan administrator to give him

Social -- the ALJ.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


QUESTION:  Ms. Blatt, did the Secretary consider


adopting a rule like CA9 has imposed?


MS. BLATT:  No, Justice O'Connor.  What the


Secretary has done has -- is -- has not opposed -- imposed


a treating physician requirement or otherwise constrained


plan administrators in the way --


QUESTION:  Yes.  I know the Secretary has not. 


Did the Secretary consider alternatives?


MS. BLATT:  They didn't consider a treating


physician rule, but what the Department of Labor did do

was impose a series of requirements to ensure fair and


accurate decisionmaking.  So plans must conduct a full and


fair review of a claim, and they have to consider all


evidence submitted by the claimant.  And before making any


medical judgments, they have to consult with a health care


professional with the relevant training and experience.


QUESTION:  The question was when they did that,


did they even think of the treating physician rule?  Did


anybody say to the Department, maybe we should have one? 


No, I don't think we will.


MS. BLATT:  No.  There's no evidence that they


considered it.  But they did overhaul their regulations


for 2002 and did impose a lot of requirements, and they


took a very different approach.  They didn't do anything


that constrained plan administrators in weighing evidence. 

Instead, they said, you have to consider all the relevant


evidence and make an independent judgment.  And then they


finally required that the specific reasons have to be


given for any denial in a manner that's calculated to be


understood by the claimant.  And in the Department's view,


what that means is it has to be in sufficient detail to


permit meaningful judicial review for an abuse of


discretion.


But the Ninth Circuit takes a very different and


categorical approach that singles out treating physician

evidence and has a requirement that reasons have to be


given if the administrator is not going to defer to that


evidence.


QUESTION:  Maybe the Ninth Circuit was trying to


spark for ERISA the same thing that the courts did for


Social Security.  The Social Security -- whatever the rule


is, the treating physician rule -- that started with the


courts and then the -- the Commissioner said, okay, we'll


adopt it as part of our regulations.  But didn't it begin


with the courts?


MS. BLATT:  It began with the courts, and they


-- most of them did impose some requirement and some


outright rejected it because they thought Congress had


entrusted the ALJ as the finder of fact with the


responsibility to weigh conflicting evidence.  And the


Commissioner, in order to bring uniformity in this massive


nationwide Government program, adopted a less aggressive,


deferential rule in its regulations.


But the Department of Labor has not adopted any


such rule.  Rather, the Department of Labor's regulations


are consistent with the background presumption that the


trier of fact has the responsibility in each particular


case to weigh conflicting evidence based on her judgment


of the relative merits of the evidence.  And -- but the


Department of Labor, as I said, has a very different set

of requirements that don't -- that leave -- that are


consistent with that background rule and don't constrain


plan administrators.


QUESTION:  Does the -- do the Department


regulations have some sort of a threshold test for whether


there's a conflict of interest or is that just not


addressed?


MS. BLATT:  No.  The Department of --


regulations don't speak to the question of a conflict at


all.  What this Court said in Firestone was that a


conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining


whether there's been an abuse of discretion.


QUESTION:  And Firestone, as I recall, just


recognized that the plan administrator can wear two hats,


be employer some times and -- and a fiduciary at others. 

MS. BLATT:  That's right.  But under Firestone,


if the employer both funds the plan and administers the


plan, we think that's the type of conflict that can be


considered as a factor in whether there's been an abuse of


discretion.


QUESTION:  So Firestone was using conflict of


interest in -- in a different sense from the sense in


which it was used here.


MS. BLATT:  The courts have differed widely, in


the wake of Firestone, of what this Court meant in


21

Firestone.  The majority of the lower courts have not


taken the Ninth Circuit's approach.  They have said it's


still an abuse of discretion review, but there's a more


searching inquiry into whether there's been an abuse of


discretion if the plan administrator is operating under a


conflict.


Now, that is not --


QUESTION:  By which it means not evidence that


he was instructed to -- to keep down costs, but the mere


fact that the employer is both the funder of the plan and


responsible for administration of the plan.


MS. BLATT:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  That alone is a conflict.


MS. BLATT:  That's the type of conflict that can


be considered as a factor in conducting whether there's an 

abuse of discretion.


Now, however that plays out in a given case, our


point is that you shouldn't have a special rule that's


limited to treating physician evidence.  And we think it's


inappropriate under ERISA for three reasons, and I think


I've already said two of them --


QUESTION:  What does treating physician evidence


have to do with a conflict?  That's -- that's what I


really don't understand.


MS. BLATT:  Nothing.

 QUESTION:  How does it show a conflict at all?


MS. BLATT:  Nothing.  If there was some failure


to defer or inadequate explanation -- first of all,


there's something wrong with the treating physician rule. 


But even if there was some inadequate explanation such


that the court could not conduct meaningful judicial


review, the standard consequence of that, Justice Scalia,


is a remand back to the administrator for further


explanation, not a de novo standard of review.


But that's not the question presented in this


case.  It's rather the propriety of a judge-made rule that


singles out treating physician evidence and elevates that


evidence over other evidence.


Now, again, it's inconsistent with the


background presumption about the trier of fact -- the 

responsibility of the trier of fact to weigh conflicting


evidence.  We think it's in significant tension with the


regulations that the Department of Labor did promulgate


which do not constrain plan administrators.


And finally, the third reason, is that ERISA


leaves to employers, private employers, the decision


whether to provide benefits and, if so, the discretion to


devise the form and structure of plans.  And a judge-made


rule is inconsistent with these discretionary and


voluntary aspects of ERISA because it tells plan

administrators across the board how to weigh conflicting


evidence in claims arising under varying and separate


plans.


QUESTION:  Would it be relevant evidence, as Mr.


Paterson suggested it would be, that this man now has


Social Security disability benefits?


MS. BLATT:  The regulations require the plan


administrator to consider all evidence submitted by the


claimant, and it -- it would be relevant if -- depending


on what it said.  But this Court in Cleveland has


explained that the Commissioner of Social Security applies


a variety of evidentiary presumptions, not only the


treating physician rule but the most prominent one is the


listing of impairments such that the Social Security


Administration may make a finding of disability even 

though the person in fact may be able to perform the


essential functions of the job when judged under different


legal settings.  And I think the issue in -- in Cleveland


was whether there was reasonable accommodation, and the


Commissioner doesn't consider that when -- when she makes


her determinations under the Social Security


Administration.  But it's just -- it's one piece of


evidence that would be before the administrator.


And if there are no further questions, we would


ask that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Blatt.


Mr. Rohlfing, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE D. ROHLFING


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. ROHLFING:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


In answer to Judge -- Justice Scalia's question


about conflict of interest, the lower courts, in the wake


of Firestone Tire & Rubber Company v. Bruch, have grossly


confused the concept of conflict of interest, dollar-for-


dollar conflict of interest, with actual bias.  And that's


the problem with the Ninth Circuit's approach, the


Eleventh Circuit's approach and the other circuits'


approach, is when we have evidence of conflict of


interest, the courts are requiring evidence of actual 

bias.  And I don't believe that that's the standard that


this Court intended in the Firestone Tire & Rubber case.


Now, the other --


QUESTION:  In Firestone -- is -- is it a


conflict of interest if I set up a trust for my children


to pay their college education, and then I have to make


decisions.  Suppose I hire a trustee and that -- or I hire


somebody to run it, and I'm going to put more in if they


need more, less, if they need less.  So the trustee has to


say whether to pay for the $80 a month or a week or

whatever, a day's spending money or not, and the more he


pays, the more I'm going to have to put in.  Is -- is that


considered, under -- under traditional trust law, a


conflict of interest?


MR. ROHLFING:  Only if the trustee's continued


employment is -- is contingent upon your satisfaction.


QUESTION:  But if it is, if -- if I say you're a


trustee, I can fire you when I want, then the courts, just


in that -- like Scott on Trusts and so forth, would say


that's a conflict of interest?


MR. ROHLFING:  Because you retain too much


control over the -- the disposition of the trust corpus. 


In these voluntary plans, a plan administrator really has


a choice.  The plan administrator can elect to retain


control --


QUESTION:  No, I understand that.  I'm just


trying to figure out what classical trust law would have


been.  So you're saying it's the same.  It should be


treated the same.


MR. ROHLFING:  The more egregious case, Your


Honor, would be the facts of -- that would be similar to


the facts of this case is if the balance of the trust


reverted to the trustee if they didn't spend all the money


on your children's education.  That would be an even more


egregious --

 QUESTION:  And then -- then classical trust law,


Scott on Trusts, says that's a conflict of interest and --


and what happens?  Then courts review it all if you set up


a trust like that?


MR. ROHLFING:  Well, Scott on Trusts, the


Restatement of Trusts, all refer to those decisions as


voidable at the election of the beneficiary, and the court


would review that decision de novo.


QUESTION:  Mr. Rohlfing, the -- the petitioner


didn't raise any question about the -- the conflict of


interest.  And so we're here on the petition which raises


only the treating physician rule, and as Justice Kennedy


pointed out, you could have the treating physician rule


when you have a separation of the trustee and the -- the


company. 


So if you could get down to the treating 

physician rule, I think it would be helpful --


MR. ROHLFING:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- since it's the only question


that's raised.


MR. ROHLFING:  Yes, Your Honor.


The Ninth Circuit did articulate the Ninth


Circuit rule in the context of conflict of interest.  So I


think it's important to keep that focus in mind.


But the treating physician rule that was


articulated by the Ninth Circuit in both this case and in

the Nord -- and in the Regula case was not a weighted


rule.  There was not a thumb on the scale as petitioner


has put it.  Rather the rule that the --


QUESTION:  Well, why -- why isn't it a thumb on


the scales when it requires substantial evidence to -- to


rebut?  That sounds like a thumb to me.


MR. ROHLFING:  It -- it doesn't require


rebuttal, Your Honor.  It requires rejection for


substantial reasons.


QUESTION:  Well, whatever term you want to use


it, unless you've got substantial evidence to override the


treating physician's opinion, the treating physician's


opinion is supposed to control, and that sounds like a


thumb.


MR. ROHLFING: 


I think that this Court's 

jurisprudence and the jurisprudence of other courts in


other contexts have stated that concepts of abuse of


discretion, arbitrary and capricious, and substantial


evidence, are really very similar concepts and there are


very fine, thin lines between those concepts.


For instance, a decision that was made without


the support of substantial evidence, I would submit, would


be an abuse of discretion.  If no reasonable person would


conclude, as the plan administrator did conclude, i.e., it


lacked substantial evidentiary support, that would be an

abuse of discretion.  The court would readily reverse that


type of determination.


And that's exactly what the Ninth Circuit said


in -- in reviewing the record as a whole, as this Court's


jurisprudence in Universal Camera, for instance --


QUESTION:  Is it clear that that's what the


Ninth Circuit means by substantial evidence?  I mean,


that's what substantial evidence means in administrative


law under the Administrative Procedure Act.  It means just


that minimal amount of evidence that's necessary to get a


case to the jury in a -- in a civil trial.  But is that


what the Ninth Circuit means by -- or do they mean


substantial evidence?  You know what I mean?


(Laughter.)


MR. ROHLFING: 


Well, unfortunately, the -- the 

court didn't bold-face or italicize its -- its use of the


term, substantial evidence.


QUESTION:  Yes.  I'm under the impression that


they mean substantial evidence.


MR. ROHLFING:  I think the -- the court in


reviewing a rule 56 motion practice, reviews the decision


of the district court de novo, and it's entitled to


substitute its own judgment.  The parties at the district


court agreed --

judgment, that is purely a question of law.


MR. ROHLFING:  Correct.


QUESTION:  So the -- the fact that it is


reviewed de novo doesn't have much bearing on this sort of


a case, it seems to me.


MR. ROHLFING:  Well, the -- once the Ninth


Circuit concluded that the district court had erred in


rejecting the procedural treating physician rule, the need


to articulate specific and legitimate reasons, and had


concluded that Black & Decker operated under a conflict of


interest, and Black & Decker represented to the Ninth


Circuit that it not -- it need not even consider


plaintiff's evidence, the Ninth Circuit exercised its


discretion to reverse and pay the case.  And that is a


question that petitioner clearly did not seek cert on. 

QUESTION:  But what about the treating physician


rule itself, which he clearly did seek cert on?


MR. ROHLFING:  Yes.


QUESTION:  What is your position on that?


MR. ROHLFING:  Your Honor, section 1133 of the


-- of the statute and the regulations that were in effect


when Mr. Nord filed his claim required the statement of


specific reasons in order to reject a claim.


QUESTION:  This -- we're now talking about an


ERISA claim, not a Social Security claim.

 MR. ROHLFING:  An ERISA claim.  The statute and


the regulations require a statement of specific reasons. 


And the lower courts have described the statement of


specific reasons as encouraging a meaningful dialogue


between the person claiming benefits and the plan


administrator.  And it would seem that a mere statement of


conclusion, we've accepted Dr. Mitri and we've rejected


your physicians, is not a meaningful dialogue.  It's


not --


QUESTION:  I don't even think they have to say


that.  The reasons for rejecting the claim is we're


rejecting the claim because you are not disabled or


because your disability does not -- you know.  Isn't that


the reason for rejecting the claim?  It isn't a


requirement that they -- that they review the evidence in 

the case.


MR. ROHLFING:  Well, they are required to review


the evidence.  That's the petitioner's position.


QUESTION:  Yes, but do they have to give a


statement?  I mean, you know, the Administrative Procedure


Act requires a -- a statement of -- of reasons for the --


in some detail.  But I don't know that this requirement is


anything -- I am rejecting your claim because you filed it


too late.  I am rejecting your claim because in my


judgment you are not disabled.  Why isn't that an adequate

statement of reasons?


MR. ROHLFING:  Well, too late would be a -- a


specific reason for rejecting a claim.


QUESTION:  Well, but you wouldn't have to review


the evidence of why it's too late.  Well, you know, so and


so said he got it then.  So and so said you got it earlier


than that.  We believe so and so.  You didn't have to say


that.  You say we're rejecting it because in our view you


filed it late.  And it seems to me it's the same thing


with a disability.  We're -- we're rejecting it because we


do not -- we do not believe that -- that the disability


you have claimed in fact exists.


MR. ROHLFING:  And the problem with -- with that


particular analysis, Your Honor, is that we don't know


whether Black & Decker in this particular case put the 

same thumb that it's complaining about the Ninth Circuit


put on the scale, that they didn't put the thumb on the


scale for Dr. Mitri.  And for all of the reasons that


petitioner and its eight private amici have argued and


also the Solicitor General's office has argued, putting


the thumb on the scale and not weighing evidence evenly


would be just as bad if it was done the other side


silently.


QUESTION:  But I don't understand what that has


to do with the question that's -- that's presented to us.

Case A, that there's a treating physician who's a longtime


personal physician and his opinion is given to the


administrator.  Case B, the employee says, you know, I'm


going to see a back specialist and he goes to a back


specialist who's never seen the man before.  Should there


be a difference in those two?  I mean, that's -- that's


what you're here to argue.


And -- and Dr. -- was it Dimitri or Mitri?


MR. ROHLFING:  Mitri.


QUESTION:  Mitri was a specialist in this area. 


The treating physician was not.  It -- it seems to me that


it's -- it's perfectly plausible to say that we give the


specialist even greater weight.  So what -- the treating


physician rule, it seems to me, quite arbitrary.


MR. ROHLFING: 


It -- it is arbitrary if it's 

simply putting weight on the scale.  But the Ninth Circuit


cast the treating physician rule as merely a statement of


-- of specific reasons that are legitimate under the


statute and that are supported by substantial evidence in


the evidentiary record before the Court.


But the -- the treating physician rule doesn't


distinguish between -- strike that.  I'm sorry.  The --


the treating physician rule does distinguish between


physicians that have different levels of probative


evidence.  The physician with more information, the long-

time treating physician, has a greater source of


information upon which to express an opinion than does the


one-time consultative examiner.


And that's really illustrated in the facts of


this case where Dr. Mitri stated that Mr. Nord should be


able to perform a certain level of work.  And his


intentional use of the word should implies that most


people or a substantial number of people with this level


of impairment can engage in this level of activity, in


this case sedentary work interrupted by standing and


walking.


QUESTION:  So you are now saying, it seems to


me, the opposite of what you were contending earlier. 


You're saying that substantial evidence means more than


just the amount of evidence that would enable a jury to 

find a particular fact.  Because if that's all that


substantial evidence meant, you wouldn't need a -- a


treating physician rule.  That rule would exist for any


physician that the -- that the plaintiff brought in.  If


he brought in a non-treating physician and there were no


substantial evidence on the other side in the -- in the


Administrative Procedure Act sense of substantial


evidence --


MR. ROHLFING:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- the plaintiff would win.  Right?

 MR. ROHLFING:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  So the treating physician rule is a


-- is a useless rule.  You should call it the any


physician rule.  If the plaintiff comes in with some


evidence and there's no evidence on the other side, the


plaintiff wins.  That's certainly not what the Ninth


Circuit means.  And -- and as you were just describing it,


it's not what the Ninth Circuit means.


It means that if you have a treating physician,


you need substantial evidence on the other side before


we're going to -- we're -- we're going to let you overturn


the treating physician's determination.  Isn't that really


what's going on here?


MR. ROHLFING:  I think the Ninth Circuit did use


the -- the phrase that the opinion of Dr. Mitri was 

overwhelmed by the other substantial evidence of record.


So you're right.


QUESTION:  Well, but -- but that characterizes


it on a very fact-specific basis.  It also referred to the


-- is it -- Regula case in which it -- it said there is


the treating physician rule.  I think you have to defend


that rule as a rule, if applicable, in the generality of


cases.


MR. ROHLFING:  The general application of the


treating physician rule that's reflected in both the --

this case and in the Regula case is that the court used


the rule only at the conflict-of-interest level of


inquiry.  It didn't instruct -- in Regula, it did not


instruct the lower court to weigh the evidence in any


particular manner.  Rather, it instructed the lower court


to allow Delta Air Lines in that case to come forward with


evidence that the conflict of -- conflict of interest did


not infect its decisionmaking process.  Again, it allowed


rebuttal evidence of actual bias rather than the pure


conflict of interest that the Ninth Circuit found to


exist.


QUESTION:  Well, what is the connection between


the treating physician rule and the concept of actual


bias?  The -- the two don't seem to have a lot in common


so far as I can see.


MR. ROHLFING:  I think that the courts are


confused below, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm confused too.


(Laughter.)


MR. ROHLFING:  The courts have created this


hybrid animal that's asking whether conflict of interest


exists and then using actual bias to -- to animate its --


its decisionmaking process.  And that's the problem.


QUESTION:  I think I can explain the confusion. 


It doesn't make any sense, but I think I can explain it.

The Ninth Circuit is simply saying, look it, any


reasonable person would give the treating physician's


opinion substantial weight over somebody who's not the


treating physician, and if the plan administrator does not


do that, and since he's presumably a reasonable person, he


must biased.  Isn't that what's going on?  The Ninth


Circuit has simply said, obviously the treating physician


wins in the -- in the usual case.  And any plan


administrator who says he doesn't win must be biased.


MR. ROHLFING:  I think --


QUESTION:  And that's not true in my view.


MR. ROHLFING:  I think what the Ninth Circuit is


saying is that when we have expert opinion and all else


being equal, given the fiduciary status of the plan


administrator, that the treating physician should receive 

.001 percent and tip the scale slightly in favor.  It's


the fiduciary status.  It's the conflict of interest


analysis that really animates the court's inquiry into --


into this --


QUESTION:  So -- so why doesn't this just --


QUESTION:  What -- what if you have a -- a


treating physician who presents a paragraph to the plan


administrator saying, you know, I've treated this fellow


for 6 months and I think he's incapacitated?  Then you


have an expert, you know, another physician weighs in on

the other side and puts in about six or seven paragraphs. 


I put him through some tests, this and that, and I think


he is -- he's not disabled.  How does that come out in


your view under the treating physician rule?


MR. ROHLFING:  Well, the question then would be


whether the -- the tests that the independent medical


examiner, the one-time examining physician, either


mirrored the test results of the treating physician or


provided an independent clinical basis.  And under the


mature treating physician rule, every court has held that


independent clinical findings that are divergent from


those of the treating physician is always a basis for


rejecting the treating physician's opinion.


But that's not the facts of this case.  Dr.


Mitri agreed --


QUESTION:  Well, does -- does the Ninth Circuit


recognize that the treating physician rule can be rebutted


in that manner?


MR. ROHLFING:  Yes, it does.


QUESTION:  You say other courts have.  Does the


Ninth Circuit?


MR. ROHLFING:  In the -- in the treating


physician rule that exists in the Ninth Circuit in a


Social Security context, it is absolutely clear that


independent clinical findings are an independent basis for

rejecting the treating physician's opinion.


QUESTION:  But it can't be rejected in this


fashion.  The treating physician who's a general


practitioner doesn't know anything in particular.  Not a


specialist with the brain, he says this man has a brain


embolism.  That's all he says.  Doesn't say anything else. 


Doesn't give any more details.  And somebody -- and -- and


the -- the employer goes to a brain specialist and the


brain specialist says, again, nothing more than this


patient does not have a brain embolism.  That would not


suffice in the Ninth Circuit, would it?  You would have to


take the opinion of the attending -- of the treating


physician.


MR. ROHLFING:  If there's no objective test


result from any physician, an MRI or a CAT-scan? 

QUESTION:  Both of them -- both of them have


come in with conclusory statements.  Why shouldn't I


believe the conclusory statement of the expert who


examined the person rather than the -- the general


practitioner?  What the Ninth Circuit says is, you have to


believe the -- the treating physician.


MR. ROHLFING:  I don't believe that any


reasonable person would accept a -- an intern's -- or a


general practitioner's opinion that the person suffers


from a brain embolism without an objective test showing

the existence and presence of that embolism.


QUESTION:  Well, then what purpose does the


Ninth Circuit rule say?  The Ninth Circuit says the


treating physician is employed to cure and has a greater


opportunity to know and observe the patient as an


individual.  I mean, that's -- that's its rule.


MR. ROHLFING:  That's -- that's the test.


QUESTION:  Well, given the confusion about it,


why isn't it the -- sorry.


QUESTION:  And we don't in -- in the law of


evidence -- I'm trying to think of an analogy where we


have some special rule for a particular kind of -- of


person.  We have expert testimony generally, but -- but


this is not so confined.  I've never seen a rule like


this.


MR. ROHLFING:  Well, it really depends on how


you view juries would -- would review divergent expert


witness opinion.  If you assume that -- that a jury would


not tend to give a source of evidence more weight than a


evidentiary source that had a less -- lesser pool of


evidence or information, less probative information, then


I think that you're right.  But I don't think that that's


what juries do.  I think juries look at it in a reasonable


fashion and think an expert with more percipient


information is going to get more weight.  And --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Rohlfing, why are we getting


juries into it when I thought the genesis of this was the


Ninth Circuit said, in Social Security the courts created


this treating physician rule?


MR. ROHLFING:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  And the Commissioner liked it so


much, the Commissioner embraced it as her own.  And so now


we're going to do the same thing for ERISA.


And that's why when you complicate it with this


bias or conflict, there's no conflict in the Social


Security.  And as I read -- that's -- that's a piece of


this decision, but as I understood it, what the Ninth


Circuit was saying, as far as the treating physician rule,


is it was a good idea in Social Security and it's equally


good here.


MR. ROHLFING:  That's exactly what the court


decided, Justice Ginsburg.  And I think that your analysis


is correct.  The court looked at the treating physician


rule and -- and said it -- it creates tools for the courts


to use engaging the reasonableness of administrative


decisions in that context.


QUESTION:  But then -- then you started to talk


about juries and in the Social Security context, it's a


guide for the ALJ, not a jury.


MR. ROHLFING:  I was speaking more generally

with Justice Kennedy.  I apologize for bringing in an


inapt analogy.


But I do think that the -- the logic and


fundamental underpinnings of the treating physician rule


engaging any expert witness testimony is that the broader


panoply of information available to, in this case, a


treating physician justifies, all else being equal, all


else -- assuming the same set of objective tests, that the


physician with the greater source of information is


entitled to slightly more weight.


QUESTION:  Since the Secretary of Labor doesn't


agree with you, why isn't it better for courts to leave


that kind of a decision to the Secretary of Labor?


MR. ROHLFING:  The Solicitor General argues in


-- in its brief that -- the Government's brief, that it 

has primary jurisdiction to develop the regulations and


flesh out the body of ERISA law.  But this Court has long


held that development of the body of Federal common law is


within the jurisdiction of the courts.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm -- I'm not suggesting a --


a primary jurisdiction rule.  What I'm suggesting is that


the -- the Labor Department is a lot closer to the


situation at the trial level than an appellate court,


including this one.  And I -- I simply would have thought


that the -- that the Department of Labor was in a better

position just to make a practical assessment of either the


need for the rule or the probable value of the rule than


-- than a court is likely to do.  And -- and when that


kind of expert judgment is available, why isn't it simply


sensible for a court in a common law capacity to say,


we're going to leave it to the -- to the party -- to the


-- to the agency that is in a better position to make the


judgment?


MR. ROHLFING:  Well, Justice Souter, the -- the


problem with that is that the -- the Secretary of Labor


has not even addressed the conflict of -- of interest


issue and that is the --


QUESTION:  But the conflict of interest issue,


you just told us, is not the reason for adopting the rule


here.


MR. ROHLFING:  But it is --


QUESTION:  It has a -- it is -- it is being


given significance in the conflict issue, but I thought


that was not the reason the rule -- I'm going back to your


answer to your question to Justice Ginsburg.  That isn't


the reason the rule was developed in Social Security, and


that wasn't the reason the rule has been adopted here.


MR. ROHLFING:  It isn't the reason the rule --


it is the -- the focal point of the rule in the ERISA


context.

 QUESTION:  Whose money is at stake in the Social


Security cases?


MR. ROHLFING:  Yours and mine.


QUESTION:  The Government's money, really.  And


if the Government wants to be particularly generous to the


claimant, I guess the Government can be if it wants to


adopt a rule that's very favorable to claimants, which it


has done in the Social Security field.


But it's not the Government's money at stake in


-- in this case and -- and in all of these ERISA cases. 


It's either the trust's money or the employer's money, and


it's supposed to be dispensed according to the agreement


that the parties have entered into.  It seems to me it's a


different situation, and I don't think the Government has


as much leeway in deciding to be generous as it -- as it 

does in the Social Security field.  I just don't see --


don't see the parallel between the two at all.


MR. ROHLFING:  The parallel between the two


exists on what questions are asked and what answers are


given.  The structure is -- is far different.  Congress


enacted Social Security as social policy.  Black & Decker


adopted its disability plan to attract employees as part


of an employment package.  And there -- although it's


Black & Decker's money, it has still promised benefits


under certain circumstances and then has, for -- for

reasons that we still aren't -- don't know, concluded that


despite the -- the clear opinions of the treating


physicians and the ambiguous opinion of the independent


medical examiner, concluded that Mr. Nord did not sustain


his burden of proof, and despite the clear evidence from


the human resources specialist that Mr. Nord could not


perform his usual and customary work --


QUESTION:  Why was it so clear?  First of all,


if you take the treating physician -- was given an


opportunity to comment on the expert's opinion, on Dr.


Mitri's opinion.  Here it is.  Not one word from either


the treating physician or the -- what is it?  The


orthopedist who was -- who was called in by the treating


physician.  So the expert stands out there all alone with


no comment on it.


And then as far as the human resources person is


concerned, it was Mr. Nord's counsel, was it not, that


wrote up that evaluation for her to answer yes or no,


right?


MR. ROHLFING:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  I wrote


those interrogatories because I read Dr. Mitri's opinion


when he said Mr. Nord could only lift 15 pounds, and I


looked at the human resources specialist's statement of


bona fide occupational job qualifications that the


occupation required lifting 20 pounds and a number of

other factors, including the recognition of Dr. Mitri that


Mr. Nord suffered from a significant pain syndrome.  I


believed that -- that Ms. Forward would answer those


questions all in the negative, that no, Mr. Nord could not


perform his usual and customary occupation.  She didn't


answer the questions all in that manner.  But she did


answer the last question in the negative, that Mr. Nord


could not perform the work of a material planner with the


pain that he was enduring.


QUESTION:  Well, I think -- I think if you gave


anybody that question, somebody is in terrible pain, can


they relate to others -- it's not as though this was some


kind of a neutral evaluation form.  It was a loaded


question that you asked her.

 QUESTION:  36 and 37 of?


MR. ROHLFING:  Yes, in the large petition


lodging.  I can read the question in full.


Dr. Mitri describes Kenneth Nord as suffering


from degenerative disc disease and a chronic myofascial


pain syndrome.  You have indicated in your employer's


statement provided to Metropolitan that the work of a


material planner requires continuous interpersonal


relationships and frequent exposure to stressful job


situations.  Assume that Kenneth Nord would have a


moderate pain that would interfere with his ability to


perform intense interpersonal communications or to act


appropriately under stress occasionally, up to one-third


during the day.  Could an individual of those limitations


perform the work of a material planner?


And the answer marked is no.  And Ms. Forward


signed that.


QUESTION:  As I understand that question, it --


it asks him assuming he can't do his job for one-third of


the day, can he do his job?  What -- what answer would you


expect?  I mean, if -- if you just said assuming he had


moderate pain, could he do his job, then -- then your


answer would mean something, but you asked, assuming he


has moderate pain that prevents him from doing his job a


third of the day.

You -- it seems to me you -- you had a hypothesis that


doesn't help your case.


MR. ROHLFING:  In -- in asking a -- a question


of a vocational expert or a human resources specialist,


assuming the person suffers from moderate pain, could they


perform their job, then we've left it up to the witness to


answer the question, what does moderate mean?  And so what


I did was define moderate.


QUESTION:  But you didn't ask moderate.  You


didn't ask just moderate pain.  You said, moderate pain


that would interfere with his ability to perform intense 

interpersonal communications.


MR. ROHLFING:  But not preclude.


QUESTION:  So it wasn't moderate pain in the


abstract.  It was moderate pain in a quite concrete


context that would -- moderate pain that would interfere


with his ability to do his job.


MR. ROHLFING:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg -- in my


experience if you don't define the terms of art in -- in


questions to vocational specialists, you're not going to


get the answers that are helpful.

Black & Decker to solicit that type of information.  She


was -- she was a Kwikset employee, a wholly owned


subsidiary of Black & Decker Corporation.  They didn't ask

the -- the treating physician didn't comment at all on the 

experts.


MR. ROHLFING:  The treating physicians didn't


comment on the -- the opinions of Dr. Mitri because I


didn't ask them to.  I read Dr. Mitri's report as


supporting the proposition of disability.  His lifting


limitations were less than the lifting required of the


job.  The standing and walking that he needed was not


permitted in the facial job description.  And I made a --


and I actually argued affirmatively to the Ninth Circuit


that Dr. Mitri's opinion, properly read in the context of

the -- the employer's statement that Ms. Forward had


filled out before at the request of Metropolitan, actually


supported the proposition of disability rather than


supporting the proposition of no disability that had been


advocated.


And I would hasten to point out that this plan


does not contain an accommodation clause.  It doesn't say


if you can perform your job with accommodation, then


you're not disabled.  It doesn't say that.  And if we're


going to use contract analysis in -- in determining the


effect of the plan language on the ultimate issue of


disability, the failure to include accommodation as an


affirmative prong of the -- the inquiry in the issue of


disability is fatal to Black & Decker's case because the


only reason that Ms. Forward's answers to the first four 

questions could be supported is if Black & Decker


accommodated it.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEE T. PATERSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PATERSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


The Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule is a


categorical rule based upon the assumption that a treating


physician's opinion is superior to other medical opinions


50

in the record.  In the Regula case, at page 1139, the


Ninth Circuit got to the issue of -- of the treating


physician rule prior to the time it even began to discuss


the conflict of interest.  And it held the treating


physician rule requires deference, as it applies under


ERISA, and that the treating -- the plan administrator in


the Ninth Circuit must defer unless there are -- he has


good enough reasons not to defer.


The court then later on in its opinion addressed


the issue of conflict of interest.


This Court in -- last year in Ragsdale v.


Wolverine when -- stated that categorical generalizations


failed to hold true that the justification for the


categorical rule disappears.  In the facts of this case,


that categorical justification disappears both in the 

individual facts of the case and as a general proposition


for all other cases.


In the facts of this case, respondent went to


Dr. Hartman, his internist, with back problems.  Dr.


Hartman referred him to two specialists, Dr. Zandpour and


Dr. Ali, both of whom examined him, tested him, and


diagnosed his condition.  Both Dr. Ali and Dr. Zandpour,


based upon the tests they conducted, provided a diagnosis


of mild degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.


The employers sent the respondent to another

specialist, Dr. Mitri, a neurologist, who agreed with the


opinions of Dr. Zandpour and Dr. Ali, but also looked at


the job duties of respondent.  Dr. Mitri opined that he


could perform the duties of a material planner if he was


allowed to stand up and walk periodically.


Just focusing on these four physicians'


opinions, it's clear that the opinions with the most


weight are the three specialists, Dr. Zandpour, Dr. Ali,


and Dr. Mitri, not the treating physician, Dr. Hartman. 


However, the Ninth Circuit's rule requires the plan


administrator to give deference, special weight, and a


presumption in favor of Dr. Hartman's opinion even though


he referred respondent to specialists for evaluation and


even though he has no apparent expertise in back injuries


or back pain.


In the facts of this case, the categorical


generalization is not true.


In addition, the amicus, American Medical


Association, has brought before this Court its statistics


published in its own publication, the Journal of the


American Medical Association.  Those statistics state that


39 percent of treating physicians misrepresent symptoms,


diagnosis, and severity of illness when their patients


submit insurance claims.  There's no justification for a


categorical rule that treating physicians' opinions are

entitled to special weight, deference, and a presumption


in ERISA disability benefit determinations when the


professional organization of the treating physicians


admits that treating physicians often make


misrepresentations when their patients are filing


insurance claims.


There's no support for a categorical rule that


treating physicians' opinions are more reliable than other


medical opinions either in the facts of this case or in


the -- the ERISA context in general.  In every case, the


ERISA plan administrator should weigh not only the source


of the opinion, but also the experience, the testing, the


treatment, and the credentials of the -- of the physician.


We respectfully submit that this Court should


reject the Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule and 

remand this case back to the Ninth Circuit.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Paterson.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
