(10:50 a.m.)


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-682, Verizon Communications v. the Law


Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP.


Mr. Taranto.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. TARANTO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


On the facts alleged, Trinko cannot sustain its


complaint unless the Court newly recognizes a section 2


duty of a monopolist to turn over its sales to rivals by


sharing its assets at specially discounted prices, that


is, a duty to dismantle itself.


Our argument is that that hasn't ever been a


section 2 duty and shouldn't now be made into one.


QUESTION:  We have an Illinois Brick problem


before we even get to the substantive question, don't we? 


I mean, why -- why should we entertain this -- this case


at all?


MR. TARANTO:  I don't think that Illinois Brick


-- in fact, I think Illinois Brick is not a jurisdictional


point.  It is a question of cause of action that goes to


certain kinds of damages.

 QUESTION:  Well, I understand, but -- but those


-- those standing rules that are not jurisdictional are


still standing rules, and we normally apply them.  Why


should we not apply our normal rule of standing in this


case?


MR. TARANTO:  Well, we -- we do think you


should, but that it shouldn't preclude the Court from


reaching the merits, which are of much broader importance. 


That is, in the absence of the rule being a jurisdictional


one, the Court has the option of considering either of two


grounds for reversing and reinstating the dismissal, just


as the Court did in the sovereign immunity case involving


Israel last year where there were two alternative grounds.


QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me --


MR. TARANTO: 


The merits question is a much 

more --


QUESTION:  It seems to me you're just trying to


rush to the merits.  I -- I think the standing and the


issues are very serious issues here.


MR. TARANTO:  Oh, we -- we think so as -- as


well, and let me -- let me address that briefly.


QUESTION:  What you're -- what you're saying


basically it's a claim for relief issue rather than a --


than a jurisdictional issue.


MR. TARANTO:  Yes, yes.  The -- the statutory

standing question has always been treated as a question of


what the meaning of section 4 of the Clayton Act, the


damages provision, is here, and both the indirect


purchaser rule and the more general indirectness aspect of


Associated General Contractor has to do with who can get


what kinds of relief.  That's not a jurisdictional


question, and therefore it remains open to this Court to


do what we think the Court should do, which is also to


address the question that is directly dividing the


circuits, what is the scope of section 2.  And --


QUESTION:  Mr. Taranto, you made a -- an


interesting classification, and I think I tend to agree


with it, but I'm not sure that these Court's cases fit


that mold.


I had thought that the things that are put under 

the head of, quote, prudential standing sound like does


this person have a claim under this statute for relief. 


That's a 12(b)(6) question.  But the Court seems to have


-- think that there's something in between constitutional


standing, which everyone agrees exists here, and 12(b)(6),


and that's this prudential standing notion.


Is there a difference between the 12(b)(6)


inquiry, does this statute afford this plaintiff a claim


for relief, and what this Court has called prudential


standing?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 

 MR. TARANTO:  The best that I can do with that


is to describe what the Court has done in the cases that


we rely on for saying there's no statutory standing. 


Associated General Contractors and Illinois Brick and its


follow-on, Kansas against UtiliCorp, are all about the


interpretation of section 4 of the Clayton Act.  In that


sense, they are classic 12(b)(6) questions.  The entire


analysis in Associated General Contractors is about what


the term injury to business or property means.  They are


interpretive questions in that way.  They're not separate


prudential standing questions somewhere between


constitutional standing and statutory coverage.  And


that's why we think it is both proper and really quite


important for purposes of the several other circuit cases


that are now sitting in cert petitions in this Court on 

the merits question that divides the circuits.


There is no section 2 duty on the merits now to


turn over your sales to a rival.  This Court said, as far


back as 1920 in the U.S. Steel case, section 2 does not


condemn mere size.  Section 2 does not compel competition. 


The 1996 act does.  It has a quite different policy.  It


says we will mandate creation of competition.  Section 2


says we protect against affirmative interferences in


independently arising competition.  They're fundamentally


different statutory approaches to a highly general goal of

competition.


QUESTION:  Is this a kind of refusal to deal


case?  So it could be covered in theory by section 2?


MR. TARANTO:  It is a kind of refusal to deal. 


It is -- all of the claims in this case, all of the facts


allege inadequate help to rivals to come and displace


one's own sales.  This Court has broadly recognized that


section 2 protects the right to just make your sales and


not turn them over to rivals with a category of


exceptions.  Every one of those exceptions, the refusal to


deal cases, involves discrimination.  The firm was


voluntarily in the business of selling the product that


the plaintiff wanted, and the plaintiff wanted it at the


terms that the firm was selling it to others, and the


defendant said, no.


That threshold condition has so far been the


only sufficiently reliable one to trigger the inquiry, if


you're selling it to some -- to everybody else, why not to


the particular plaintiff?  And the answer, we're not


selling to the plaintiff because the plaintiff is a rival


or the plaintiff is dealing with a rival, has been the one


exception to the general rule that forced sales to help


rivals is not adequate.  Discrimination doesn't mean that


-- mean illegality.  There may be good reasons, but it so


far has been the necessary threshold condition for

demanding an inquiry. 


This case does not involve any kind of


discrimination like that.  There's no allegation here. 


There couldn't be an allegation that Verizon was in the


business of renting out its facilities to rivals at


specially discounted prices before the 1996 act compelled


that.


So for Trinko to prevail here, it would have to


-- the Court would have to recognize something brand new


under section 2.  It would have to expand section 2 to


where it has never been before, and we submit there are


extremely good reasons for not doing that. 


QUESTION:  And the reason Otter Tail -- Otter


Tail seems like the strongest precedent against you. 


Before you say the reasons against expansion, I'd just 

like to hear 30 seconds on why in your opinion Otter Tail


is different than this.


MR. TARANTO:  Otter Tail was also a case of


discrimination.  If -- the opinion in Otter -- in Otter


Tail is a little bit shy on full explanation for what


factors matter, and so one has to look at what the facts


were.  If you look at the extensive findings of fact by


the district judge, which are in the -- not the appendix


of this case but the appendix in Otter Tail, there's an


entire section called discrimination.  Otter Tail at -- at

JA 103 to 111.


Otter Tail was undisputedly in the business of


wholesaling power and of wheeling power to others.  When


particular communities came and said we want from you the


same thing that you're happily selling to others, Otter


Tail said no.


That's exactly the same kind of discrimination


that existed in Aspen Skiing where the three mountain


defendants said, we won't even take full price ski tickets


from people who are using the fourth mountain because


that's a rival.  So discrimination was the predicate there


too.


This is not a case of discrimination.  In the


absence of discrimination, any court entertaining a


section 2 duty would have to undertake tasks that 

antitrust has never viewed as appropriate.  It would have


to ask what are the effects on long-run investments, the


long-term effects on investments.


QUESTION:  Well, now you're back into the


merits, aren't you?


MR. TARANTO:  Yes, yes. 


QUESTION:  Yes.  Did you finish with the inquiry


of whether we should recognize this plaintiff? 


MR. TARANTO:  Well, I -- we think not really for


-- for a combination of reasons.  All of the factors in

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 

Associated General Contractors I think point in the same


direction.  The injury here is indirect.  That is, Trinko


was a customer of AT&T which was a customer of Verizon,


and Trinko's injury was only an indirect result of the


alleged injury to AT&T.  The additional considerations


point in the same direction.  There's obviously a better


plaintiff.  AT&T.


QUESTION:  But AT&T didn't bring an antitrust


action.


MR. TARANTO:  Well, the -- the final -- final


reason I'll mention here is that recognizing the statutory


cause of action here would also interfere with the


voluntarily agreed upon nonjudicial dispute resolution


mechanism that AT&T and Verizon entered into.


QUESTION: 


Mr. Taranto, Judge Katzmann in the 

Second Circuit, whose decision we're reviewing, seemed to


think that AT&T was not, as you expressed it, the better


complainant, but that the remedy for AT&T was the


administrative context.  I -- I thought his opinion


suggested that for AT&T the remedy was the administrative


route, but for the customer who has no place else to go,


it was court or nothing because the customer would not


have access to that administrative process.


Now, is there -- first of all, is -- would AT&T


have standing or state a claim for relief if AT&T had been

the plaintiff here?


And second, if you're right that this plaintiff


has no claim in court, is there anyplace that this


plaintiff can go with the complaint?  The reality is --


and we accept what the complaint alleges as true for


current purposes -- I have gotten the worst service.  It's


a constant embarrassment.  I've lost clients.  I've lost


my professional reputation.  That's a legitimate


complaint.  Is there anyone in the world that that can be


asserted against?


MR. TARANTO:  Let me take those in -- in order,


if I may.


AT&T could, of course, have brought a Sherman


Act suit had it not expressly waived its right to go to


court. 


It adopted instead a mechanism by which it secured 

relief far more promptly than any antitrust case would


have -- would have obtained.  So it's like --


QUESTION:  But it had no choice in that.  I


mean, that's a statutory mechanism.  There's no


independent waiver that AT&T, as apart from others, what


they call them, CLEC's.  It's -- it's an -- it's a regime


imposed on all the participants, isn't it?


MR. TARANTO:  Well, that -- that -- nondispute


judicial -- dispute judicial -- nonjudicial dispute


resolution was here part of an agreement.  It's not in the

statute.  Many agreements contain it.  Some agreements do


not contain it.  This one does.  And it serves very


important statutory functions of providing what here took


only 3 months or so fully to resolve the problem and to


provide compensation to AT&T.  And that's --


QUESTION:  Okay, and if -- if there hadn't been


an agreement, AT&T would go where?  To the commission? 


MR. TARANTO:  It -- it could go to the


commission or it could bring a Sherman Act suit unless, of


course, as we do contend, there is no legitimate section


-- section 2 claim.  But as far as standing is concerned,


the customer, that is, AT&T, has standing.


QUESTION:  Mr. Taranto, would you clarify one


thing for me?  Did the AT&T settlement just settle the New


York area problems or was it nationwide?


MR. TARANTO:  The New York Public Service


Commission settlement settled the New York problem.  There


was an FCC national level consent decree that on a going-


forward basis settled -- solved the problem.  The problem


was in fact a -- a New York-specific one, and here we're


talking about the only concrete instance in --


QUESTION:  Well, I was under the impression AT&T


retained the right to sue in other parts of the country. 


In fact, they filed an amicus brief in this case, which


suggests that they still have an interest in the ongoing

controversy, but not in New York.


MR. TARANTO:  I -- I'm -- I'm -- I don't know


that AT&T has signed similar agreements for the rest of


the country.  This particular problem that gave rise to


this problem was fully resolved in New York with


compensation to AT&T and nationally at the FCC level.  So


I -- I -- AT&T certainly, wherever it hasn't adopted an


arbitration agreement, the way any other plaintiff can


adopt, certainly has a right to go to court and to argue


as -- as Covad has in the Eleventh Circuit case, as


Cavalier has in the Fourth Circuit case, to argue that


there is a Sherman Act claim, and that's the merits claim


that is before this Court as part of this case as well.


QUESTION:  Of course, their position is that


this isn't the best test case because this plaintiff 

didn't make all the right allegations, as I read their


brief.


MR. TARANTO:  Well, I -- I don't think there


could have been any different allegations on the


dispositive point.  As long as the allegations are the


incumbent insufficiently helped the rival --


QUESTION:  Yes, but they -- they alleged that in


other areas, that there had been -- that there's been sham


litigation, fraudulent misrepresentations, and -- and


affirmative misconduct, in addition to failing to comply

with all the requirements of the '96 statute.


MR. TARANTO:  And -- and those -- those claims,


to the extent that they're not helping hand kinds of


claims, would of course be outside the analysis.  The


Cavalier case, the Covad case are overwhelmingly, as this


case is, helping hand cases, as the Goldwasser case in the


Seventh Circuit was, and that's the core issue that --


that all of these cases are about.


Now --


QUESTION:  Would you get to the --


MR. TARANTO:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- the last part?  Does this customer


of AT&T have any remedy for the bad service that the


customer attributes not to AT&T but to Verizon?


MR. TARANTO:  Yes. 


Well, first, in this very 

case the Second Circuit reinstated the section 202 claim


of this plaintiff and this Court denied cert on that.  So


that claim is alive in this very case.


QUESTION:  Are damages available on that claim?


MR. TARANTO:  The claim is -- is a claim under


the damages provision of section 207 for an alleged


violation of the substantive Communications Act provision


in section 202. 


They, of course, also have any remedies any


customer has for lousy service here against AT&T, the

provider of the service, which received compensation.


QUESTION:  But you -- you say that under --


under 202 that there would be if -- if plaintiff prevails


on that claim against Verizon, not AT&T, there would be a


damage remedy for the loss that the plaintiff could prove? 


In other words, does it give the plaintiff the same thing


that the plaintiff is seeking here except it's not


trebled?


MR. TARANTO:  The plaintiff certainly asks for


the same damages.  Section 202 -- section 207 is the


liability damages provision of the Communications Act. 


The Second Circuit said that that provision was available


to this plaintiff to seek recovery for injury from the


alleged violation of section 202.


QUESTION: 


Then why did Judge Katzmann say a 

couple of times the only opportunity for the plaintiff to


get damages is if there is this second section 2 suit?


MR. TARANTO:  I'm -- I'm afraid I can't answer


that question, having -- the court having reinstated that


-- that claim.  That is a damages claim.


If the Court has no further questions, I would


reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Taranto.

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


It is not a Sherman Act violation to breach a


telephone interconnection agreement.  The telephone -- the


Telecommunications Act created an extraordinary, carefully


crafted, comprehensive regulatory and remedial regime to


force lawful monopolies --


QUESTION:  Mr. Solicitor General, before you get


into your argument, do you have a position on the standing


issue?


MR. OLSON:  We did not brief and we did not take


a position in our briefing on the standing question.  We


-- and our reason for doing that, Justice Stevens, is that 

we believe that in order to ascertain antitrust standing,


one has to connect the injury, the alleged injury, to an


antitrust violation.  We feel that the question of whether


or not there's an antitrust violation in this case comes


before the determination of the antitrust injury.  And


therefore, the United States did not brief that question. 


We do believe that the '96 statute is, as this


Court characterized it in its previous review of that


statute, extraordinary in that it -- it set out to create


competition in an area where the antitrust laws would not

have accomplished that objective.  The --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  I've just been thinking


about your prior answer, and I -- we certainly don't --


don't do this for standing normally.  We -- we say the


question of whether there's been an injury comes before


the question of whether there's been a violation.  That's


what standing is all about.  And -- and you -- you say


that the Government has just concluded that -- that both


questions are -- are of equal priority, and that -- that's


just not the way we usually work.


MR. OLSON:  We -- we felt, Justice Scalia, not


in the context of Article III standing, but in the context


of prudential standing in the context of antitrust


standing which relates specifically to something this


Court has called antitrust injury, which ties into the 

particular violation, and in order to determine that here,


we felt that the Court would have to first answer the


question whether there is an antitrust injury itself.  Is


there any violation of the antitrust laws that would give


rise to a section 2, Sherman Act claim in this case.

case where a -- a plaintiff without a real interest may be


the one that's -- that's demanding that -- that


adjudication.  This is very odd.

and had we briefed the question, we would have -- we would


have thought that there was -- that -- that Trinko had


some points here, that it -- this is not an Illinois Brick


case -- that Trinko was depending in part upon service


provided by the Verizon loop and that it had a choice, as


the plaintiffs -- the plaintiff -- that Trinko has alleged


in this case, that it had a choice between deficient


service from AT&T or -- or paying perhaps a higher price


or something else from Verizon, that there are


distinctions.


And we think that they might -- but because we


didn't brief that, because we thought it was -- the Court


first -- we have a litigant here that alleges, and we have


a Second Circuit decision, and we've got other circuit


decisions that have addressed this very antitrust issue --

that it's very important to resolve that case,


particularly in the context of where we have an -- a


significant, extraordinary effort by Congress to create a


comprehensive, complex, carefully modulated effort to


create something. 


QUESTION:  And do you -- do you take the


position that that effort gives Trinko a cause of action


under the statute?


MR. OLSON:  That we take -- I'm sorry.

cause of action under the statute?


MR. OLSON:  Under -- well, yes.  In fact, this


is in answer I think to Justice Ginsburg's question. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. OLSON:  There is a -- there would be -- and


the Second Circuit did decide that there was a right to


action under the discrimination provisions of section 202. 


And this appears -- it's the -- the first full --


QUESTION:  Is --


QUESTION:  But I -- I thought Mr. Taranto said


this -- there is no discrimination in this case.  So that


if that's true, then there wouldn't be a remedy under 207.


MR. OLSON:  Well, first of all, to the extent


that there is and to the extent that there are allegations


of that, the court addressed that and reinstated that very 

cause of action.  This Court decided not to review that. 


That --


QUESTION:  Okay, but on the -- just on the facts


pleaded, do you take -- does the United States take the


position that -- that Trinko has pleaded a cause of action


under 202 or any other section of the statute?


MR. OLSON:  We do not dispute, Justice Souter,


the existence of the cause of action recognized by the


Second Circuit on page 16a --

MR. OLSON:  We do not.


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. OLSON:  With respect to that section of the


Communications Act.


QUESTION:  But is there any reason he can't go


to the -- the PSC like anybody else can and say I have


ducks on the line? 


MR. OLSON:  That's --


QUESTION:  I can't hear anything.  It's terrible


and then they issue an order.  And if they don't follow


the order, you go to court and sue them for damages.


MR. OLSON:  That's also true and there's also an


action against the -- the -- Trinko had a contract with


AT&T to supply it with adequate telephone service.  It may


have a cause of action against AT&T.  To the extent that


AT&T attributes its inability to provide that service to


Verizon, AT&T has already addressed that under the


exclusive remedies it had available to it under the


contract.


QUESTION:  To -- to get to -- to the merits part


of the case, the sacrifice test that you want us to adopt


assumes that certain acts are not pro-competitive.  But in


this case, doesn't the telephone -- doesn't the 1996


Communications Act tell us that certain acts are not pro-

competitive?


MR. OLSON:  Actually we submit, Justice Kennedy,


that what the Communications Act does is something that


the antitrust laws never did do.  And the reason that the


Communications Act was in -- in fact necessary to break up


the monopolies, to cause legitimate, lawful monopolies to


do something that the antitrust laws wouldn't require,


that is, to open up their markets, which they had no


obligation under the antitrust laws to do, at a subsidized


rate to invite in competition -- that entire regulatory


scheme was something that Congress decided was necessary


to do which no other laws in existence had been able to


do.


Therefore, not only -- and I think that this is


clear from the Court's jurisprudence as well, but also 

well articulated in the Town of Concord decision that was


authored by Justice Breyer on the First Circuit.  That


regulatory regime, which monitors the conduct on an


ongoing basis, which the antitrust laws are not well


equipped to do, prevents the occurrence of antitrust


injury and inhibits the ability to accomplish antitrust


benefits and monitors the process in a way that succeeds


in dealing with the possibility of anti-competitive


conduct, but conduct that was not required at all under


the antitrust laws, that on opening of the markets to

selling one's assets at a discount, to going into a


business that the lawful monopolist was not already in. 


The additional point there is that the treble


damage remedy is considerably more draconian.  It acts in


an ad hoc, specific case under the supervision of


generalize -- generalist judges and ad hoc juries. 


Whereas Congress decided that the scheme was most -- that


was most appropriate -- the regime that was most


appropriate to create this new world that this Court


specifically recognized in the two previous


Telecommunications Act cases was this regulatory regime,


inhabited by experts, administered by experts, where there


are prompt, efficient, effective remedies, and -- and a


scheme which is adjustable from time to time to deal with


any anti-competitive conduct.


So it's not only a reason why Congress said we


do not change the antitrust laws by this statute.  There's


good reasons why Congress decided to do that.  But there's


also additional reasons why the section 2 remedy would be


a sledge hammer in an area where Congress has enacted a


scalpel to deal --


QUESTION:  Why -- why do we have to accept or


buy into your broader no-help theory of the antitrust laws


if we -- we accept what you've just said?  Why can't we


just say in this particular instance, we don't have to

particular instance the Communications Act has just


superseded the Sherman Act?


MR. OLSON:  I agree with that, Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  You do.


MR. OLSON:  -- that the Court does not need to


go into broader general principles.  And this Court -- we


-- we addressed those principles because we felt we had an


obligation.  And we have addressed -- the Government has


articulated those same principles not only in this


Court --


QUESTION:  How can you say the Communications


Act has superseded the Sherman Act when the statute itself


says it didn't? 


MR. OLSON: 


It does -- no, we are not suggesting 

-- we're not saying that the -- that the act provides any


immunity.  The act still exists side by side.  What we do


say is that this was not -- this conduct was not a Sherman


Act violation before the act, and the act specifically


says --


QUESTION:  Well, that's a different point than


the one Justice Scalia made.  You're saying there was no


antitrust violation whether or not there was a


Communications Act or not.


MR. OLSON:  That's correct, but it's

exists.  To the extent that there is any anti-competitive


activity, this Court has repeatedly said that it must look


from -- at the antitrust laws and the application of the


antitrust laws in connection with the particular industry


and in a particular regime in which it exists.  So when


this Court -- this case comes to this Court, it is


entirely consistent for this Court to look at the alleged


violation of the antitrust laws in that context.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


I'll address the standing question first and


explain why consumers in Trinko's position have standing


and why General Olson is correct that Illinois Brick is


not a problem.  Then I'll show why it would be unwise and


unwarranted to adopt the discrimination test that my


friends on the other side advocate as a matter of section


2 law and why the 1996 act is crucially relevant and why

the antitrust laws in that act should be enforced in


tandem, as Congress indicated. 


Now --


QUESTION:  And at some point in -- in your


standing discussion, could you address whether or not


Trinko could just have sued AT&T, say you're giving us


lousy service, we want our money back?


MR. VERRILLI:  I think Trinko could have brought


a suit like that.  Of course, AT&T would have then said it


was Verizon's fault, which it was, and there would be --


QUESTION:  That's not usually a defense, the


failure of the contracting party to deliver adequate


services under the contract.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, that -- that's correct, but


in this situation, there -- there might well be filed rate 

doctrine problems with a suit like that.  There would be


all kinds of a problems with a suit like that.  And in any


event, because Trinko has -- has an is a proper plaintiff


under section 4 of the Clayton Act, is entitled to invoke


the Sherman Act, the fact that they had -- it has other


remedies seems to me beside -- beside the crucial point.


Now, under Reiter against Sonotone, this Court


held that consumers have standing under section 4 of the


Sherman Act -- under section 4 of the Clayton Act to sue


when they are injured by anti-competitive conduct that

raises prices or lowers quality in the market where they


purchase.  That is what Mr. Trinko is alleging. 


Illinois Brick is not a reason to cut off that


standing here, as General Olson indicated, for the


following reason.  Illinois Brick applies when Hanover


Shoe applies, and Hanover Shoe does not apply here. 


Illinois Brick is just the flip side of Hanover Shoe.


Hanover Shoe says that in a case of a price-


fixing overcharge -- the same as in UtiliCorp -- price-


fixing overcharge -- when a middle man pays too much, the


middle man is entitled to sue under the Sherman Act for


the entire amount of the price-fixing overcharge, and the


-- and the defendant can't assert a pass-through defense. 


And -- and the reason for that is to ensure full and


effective use and enforcement of the Sherman Act's damages 

remedy.


Now, in that situation, what Illinois Brick


holds is that, well, once the -- once the middle man has


sued for the full value of the overcharge, then the people


subsequently down the chain can't bring antitrust claims


themselves because that would create a problem of


duplicative recovery.  But the -- but the reason that you


don't have --


QUESTION:  Or even if he hasn't sued I thought.


MR. VERRILLI:  That -- well, that's correct, but

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 

there were -- because he could sue and there will be


problems of duplicative recovery.  But that -- it only


applies, Justice Scalia, in situations where the measure


of damages that the middle man would have is the


overcharge damages.  And here, of course, AT&T is a


competitor of Verizon.  AT&T would bring a monopolization


claim, and it's been clear since the Southern Photo case


in 1927 that AT&T's measure of damages would be its lost


profits, not an overcharge, but its lost profits.  And --


QUESTION:  So as long as the consumer can bring


an action for something that AT&T couldn't bring, no


Illinois -- no Hanover, no Illinois Brick.


MR. VERRILLI:  Correct.  In fact, it would


disserve the very policies of Hanover Shoe here because it


would result in the -- the monopolist not being 

responsible for the full value of the antitrust injury it


inflicts.  So there's no Illinois Brick problem here.


And I think that's why my friends on the other


side in Verizon relied so much on Associated General


Counsel -- Associated General Contractors rather than


Illinois Brick.  But, of course, all that case states, as


-- as this Court made clear in Holmes, is a rule of


proximate cause.


And remember the facts in Associated General


Contractors.  The allegation was that a landowner

pressured a contractor to hire non-union subcontractors,


and as a result the union subcontractors had less


business, and as a result, they had fewer employees, and


as a result, the union had fewer dues to collect.  And the


Court quite properly held that proximate causation can't


possibly extend that far.


QUESTION:  Yes, but isn't there a proximate


cause problem in this case too?  You -- you represent a


class, I think.  Your -- and is it not likely that the --


there are many, many members of the class who have


different kinds of injuries from the other members of the


class?  It's a little hard for me to understand precisely


how the wrongdoing that affected AT&T necessarily carries


over to customers of AT&T.


MR. VERRILLI: 


The means by which Verizon was 

trying to monopolize the market, as the complaint alleges


-- and I think this is clear from paragraphs 1 and 2 and


54 of the amended complaint -- was that it was -- Verizon


was using its control of the local loop that competitors


needed to lease to get service going to degrade the


service that its competitors, including AT&T, were able to


provide to customers.  That was the means by which the --


the antitrust scheme was effectuated, and as a result --

MR. VERRILLI:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  -- retail obligation?


MR. VERRILLI:  I think -- you know, remember --


QUESTION:  Because that's a little different


from the way the court of appeals described the complaint.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, I -- I understand it, Your


Honor, but the -- but the complaint -- one of the


difficulties of this case, of course, is that we're here


on a complaint and the test under rule 8 is a notice


pleading test, and it can -- and the complaint can only be


dismissed if there is no conceivable set of facts that


could be proved consistent with the allegations in the


complaint that would support relief.  And --


QUESTION: 


Yes, but you have to have alleged in 

your complaint just how it was that -- that Verizon's


misconduct hurt your clients.


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, Your Honor, and I think the


-- I think paragraph 2 of the amended complaint says that


Bell Atlantic deterred and will continue to deter


potential customers from switching to another company for


local phone service or cause customers that switch back to


Bell Atlantic in frustration for the poor services


rendered by their local phone service provider.  There are

alleged that the quality of service that AT&T customers


get and other competitors' customers get is degraded in


comparison to --


QUESTION:  Under the -- what bothers me about


the Illinois Brick problem is -- I completely agree with


your characterization, but the law would seem odd that


would say when Smith, a price-fixing ring, charges Jones


$3 extra, we don't let Jones' customers sue for the actual


overcharge he undoubtedly suffered.  But in fact, when


Smith, the monopolist, drives Jones through predatory


pricing out of the market, we let Jones' customers come in


and say, oh, my service isn't as good, I -- I may -- I


don't know exactly.  I might have switched.  I -- I got


bad service, et cetera.  You see how much more ephemeral


that is, how much more uncertain it is, how much more 

vague it is?  And the more precise thing we don't let them


recover for.  The more vague thing on your theory, which


is highly speculative, we will, on your view, let them


recover for.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, I think it's the right


answer to let them recover, and -- and it's not


speculative.  They -- their -- the -- this conduct


directly raises the cost of -- and degrades the service


that consumers in the market receive.  And they are


entitled under Reiter against Sonotone to sue for the

damages that those occur.


And it -- you know, Illinois Brick -- I'm not


here to defend the wisdom of Illinois Brick in the context


in which it exists, Justice Breyer, but it has been


narrowly confined to that context.  And -- and if you


don't have an overcharge case, you don't have Hanover


Shoe.  If you don't have Hanover Shoe, you don't have


Illinois Brick.


QUESTION:  The other thing on -- on the -- that


I had as a question on the merits of the complaint is I --


I -- if this complaint had said that Verizon went to the


customers who were trying to use AT&T and said, Mr.


Customer, we're going to wreck your service unless you buy


from us, or indeed carried that out in -- through


surreptitious ways, but that's what he was saying.  You


buy from us or you'll be sorry.  If that's what the


complaint said, you might well have a complaint.  But I


don't see that in the complaint. 


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, under --


QUESTION:  Rather, what I see in the complaint


-- and I want you to point out where it's the contrary --


is that every claim of bad service is connected through a


because or some other word like that to the refusal of


Verizon to hook up AT&T, i.e., to provide them with the


Verizon service so they can provide service to the

customer.


Now, I've read the complaint a few times, but I


want you to point out to me the part that you think most


clearly contradicts what I just said.


MR. VERRILLI:  First, paragraph 2, which is at


page --


QUESTION:  2 is the overview.


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, but what it says, Justice


Breyer, is that they degraded service.  Well, the -- the


degraded service has to occur not only during the -- the


process of switching over, but after the switching over,


and of course, under Swierkiewicz and under Leatherman,


the test here is whether there's any set of facts that


could be proved consistent with these notice pleading


allegations that would support a cause of action.  And I


think Your Honor's question proves that there is, the


first set of facts that Your Honor described.  So --


QUESTION:  Well, I'm not with you completely for


the reason that the overview seems to be an overview which


is explicated by the specific complaints of exclusionary


conduct which appear later in the complaint.


MR. VERRILLI:  But I think those complaints are


fairly construed to -- to include denial --


QUESTION:  And I would like you to point out.

52.  I think it's true about paragraph 54.  I think that


that is the essence of the complaint here.  And of course,


that makes sense because these are exactly the kinds of


allegations -- this is -- this is the way monopolization


occurs.  This is the way maintaining monopoly power occurs


in this -- in this arena.  There's a long and unfortunate


history that goes back to MCI against AT&T and


continuing --


QUESTION:  All right. 


MR. VERRILLI:  -- to this present day.


QUESTION:  Then with paragraph 54, which I


thought was the heart of the complaint, what it seems to


say at the end is when they did these bad things, the


plain effect was that AT&T was prevented from offering


local phone service of the quality, as was offered by 

Bell, and thereby to impede the ability of AT&T to


compete.  And so I took 54 as being essentially a


complaint that AT&T is kept out of the market.

MR. VERRILLI:  I think -- well, I think you do


have an obligation under the antitrust laws, and I'll try


to get to that as fast as I can.


QUESTION:  If you don't --


MR. VERRILLI:  But --


QUESTION:  If you don't, do you lose?


MR. VERRILLI:  No, because this says --


QUESTION:  Where -- where are you reading from,


Mr. Verrilli?


MR. VERRILLI:  I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. 


It's at page 46 of the joint appendix, paragraph 54 of the


amended complaint. 


What it alleges is that AT&T and other


competitors weren't able to provide service at the -- at 

the level of quality -- provide service at the level of


quality that -- that Verizon could.  It doesn't only say


that they weren't able to provide service at all.  It says


both of those things.  And so I think the allegation is


there in 54, and I think the -- and it's described in the


-- the overview, 1 and 2.  And paragraphs 1 and 2 of the


amended complaint explains how it works.


And I'd like to -- if I could, go to -- to the


core antitrust issue here.  I think it is common ground


with my friends on the other side that a monopolist's

right to refuse to deal with competitors is not an


unqualified right.  They acknowledge one qualification. 


That's where the monopolist discriminates.  They argue


that's the only time a section 2 duty ought to be imposed


because that -- in that situation you can be confident


that it's anti-competitive conduct, and you won't have


problems with dampening incentives and you won't have


administrability problems because you can refer back to


the prior course of dealing.


But where they're wrong is in suggesting that


that's the only time that you can find liability under


section 2 for monopolist refusal to cooperate with its


rivals.  It is equally true in this case, in this


situation where, as Justice Kennedy, your question earlier


indicated, there is a regulatory regime in place that 

requires competitive access on the part of the monopolist


in order to bring competition into the market.  And what


you have -- and -- and I think these allegations are


consistent that -- what I am about to say is consistent


with the allegations in the complaint, and what you have


is a course of conduct on the part of the monopolist that


is intended to subvert the competitive entry that those


regulations require. 


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you say then that the


1996 act gives you affirmative momentum that you wouldn't

have with -- that you wouldn't have if it were just the


antitrust laws? 


MR. VERRILLI:  I wouldn't put it quite that way,


Your Honor, but I -- and I will answer Your -- Your


Honor's question directly.  The -- the test, under the


Sherman Act, for exclusionary conduct applies in the same


way that -- it's the exact same test whether the '96 act


is there or not.  The test is whether the conduct impairs


rivals' opportunities to compete in the market and whether


the -- the conduct does or does not further -- by the


monopolist further competition on the merits.


That test would apply to a different factual


scenario after the 1996 act was passed than before.  And


it's clear that that must be the case.


For example, Your Honor, one thing that the 1996 

act did -- this is section 253 of the act, which I think


is at page 90 of the appendix to the petition -- it


eliminated, preempted State monopoly franchises.  Now,


prior to passage of the 1996 act, if -- if Trinko went to


sue -- bring a section 2 claim against a local telephone


provider in a State where -- where there was a monopoly


franchise law, Trinko would be out of court on the State


action doctrine.  There would be an ironclad defense. 


Well, section 253 of the act preempted the defense.


So obviously in that situation, there is an

antitrust claim that wasn't there before, and so it can't


be the case that what -- that -- that the passage of the


1996 act has no relevance whatsoever to the application of


section 2 of the Sherman Act.  And indeed, we think it


would impermissibly -- it would violate the savings clause


and impermissibly modify the applicability of the


antitrust laws to conclude that the 1996 act is the sole


remedy here for a person in Trinko's position.


QUESTION:  Well, you're modifying it either way,


aren't you?  I mean, you're modifying it if you say sole


remedy.  You're modifying it if -- if it gives, in the


Chief Justice's words, momentum.


MR. VERRILLI:  I don't think so.


QUESTION:  It's modification either way.


MR. VERRILLI: 


I don't think so, Justice Souter, 

because the -- the statute says that nothing shall modify


the -- modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of


the antitrust laws.


QUESTION:  And the momentum theory, in effect,


says the applicability is being modified because there's a


declaration of certain anti-competitive conduct.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, I don't -- I don't think


so.  I think it -- the exact same test applies before the


act was enacted and after, so it doesn't -- it doesn't


modify the substantive antitrust rule one iota.  What it

changes is the facts to which the rule applies.  Now, in


this case it would not be true --


QUESTION:  But I thought you were invoking the


act for the characterization of those facts as anti-


competitive.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, yes, in the following


sense, Justice Souter.  But I don't think it constitutes a


modification of the applicability of the antitrust laws. 


It might change the result under the antitrust laws, but


not modify the applicability because the general rule


under the antitrust laws is that one takes the regulatory


context into account, and the fact that conduct violates


extrinsic norms, and in particular, when it violates, as


it did in MCI v. AT&T and in the Litton Systems case and


the court -- cases in the court of appeals, when it 

violates extrinsic norms that are designed to promote


competition, that counts against the --


QUESTION:  Are -- are you saying that the


Telecommunications Act imposes new duties and the


violation of those duties now becomes an antitrust


violation?


MR. VERRILLI:  No.  That's --


QUESTION:  You want to talk about the -- about


-- about the facts of -- of the -- of the market.  I


understand that.

 MR. VERRILLI:  They -- I --


QUESTION:  But it seemed to me the thrust of


Justice Souter's question as well was that the


Telecommunications Act imposes new duties, and violation


of those new duties is -- is really the gravamen of your


complaint.


MR. VERRILLI:  I don't think that -- I don't


think that's quite right, Justice Kennedy, and let me try


to explain why.


The test is whether the monopolist's conduct


prevents competition, obstructs competition, whether it


does so on a basis other than competition on the merits,


and whether it is -- there's otherwise a legitimate


business justification.  That's the general rule, as the


United States acknowledges at page 14 of its complaint. 

That's the rule that was applied in Aspen, the rule that


was applied in Kodak.  That's the rule. 


That rule applies here.  When one answers the


first part of that test that -- which is does the


monopolist's conduct obstruct competition, the -- the --


it's not the case that any violation of the 1996 act would


obstruct competition.  What has to be shown there is that


the monopolist's conduct is sufficiently grave,


sufficiently serious, sufficiently sustained that it --


that it amounts to an overall pattern that obstructs

competition.  So it's not the case that there is a -- that


-- that there's a -- an automatic transference of a -- of


a duty under the 1996 act into an antitrust duty.


But where the -- where the 1996 act becomes


relevant is when you get to the next stage of the inquiry. 


And I think -- and it's just what Your Honor said earlier. 


At that stage in the inquiry, it is -- the monopolist does


not have open to it the argument that this is pro-


competitive behavior and that I have a legitimate business


justification for it because in that circumstance, it is


unlawful to do it.  And so it can't be a legitimate


business justification to say I don't want to do something


that the law compels me to do because I'll be better off


as a competitive matter if I don't do it.  So it does


enter the analysis. 


It's not irrelevant by any means. 

But it doesn't transform or change in any way the


antitrust standard.


But it -- it does have this -- this additional


effect --


QUESTION:  Or does it say we define pro-


competitive in a -- in a new way based on the


Telecommunications Act?  The Telecommunications Act is


pro-competitive.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, I think -- I think it does


say that this is conduct that it -- that it -- I think you

can no longer say that it is -- that it is consistent with


competition on the merits for a monopolist to refuse to


cooperate when a law designed to promote competition


insists on the cooperation.  So I think in that way, I


agree with Your Honor, that's what's happening here.


And then the other thing that's critical is


that --


QUESTION:  What is cooperation?  I mean, the --


the main obstacle in my mind to your argument is that if


we accept your argument, it will be a violation of the


antitrust law not to agree to interconnect with the new


competitor coming in.  Immediately it will be a question


of was that refusal reasonable or not.  What were the


terms?  What were the pricing?  What was the lease


arrangement, et cetera? 


Because there's no way to know 

whether it's justified or not justified under the law


without going into those details.  You and I both know


that there have been opinions written in this Court that


just skim the surface of the complexity of answering that


kind of question. 


And the main obstacle to your argument in my


mind is it seems to be a question of whether that


incredibly complex question will be answered by a


regulatory agency in a regulatory proceeding brought by


complainants or by 500 judges and juries in antitrust

cases throughout the country, each potentially reaching a


different answer.


MR. VERRILLI:  I -- I disagree with that, Your


Honor, and the reason why is this.  Because I think that


question -- if I may say so, I think it picks up on what I


believe to be a false choice that my friends on the other


side are presenting, and that's a choice between, on the


one hand, a -- a duty to deal relegated solely to the


circumstance of discrimination and, on the other hand, a


wholly unqualified duty to deal that -- that might raise a


lot of the problems that Your Honor has identified.


But there's a middle ground here, and it's the


middle ground that I -- that I submit to Your Honor that


-- that Professor Areeda identified in a 1989 article and


that makes a world of sense. 


And that is, when there is a 

regulatory regime in place that supplies the background


norms, then the juries don't answer those questions.  The


juries decide something very different.  What the juries


will decide in that set of circumstances is whether the


regulatory requirements have been violated or not, and


they'll also -- and -- and remember, many of these


regulatory requirements are contractual terms.


QUESTION:  And many of those regulatory


requirements consist of something called TELRIC blank

number of pages and I'm sure would come into the argument


about whether the pricing condition is or is not a


reasonable one.


MR. VERRILLI:  I don't -- I don't think that's


right, Your Honor.  I -- I think it is -- it's an obvious


defense in a case like this for -- for an incumbent to


say, well, I'm -- I'm in compliance with the law and I'm


in compliance with my contractual obligations.  I think


it's also a defense for an incumbent, as it was in the MCI


v. --


QUESTION:  But does that go to the jury then? 


Well, I mean, so you say it's -- it's a -- a defense, but


it's always going to be argued, no, you're in compliance;


yes, I am in compliance.


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes. 


I -- I think the answer is 

if it can't be resolved on summary judgment -- of course,


Matsushita says that summary judgment has a particularly


important role to play in antitrust cases, but if it


can't, then -- then it will go to the jury.


But that's really not any different --


QUESTION:  Well, but then you have the jury


determining whether -- whether TELRIC pricing is -- has


been properly applied or not.  Don't you --


MR. VERRILLI:  No, I don't think you do because

Your Honor, is -- is something very different.  There


might be a contractual provision, for example, that says


you've got to cut over the loops from your own switching


system to our switching system within an average of 6


days.  Now, if a plaintiff were able to come into court


and show, well, you know, the contract says 6 days, but


actually it's taken them 6 months and as a result, we're


being disabled, that's not anything different than what --


what an antitrust court and what an antitrust jury is


asked to decide in any case.  These antitrust cases are


complex.  There's no getting around that.  They -- but --


but they go to a jury if there's a dispute of fact. 


There's no getting around that either.  And this is no


different from any other one in those respects.


QUESTION: 


You're saying only when the claim 

relates not to the refusal to interconnect, but to the


failure to provide adequate service after interconnection


pursuant to a contract.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor.  I


-- I think there would be -- I think there would be claims


of both kinds possible certainly under the antitrust laws.


QUESTION:  Well, let's suppose it's a refusal to


interconnect.

 MR. VERRILLI:  That's also governed by the same


set of regulatory norms, and it takes away -- it --


QUESTION:  But in that case at least you'd have


to put to the jury the question of whether the refusal to


enter into this contract was an unreasonable one, which


would depend on these very subtle pricing determinations. 


MR. VERRILLI:  I -- well, I think there might be


some circumstances, Your Honor, in which it will be a


harder case to make, and that might be a case where a


judge could appropriately say, it's too complicated, it


can't go to the jury, or might appropriately say, this is


a matter for primary jurisdiction.  But it is not a black


and white situation in which the -- the right answer here


is to cut off an antitrust remedy that Congress clearly


envisioned when it enacted that savings clause.  Congress


enacted the savings clause to make clear that antitrust


was to operate in conjunction with the regulatory regimes


here, and with all due respect --


QUESTION:  Mr. Verrilli? 


QUESTION:  Yes, but this is in some ways a sort


of derivative cause of action that Trinko brings with --


with the primary injured party probably being AT&T.  And


so it is a concern when you address it in this context,


isn't it?

it is not a concern that defeats standing for the reasons


I gave earlier, and it is a concern that can be overcome


through the normal processes of discovery under the


Federal rules. 


And -- and with respect to the -- to the


substantive antitrust claim that's before the Court -- and


in fact, the existence of the regulatory regime solves the


problems.  It sets the benchmarks.  It functions as a


benchmark in just the same way that a prior course of


dealing would function as a benchmark in a discrimination


case, and --


QUESTION:  Mr. Verrilli, in attempting to


determine whether these two pieces of legislation operate


on separate tracks, Telecommunications Act, section 2,


Judge Wood said one of the problems with reading the 

Telecommunications Act effectively into section 2 is that


it then -- then section 2 of the Sherman Act might eclipse


this elaborate regime that Congress set up because why


would any player want to use that mechanism instead of


coming into court with the possibility of getting treble


damages. 


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, I -- I think the answer is,


Your Honor, because in -- in the absence of an effort by a


-- an entity, a competitor, to use the mechanisms that the


act put in place, then that -- in that situation, the

entity doesn't have an antitrust claim where they could


show exclusionary conduct based on subversion on the


regulatory requirements and lack of a legitimate business


justification based on refusal to abide by the regulatory


requirements because they haven't invoked the regulatory


requirements. 


QUESTION:  But after because -- because


certainly AT&T could go back to the regulator and say --


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's


right, but that's a far -- but -- but I think that's a far


different situation from the one that Judge Wood


described.  And I think it's important, critically


important, here to understand where the regulators are on


that very question.  The regulators don't think there's


interference if there's mutual enforcement.  It's notable


that the Federal Communications Commission is not on the


brief for the United States and the Federal Trade


Commission today and that's because their position, which


is articulated in orders which we cite in the footnote


page 38 of our brief, is that the duties that they impose,


the -- the access duties and specific obligations, ought


to be enforced under the antitrust laws as well as under


the -- as well as under the Telecommunications Act and


that -- and that -- you know, the lessons of history are


behind that and the lessons of common sense are behind

that.


The fact is that the regulatory regime that the


FCC tried to put in place to bring long distance


competition and to bring telephone equipment competition


was insufficient, standing on its own with all of those


regulatory mechanisms, to make that competition occur. 


That competition occurred only when vigorous antitrust


enforcement was brought to bear in part to enforce those


very regulatory requirements.


And that makes a great deal of common sense, of


course, because the incumbents in this situation have


every incentive in the world for this system not to work


because they want to retain as many customers as they can


and they want to make as much money as they can, and they


have ample ability to do it. 


There's a thousand ways in 

which they could subvert this -- this regulatory regime by


-- with -- with using low-level, low-intensity


obstructionist conduct that history has shown is beyond


the power of the regulators to -- to capture and prevent.


And that is why antitrust law needs to apply


here.  It's why the FCC says it should apply.  It's why


the 15 States who have submitted a brief in support of our


position on this said it should apply because that's the


only way, operating in tandem, that we're going to get to


the competition that Congress tried to bring about.  And I

competition, pro-competitive mask a fundamental


distinction between the 1996 act and the Sherman Act.  The


'96 act creates competition.  Section 2 of the Sherman Act


has always gone no further than protecting independently-


developed competition. 


The '96 act is a comprehensive 

regime for policing the thousand ways, as Mr. Verrilli


said, in which the obligations to create competition might


be violated.


This complaint, if you look at the two


paragraphs that Mr. Verrilli cited, paragraph 2 and


paragraph 54, are all -- is all about helping to create


competition.  Paragraph 2 says the conduct we complain of


is that Verizon was making it difficult to obtain full use


of Verizon's local loops.  There is no allegation of


obstruction of AT&T's independent efforts to create

What we ask the Court to say on the merits here


is not that there is a rigid requirement of discrimination


or anything else.  What we ask the Court to recognize is


that up till now -- till now -- helping hand cases have


been limited by the requirement of discrimination between


customers, not between self and others, but between


customers, and there are compellingly strong reasons not


to expand section 2 beyond that.  For institutional


reasons, the antitrust courts are not capable of reliably


making the necessary determinations and for fundamental


incentive reasons, the incentives of incumbents to invest,


the incentives of rivals to invest rather than piggy-back.


In this context, a common law-like context,


there's no question of overriding preexisting, settled 

antitrust obligations.  The question is should the Court


create something new.  And in a common law-like area, the


existence of another regime is one strong reason not to


create something new.  The Court said so in the Black &


Decker case only last term involving the common law of


ERISA obligations when the Court said the scope of


permissible judicial innovation is narrower where other


Federal actors are engaged.  That's what we ask the Court


to decide, that the 1996 act is one compellingly good


reason not to create new section 2 law here.
