CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 00-6933, Remon Lee v. Mike Kemna.


Ms. Vergeer.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF BONNIE I. ROBIN-VERGEER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may


it please the Court:


Remon Lee is serving a life sentence without


possibility of parole for first degree murder without ever


having had a chance to present testimony from witnesses


who could have established his innocence. 


I would like to begin by discussing whether


Lee's failure to comply with two Missouri rules governing


motions for continuance is an adequate State law ground to


bar consideration of Lee's Federal due process claim based


on the State trial court's denial of a brief continuance. 


In the circumstances in which his motion for a continuance


was made, the answer is no. 


Under this Court's existing precedents, Missouri


rules 24.09 and 24.10 are not adequate to bar review of


Lee's due process claim because application of the rules


in -- in this case was arbitrary and serves no legitimate


State interest where Lee lacked a reasonable opportunity

to comply with the letter of the rules under the


circumstances, where Lee supplied --


QUESTION:  You're -- you're just summarizing


now, I take it.  You're going to go into more detail as to


why --


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- the rules are arbitrary. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Correct.  I was just


summarizing for the Court the circumstances that made it


so that there was no legitimate State interest served in


this case. 


QUESTION:  Well, at least as far as 24.10's


elements are concerned, presumably those could have been


addressed by counsel.  I mean, the -- the different


requirements could have been orally presented.  I would


assume that 24.10 sets out certain information that is


generally regarded by the State as -- as crucial --


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  That's --


QUESTION:  -- in making the decision. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  That's correct, and every


piece of information required by those rules were before


the trial court.  The Missouri --


QUESTION:  When you say before the trial court,


you mean in the presentation made at that time orally by


counsel?  Answer that yes or no, please.

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  No.  Every element --


QUESTION:  Where -- where else are you saying it


came from? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  The opening statement by


defense counsel. 


QUESTION:  So, the trial judge is supposed to


remember the opening statement by -- by defense counsel


when he passes on a motion for a continuance that's made


at the end of the trial? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Let me clarify a few things. 


Every element required by the rules was -- was before --


was stated by counsel or by the defendants on the stand --


QUESTION:  How about -- I didn't find anything


about that at all.  The sixth requirement was that the


affiant knows of no other person whose evidence or


attendance he could have procured at trial by whom he


could prove the same facts.  Was that addressed?  I -- I


didn't find it.  Perhaps you could point me to where that


was addressed.


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  The discussion with the


trial court was -- bear in mind the discussion with the


trial court occurred in an emergency situation where


witnesses are suddenly gone and the -- and counsel is now


before the trial court explaining what had happened. 


Everyone in the discussion knew who the witnesses were and

why they were crucial to his defense.  This was a short


trial --


QUESTION:  You -- you say that the trial judge


knew it too?


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Yes, and the trial court --


even in the colloquy, you can see that the trial court


knew who the witnesses were.  At one --


QUESTION:  And what their purpose was?  I -- I


didn't get that at all out of the transcript.


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  At one point during the


discussion -- the only question that the trial court had


for counsel was were these witnesses under subpoena, and


counsel answered that question yes, twice. 


QUESTION:  The counsel has to make a showing of


his own.  It's not just responding to questions from the


court. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  When the -- when counsel


pulled out the subpoenas and starting reading from the


subpoena and he read, Gladys Edwards is supposed to come


on the last day of trial at 9 o'clock, the trial court


responded, is she the mother, showing that the trial court


understood who the witnesses were.  Bear in mind this


was --


QUESTION:  But what -- what the purpose was. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  There was only one issue in

the case and that was whether the defendant was correctly


identified by the eye witnesses or was he somewhere else. 


This was the entire affirmative defense for Mr. Lee. 


Three witnesses were his entire affirmative defense,


and --


QUESTION:  Was that explained in the opening


statement?  Could you elaborate on what was said in the


opening statement? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Yes.  In the opening


statement, which occurred only the day before this


exchange took place, counsel outlined for the trial court


and the jury the fact that Minister James Edwards, Mr.


Lee's stepfather; Gladys Edwards, his mother; and Laura


Lee, his sister had traveled from California to testify


that during the period of July through October 1992, Mr.


Lee had been staying with them in California and was not


in Kansas City.  And they -- and his statement provided


certain details that showed why they remembered when it


was, that he had come out for the birthday parties for


himself and for his niece and had stayed through the -- up


to the Halloween party.  And all of this was laid out in


the opening statement and made it clear that these


witnesses were crucial to his defense and is what his


entire defense was based on. 


QUESTION:  This -- this goes to the importance

of those witnesses.  I find it extraordinary that you


didn't get a neighbor or, you know, somebody other than


his mother, his father or stepfather, and the sister to


come and testify he was out there.  Nobody else saw him


there?  He -- he stayed in their home the whole time?  You


know, if I was looking for people to -- to bring to


testify for an alibi -- he was there for how long?  For


the whole holiday season? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  July through October.  The


record is silent --


QUESTION:  Nobody else saw him there that he


could have brought in?  He has to bring in his mother, his


stepfather, and his sister? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  I -- I can't answer that. 


The record is silent on who saw him. 


QUESTION:  Well, let me tell you -- let me tell


you, counsel, what -- what concerns me about your case. 


Let's -- let's assume that you can convince us that given


the haste -- the press of trial and the shortness of time


that the counsel did about all he could -- all he could


do.  But there was a post-conviction new trial motion some


17 days or -- or 2 weeks later, and at that point, the --


the counsel made no specific showing as to why the


witnesses -- the mystery remained.  There was -- A, there


was no showing at all or even mentioned of the fact that a

court officer might have misled them, and -- and B, we


never know why they left.  Whether -- the counsel had 2


weeks to -- to supplement that motion. 


I -- let me as you this as a predicate.  I


assume that the State trial judge at the new trial motion


had the opportunity and the right under State law to


revisit his ruling denying the continuance. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Well, there was nothing new shown by


counsel at that point.  So, even if you -- if we concede


that the press of trial and the surprise that attended the


disappearance of the witnesses excused the counsel from


doing anything more, he surely is not excused from this


skimpy showing 2 weeks later.  That's what bothers me


about the case. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Okay.  As for why, I was not


trial counsel below.  I don't know why he didn't say more


in the motion for a new trial.  But I can tell you that


the Missouri rules governing motions for a new trial say


that when a -- when error is assigned at the motion for a


new trial stage -- and this is rule 29.11 of the Missouri


Supreme Court rules -- that -- and a request is denied and


then that's made a basis for a motion for a new trial, a


short general statement reiterating that ground is


appropriate in a motion for a new trial.

As for why he didn't say more, I can't answer


that.


QUESTION:  Well, but you're -- you're saying


that Missouri, as a matter of due process, did not afford


adequate opportunity for this attorney to explain the


disappearance of his witnesses.  And even if I grant you


that the rush of -- that the press of time was such that


we can excuse the performance at the -- on the day of


trial --


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  I have --


QUESTION:  -- 2 weeks later he had -- he had all


the opportunity in the world to explain this, I think. 


Now, Judge, we were in a hurry when you denied the


continuance.  Maybe you didn't understand him, and here's


what happened.  He doesn't do that.  It seems to me that's


the end of the case from a due process standpoint.


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  I -- I disagree.  I think


that the ruling on the motion for a continuance is


evaluated ex ante.  It's evaluated at the time that the


motion was denied, and at the time that the motion was


denied -- and the standard has been stated in Unger v.


Sarafite.  Quote --


QUESTION:  But Missouri gave to the attorney the


opportunity to revisit the entire matter at the post-


conviction motion for a new trial, and nothing further was

adduced. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  The motion for a new trial


restated his grounds for granting a new trial, the fact


that the witnesses had come in -- and it did -- it did


explain that they -- these were the alibi witnesses from


California -- so that was clear in the motion for a new


trial -- and the fact that the trial court had denied that


motion without giving him a short recess or without


enforcing the subpoenas.  These witnesses were under


subpoenas, and rule 26.03 of the Missouri rules states


that when a witness doesn't -- isn't there for a criminal


trial, he's under subpoena, he's subject to arrest.


There's no special procedural rule that governs


how that has to happen.  The judge took no effort


whatsoever to enforce the subpoenas in this case, and


we're talking about just a short -- a few hours'


continuance to try to figure out what happened and to get


them in.


QUESTION:  These were sequestered witnesses, as


I remember it.  At the time of the motion for a new trial,


did the lawyer point out that the bailiff, or whoever it


was, had told them they would be excused for the -- till


the next day? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  That was not stated in the


motion for a new trial.

QUESTION:  It wasn't until later.


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  It was in the rule 29.15


State post-conviction motion that that issue first came


up.


But the question of why the witnesses ultimately


left and whether the State was responsible for that is


really a separate issue.  That goes to -- well, that may


go to cause, but it also goes to whether he has a separate


due process claim on that basis.  It's not necessary to


figure out why the witnesses left to evaluate whether or


not the trial court's denial of a brief recess to try to


figure out what happened to the witnesses was an arbitrary


denial --


QUESTION:  Well, there's where I disagree with


you because 2 weeks later, he didn't show anything more


other than they were alibi witnesses.  And I'll -- I'll


assume, for purposes of this question that he knew that


because of the opening argument. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  The reason why they left


doesn't change the fact that the moment that the trial


court ruled on the motion for a continuance, he didn't


know where they were, counsel didn't know where they were,


the prosecutor didn't know where they were.  At that


moment, was it reasonable to deny him -- I mean, the


defendant only asked for 2 hours, just a few hours --

QUESTION:  Well, but what I'm saying is we don't


need to have at that time because we have the benefit of


hindsight 2 weeks later, and you had nothing new.


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  There's nothing new in the


motion for a new trial, but no new facts need to be


adduced in the motion for a new trial.  It is appropriate


in Missouri to bring facts that are outside of the record


in a rule 29.15 post-conviction motion, and they were


brought up in the rule 29.15 post-conviction motion. 


There's no mystery here about why the State


trial court judge denied the motion, and he denied it on


the merits.  He did not deny it because the application


was defective.  The prosecutor didn't object to the


application, either the request for a continuance or the


form in which the request was made.  Had the trial court


or the prosecutor signaled some question -- and again,


bear in mind the emergency way that this came up -- had


signaled some question, he could have cured it. 


And in a way, you have a kind of a reverse


sandbagging where error is left embedded in the record and


it isn't until the direct appeal 2 years later that anyone


suggests there was something procedurally defective about


the motion. 


QUESTION:  Do -- do we know that if he had been


given the couple of hours' continuance, which is what he

asked for, you would have located the witnesses?  Where


did they go?  I -- I'm -- that part of the story never


comes out from this stuff.  They -- they just disappear


from the courthouse.  Is there any explanation of what


happened to them? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Well, the affidavits of the


witnesses don't state where they went when they left.  In


the rule 29.15 post-conviction motion, it states that they


went to a relative's house.  The defendant represented to


the trial court at the time of the colloquy that he knew


they were still in town because there was a religious


event, and counsel provided the actual address of the


relative's house, at which were believed to be staying,


and told the trial court judge that they had no telephone


there, which is why the girlfriend had gone out looking


for them. 


QUESTION:  Where did they go?  I mean, had they


gone to a movie?  I mean, if they were not back at the


uncle's house, it wouldn't have made any difference unless


it was a very short movie.  I mean, the couple of hours'


continuance that he asked for -- we have no reason to


believe it would have been -- it would have been enough,


and that's all he asked for.  These witnesses just


disappeared into thin air.  We still don't know where they


went.

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  The --


QUESTION:  Why do you say that, you know, if he


had only gotten these couple of hours, everything would


have been okay? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  The record doesn't establish


for sure where it is that they went at the time they left


or for a fact that they could have been brought in.


Again, I -- I don't think that that's necessary


to the ruling because it's evaluated at the time of the


trial court's denial.  But if the Court disagrees, it


could remand this for an evidentiary hearing to engage in


more fact-finding about what the witnesses did. 


The lower courts never got that far. 


QUESTION:  I think -- I think that's your


burden.  I think you have to show that there was an error


that -- that harmed your client, and -- and if the refusal


to -- to give a couple of hours' continuance -- if there's


no reason to believe that -- that it caused any harm,


what's the difference? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  There is nothing in the


record that contradicts the representations made by


counsel and the defendant to the State trial court that


they were staying at a relative's house and that they were


still in town, and the State has never offered --


QUESTION:  There's nothing in those facts that

suggests you could find them in 2 hours.


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Well, counsel's actual


request for a continuance was -- was until the following


morning.  And if nothing else, even if counsel couldn't


have found them, the State has an obligation --


QUESTION:  I'm quoting -- I'm quoting from your


brief.  Lee asked his counsel to request a couple of


hours' continuance to try to locate them. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Correct, and then it's --


and then --


QUESTION:  Lee told the court that he knew the


witnesses were still in town, blah, blah, blah, blah,


blah.


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  But then -- but ultimately


counsel asked for an overnight continuance.  And that's


when the whole exchange with the judge takes place where


the judge says, oh, Friday I'm going to be with my


daughter in the hospital.  Then the lawyer says, well,


what about Monday, and the trial judge's response is, I


have another trial scheduled.  So, that's where that whole


exchange takes place. 


QUESTION:  So, you -- counsel did ask for a


continuance until the following morning. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Correct.  Correct. 


And the sheriff's office could have gone out.

Counsel also asked for arrest warrants -- he called them


capiases -- arrest warrants to go out to find the


witnesses, if necessary, if he couldn't have located them. 


And that's -- that's the least that the Due Process Clause


and the Compulsory Process Clause would require, would be


some effort to try -- to try to bring in the witnesses --


QUESTION:  But it's -- it's odd in a way, and


perhaps this doesn't -- that, you know, you would have to


get a capias and arrest your -- your father-in-law and


your mother and your sister.


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  You know, I think that is a


backup suggestion by counsel to cover all bases.  They


were under subpoena.  The defendant has a right to have


witnesses under subpoena there.  They had mysteriously


disappeared.  He had no idea why they left or where they


had gone.  And he was covering all of his bases by asking


the trial court for arrest warrants, if necessary.  It may


never have come to that because the girlfriend wasn't even


given enough time to get to the relative's house to see if


they were there. 


And just returning also to the circumstances in


which this exchange took place, the trial court had


created a real sense of rush and urgency in this trial. 


I've quoted several instances in the opening brief.  It's


footnote 9 where the State trial court had indicated to

counsel that he wanted to move this case along.  Just


before the lunch recess, in fact, he said, I want this


courtroom cleared by 2:00 p.m.  And that's trial


transcript page 570.  I want this courtroom cleared by


2:00 p.m.


QUESTION:  Counsel, please -- please don't ask


us to write an opinion where we tell judges it's wrong to


tell counsel to hurry along. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  No. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  No.  And I'm not saying that


the -- the trial court doesn't have broad discretion in


how to manage its docket and everything else. 


But when counsel was before the judge and is


explaining the situation that has occurred, the


atmospherics that had arisen where the trial court judge


is pressuring them to move along factor into how the


colloquy went, especially given that this is an unexpected


situation. 


It's not that different from what happened in


Osborne v. Ohio, although I think that case is less


compelling than ours because there was no emergency


situation.  But in Osborne v. Ohio, Ohio had a rule


requiring that jury -- that objections to jury


instructions be made right before they're delivered.

Counsel didn't object to the lack of an instruction on


lewdness, but this Court said that the pretrial motion to


dismiss the indictment on First Amendment grounds was


sufficient and --


QUESTION:  Well, the rules for reviewing that


sort of thing in this Court have changed a good deal from


the time of Osborne against Ohio I think. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Well, the basic principles


regarding when a State law ground is adequate haven't


changed much.  This Court takes a functional approach to


looking both to whether or not a litigant has a reasonable


opportunity to preserve his claim and also to whether


anything would be gained whether all of the purposes


served by the rules have been fulfilled, such that there's


some adequate State interest in enforcing a procedural


default. 


The purpose of these rules is to permit the


trial court to pass on the merits of a motion for a


continuance.  The trial court denied this motion on the


merits, and we quarrel with the basis for the trial


court's denial.  We think it was as arbitrary as arbitrary


can be.  But there's no mystery here was to why the trial


court ultimately denied that request and it wasn't because


of any procedural defect in that motion.

upheld the denial on the basis that it hadn't conformed to


rules what?  09 and 10?


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Correct.  And -- and there's


-- there's something anomalous about an appellate court


coming in to enforce a procedural rule, in circumstances


where there's an emergency situation, such that neither


the trial court, the prosecutor, or the defendant believed


that there was anything more that needed to be done.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I think it's fair to say


-- or maybe it isn't.  Maybe you can argue with this --


that what the appellate court was saying that at least


under 24.10, there was an insufficient showing, and that's


exactly what the trial judge found.  The trial judge


didn't cite 24.10.  He doesn't say I'm ruling against you


because you're inadequate of showing under 24.10.  But


it's clearly implicit in his ruling. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  The only thing that could


possibly be missing in the showing that was made during


the exchange on the continuance was a failure to repeat


the full opening statement regarding what the witnesses


would have testified to. 


QUESTION:  No.  I think it was assurance that


the witnesses would be provided within -- within the time


frame that -- that they asked for.  I didn't see where


that -- that assurance was, and that's what -- what .10

requires, and that's what I think the trial judge didn't


-- didn't have, and that's the reason he said, forget


about it. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  What rule 24 --


QUESTION:  One of the reasons.


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  -- rule 24.10(b) requires


the name and address --


QUESTION:  Where are you reading from?


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  I'm reading from page 3a of


the -- the appendix to the opening brief. 


It requires the name and residence of such


witness, if known -- that was given -- and also facts


showing reasonable grounds for belief that the attendance


or testimony of such witness will be procured within a


reasonable time.  The showing that was made to the trial


court during the discussion was both that they were still


in Kansas City, Missouri.  They hadn't left for


California, and that they had reason to believe they were


still there because they had a religious event to attend.


If he had written out of amotion, he couldn't


possibly have said more.  That is a sufficient showing


under that ground. 


QUESTION:  And they had come voluntarily.


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  And --


QUESTION:  They had not come by subpoena.  They

weren't subpoenaed until they got to Missouri.  They came


there voluntarily? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  That's correct.  They were


subpoenaed in counsel's office when he was interviewing


them.


QUESTION:  They also skipped voluntarily just


before they were supposed to be put on the stand under


oath. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  But we don't --


QUESTION:  Doesn't one factor that into account


as to whether these witnesses who suddenly vanish into


thin air are likely to be found? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  No, because there was no


factual basis at that moment before the State trial court


judge to have any idea whether it was a medical emergency,


a misunderstanding, they had gone to lunch and hadn't come


back on time.  There was no information before the State


trial court at that moment to form any assumption about


why they left. 


QUESTION:  They were there under subpoena.  They


knew that they were going to be testifying in an hour, and


they left without apparently telling the person who had


subpoenaed them, their -- their son's counsel, or anybody


else.  I mean, are those circumstances which would lead


one to believe that it's going to be a cinch to find these

people and bring them back within a reasonable time?


QUESTION:  But you also have to factor in the


fact they were sequestered witnesses not in contact with


any of these people you're discussing. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Correct.  They were in a


separate witness room, and during the time that they


supposedly left, there were trial proceedings that were


going on.  There was -- they were in trial with witnesses


at the point that they -- that the witnesses left.  So,


there wouldn't have been contact.


QUESTION:  Did their sequestering prevent their


leaving a message with the -- with the clerk of the court


or a marshal or someone saying, tell my son we're going


because we had a medical emergency or, you know -- or


because, as the -- as the later story comes out, some


marshal told us to leave? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Well, if you credit the


later story --


QUESTION:  I find that so implausible that they


should just walk out, not leave any word for -- for their


son for whom they were about to testify.  I -- and I don't


think, if I were a trial judge, I would have thought these


witnesses are about to be found within -- within a


reasonable time. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  You have witnesses who

apparently are unsophisticated.  They're not lawyers.


They're not schooled in the law, and if you credit their


story that someone told them their testimony wasn't needed


that day and they could leave --


QUESTION:  Wasn't there a thing too that he's a


minister, the father, and he was scheduled to give a


sermon that night? 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Correct.  He had -- he was a


minister and he had a religious event in Kansas City that


day and the next, which was the reason that was given for


believing that they were still in town.  No one made any


effort to track these witnesses down or to enforce the


subpoena. 


QUESTION:  The defendant was in custody, was he


not, during --


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Correct? 


QUESTION:  So, they didn't have actual contact


with him.  They couldn't have gone in and said, hey, we're


going to lunch. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Correct, correct. 


QUESTION:  There is a --


QUESTION:  But they could have told somebody to


tell him, couldn't they?  And -- and there was no reason


to believe at that time -- this story came up a lot later


after the -- much later than 2 weeks that -- that in fact

it had been some court personnel who told them that they


were no longer needed.  As far as the trial court knew --


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  It actually makes the trial


court's decision that much more arbitrary because at the


moment that the trial court is faced with this question,


you have witnesses who traveled voluntary from California,


who are under subpoena, who actually appeared in the


courthouse, were sitting in a witness room, and had


suddenly disappeared, and no one knew why.


QUESTION:  Why did it take 17 months to bring


out the -- the information that a court official told


these people their testimony wouldn't be needed?  Was it


not needed at all or not needed till tomorrow?  That's


unclear. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Well, with respect to your


question regarding the delay, I think that's just a


function of how the Missouri post-conviction process


unfolded.  He -- you know, he filed a -- a motion for


post-conviction relief later in '94.  Counsel was then


appointed.  Counsel filed an amended petition, and so you


had the passage of time. 


QUESTION:  Did he get in touch with these people


before -- before 2 weeks -- I mean, before the motion for


reconsideration of -- of the denial of -- of continuance


came up?

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  I don't know whether he got

QUESTION:  Well, that's extraordinary.  I mean,


if they were so easy to find, one -- one would have


thought that he would have contacted them within the 2


weeks and they would have told him within those 2 weeks


that a court personnel had told us to leave. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  The record --


QUESTION:  But he doesn't mention that --


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  The record --


QUESTION:  -- 2 weeks later. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  The record is silent on


that.  I -- I can't answer that. 


QUESTION:  I know it is.


QUESTION:  Was the motion for a new trial filed


by the same lawyer who represented him during the trial?


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Yes, it was and in fact, he


was relieved during the sentencing hearing that took


place.


QUESTION:  I know.  He wanted to get out of


there because he wasn't going to get paid even for the


notice of appeal.  It seemed to me he was anxious.


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  And once he had gotten fee for what


had been done, he sort of lost interest in the case.

MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  That is an impression that


the record gives. 


QUESTION:  So, you -- you can't say that he --


he got in touch with these witnesses who would have been


so easy to find within a day.  You can't even say that he


got in touch with them 2 weeks. 


MS. ROBIN-VERGEER:  I don't know.  I don't know.


Getting back -- just to return to the second --


to this Court's cases because I think I was beginning to


get into Osborne.  I think that Osborne supports our


position here because the Court took a functional approach


in Osborne to whether or not there was any -- anything


that would be gained by forcing counsel to repeat


information that was already before the judge, and the


Court said, no, there was no -- there was no default.


Other cases in which this Court has found that


procedural rules were applied with the phrase being


pointless severity or whether there were arid rituals of


meaningless form where technical niceties were not


observed, but nonetheless counsel could substantially


comply with the showings required by the rules, cases like


Douglas v. Alabama where you didn't repeat a futile


objection, cases like Staub v. City of Baxley where


counsel challenged on First Amendment grounds an entire


ordinance and didn't signal out particular -- particular

provisions to -- to attack because it was clear what the


-- what the lawyer was challenging.  Wright v. Georgia and


NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Flowers where the claims weren't


grouped exactly right in the -- in the State court appeal,


but this Court, nonetheless, found that no purpose would


be served by finding a default in those cases.  All of


those suggest -- and -- and also the fact, of course, that


the defendant did not have a reasonable opportunity to


comply with the letter of the rules, but nonetheless


substantially complied with the rules.  All of those


suggest there should be no default, and in the


alternative, even if there was one, that there should be a


finding of cause and prejudice. 


And with the Court's permission, if there are


any more questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of


my time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. Vergeer. 


Mr. Wilson, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL C. WILSON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. WILSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Justice Kennedy -- Kennedy, you are quite right


to be disturbed by counsel's failure to provide the court


any more information or better showing under -- under rule

24.10 in the motion for a new trial that was filed 2 weeks


after the events that the Court has been discussing than


he did. 


But what should trouble this Court much, much


more than that is that 2 months following the last day of


petitioner's trial, his new trial motion was heard, and


the trial court asked counsel whether he had anything else


that he would like to submit in consideration of the


motion for a new trial, and counsel replied no. 


QUESTION:  Why -- why do you think that might


have been?  I mean, why -- why do you think -- I mean, I


was wondering why it wasn't ineffective assistance of


counsel not to put the thing in writing and not to comply


with 10.


MR. WILSON:  First of all, for -- for counsel to


have represented the facts that 24.10 requires, counsel


would have had to believe that they were true.  And one of


the principal purposes --


QUESTION:  He didn't say all that in the opening


statement, did he? 


MR. WILSON:  Excuse me?  I'm --


QUESTION:  I mean, I wonder why is there no


ineffective counsel claim.  Why didn't the Federal court


in this case say, well, look, you're the lawyer in the


State court at the trial, didn't comply with rules 9 and


29

10?  My goodness, that was in effective assistance.  Why


didn't the habeas court say that here? 


MR. WILSON:  The habeas court addressed the


question of whether there was such --


QUESTION:  Why didn't they say what I just said?


MR. WILSON:  And because they -- they said that


claim was never raised to --


QUESTION:  Now -- now, that's exactly right. 


Now I want to know why do you think that -- that


that claim wasn't raised at that hearing, namely, the


after-the-trial hearing, the post-conviction? 


MR. WILSON:  First, how trial counsel conducts


trial motions and post-trial motions is an area in which


he -- there is a broad discretion for the trial counsel.


QUESTION:  Of course, and what I'm really


driving at is, isn't the reason that they didn't raise


rule 9 and rule 10 as showing ineffective assistance at


that post-trial business is because nobody dreamt that the


courts in that State of Missouri would apply rule 9 and


rule 10?  Because up to that point, nobody had even


mentioned them.  They didn't get mentioned until the


appellate court, after this series of events, on its own


raises rule 9 and rule 10.


MR. WILSON:  Justice Breyer, that's correct. 


QUESTION:  That's not --

22

23

24

25

MR. WILSON:  That is not correct. 


First, these are published rules of court that


were in the book long before petitioner's trial, and the


cases applying these rules, in fact, comparable to these


and in others, are -- it's an unbroken string of


precedent.  So, counsel was either aware of those or was


certainly deemed to be aware of those. 


QUESTION:  Well, at least --


MR. WILSON:  And second --


QUESTION:  -- we know that the -- the trial


judge did not deny the continuance on the basis of a


failure to comply with those rules, did he?


MR. WILSON:  He didn't say because I find


that --


QUESTION:  There's nothing in the record to


indicate that the trial judge said, well, I can't grant


that.  You didn't file it in writing.  You didn't supply


this information.  That's not in the record, is it?


MR. WILSON:  No, Your Honor.  He did not cite


that. 


QUESTION:  The trial judge denied it because he


wanted to go to the hospital with his daughter on one day


and he had another trial in another case starting the day


after. 


MR. WILSON:  I don't believe that's correct.

QUESTION:  Isn't that right? 


MR. WILSON:  I don't believe that's correct,


Justice O'Connor.  I don't believe that a fair reading of


the record indicates that that is why he denied the


motion.


QUESTION:  What -- what does it indicate?  I


mean, I --I read it the same way Justice O'Connor did, and


I -- I don't -- what is your reason for --


MR. WILSON:  I -- I think the record clearly


shows that the reason he denied the continuance is


because, as Justice Scalia suggested, he determined, on


the circumstances that had been presented to him, that


these witnesses abandoned the defense. 


QUESTION:  Then why did he get into his


daughter's hospitalization and his Monday schedule? 


MR. WILSON:  The -- the continuance that was


requested was till the following morning, and it was in


that context -- and -- and it is a single sentence


utterance there, that -- that he noted that he was not


going to be in the courthouse --


QUESTION:  Well, why if he -- if he was denying


the motion on the ground that there had not been the


specifications that rule 10 required, why get into his


daughter's medical condition? 


MR. WILSON:  The trial judge could have been

responding to the idea that even though you've not made a


sufficient showing, I'm not going to cut a break for this


because --


QUESTION:  Yes, I assume -- I assume there are a


number of factors that go into the judge's decision.  One


is that -- the -- the court's own schedule.  The other is


the reason these people have gone.  He says it looks like


your -- you folks -- I think he said you folks have been


abandoned by these witnesses.  And so, he gives a number


of reasons, all of which are exactly what he has to do


under 24.10 even though he doesn't cite 24.10.


MR. WILSON:  He found that an insufficient


showing had been made, and there are other factors that he


would have been considering. 


First, counsel had committed to this trial


schedule. 


Second, defense counsel had announced himself


ready to proceed and had put on part of his case. 


Third --


QUESTION:  The witnesses were there, we're told. 


They -- they, in fact, were there and subpoenas had


issued.  They were there.  And it is, I think, somewhat


unusual that in the strange circumstances of their


disappearance, that there wouldn't be some small amount of


time given to find out what had happened.

MR. WILSON:  Except that the circumstances that


were presented to the trial court, Justice O'Connor, I


believe supported his conclusion that they had left --


QUESTION:  May I just interrupt?  Isn't it


correct that the witnesses were sequestered, and the one


person who would know where they were would be a court


employee who had -- in charge of the sequestered


witnesses? 


MR. WILSON:  There was a court employee in


contact with them and also trial counsel was in contact


with them and the defendant.


QUESTION:  No.  Trial counsel was in court.


MR. WILSON:  But trial counsel went and checked


on them at 10 o'clock when the State rested its case.  He


was back one subsequent time I believe the record shows. 


But at least he says in the new trial motion -- he says


with clarity and particularity that he went there at 11


o'clock and they were gone.  So, from the time he knew


that they were gone, 2 hours elapsed before they were back


in front of the trial court. 


And it is important to note that the -- the


colloquy that occurs.


QUESTION:  Well, they might have gone down to


get an apple out of the vending machine.  I mean, the


counsel has got a lot to do.  He's got his closing -- his

opening statement for the defense.  He's got his


witnesses.  He goes down.  They're not in the room.  I


don't -- I don't attribute much to that. 


MR. WILSON:  But if these are the witnesses that


stand between this young man and life in prison without


parole, it is absolutely to be presumed that trial counsel


did what trial counsel would do in that circumstance and


say, you are under subpoena.  You don't leave this


courtroom unless I tell you -- you don't leave the


courthouse unless I tell you it is okay.  Our case is now


beginning.  It will proceed --


QUESTION:  Why would he have any reason to think


that witnesses who had come on their -- by their own


expense all the way from California and who were in the


courtroom that very morning -- they were there at 8:30, as


I understand, and at 10 o'clock they're still there.  Why


would he have any reason to think they would leave? 


MR. WILSON:  Justice Ginsburg, he may not have


believed that they would leave or -- or suspected they


might leave, but these are the sorts of instructions that


trial counsel give their witnesses whether or not they


think that that might happen because the circumstances can


be very dire if they do leave. 


QUESTION:  Well, if -- if we're -- if we're


going to make an argument based on what trial counsel

could be expected to do, why isn't it equally fair to make


an argument about what trial judges could be expected to


do? 


And I would have supposed that if the trial


judge was denying that motion based on rule 9 or rule 10


grounds, he would have said I'm denying your motion


because you haven't conformed with rule 9 to put it in


writing, if that was the case, or rule 10, to specify what


you're supposed to specify.  And he didn't do that.  And I


am also supposing that if he had done anything like that,


counsel would have said, gosh, judge, please give me a


piece of paper and let me write this out.


So, why -- why isn't it a -- a fair inference,


when the judge says nothing about these rules, that the


judge in fact is not relying on those rules in any way?


MR. WILSON:  First, the judge did ask, following


the discussion about what had happened, whether counsel


intended to file a motion for a continuance.  It seems


clear in that that he expected or at least had reason to


believe that counsel would be providing a writing. 


Second, this trial judge was a very well-


respected court of appeals judge in the State of Missouri,


and in fact he sat on the panel that decided State v.


Settle, which is cited in our brief, which was a case that


determined that a showing -- where the 24.10 showing was

not made, either by affidavit, but also by substance, that

affirmed on that basis alone. 


QUESTION:  Even -- even where it wasn't -- the


denial wasn't based on that basis. 


Are any of the other Missouri cases involve a


situation where the trial judge did not rely on 9 or 10,


but nonetheless, his action was affirmed on the basis of


-- of failure to comply with 9 or 10? 


MR. WILSON:  I don't know any of the dozens of


Missouri cases that are cited in the briefs that applied


the rule that a failure to comply with those rules will


foreclose appellate review where they cited that the 


trial judge had made a specific finding 24.09 has been or


24.10 has been violated.  Instead, that's the -- the


review that the appellate court undertook. 


Second --


QUESTION:  The question was --


QUESTION:  -- on that -- I -- I mean, they have


a lot of cases.  You know, and in their reply brief they


have -- the other side has some that seem pretty much on


point against you.  But there's no case that I can find


directly on point.  Direct.


MR. WILSON:  Justice Breyer --


QUESTION:  So -- so, if that -- maybe you can

suggest one, but I'll go back and read it.  But the -- the


rule -- the standard I thought might be useful is the


standard in respect to that, that did the lawyer have fair


notice that the rule exists and applies in the


circumstances. 


Now, maybe since -- and it was written in an


amicus brief that favors your side -- maybe you approve of


that standard.  And I'd like to know, A, do you or not?


And if you do approve of that standard, but I come to the


conclusion here that that trial judge did not have fair


notice that the Missouri rules would apply in these


circumstances where he was suddenly surprised by the loss


of witnesses and nobody in the courtroom said a word about


9 or 10.  And nobody said anything about 9 ever, and the


appellate court went and applied it for the first time on


its own. 


That's a big question, but it has two parts, and


I'd like an answer.  The standard and the application of


it. 


MR. WILSON:  The standard that you gave me,


Justice Breyer, I don't believe differs materially from


the standard in Ford v. Georgia which is firmly


established and regularly applied.  It's important to note


that regularly applied does not mean precisely applied to


these exact circumstances in a published case prior to the

defendant's trial, but rather regularly -- regularly


enforced. 


And so, I believe that the standard you


articulate is a good one, and this rule meets it because,


A, it's published, and B, there were an -- an unbroken


string of precedents both before defendant's trial and


since that time, and not one of them excuses a default


under 24.09 or 24.10, reaches the merits of a request for


a continuance, and finds that the denial was error. 


QUESTION:  The reason the -- the three aspects


of it that suggest maybe this lawyer did not have fair


notice that the rule would apply in the circumstances are,


first, the lawyer was surprised by his loss of witnesses.


So, he didn't have time to prepare anything in writing in


advance. 


Second, he's in the courtroom talking to the


judge and he knows full well that everyone in that


courtroom knows every single thing about what rule 9 and


rule 10 require.  There was no missing fact.  The judge


knew it.  The prosecuting attorney knew it, and he knew


it. 


And third, there is no Missouri case that says


that we're going to require a useless act in the


circumstance where the lawyer has suddenly been surprised


by his loss of witnesses and everything is going on orally

in front of the judge anyway. 


Now, those are the three that I think cut


against you, and so I'd like your reply. 


MR. WILSON:  Surprise, Justice Breyer, was not


present.  He went to the witness room at 11 o'clock in the


morning before the lunch break, substantially before the


lunch break, and discovered that they had left.  From 11


o'clock then until just after 1 o'clock is the amount of


time he had to conduct his investigation as to where they


had gone, but also to prepare a writing. 


But leave aside the writing requirement, which


may or may not have operated with any purpose in this


situation -- I believe that it did.  But more importantly,


he did not gather the information and present it all at


once to the judge that 24.10 requires. 


Second --


QUESTION:  Could you just tell me on that, what


could he have told the judge that he knew that he didn't


tell the judge?


MR. WILSON:  He did not tell the judge that


these witnesses could be located in a reasonable amount of


time and that they would give the testimony that it has


been suggested they would give. 


QUESTION:  Well, he -- the judge knew what


testimony they were going to give.  You don't question

that, do you, that there --


MR. WILSON:  I -- I do question that, Justice


Stevens. 


QUESTION:  Didn't -- didn't the lawyer announce


it in his opening statement to the jury?  Isn't that one


reason it was so -- so prejudicial that they didn't show


up?


MR. WILSON:  The -- the -- a lawyer's statements


and opening statement are not evidence and they're not


evidentiary. 


QUESTION:  But the judge heard the statement. 


MR. WILSON:  He did hear the statement, but


what's --


QUESTION:  He knew what the witnesses were


intended to testify to, didn't he? 


MR. WILSON:  But 24.10 requires more than that,


Justice Stevens. 


QUESTION:  Well, he did know that much, don't


you agree? 


MR. WILSON:  I do, but -- but it requires


someone to attach their credibility to the proposition


that they will actually give that testimony. 


QUESTION:  And, of course, I suppose the lawyer


knew what the family would testify to before they heard


the strengths of the prosecution's case, which was that

there were four witnesses that put him in -- in the city.


QUESTION:  I don't suppose a lot of judges


concentrate intently on opening statements the way they do


perhaps motions that they have to decide or something like


that.  If -- if some -- in the rare instance where


opposing counsel objects to an opening statement, the


judge -- but certainly he doesn't pay attention to that


the way he would to lots of other things in the case. 


MR. WILSON:  Your Honor, that might be true as a


general proposition, but we don't need to rely on a


general proposition in this case because this judge told


these lawyers in this lawsuit the following.  Quote:  I


don't have a lot of faith in what's said in opening


statements anyway.  That's the trial --


QUESTION:  Are you going to tell me right now --


we both read this record.  And are you going to tell me


that in your opinion, the judge did not know that these


witnesses were here to say that the defendant was in


California at the time?


MR. WILSON:  The judge knew that he did not have


anybody in that courtroom who was willing to stand up and


say on my credibility, that's what these witnesses --


QUESTION:  He did not know that he had the


lawyer's assurance of that.  He did not know that he had


the lawyer's assurance of that.

MR. WILSON:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  But he did --


QUESTION:  Actually I asked the question that


I'd like an answer to.  The question that I asked you was


whether you're prepared to say right now that the judge


did not know that the purpose of these witnesses was to


testify that the defendant was in California at the time. 


I didn't ask you the question that Justice Scalia asked. 


I asked you my question.  I'd like to know the answer to


my question. 


MR. WILSON:  I believe that the -- that the


judge knew what had been said -- what had been attributed


to them in the opening statement.  I -- that is not the


test that 24.10 requires.  That's not the --


QUESTION:  That's a different -- well, if you're


-- you're willing to say, which I think is fair and I


think correct, that on the basis of this record, the judge


knew that the point of these witnesses was to testify that


the defendant was in California at the time. 


MR. WILSON:  At the most --

that right?

MR. WILSON:  Yes.  At the most what he knew was


counsel expected that to be their testimony the day of --


QUESTION:  Well, he knew something more than


that, didn't he?  He knew that counsel, who was an officer


of the court and need not be sworn in making


representations in that courtroom, had represented as a


matter of fact to the judge and to the jury that that's


what the witnesses would testify.


MR. WILSON:  No, I don't believe that that's


correct.  I don't believe that that's what you can say his


statement and opening statement means.  I think that it


means that standing there -- at -- at the most, what you


could say is, standing there in front of the jury -- and


he's addressing the jury and not the judge -- that his


best expectation of the best the evidence will be out of


the witnesses' mouths is as he stated it.  I don't --


QUESTION:  What -- I presume what he stated was


not if things go as well for me as possible, these people


will say as follows.  I presume what he said is, I have


these three witnesses.  He described their relationship,


their location, et cetera.  And they will testify that the


defendant was in California at the time.  I presume that's


what he represented in open court.  Isn't that correct?


MR. WILSON:  That is what he told the jury.


QUESTION:  -- because we have the transcript

that shows exactly that.  He told the jury these are the


three witnesses.  They will testify that he was in


California.  He described the witnesses and he said, they


will testify. 


MR. WILSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  He didn't say, the best thing that


you might infer from what they testify.


MR. WILSON:  But counsel's statements to the


jury in opening statement are not held to the level of a


representation of an officer of the court to the judge --


QUESTION:  But the judge was fully apprised that


the defendant was expecting to put on witnesses and that


they were alibi witnesses.  There's no doubt about that,


is there? 


MR. WILSON:  The judge knew facts -- knew those


facts from the opening statement only. 


But 24.10 requires someone to attach their


credibility to those propositions when they are asserted


as the basis for an interruption in the orderly conduct of


a criminal trial. 


QUESTION:  Is it your experience that witnesses


ever have second thoughts about giving their story after


they've heard the strength of the prosecution's case?


MR. WILSON:  That -- Your Honor, I believe that


that does happen.  And I believe especially it can happen

in a case such as this one where the defense counsel did

he might have because instead of the --


QUESTION:  But were these witnesses in the


courtroom to hear that testimony?  I thought they had been


sequestered. 


MR. WILSON:  They had been sequestered.  That's


correct. 


QUESTION:  So how would they know?  How would


they know the strength of the government's case if they


hadn't been there to hear it? 


MR. WILSON:  I don't know that they did know,


but I know that they visited frequently with the defendant


and with defendant's counsel.  I don't know that they did


know. 


And -- and it isn't for us 9 years later --


QUESTION:  They did later file affidavits


substantiating what the -- was said in the opening


statement, didn't they? 


MR. WILSON:  Excuse me? 


QUESTION:  They did later file affidavits


consistent with what the counsel had said in his opening


statement. 


MR. WILSON:  Yes, 4 years later they did, 4


years --

QUESTION:  What about the third part which is --


I -- I take it as well that you would agree that the judge


heard that this -- the missing witness is a minister who's


there for a religious event that's taking place that


evening.  All right. 


So, we know that 9 and 10 were not literally


complied with.  Now, but they might have been


substantially complied with.  And so, at this point, when


everybody knows in the room what's going on, was the


lawyer fairly apprised that what we had to do was perform


what he might have thought of as a useless act? 


And the case that's the strongest for your yes


answer, he had to go through the form even though the


substance was right there in the case of the surprise


witnesses -- your strongest case or two under Missouri law


is?


MR. WILSON:  Missouri v. Cuckovich and other


cases cited in the -- in the dissent in the Eighth Circuit


where he quite candidly categorizes and admits that


Missouri rules of 24.09 and 24.10 applied prior to trial,


at the outset of trial, and during trial.  They apply --


they apply --


QUESTION:  Well, you don't want us to decide


this case on the fact that he didn't make an affidavit, do


you?  I mean, that's so easy.  The judge puts him under

oath or gives him 2 minutes to write something out. 


You're not resting on that, are you? 


MR. WILSON:  Your Honor, I am not --


QUESTION:  -- 24.10 I would --I would think.


MR. WILSON:  I'm not going to stand on the


formality, and we didn't stand in the court of appeals on


a formality of a writing or even the formality of an


affidavit. 


But there was no one in the courtroom at the


time this issue was being decided who was willing to


attach their credibility to these assertions, who was


willing to say to the judge, if you stop this trial, I


believe there is a reasonable probability that I can


produce these witnesses and that they will give this


defendant an alibi, that they will say on the date and


time of this murder, he was not within 1,000 miles.


QUESTION:  So, if I read through the transcript


and I came to the conclusion that everyone in that


courtroom in that very short trial, in the circumstances


given what was said, would have very clear that this


lawyer does mean to tell the judge, one, these are my own


witnesses that make a difference.  Two, they're alibi


witnesses.  Three, they're going to say he's in


California.  Four, I don't know why they left.  Five, give


me a couple of hours or at least till tomorrow morning.

He's giving a sermon downtown and I'd like to try to find


him.  Now, if I come to the conclusion that any one


reasonable person in that courtroom would have thought


that was -- the lawyer was saying that in the


circumstances, I could hold against you.  Is that right? 


If I think that the circumstances were such in the


courtroom that anyone would have -- any reasonable person


would have come to the conclusion that this was in effect


what the lawyer was telling the judge.


MR. WILSON:  In effect, what the lawyer was


telling the judge by reference, implied or otherwise, to


the entire body of trial is not what 24.09 or 24.10


require.  They require that that showing be made in the


application for the continuance. 


Now, if we say that an oral application is fine,


okay, but you still have to present the facts and you have


to present them in a way that makes them believable


because what's being asked for is a serious imposition on


the trial court and its conduct of this criminal trial.


QUESTION:  Mr. Wilson, at the time of the new


trial motion, the transcript was available to the judge of


the proceedings? 


MR. WILSON:  I don't know, Justice Ginsburg. 


The new trial motion was filed 2 weeks after trial, but


the new trial motion was heard 2 months after trial.

QUESTION:  My concern with your position is you


suggest twice in your brief that counsel ought to have


scribbled out this 24.09 notice.  He could have had a


legal pad and scribbled it out.  That seems inconsistent


with your answer that you're not seeking to the form.


Here is -- is a man on trial for a very serious


offense.  The lawyer is faced with the absence of the only


witnesses he has.  He's got to do his best.  Should he be


thinking about scribbling anything on a piece of paper? 


Should he be -- have all of his attention trained on how


can he do the best for his client under these extremely


horrible circumstances? 


MR. WILSON:  Justice Ginsburg, that argument in


the brief is -- is not made to show what a reasonable


lawyer would do or what every lawyer could do, but rather


to show that it was neither impossible nor impractical --


impracticable to comply with the rule. 


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I -- 29.09.  I was


surprised to see the Missouri Court of Appeals interpret


it to apply to things like a motion for a continuance


arising during trial because it -- well, it's very


difficult, I would think, for a lawyer, suddenly faced


with an emergency like this, to -- you know, you obviously


-- you can't go back to your office and dictate a motion,


and to simply write out something in longhand when perhaps

he can simply make the statement orally. 


MR. WILSON:  It may be surprising that -- that


the court of appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court have


done that, but they have done it.  And that is the


Missouri law and -- and it has been so for some time.  And


the mere fact --


QUESTION:  We don't know -- we don't know that


-- that the idea of you have to scribble something in the


court has been around for some time because, as you said,


there's no case that presents precisely that situation


where the motion is in the -- in the heat trial something


unexpected happens.  You have no precedent that says, even


so, under the Missouri rules you must sit there in your


seat at counsel table and scribble out a motion.


MR. WILSON:  Well, the -- no.  The -- the


precise circumstances of this petitioner's case have not


arisen in a published case in Missouri.  That's correct.


But there is -- it was clear that in the midst


trial and even in some exigency, the courts of appeals and


the Missouri Supreme Court had held 24.09 and 24.10 to


require a writing and a sufficient showing in the past. 


And -- so, if this counsel -- as soon as this colloquy was


concluded and the motion had been denied, they turned


immediately to the -- to the petitioner's counsel's motion


for judgment of acquittal at the close of all of the

evidence.  He made that motion orally, but because he knew


that in order to preserve his right to appeal any of the


points therein, he asked the judge, and the judge gave him


permission, to file the writing later. 


The same is true with this rule.  Because


anybody who had read the cases applying 24.09 and 24.10


would know that you are forfeiting your right to appellate


review of a denial if you have not put the sufficient


showing before the judge and done so in writing. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Wilson, I thought you weren't


going to rely very much on the -- on the not written part,


but let's talk about the other part, that all of these --


even if all of these factors of substance that had to be


in the motion were somewhere in the trial transcript and


even if you could say that this trial judge knew it, you


couldn't say, could you, that the court of appeals knew


it, that the court of appeals could look back to this


motion without searching the entire transcript and asking


itself, I wonder what, under this transcript, the trial


judge knew?  The -- the court of appeals in Missouri could


not look at the motion and say, well, he set forth what he


had to say -- set forth.  That -- that's clear, isn't it?


MR. WILSON:  Yes, that is clear.

constrained to review the entire trial record, which it is

one of the purposes of -- of .10 to avoid.


MR. WILSON:  Yes, it is.  24.10 -- one of the --


QUESTION:  It is not purposeless, even if you


assume that the trial judge knew that -- that in fact the


lawyer was -- was making the affidavit that he -- that he


had to make.


MR. WILSON:  Yes.  The purpose would be to


provide a meaningful appellate review by bounding the


relevant facts in a credible fashion and presenting them


not just to the trial judge, but also to the court of


appeals. 


QUESTION:  But, of course, I suppose the court


of appeals is entitled to rely upon the trial judge's


reasons when it reviews the adequacy of those reasons for


granting the motion.  So, if the trial judge's reasons do


not look -- do not reasonably refer to rule 10, then I


suppose on anybody's theory, the court of appeals wouldn't


have to search the record.  Isn't that so? 


MR. WILSON:  No, I don't believe so because the


-- the very purpose of the appellate rule is that they


will not do exactly that.  If 24.09 and 24.10 were not


complied with, then it doesn't really matter.


QUESTION:  No.  All I'm -- all I'm saying is


that I thought what the -- the State court of appeals


would review would be the -- the reasons given by the

trial judge for ruling as he did.  Isn't that correct?


MR. WILSON:  No, I don't believe so.  I believe


-- I believe that what is appealed from is the decision


and not the reasons for the decision.


QUESTION:  Mr. Wilson, in -- in answer to


Justice Scalia's question about hunting through the whole


record, wouldn't counsel, notified about the 24.10


requirement, say, judges, you don't have to read through


the whole record?  I'm putting it all in front of you, the


exact words.  It will maybe be two or three pages, but not


a whole record.  Shouldn't the attorney be able to, in


this very case, in a matter of a few pages say where --


where it was in the transcript? 


MR. WILSON:  Except that compliance with 24.10


doesn't -- doesn't require you to be able to trace it


through the record, but rather that you presented it all


at once to the trial judge and that you did so with some


credible reason to believe that what was being asserted


was so.


Your Honors, 2 -- 2 months after this -- after


the denial of the continuance occurred, they appeared


before this very same trial judge to hear the motion for a


new trial.  No explanation was given to that judge.  No


better or further showing was provided.  Even the simplest


fact like the -- like that they were available and able to

testify the very next day in Kansas City was not offered


to this trial judge.  There was no due process claim


before this trial judge either at trial or on the motion


for new trial, and he had no facts to believe that he had


done anything other than what was fundamentally fair under


that circumstance on the circumstances as they had been


presented to him in the context of the motion for a


continuance.


Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Wilson. 


Ms. Vergeer, you have 3 minutes remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BONNIE I. ROBIN-VERGEER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. VERGEER:  Just a few quick points.  With


respect to the proffer and somebody being willing to put


their credibility on the line, the defendant actually took


the stand during the -- the colloquy on the continuance. 


He was sworn, which actually you would think is a superior


form of proof to an affidavit, and there he was subject to


cross-examination by the prosecutor, if there had been any


questions.  She didn't have any other than to clarify that


the witnesses had been under subpoena, which they had


been.  And -- and so, I -- I think that the -- that whole


like of inquiry about whether somebody is willing to sort


of swear to facts in support of the motion sort of falls

by the wayside because he was on the stand.


In addition, in terms of what -- what all the


players in the sea knew about -- about these witnesses,


there's a rule.  It's rule 25.05 of the Missouri rules


that requires a notice of an alibi to be given. 


Apparently one was given because the prosecutor came


prepared in her opening statement to address briefly the


fact that there was an alibi defense that she expected to


be presented. 


And in addition, the detectives interviewed


these witnesses while they were in Kansas City and took


statements from them, and if there was any question later,


as the record developed further in Federal court, about


whether these witnesses really would have said what --


what they said they were going to say, the State had


whatever notes or statements that was taken from the


interviews that were done with these witnesses. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Robin-Vergeer, was any due


process argument ever raised at the motion for a new trial


level?


MS. VERGEER:  At the motion for a new trial, the


defendant argued the denial of the brief continuance and


the denial of the arrest warrant to enforce the subpoenas


-- argued that that denied the defendant a fair trial. 


Due Process Clause was specifically mentioned in the post-

conviction motion and on appeal in the Missouri Court of


Appeals.


QUESTION:  Well, in the post-conviction


proceeding, as I recall, what was raised was ineffective


assistance of counsel primarily.


MS. VERGEER:  Actually, it -- it was both.  In


the amended post-conviction motion and -- and the relevant


passage is on page 56 of the joint appendix and it


continues through page 58 -- the defendant specifically


argued that movant was denied his rights to due process of


law and to the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed


by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments when -- and then it


sort of recites, and it -- and it goes along and says --


and talks about, A, the fact that someone told the


witnesses to leave and, B, that the trial court overruled


the -- the defense motion for a continuance.  So -- so,


the Due Process Clause is -- is explicitly stated there


and -- and thereafter.


If there are no further questions. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms.


Vergeer.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
