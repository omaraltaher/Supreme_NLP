 (10:14 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This morning we will 
first hear argument in Case 08-305, Forest Grove School 
District v. T.A.

 Mr. Feinerman.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The 1997 amendments to IDEA prohibit tuition 

reimbursement awards for students who are unilaterally 
placed in private school without first having received 
special education services from the public school 
district.

 This is so under ordinary principles of 
statutory construction and particularly so under the 
Spending Clause clear notice rule.

 Prior to 1997, IDEA did not expressly 

address tuition reimbursement for unilaterally placed 
students.  In 1997, Congress added section 
1412(a)(10)(C).  In subsection (i), Congress provided 
that when the school district makes a free appropriate 
public education available, a FAPE, no reimbursement is 
allowed.  And then in subsections (ii) through (iv),

Congress addressed situations where courts and hearing 
officers may award tuition reimbursement and said that 
reimbursement may be allowed where the school district 
does not make a FAPE available to a student who 
previously received special education services from the 
public district.  Congress said nothing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Feinerman, but the --

the first provision that you read, sub (i), says that 
there will be no reimbursement if the agency has made a 
free appropriate public education available to the child 
and the parents elected to place the child in private 
school.  But that "if" -- if the agency made a free 
appropriate public education -- and here, as I 
understand it, the school district said that this child 
was ineligible for special education.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if the child was 
entitled to a free appropriate public education and 
didn't get it, then under this sub (i), wouldn't the 
parents be entitled to tuition reimbursement?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  No.  Subsection (i) covers 

students who are provided a free appropriate public 
education.  Subsections (ii) through (iv) address the 
other category of students --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that's your --

MR. FEINERMAN:  -- those who are not --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's your construction. 

But couldn't this be read to say no reimbursement if --
the word is "if" -- the agency, not -- so the 
implication is if the agency did not make a free 
appropriate public education available, then --

MR. FEINERMAN:  That -- that might be the 

implication if there weren't subsection (C)(ii) through 
(C)(iv).  So it's -- it's T.A.'s argument and the 
government's argument that (C)(i) sets forth the general 
rule, but if that were the way that -- that Congress 
meant the statute to operate, it wouldn't have had any 
reason to put in (C)(ii) through (C)(iv) because we 
would already know from (C)(i) that tuition 
reimbursement was a possibility for students who did not 
receive -- previously receive special education services 
from the public district.

 Congress instead went on in (C)(ii) through 
(C)(iv) to address very specifically, in the context of 
a comprehensive statutory scheme, when tuition 
reimbursement would be available to students who did not 
previously receive.  And Congress specified, after 
essentially being invited to do so in Burlington, which 
of those students could get tuition reimbursement.  And

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, (ii) through 
(iv) don't -- don't limit or contradict any explicit 
requirement of (i).

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Oh, no.  It --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  (i) is only at most a 

negative implication, which -- which one would not draw 
in light of (ii) through (iv), is what you're saying.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Yes, that's exactly what I'm 

saying.  And -- and they deal with different sets of 
students.  In (i), the school district has made a FAPE 
available; in (ii) through (iv), the school district has 
not made a FAPE available.  And no mention is made of 
when a FAPE is not made available to a student who had 
not previously received.

 And under this Court's decision in 

Arlington, because those students like T.A. who had not 
previously received, are not mentioned, yet Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then -- then what happens 

in a case which I think is like this one, where the 
child doesn't receive special education because the 
school has determined that the child is not eligible? 
So the child isn't getting public education, and in the 
parents' view, confirmed by experts, the child is in 
need of special education, can't get it from the public 
schools, because they declared the child ineligible.

What is such a parent to do?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  If -- if it's an incorrect 

determination by the school district, the problem is 
remedied rather quickly.  There are very tight time 
frames in IDEA --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, the parents here 
didn't -- didn't run off to a private school only after 
the school district had found that their child didn't 
require any special education, did they?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They -- they put him in a 

private school without even consulting the schools.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Right.  And then only after 

the fact went to the school district and asked for --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Saying by the way, we can 

get some money.  How much -- how much money are you 
talking about imposing on the school district here?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Well, it's -- the tuition is 

$5,200 a month.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  A month?
 MR. FEINERMAN:  Yes, and then there's a 

$5,200 alumni services fee, a $1,500 interview fee.  But 
let's --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Feinerman, can we go 

back to the time frame again?  I've just got a question

of fact.  I should know this, but I don't.  You said 
that if the -- if the parents and the school district 
disagree, it can be remedied fairly quickly because 
there's a fairly tight schedule set for the 
administrative procedure.  What I don't remember, and my 
question is this:  When the administrative steps have 
been exhausted, if there is still disagreement, is there 
any limit on the time in which the -- the judicial 
appeal has to be resolved?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  No, there isn't.  So --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't that the -- isn't 
that the kicker here?  In other words, I -- I fully 
understand your -- your textual argument.  I -- I can 
see its soundness as a possibility that is open to us 
and, perhaps on the face of it, the most likely 
possibility, but there is a cost, and the cost, it seems 
to me, is that once you get into the -- once you get 
into appeals, this thing can go on for years, and you 
can't wait years when -- when a kid is in this kind of 
condition.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct, but there's 

no need to wait years.  Let's assume that parents 
actually went through the process appropriately, unlike 
T.A.'s parents --

what the process is --

MR. FEINERMAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- because Justice Scalia 

said the parents just went away.  The school at an 
earlier point said this child was ineligible for special 
education, isn't that so?  I think --

MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct.  That was in 

2001, and the district judge, at --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.
 MR. FEINERMAN:  -- at page 39 of the 

petition to the -- of the appendix to the petition, page 
39 note 3, the district judge noted that the 2001 
evaluation is an appropriate part of this case.  But for 
this -- for the parents who try and get their student --
get their student evaluated, the school district says, 
"No.  The child is ineligible"; and then the parents --
at that point, the timing kicks in.  The parents can ask 
for a due process hearing the next day.  Under the time 
periods that were in place when T.A.'s case was going 
through --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that hearing --
MR. FEINERMAN:  -- the hearing officer --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that hearing on 

eligible or not, or is it on what the IEP should be?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Well, it's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When the school said not 

eligible, is there -- is that question resolved first 
before we ever get to the IEP?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I think, in a situation 

where the school district finds the child ineligible and 
there is an appeal, both the eligibility and the 
appropriate placement are decided in front of the 
hearing officer.  And there was a 45-day time period at 
the time T.A.'s case went through for the hearing 
officer to make a decision.  And then after that, it's 
--

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, wouldn't the school 
say, we -- we have no obligation to get up an IEP until 
the question of eligibility is determined?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I suppose if the school 
district were to get a stay of the hearing officer's 
decision pending appeal to the district court.  But 
that's not what happened here.  What happened here is 
that the hearing officer decided on June -- January 26, 
2004, that T.A. was eligible.  On February 19th, quicker 
than the 30 days allowed, Forest Grove School District 
proposed an IEP that could have started as soon as 
possible thereafter, as the regulations require.

 So you are talking about a very tight -- I 

understand the situation that you are hypothesizing,

Justice Ginsburg, but we are talking about a very tight 
turnaround in T.A.'s case, 75 days, which is a matter of 
weeks, not a matter of years as was the case in 
Burlington.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  What happens when we get to 

court?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Excuse me?
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  What happens when we get to 
court?  Isn't that when it turns into a matter of years?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  It turns into a matter of 
years, but in the interim this school district, Forest 
Grove School District, while it was litigating in the 
district court, Forest Grove School District offered an 
IEP, and at that point T.A.'s parents could have tried 
the IEP out, sent the child to receive services in the 
public school district --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The IEP -- they did the 

IEP after the hearing officer was finished?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Yes.  Less than 4 weeks 
after the hearing officer was finished, Forest Grove 
offered an IEP, and that's in the addendum to our reply 
brief.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  But I think we've 
got to assume that Congress has some concern for the 
parents who correctly say, this IEP is no good, it just

can't be done in the school system, and the kid needs a 
special school.  In that case, maybe -- your answer may 
be that's the exceptional case and it shouldn't drive 
the -- the inferences to be drawn about congressional 
intent.  But in that case, if the district and the 
parents are at good faith loggerheads it can go on for a 
long, long time, can't it?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  It can go on for a long, 

long time if the parents file for a due process hearing, 
and that it can --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but they get the due 

process hearing.  The ultimate result is that the school 
proposes an IEP; the parents, based on what their 
experts tell them, say that isn't going to work, and the 
parents say the only way we can educate this kid without 
his falling behind more is to put him in a private 
school.  At that point, with assuming good faith here, 
it seems to me you get into court and it can go on for a 
long time, if we accept your -- your analysis of the 
text.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  But all the parents have to 
do in that situation is to give the IEP a try and send 
their child to public school.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but doesn't that get 
to the point of something pretty formalistic?  I mean,

somebody in the brief said, given one day under the IEP 
and the -- if you win, ultimately the check can be 
written.  That can't be right.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I don't think one day could 
be right.  The statute says -- it -- it expressly says 
"who previously received special" -- "special education 
service under the authority of a public agency."  It 
doesn't say how long it has to be.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe -- I'm sorry.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I remember, perhaps 

incorrectly, from the prior argument here that the 
period that they had to try out the school plan was ten 
days?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  That -- that's a 

discretionary factor that courts and hearing officers 
can -- it's not a hard and fast rule.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not a hard and fast 

rule.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  But I think it's probably 

good as a general benchmark.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is that -- is 
that a period that your client's prepared to accept?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Yes, so long as -- in the 

ordinary case, ten days would -- it's in the statute, so 
we have that textual indication.  And it will provide

the school district a chance to provide services under 
the IEP.

 And as this Court mentioned in a prior case, 
IEP's -- it's not an exact science and when you look at 
it on a piece of paper it's hard to know whether it's 
going to work or not.  The way you find out whether it 
works is where the rubber hits the road and it could be 
that the parents look at IEP and say, you know what, I 
don't think this is going to work.  But until you 
actually give it a chance to work -- maybe the child 
goes in and -- and works with the special education 
teacher or the instructional assistant and they really 
hit it off.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that's 

realistic?  If the parents are convinced going in that 
this is an inappropriate IEP and they send the child to 
school for ten days under the IEP, at the end of the ten 
days they are going to say, oh, well, we've completely 
changed our mind, now we think this is a good plan?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  It's certainly plausible 
under certain circumstances.  It -- it may not happen 
every time.  And it may not happen half the time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't it also plausible 

that the district will say, ten days is not a fair trial 
for this system, this is a child with severe learning

disabilities and to give this IEP a fair chance we need 
ten months?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  At that point those 

arguments can be made under (C)(iii) and (C)(iv) because 
at that point the child would no -- the parents would no 
longer be categorically barred from seeking tuition 
reimbursement and those are arguments that you can make 
to the hearing officer.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you are basically 
saying that the -- that the only necessary delay in 
order to satisfy a condition for eligibility, if the 
parents otherwise prevail, is a ten-day delay.  That's 
basically your answer?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I -- I don't think I'm 

saying that.  I'm saying --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This school does not have 
to come up with an IEP.  It could tough it out and say, 
we're going to rest on our belief that this child does 
not need any special education, right?  And unless the 
school proposes an IEP, the parent cannot come within 
subsection (2) by sending the kid to get the special 
services.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I think that assumes that 
the school district is not going to abide by the order

of the independent hearing officer.  And in this -- in 
our case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What about before?  The 
whole point is that under the words of the statute as 
you interpret it, there is a condition predicate that 
has to be satisfied.  So, to say that -- to answer by 
saying, well, that assumes they won't obey the hearing 
officer, what about before the hearing even takes place?
 MR. FEINERMAN:  Right.  Before the hearing 

takes place, there is 45 days, and then well, the 
hearing -- there's a request for a due process hearing, 
the hearing officer has 45 days, and then if the hearing 
officer says this child is eligible, district, you must 
propose an IEP, the district has 30 days after that.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what happens in the 

case where --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could the district appeal? 
That's the end of the road?  Can't the district say the 
hearing officer is wrong?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Absolutely, the district can 

appeal.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if it does, does it 

have to take any action in the interim.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I suppose it, yes, unless it 

gets a stay of the hearing officer's ruling.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is --
MR. FEINERMAN:  But that didn't happen here 
and I am not aware of any cases which it did happen.  In 
this case there are two tracks.  The hearing officer 
said:  T.A. is eligible; prepare an IEP.  The district 
said:  I disagree; I'm going to appeal to the district 
court.

 But in t mean time, within less than 28 

days, t district prepared an IEP and offered it to T.A. 
And at that point T.A. could have accepted the services, 
thus rendering him eligible for tuition reimbursement.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I still don't understand 

your answer to Justice Scalia.  What if the school board 
just was adamant that he is not entitled to any special 
education?  It just maintained that position throughout 
the litigation?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I think the assumption is 
that the school district would not abide by a lawful 
order of a hearing officer.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, they got a stay and 
they wanted to appeal it.  And if they did what happens?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  In that situation there 

would be no -- and I'm not aware of that situation ever 
happening --

could take that position and they would never be 
liable -- never be liable.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  There would be a delay in 

that situation, but I'm not aware of any case where that 
situation -- where a school district.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But that's the consequence 
of your position as I understand it, that they could do 
that and they would not have any risk of liability.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I think that's a 

hypothetical risk, because again I haven't seen any 
situations where that actually has occurred.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but it's not that 

hypothetical when -- there are two prongs.  Number one, 
the school has to agree first with the diagnosis, which 
in this case they didn't even do that.  They had a good 
faith disagreement.  Second, they have to have an 
adequate IEP.  So there are two conditions.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  That's true, and I think --
I think the answer to the question -- it's really, this 
is really a legislative question.  Perhaps Congress 
ought to further amend the statute to say in those 
situations where a school district is being obstreperous 
in refusing to comply with the hearing officer's order, 
in those situations there is going to be an exception to

the exception.  But it's not -- it's not the statute 
that Congress wrote.  Congress wrote --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Doesn't your 

interpretation of the statute create an incentive for 
the school board to just say, we'll never provide any 
kind of education, special education, we will just tough 
it out?  Because they can't lose, they can't be liable 
if they do that, if I understand you correctly.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I -- I suppose 

hypothetically it does, but my understanding is that 
that just doesn't happen.  In Schaffer v. Weast and 
other cases, the assumption --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would you be surprised to 
find a court decision which says that when the reason 
that the plaintiff cannot comply with the requirement 
that he first be in a plan, when the reason is -- is the 
district's refusal to abide by an order to prepare a 
plan, that subsection (2) does not apply?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Your --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can't profit by your 

own malfeasance.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct.  And I -- I 

don't think there could be reimbursement under 
subsection (ii).  Perhaps if there were a parallel 
Rehabilitation Act claim under 504, that might be a

vehicle to get relief in a situation where the school 
district is acting as horribly as being hypothesized, 
but not under --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you -- you don't think 

-- you don't think a court could say the only reason 
these people could not comply with (ii) is that the 
school district made it impossible by not complying with 
the order to provide an IEP; and, therefore, they --
they can recover for the private placement?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  It's conceivable that --
that a court could hold that.  A court could also --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it's more than 
conceivable.  I know a lot of courts that would hold 
that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But your position is that 
there are basically two situations:  One, the situation 
in which there is an administrative order to do an IEP 
and the school district says, no, we won't do it. 
Millions for defense; we are going right into appeal, 
and we are not going to prepare the IEP.  In that 
situation, as I understand it, you are saying, the 
parents have no way of getting relief under the statute.
 In the case in which there is an order for 
the IEP and the school district prepares the IEP, even 
though the parents think it will be inadequate, there in

fact is a ready remedy subject to two delays:  One, the 
time to prepare the IEP; and, two, ten days to give it a 
try before the parents take the kid out of school. 
That's basically the scheme that you are proposing that 
the statute provides; is -- is that correct?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  That's the scheme that 
Congress wrote in the statute, yes, under -- under 
(C)(ii).  And it has to work that way, because -- I want 
to come back to a -- to a point that was aired in the 
briefs, which is T.A.'s argument and the government's 
argument rests upon the notion that section 
1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) gives hearing officers the authority 
to award tuition reimbursement.  That provision doesn't 
give hearing officers any authority to do anything, let 
alone to award tuition reimbursement.

 The only provision in IDEA that gives 

hearing officers the authority to award tuition 
reimbursement is 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  So if the statute 
doesn't work -- the statute doesn't work, and the 
Secretary's interpretation of 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) is 
implausible because it accords to hearing officers the 
authority that it doesn't have.

 There is another textual clue why the 

statute works in the way that I am suggesting, and that 
is in the '97 amendments in subsections (iii) and (iv)

Congress gave very explicit guidance to courts and 
hearing officers as to the factors the court and hearing 
officer should consider when deciding whether to award 
tuition reimbursement to a student who previously 
received special education services.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the problem that 

the government and the parents have is they have to give 
some work to (ii).  Under -- under their view (ii) 
doesn't seem to do much work.

 And the problem with your position is that 

it seems in a way formalistic and in some cases to 
encourage intransigence.  If we adopted a presumption 
that the school district's diagnosis was correct and a 
presumption that it's -- if -- if there was a diagnosis 
of disability, that its individual education program was 
adequate, that would, it seems to me, not be all you 
wanted, but would ameliorate the position of the school 
district.  Would we have authority, do you think, to 
adopt such a presumption?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I think the -- the Court 
already has adopted that presumption in Schaffer v. 
Weast.  School districts are presumed to be acting in 
good faith.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, this -- this would 
be a clear and convincing evidence presumption that the

-- that the IEP is -- that the school district designs 
is right, that its diagnosis is right.  That's not all 
you -- that's not all you would be asking for.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But would we have 
authority to do that if we were to reject your 
interpretation of the statute?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I suppose you would have the 

authority to do that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How have -- how have 

hearing officers been proceeding?  I mean, here we had a 
case that went to a hearing officer.  There is no IEP 
when the hearing officer begins the process.  In the --
on the eligibility or not, do hearing officers give 
deference to the school district and then -- so that's 
eligibility.  At the IEP stage, do they give deference 
to the student?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  There is some deference 

given to -- are you talking about the deference that the 
district court gives to the hearing officer?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No, the hearing officer. 

The hearing officer is the first-level decisionmaker. 
And the school board gives its reasons why it thinks the 
child is ineligible; the parent, the reasons that the 
child is eligible.  That's the threshold determination.

On that threshold determination of 

eligibility, do hearing officers presume in favor of the 
school district?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Not -- not in this case.  In 
this case under Oregon law at the time -- and this was a 
pre-Schaffer decision -- the hearing officer put the 
burden of proof on the school --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel --
MR. FEINERMAN:  -- on the question of 

eligibility.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- why isn't it the 

case that the school's diagnosis is a related service 
under the statutory provision?  It seems to me to be 
very important service to the parents to know what the 
school's diagnosis is.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I -- I think that the 
diagnosis is more in terms of eligibility.  It's 
under -- under (b)(6), the hearing officer can decide --
can consider issues of identification, eligibility, and 
placement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I'm talking 
about what the parents received.  And they receive a 
diagnosis, and the statute covers -- asks whether they 
previously received special education and related 
services.  Diagnosis would seem to me to be a service

related to special education.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  I -- I don't think that's 

the way it works.  A diagnosis -- a finding of 
eligibility or not is not a diagnosis.  It is just an 
eligibility finding, and that's something that the 
parents can take to a -- a due process hearing under 
1415(f).

 If there are no further questions, I will 

reserve the remainder of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. SALMONS:  That you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The school district in this case improperly 

denied T.A., a child with a disability who had always 
been enrolled in public schools, access to all public 
special education services.  It asserts that because its 
wrong eligibility determinations prevented T.A. from 
receiving special education services, it is immune from 
reimbursing T.A.'s parents the cost of obtaining those 
services from another source.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is wrong with 

ten days?  I mean it's -- it's a big expense you are

asking the school district to incur, that will take away 
funds from other programs.  And all -- all they are 
saying is give it a try for ten days, and if it doesn't 
work out, then you can go?

 MR. SALMONS:  I think there are several 

problems with that reading of the statute, Your Honor. 
First of all, the ten-day period that is referenced in 
subsection (C)(iii) refers to the amount of notice that 
a district needs to receive before a child is removed 
from the public school system.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, yes, the first 

day -- the first day they say, look, we don't think this 
is going to work out, so we are notifying you what we 
are going to do.  And they say, well, you've got to do 
that in ten days, and they said, okay, ten days.

 MR. SALMONS:  But that's -- that's simply 
not the way these things work as a general matter, and 
let me just point out a few things about the normal 
process of developing IEP's.  And, again, here the child 
never even got that far.  But, typically, IEP's are 
developed at the end of the -- of a school year for the 
following year.  And the parents at that point have a 
period of time in which to decide to go along with that 
plan or to give notice and then make alternative 
arrangements.

And it's simply the -- I mean -- and that's 
the way it works, because it's important for parents to 
be able to get their child in an alternative program if 
they decide that's what they want to do.  And if you 
wait until the school year has already started, those 
may not be available.  And the ten-day notice 
requirement --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I suppose 
that's right, but once the law is clarified, schools 
that specialize in -- in treating these kids would be 
able -- they would understand as well, and they would 
understand you've got to -- the people who are going to 
be sending -- most of the people who will be sending 
their children to the school have to wait ten days.  And 
it seems to me that the actual practice on the ground 
would work out pretty easily.

 MR. SALMONS:  But, again, Your Honor, if you 

focus on the terms of the statute, the -- even under 
Petitioner's reading, the requirement would be to have 
previously received special education services, not to 
have tried out a particular plan.

 It may be the case that the plan for the 

upcoming year is -- is very different than the plan for 
the prior year.  Perhaps they have had another 
assessment, and they had substantially changed --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, which way does 

that cut?  It seems to me that cuts the other way.

 MR. SALMONS:  Well, I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Here's a -- here's a 

new plan.  We've worked on it.  Here it is.  At least 
give it ten days -- two school week tries.

 MR. SALMONS:  I think the way that cuts, 

Your Honor, is -- is that that reading of what you are 
positing, I guess, in this exchange what Congress might 
have had in mind, is not what they said in the statute. 
They did not require parents to try out a particular 
plan; just that at some point in time they had 
previously received special education services.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  With respect, 

counsel, what Congress provided is that the child must 
have previously received special education and related 
services.

 MR. SALMONS:  That's right.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I think they did 

provide that you've got to try it out at least for a 
minimal period.

 MR. SALMONS:  But not the particular plan 

that is the subject of the IEP, Your Honor.  That --
that connection does not exist in the statute.  And --
and we think it's counter to what Congress intended.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So what type 
of special education services do you think do count as 
having been previously received?

 MR. SALMONS:  Well -- well, if I -- if I 

may, the way we read this provision, and it's set forth 
on pages 3 and 4 on the addendum to the blue brief, and 
we think it's important that we read this as a whole and 
in context, is that subsection (C)(i) provides the 
general rule to govern the payment of private school 
tuition based on a unilateral placement by the parents. 
And subsection (C)(i) creates the only expressed 
limitation on the right to reimbursement, and it does so 
only in instances where the school district has provided 
a free and appropriate public education.

 We think subsection (C)(ii), (C)(iii), and 

(C)(iv) work together to govern the subset of cases that 
is Congress was most concerned about and that, in fact, 
are the most common scenario in which these disputes 
have arised.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except that you are reading 

(C)(i) to say something that it doesn't say.  It just 
says you don't have to pay if the agency has made a free 
appropriate public education available.

 MR. SALMONS:  That is what --

must pay whenever it hasn't made, and it just doesn't 
say that.  It -- it's a safe harbor for the school 
district.  It says, so long as you've made an 
appropriate public education available, you can't be 
liable for any -- any private school tuition.

 Now, you want to expand that to say, and 

whenever that condition doesn't exist, you are liable. 
But it really doesn't say that.  And -- and the later 
sections suggest that it meant not to say that.

 MR. SALMONS:  Well, that's where we part 
company, Your Honor, because, in fact, that negative 
inference that you refer to is precisely what 
Petitioners attempt to read into subsection (C)(ii). 
There is nothing in subsection (C)(ii) that provides any 
restriction on the ability to obtain reimbursement.  It 
was written in permissive language.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In reading -- in 
reading it that way, you are reading the phrase "who 
previously received special education services" to mean 
also who previously did not receive special education 
services.

 MR. SALMONS:  No, Your Honor.  We are simply 

not reading that language "who previously received" to 
be a condition precedent.

matter whether they previously received or not.

 MR. SALMONS:  It does matter, Your Honor, 

because the provisions that follow in (C)(iii) and 
(C)(iv) that guide the exercise of discretion, in that 
category of cases that were of concern to Congress, only 
apply to the cases that are defined in subsection 
(C)(ii).  So in our reading the language "who previously 
received" still serves an important purpose, but it 
serves an identifying purpose for the limiting factors 
provided in (C)(iii) and (C)(iv).  It does not serve --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you are saying 

Congress went to the trouble of spelling out this 
elaborate provision in (C)(iii) and (ii) and all the 
other things, but that was not the universe of the 
situations in which there could be reimbursement?  They 
went to that trouble, but then -- at the end you want to 
say or some other provisions or some other 
circumstances?

 MR. SALMONS:  Well, that's right.  We think 
that Congress was focused on a particular set of cases 
where problems had arisen, and that's where you already 
had a child in the process of receiving special 
education and you had parents who removed the child out 
of that process without giving adequate notice, and 
thereby short -- excuse me -- short-circuiting an

ongoing collaborative relationship that Congress wanted 
to preserve.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but if -- if you avoid 

that collaborative relationship entirely and just run 
off to a prior -- to a private school right away, you 
get reimbursement.  Why?

 MR. SALMONS:  Well you don't automatically 

get reimbursement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why would Congress -- huh?
 MR. SALMONS:  You don't -- you don't 

automatically get reimbursement, Your Honor.  There is 
just no categorical bar to seeking reimbursement.  You 
still have to show it's an appropriate remedy, which 
always has been understood to require a showing that the 
parents acted reasonably and in good faith, and that 
they were sincere in their efforts to obtain services 
from the school.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What about more than that?
 MR. SALMONS:  The alternative --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not -- I mean,

which may not be relevant -- I would appreciate the

if they have a disability, this program pays them 
something, right.

 MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not following this.  I 

don't know what section.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It's at the very beginning,

Court that the obligation on the State is to ensure that 
children, all children with disabilities, regardless of 
whether they are in public or private school, have the 
opportunity for a free appropriate public education.

 With respect to children in private school 

who are not seeking a free appropriate public school 
education from the public school district, the only 
requirement under the Act is that you seek them out, you 
find them, you identify them, and that you report that 
to the Department of Education, and that you get money 
for those children.  And for those children who are not 
enrolled in public school, you have to use a percentage

words --

disabled child who never thinks about the public school

then work, what is -- would this system work under the 
statute?  You say, parents, if you are going to a 
disabled child, you simply go to a private school, you 
get the services you just mentioned.

 Now, if you put in -- put the child in a 

public school, and they find a free appropriate public 
education, fine, that's the end of that, you have to do 
it.  Now, if they don't give you a decent one, you can, 
you can send the child to a private school, but it 
has -- you have to give it a shot to the public school 
system.

 Now, that's what you don't want the 

interpretation to be?  You don't -- you are against 
that.  But -- but let's amend it a little.

 MR. SALMONS:  That's not -- I would not 

describe it that way, Your Honor, if I -- I don't mean 
to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I am reading the language. 
You may require the district to pay for someone who has 
been enrolled in special services --

MR. SALMONS:  I mean, again, just keep in 

mind the facts of this case.  This is a child who was in 
the public school system --

amendment.

Go ahead.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  My amendment is the norm 
will be give the public school a shot, but there could 
be circumstances, you're getting the run-around, there 
is need to put that child in a public school now.  In 
other words, special equitable circumstances that make 
it reasonable for the parent not to give the school a 
shot, though that's the norm.  And in those unusual 
circumstances, there would remain grounds for equitable 
relief.

 What about that as an overall interpretation 

of the statute which has several parts to it?

 MR. SALMONS:  I would submit that the way we 

read the statute, Your Honor, in fact, does precisely 
that.  Because, the school district -- just again, take 
this --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But you have to be willing 
to accept that it's an unusual situation, though it may 
well exist, that the judge is going to reimburse the 
parent where that parent didn't give the public school a 
shot.  They will have to show there is a good reason for 
not doing that.

MR. SALMONS:  The -- the difficulty I 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that all right with you 

have --

or not?

 MR. SALMONS:  Well, the difficulty I have 

with your question, Your Honor, is that the school 
district always has a shot under the Act.  In this case, 
the school district assessed the child in 2001 and again 
in 2003, and both times it erroneously concluded 
that the child --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you are simply saying 

that it was reasonable for the parent here.  I'm not 
asking that question.

 MR. SALMONS:  No, not just that it's 

reasonable, but in the process of assessing the child, 
in developing an individual education plan that is 
appropriate for that child, that is precisely the shot 
that the statute gives the public school system to get 
it right.  What the statute does --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Salmons, I thought 
that the -- the courts, the district court, will not 
provide for tuition reimbursement, unless at least two 
things are shown.  One is that the school district did 
not provide an adequate education for this child.  And 
two, that the private school did, and then there are

equitable considerations.

 MR. SALMONS:  That is absolutely correct.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you must find both, 
not just that the private school was a good place, but 
that the school district did not offer an adequate 
education for the child.

 MR. SALMONS:  That is -- that is correct. 

That is what this Court held in Carter.  That's what the 
regulations say.  I would note that there is nothing in 
the text of the statute and the provisions that 
Petitioner relies on, (C)(ii) for example, that makes it 
a statutory requirement to show that the private 
placement is reasonable as a -- as a condition precedent 
to obtain tuition reimbursement.  But both sides concede 
that that's required, even though it's not in the 
statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But procedurally we -- we 
know that there is a provision addressed to a court for 
equitable relief.  The question was put before:  Where 
does the hearing officer get the authority to order 
tuition reimbursement?  Because the statute on which you 
rely for the court speaks only to the court's authority.
 MR. SALMONS:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I am 

happy to answer that question.  But Petitioner makes 
this a centerpiece of their reply brief and I think they

just misread the statute.  And again, keep in mind that 
these amendments in 1997 were written against a backdrop 
of this longstanding statute and this Court's 
interpretations of it.  The most direct place where the 
statute provides hearing officers the authority to hear 
address reimbursement claims and to award 
reimbursement -- and this is on page 9 of the addendum 
in the blue brief -- is 1415(b)(6).  This has always 
been in the statute and it states that the parents must 
be provided an opportunity to present complaints with 
respect to "any matter relating to the identification, 
evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or 
the provision of a free appropriate public education to 
such child."

 That is -- again, that has always been 

understood to include the right to seek reimbursement 
before the hearing officer.  And this Court in 
Burlington cited legislative history from the 1975 Act 
that noted that hearing officers could award 
reimbursement and address such claims in concluding that 
it was part of the appropriate relief that courts ought 
to be able to have under 1415.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are any of these other 

procedures -- I took these to be procedures that have to 
be provided by the school district, not -- not by the

hearing officer.

 MR. SALMONS:  These are -- these are 

required -- this whole section, Your Honor, 1412, is 
entitled "State Eligibility," and these are all 
requirements that States have to provide for process in 
order to obtain funds under the Act, and so it is a 
requirement that States provide hearing officers that 
have the ability to award reimbursement --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it doesn't say hearing 

officers.  "An opportunity to present complaints with 
respect to any matter relating to the identification" --

MR. SALMONS:  Those complaints --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to present the complaint 

to the principal.

 MR. SALMONS:  No, Your Honor.  This is a 
reference to the due process complaint notice that is 
referenced elsewhere in the statute.  I believe 
Petitioner would agree with me that that's what this 
references.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but the reference is to 
a right to be heard on certain subjects.  It doesn't say 
anything about authorizing a particular individual or 
officer within a school system to award relief.  The 
problem is, it says you can be heard.  It doesn't say 
who will tell you or who will tell the school district

to write a check.

 MR. SALMONS:  Right.  But keep in mind that 
the judicial review process that the statute provides --
and this is at page 17 of the addendum.  The right to 
file a Federal action is limited to those matters that 
are raised in the due process complaint notice filed 
before the hearing officer.  This is an exhaustion 
requirement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But can you raise the --

you can raise the claim to eligibility to a -- a private 
education here without the hearing officer having the 
authority to order the school district to provide it.

 MR. SALMONS:  That has not been the 

interpretation of this Act, Your Honor, and I would 
refer the Court to 34 CFR 300.148(b), which is a 
regulation that states that hearing officers can award 
reimbursement and that has been around since the mid-
1980s.  My point is that is -- the Congress enacted 
these amendments in 1997 against a subtle understanding 
of how this Act works.  And it's always been understood 
that hearing officers can award reimbursement.  There 
was no need to provide in the '97 amendments that 
hearing officers can also award relief.

 And again because it's an -- it's an 

exhaustion requirement and the judicial review provision

only relates to the things that you have raised before 
the hearing officer, it makes no sense to say a court 
can award reimbursement but you can't get reimbursement 
from the hearing officer.  That's the subject of the 
review of the Federal court action.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but it might make 

senses to say that the hearing officer can determine 
eligibility; it is then up to the school to pay it; and 
if the school does not pay it, then you have got to go 
into court and get an award.

 MR. SALMONS:  In fact, Your Honor, the 

hearing officers have always been permitted to award 
reimbursement, as occurred in this case, and then the 
school district can decide either to pay that or to seek 
review if they -- if they so choose.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it might make also 

sense to say that if the hearing officer has no 
authority to award a certain type of relief, neither 
does a court, under that general provision that --

MR. SALMONS:  But of course this Court in 

Burlington held the court did have that authority and it 
relied on the fact that it has always been understood 
that hearing officers have that authority in reaching 
that conclusion in Burlington.

with these new provisions, if the hearing officer 
doesn't have the authority to award the kind of relief 
that was awarded here, then the court wouldn't either.
 MR. SALMONS:  Well, I -- with respect, I 

think there is nothing in the '97 amendments --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you agree they go, as 

we say, in pari passu --

MR. SALMONS:  Well, I do think that it 

doesn't make sense to say --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that -- that whatever 

the hearing officer can do, the court can do.
 MR. SALMONS:  I think generally --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and whatever he can't 

do, the court can't do.

 MR. SALMONS:  I think they ought to be read 
together, yes, Your Honor.  But I think they ought to be 
read to provide for the authority to provide tuition 
reimbursement.

 One statutory point I would like to make, 
Your Honor, is that under Petitioner's reading of the 
Act, if you read (C)(ii) to be -- that reference to "who 
previously received" to be an absolute precondition, 
then I think it's the case that (C)(i) has no meaning 
whatsoever.  It does not work under the Act at all. 
Whereas on our reading of the statute, (C)(ii) still

does work.  It's not a precondition; it doesn't do the 
work that Petitioner suggests; it does a more limited --
serve a more limited function, but it still serves that 
identifying role for the factors Congress wanted applied 
when it was focused on how to preserve relationships, 
ongoing collaborative relationships through the IEP 
process that warrant preservation.

 One other point I make, Your Honor, and 

Justice Scalia, you make reference to this principle of 
equity, that you ought not be allowed to prevent 
something from happening and then come into court and 
claim, "Ha, ha, they didn't satisfy a condition."  And 
that was a point that was made by Justice Cardozo in the 
R.H. Stearns case that we rely on, where he said he who 
prevents a thing from being done may not avail himself 
of the nonperformance which he himself has occasioned.
 That's precisely what happened here.  As 
this case to this Court, it is established that is a 
child who was entitled to receive special education 
services back in 2001.  The only reason he did not 
receive those services is because the district violated 
its statutory duties --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought in 2001 even 
the parents agreed that he didn't -- that they didn't 
want to put him in special education?

MR. SALMONS:  The parents agreed, Your 

Honor, that he did not qualify for the learning 
disabilities they tested him for, but they had an 
obligation under the Act -- and this was found by the 
hearing officer and the complaint that was filed was 
filed within the two-year limitation to challenge that 
2001 determination, and that that was there, they had an 
obligation to test him for those other health 
impairments at that time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Had Petitioner provided T.A. a special 

education that was later determined to be inadequate, 
there would be no question that the district court would 
have authority and discretion to determine whether an 
award of private school tuition reimbursement was 
appropriate.  Petitioner's view is that because it 
offered no special education at all, it was therefore 

45

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

categorically immune from such an award.  That position 
is not supported by the statute and it's inconsistent 
with the reasonable interpretation of the Secretary of 
Education.

 There is no basis for reading the statute to 

create what effectively would be an incentive for 
districts to stonewall and to say that if they don't --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, for 10 days, 

right?  Even assuming the bad faith that you are 
ascribing to the school district, it would only work for 
10 days, right?

 MR. MILLER:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then they would 
have -- then they would have previously received special 
education services, and they could proceed.

 MR. MILLER:  We were not assuming bad faith. 

Or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  "Stonewall" sounds 

to me like bad faith.

 MR. MILLER:  Well there --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That was the word 

you used.

 MR. MILLER:  I -- Congress -- there is no 

reason to suppose that Congress wanted to create an 
incentive or to reward districts that do do that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we are talking about 

two different things.  I think the Chief was talking 
about putting the child in special education, and 
keeping the child there for 10 days.  You are talking 
about the school district that says "no special 
education; this child is not eligible."

 MR. MILLER:  That's absolutely right.  So in 

a case like this, there is -- there is nothing to try 
for 10 days because the district has found him not 
eligible, they haven't offered any special education or 
related services.  Now to the extent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's move to 

the situation where they have a plan that the parents 
regard as inadequate.

 MR. MILLER:  In the case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In that situation 
all they would have to do is to have the child try the 
plan for 10 days.

 MR. MILLER:  Well if the -- to the extent 

that there is an interest in having parents try out the 
plan, Petitioner's reading of the statute is poorly 
tailored to that objective, because it doesn't require 
that they try the specific plan that's being proposed 
for 10 days.

 Even under Petitioner's reading the statute

simply would require that the child at some point have 
received some special education and related services. 
It wouldn't have to be under the plan that was being 
tried.  And --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the odds are that it 

would be under the plan.  I mean, what you say is 
theoretically possible, but in the real world it's 
probably going to be under the plan, isn't it?

 MR. MILLER:  Well, not necessarily because 

there's a new plan at least once a year under the 
statute, and they are typically proposed at the end of a 
school year for the start of the new school year.  So 
there wouldn't be, on Petitioner's reading, a 
requirement that you show up for the first 10 days of 
the new year; you would just have to give notice after 
the IEP is proposed in May or June.  You give your 10 
days' notice.  You receive special education services 
under the old plan, under the previous year.  And under 
-- on Petitioner's reading, the statute would be no 
barrier to reimbursement there.

 Now, of course, the district courts do have 

considerable equitable discretion, and we're not 
suggesting that reimbursement would be mandatory in that 
case or in any case.  And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the parents -- I

think you agree that the parents would have the burden 
of showing both that the school did not provide an 
adequate education, an appropriate education, and that 
the private school does?

 MR. MILLER:  That's -- that's absolutely 

right.  And they would also, in our view, have to show 
the district court that they had genuinely cooperated 
with the public school in making their child available 
for evaluation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose we thought it were 
sensible to add to that burden the further rule that the 
school district is presumed to have made the correct 
diagnosis and, if there is a plan in that kind of case, 
that the plan was adequate, and that the parent would 
have to show by clear and convincing evidence that this 
is not so, rather than just inventing it and pulling it 
out of the sky.

 Is -- is there some authority in the statute 

that would give us warrant to do that?  Or is there 
some -- any cases that would give us warrant to -- to 
establish a presumption of that kind in order to 
recognize the long-standing expertise of the States in 
this matter and in order to allow section (ii) to do 
some work?

evidence presumption would be difficult to reconcile, I 
think, with 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), which says that the 
district court decision should be based on the 
preponderance of the evidence, but it is certainly 
within the district court's discretion and it would be 
within this Court's discretion, I think, to prescribe 
principles to guide the exercise of the district courts' 
equitable discretion --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The district court 

doesn't get into the act until the hearing officer is 
done.

 MR. MILLER:  Right.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so it would be odd to 

have a presumption applicable in court that isn't also 
applicable to the hearing officer, because the court is 
reviewing a decision by the hearing officer.

 MR. MILLER:  Right.  Well, the -- the 
standard in both stages of the proceeding is by a 
preponderance of the evidence, and the parents, as the 
party challenging what the school has done, have the 
burden.  But at both stages, it would be appropriate to 
consider whether they were genuinely seeking a free 
appropriate public education, and I think it would be 
entirely appropriate and consistent with the 
preponderance standard for the hearing officer or the

court to take due account of the fact that the school

to what it has proposed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  (i)(2)(B)(iii) --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is the department --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  (i)(2)(B)(iii)?
 MR. MILLER:  Oh, it's (i)(2)(B) -- it's been

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's now (C)?
 MR. MILLER:  (C).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does the -- does the 
department have a regulation that says the hearing 
officer may order the private school -- the parents to 
be reimbursed for private school tuition?  Because it's 
not in the statute.

 MR. MILLER:  34 C.F.R. 300.148(b) says that 

disagreements between the parents and a public agency 
regarding the availability of a program appropriate for 
the child and the question of financial reimbursement 
are subject to the due process hearing procedures.  So 
yes, that regulation gives hearing officers the 
authority to award reimbursement, as indeed the hearing 
officer had done Burlington.  Burlington was the case

where the reimbursement award was made in the first 
instance by a hearing officer, and, of course, the Court 
held that that was appropriate.  And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, this is 

Spending Clause legislation.  Do you have any rough idea 
of how much of the obligation incurred by the States is 
reimbursed by the Federal Government?  What percentage?

 MR. MILLER:  I think of the additional costs 

of treating special education children, above those of 
educating other children, I think approximately 
10 percent, 10 to 12 percent, is reimbursed by the 
Federal Government.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if this 

interpretation vastly expands the liability of school 
districts in that particular area, isn't that a 
consideration we should consider?  Since they accept --
the States accept 10 percent of the funds to incur these 
obligations and then you are expanding the obligation in 
a way that we may at least find is ambiguous, isn't that 
a pertinent factor?

 MR. MILLER:  There's no basis for supposing 
that there would be a vast expansion of liability, and

who are receiving special education, barely 1 percent of 
those are in private placements, and the vast majority 
of those are agreed-upon placements between school 
districts and the parents.  So this sort of unilateral 
private placement is quite rare, because, first, the 
parents do it at their own financial risk, and so 
there's a real barrier to parents doing it, because they 
have to be pretty sure that they are right and that they 
are going to be able to meet the demanding standards of 
-- satisfying the district court that an award of 
tuition reimbursement is appropriate, and if they don't 
do that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the --
MR. MILLER:  -- they're going to be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the parents are 
entitled and the child is entitled to the special 
education and the school doesn't give it, and there are 
two schools -- private schools in the community, A and 
B.  A charges, what is it, $5,200 a month tuition; the 
other is considerably less.  And they both have adequate 
programs for the child.  Is the hearing examiner 
entitled to reimburse only for the lower amount, or is 
the parent entitled to send the child to the -- to the 
more expensive school?

 MR. MILLER:  No.  What this Court said in

Carter is that it's appropriate for the hearing officer 
to take into account whether the cost of the private 
education was unreasonable.  So in a situation where you 
had two basically equivalent schools, that would 
certainly be an appropriate thing for the hearing 
officer to take into account in limiting or denying 
reimbursement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Or there could be, I 

suppose, an order that any tuition in excess of a 
certain amount would be the parents' responsibility.

 MR. MILLER:  That's -- that's right.  That 
would be within the discretion of the hearing officer.

 In a case like this, where you have a 

residential placement and the residential component of 
it -- there has been no suggestion that that was -- had 
some educational purpose or was a part of providing an 
appropriate education, it would also be appropriate for 
the court to decide to disaggregate that and say we are 
only paying -- the school district only has to pay for 
the educational component.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let me be clear.  Am I 

correct that under -- under the theory of the statute 
that you are supporting, it would be possible for a 
parent, without first consulting with the school at all, 
to put the child in a private school and then later to

request public school services, and when it is -- when 
they are denied or they are inadequate, all that public 
school -- private school tuition would be reimbursable?
 MR. MILLER:  There would be no categorical 

bar in the statute in that situation, but a district 
court confronted with those facts would most likely 
conclude that the parents had not genuinely sought a 
free appropriate public education and hadn't 
appropriately cooperated with the school district.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FEINERMAN:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice.

 I'd like to address the two provisions that 

we have heard today for the first time.  T.A. and the 
government are resting their argument that tuition 
reimbursement is permitted in the unilateral placement 
context to students who had not previous received.  The 
regulation 300.148 -- counsel referenced subsection (b), 
Disagreements about FAPE, and it does say that the 
hearing officer can consider the question of financial

reimbursement.  And the very next subsection, (c), is 
entitled Reimbursement for Private School Placement, and 
that provision speaks only to students who previously 
received special education and related services under 
the authority of a public agency.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where are you reading 

this?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  This isn't -- this 

regulation was brought up at argument.  It's not in any 
of the addendums, but I -- I would direct the Court's 
attention to subsection (c) of 300.148.

 In terms of the -- the provision that T.A.'s 
lawyer addressed, 1415(b)(6), no argument -- there's no 
argument in the briefs that 1415(b)(6) gives hearing 
officers the authority to grant tuition reimbursement in 
these circumstances.  The Department of Education did 
not rely on this provision when articulating its 
commentary that tuition reimbursement is still permitted 
under these circumstances.  The Secretary of Education 
relied upon the 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) provision.  That of 
course, refers only to courts.

 And even if the argument were properly 

presented, which it isn't, it would be subject to the 
same dynamic that's in play with respect to 
1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  You have a very general provision

giving hearing officers authority.  Congress got 
specific in 1997.  There's a heading -- enacted a 
provision under the heading Reimbursement for Private 
School Placement.  I think that clearly indicates that's 
where Congress intended to repose the authority of 
hearing officers to order tuition reimbursement to 
unilaterally placed children.

 We also have the -- and -- and it just 
doesn't work to say that 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) somehow 
gives hearing officers authority.  Even if it were 
interpreted that way prior to 1997, in 1997 Congress 
enacted the statute that expressly referenced hearing 
officers and courts, and allowed both of them to give 
tuition reimbursement.  So even if 1415 were interpreted 
prior to '97 -- incorrectly, we would submit -- to give 
hearing officers that authority, after 1997 where 
Congress actually went to the trouble of saying hearing 
officers and courts can give tuition reimbursement in 
certain circumstances, that -- that prior 
interpretation, whatever its merits back then, no longer 
is valid --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what happens -- what 
happens if the hearing officer can't, but why couldn't 
the court?  I mean, they see an unusual situation.  The 
parents were justified, and it doesn't say there are no

circumstances other than -- where you couldn't -- where 
they may not pay.  So the judge says, I think this is a 
situation where it is -- it is equitable to pay the --
the reimbursement.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct, but --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?  What says you 
can't do that, other than your basic point about the 
"may require"?

 MR. FEINERMAN:  The Spending Clause, the 

headings that Congress used --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But anyway, the 

regs don't say anything about that.

 MR. FEINERMAN:  At any rate -- and it's a 

system that doesn't make any sense, because for children 
who did previously receive and go to the hearing officer 
to challenge either an eligibility determination or an 
improper IEP, the hearing officer could award tuition 
reimbursement, but for children who didn't previously 
receive and then they went in front of the hearing 
officer, they would have to -- I don't know what the 
word would be -- appeal to the district court in order 
to get tuition reimbursement.  Is it conceivable that 
that that could be the system --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You're saying the statute 
says the hearing officer can't do that no matter what.

be the system.
