CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument now on


number 01-6978, Gary Albert Ewing versus California.


Mr. Denvir.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF QUIN DENVIR


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DENVIR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:  In March 2000, Gary Ewing walked into a Los


Angeles pro shop, took three golf clubs, stuck them down the


pants legs, and walked out.  He was quickly apprehended for


that crime.  For that crime --


QUESTION:  What was the value of the golf clubs?


MR. DENVIR:  Because the value of the golf clubs was


approximately $1200, it was grand theft under California law. 

For grand theft, as a general matter, California


provides a maximum sentence of three years.  It also --


because Mr. Ewing had served a prior prison sentence, he would


be subject to a recidivism enhancement of one year, so the


maximum sentence that he would have faced under California


law, but for the so-called "three-strikes law," would have


been four years in prison, which could have been reduced by


one-half by his conduct in prison and his work in prison. 


However, because Mr. Ewing had a prior conviction for first-


degree burglary, which has been classified as a serious felony

by California, and for robbery, which has been classified as a


violent felony by California --


QUESTION:  Was it armed robbery?


MR. DENVIR:  He was armed with a knife at that time.


And because of those two convictions, he came under


the California "three strikes and you're out" law.  And as a


result of that, he received a sentence of life imprisonment


and with a -- with an added bar that he could not even be


considered for parole for 25 years.


QUESTION:  Would it be fair to add that another


reason for the sentence was that the judge did not disregard


the priors, and that was because the judge had the record in


front of him and the record showed other --a history of other


offenses?  Would that be a fair statement?


MR. DENVIR:  It is correct, Your Honor.  It -- the


judge did have discretion to strike the priors or to reduce


this wobbler offense to a misdemeanor.  She declined to do so,


partly on the basis of his prior record.  His prior record


were all misdemeanor convictions prior to that time.  But --


QUESTION:  They were all misdemeanors?


MR. DENVIR:  Yes, Your Honor.  All his -- he had --


the prior convictions that he had were felonies were four


felonies, all occurred within one year, in 19- -- in one


month, in 1993.  There were three first-degree burglary


convictions, and then there was one robbery conviction.  He

had other --


QUESTION:  Well, now, those surely are not


misdemeanors.


MR. DENVIR:  No, Your Honor.  I was -- I thought


Justice Kennedy's question was directed not to the -- what


they call the "strike priors," but to the fact that he did


have other --


QUESTION:  Oh, other than --


MR. DENVIR:  -- previous crimes that were


misdemeanors.


QUESTION:  -- other than the burglaries.


MR. DENVIR:  I think that's -- the sentencing judge


relied on that, to some degree, in denying him any


discretionary --


QUESTION:  Now --


MR. DENVIR:  -- relief.


QUESTION:  -- it actually went back to 1984, didn't


it, with grand theft in '84, grand theft in '88?


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, the grand theft actually


was a misdemeanor, as we've shown in the appendix to our reply


brief.  There was -- there was a misconception that that was a


felony.  And in fact, it was a misdemeanor in Ohio, the


first --


QUESTION:  That was the Ohio offense.


MR. DENVIR:  I --

 QUESTION:  The --


MR. DENVIR:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  -- the one that was alleged to be a


felony, I think, in the government's brief --


MR. DENVIR:  Is in --


QUESTION:  -- I think that it was only a


misdemeanor.


MR. DENVIR:  In fact, we've attached the governing


court records as an appendix to our reply brief that shows it


was a misdemeanor.


QUESTION:  How many -- how many convictions in all,


felonies plus misdemeanors?


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, I believe that he had the


four -- the four prior convictions -- the strike convictions,


the felonies, and I think he had another nine misdemeanors, 

and then this present offense.  I think that's the --


QUESTION:  And the purpose of the three-strikes law,


as I understand it, is to take off of the streets that very


small proportion of people who commit an enormously high


proportion of crimes.  I forget what the statistics are, but


it's something like, you know, of those convicted, 20 percent


commit 85 percent of the crimes.  It sounds to me like your


client is a very good candidate for that law.


MR. DENVIR:  We got -- we got --


QUESTION:  I mean, if that's a reasonable law.  It

seems to me this is precisely the kind of person you want to


get off the streets.  He's obviously going to do it again.


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, we believe that the law, in


itself, is not unreasonable and it could result in a


proportionate sentence.  It did not in this case.


Under this Court's decision in Solem versus Helm,


the Court has said that you can look to the prior record as


relevant to the sentencing decision because it aggravates the


present crime, but the focus must remain on the present crime.


QUESTION:  Well, Solem stands with Rummel and with


Harmelin.  They're really three different points, and Solem is


probably the case that favors you most.  But certainly Rummel


is good law, and Harmelin is good law.  And I think those


cases don't favor you.


MR. DENVIR: 


Well, Your Honor, I believe that 

Rummel -- the Court said in Solem -- the majority opinion said


that Rummel would be controlling only in a similar factual


situation.  We do not believe we have that here.  And as far


as Harmelin was concerned, the basic principles of Solem were


reaffirmed by seven justices in Harmelin and, we believe, when


applied here, will show that this is a grossly


disproportionate sentence.


QUESTION:  Mr. Denvir, would you clarify whether


your challenge is strictly as applied?  Because some of the --


some of the points that you make seem to be going to the

statute wholesale.  So, for example, you talk about it -- the


statute's infirm, because it has no washout for aging


offenses, but there was no such offense at stake here.  The


strikes were all rather recent.


MR. DENVIR:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


And --


QUESTION:  So --


MR. DENVIR:  -- and to answer your question, we are


challenging only the sentence that Mr. Ewing received for the


crime that he committed, that he was sentenced at.  There's


much discussion on both sides of -- as -- I -- as the


background of the three-strikes law.  We have no doubt the


three-strikes law could result in a -- in a constitutional


sentence.  It did not, in this case.  So however the scheme is


that reached this sentence, this life sentence for stealing 

three golf clubs, that sentence is -- falls under the Eighth


Amendment, in our view.


QUESTION:  But we -- so we should leave out things


like no washout, that someone who never served any time would


subject to the three strikes --


MR. DENVIR:  I think that's correct, Your Honor,


that they don't play into this case.  And I think that -- as I


said, that the three-strikes law is merely -- it's the process


that produced an unconstitutional sentence.  It could have


been produced by a different sentencing scheme, also.

 QUESTION:  Well, when we're examining the


constitutionality of the three-strikes law, as applied to this


sentence, we should take into account, should we not, the


purposes of the California law, which was to have a law which


was -- gave simple, clear notice of the three-strikes policy? 


And if you want us to take case-by-case, then that whole


policy is undercut, it seems to me.


MR. DENVIR:  Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't


think that's true.  In Solem v. Helm, the Court made very


clear that it was looking only to the sentence that was


imposed on Mr. Helm.


QUESTION:  Yeah, I was going to ask you about that,


because you had said that the principal focus has to be on


this sentence.  I'm just not sure what your authority for that


is when we have a recidivist scheme of this kind. 

MR. DENVIR:  Well, Your Honor, the -- in


Solem versus Helm, the Court, of course, had a recidivist


scheme.  The focus there was on number of prior offenses, as


opposed to the nature of the prior offenses.  The Court said


that the defendant, under double-jeopardy principles, cannot


be punished for those prior crimes; however, they are relevant


to the -- to the sentence imposed for the present crime.  And


the -- and the reason they are relative -- and the Court said


this best in Gryger versus Burke -- is what they -- what


they -- what they authorize is a, quote, "stiffened penalty

for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated


offense because of repetitive one."  That's at page 8 in our


reply brief.


But what Solem v. Helm made very clear is, although


the prior crimes are relevant, the focus must remain, when


judging proportionality or gross disproportionality, on what


this -- what this defendant did at this time, what he is being


sentenced for at this time.


QUESTION:  I'm just not sure how that works.  What


am I supposed to do with recidivism as a factor in analyzing


this sentence?


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Give it some weight, but not controlling


weight, or something like that?


MR. DENVIR: 


-- I think that what the Court can say 

is that his prior crimes are relevant, in the sense that they


make this crime a more aggravated crime than a crime committed


by a first offender --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. DENVIR:  -- and that there can be a reasonable


enhancement for that.  But in this case, he has been sentenced


to -- he has -- his sentence has gone from a maximum of three


years for a first offender to life, all based on the


recidivism.


QUESTION:  Well, why --

 MR. DENVIR:  At that point --


QUESTION:  -- why can't the State say that -- where


a person has a string of convictions like this man has, that


it's time to get him off the street, as Justice Scalia says,


that he simply cannot conform to the law?


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, if he, in fact, committed a


crime at this point that was a serious or a violent crime,


they may have a basis, but what the Court has said very


clearly is that --


QUESTION:  What --


MR. DENVIR:  -- is the focus remains on this,


because otherwise --


QUESTION:  What --


MR. DENVIR:  -- he's being punished for the prior


crimes.  I'm sorry, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Well, what's the reason for saying that


though -- that you can only -- that the focus remains on this


crime, but others are relevant?  I mean, that really is kind


of meaningless, it seems to me.


MR. DENVIR:  Well, I don't think so, Your Honor,


because, as I say, what the Court has said over the years is


that the important part about the prior crimes is that it


shows that this is a repeat offense.  And the fact that he has


committed offenses in a row makes this particular offense


worse.  The fact that he has committed worse offenses in the

past does not aggravate this crime.  I -- this is -- this


still remains shoplifting three golf clubs, regardless if he


had been a triple murderer or anything else, and that's what


he's being punished for.  Because if he's being punished


because of those prior crimes, their nature, there's really


serious double jeopardy --


QUESTION:  What do you think would be enough? 


Thirty years?  Would you like 30 years for walking off with


three golf clubs?


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, I -- the -- if you -- if


you look at our --


QUESTION:  I mean, if you're going to look on it as


just stealing three golf clubs, and cast a blind eye to his


long record of criminal activity, I don't know why you can


give him any more than, you know, a couple of years. 

MR. DENVIR:  Well, Your Honor, if you look to our --


to the comparison with other jurisdictions -- and I just don't


think this has been highlighted in our brief -- there are


only -- there are only five jurisdictions that would have


allowed a life sentence.  There's only one additional


jurisdiction, Montana, that would have allowed a term of years


as great as the minimum sentence here, and that's -- Montana


allows -- is five to a hundred years.  And most states allow


for either grand theft or recidivist grand theft --


QUESTION:  But we said --

 MR. DENVIR:  -- ten years at the most.


QUESTION:  -- we said in Rummel, there's always


going to be some state that punishes more harshly than others. 


And certainly it was not intimated that that state, therefore,


would -- it was cruel and unusual.


MR. DENVIR:  No, that's correct, Your Honor.  In


Solem v. Helm, the Court noted that he could -- that Mr. Helm


could have received a comparable sentence in one other state,


and nevertheless held that it fell under the Eighth Amendment.


QUESTION:  Well, just help us one more time.  The


prior history is relevant, but then how relevant?


MR. DENVIR:  Well, Your --


QUESTION:  You say the principal focus has to be on


the three golf clubs, like we're some judges out of Victor


Hugo or something and that's all we have to focus on.  But


this -- there's a -- there's a long recidivism component here,


and that's the whole purpose of the California law that you're


asking us to ignore, it seems to me.


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, and -- what I'm saying


is -- I'm going back to what the Court said in Solem v. Helm


in its analysis, which I think is controlling here.  It


made -- it made the point that the -- the prior convictions --


he cannot be punished for those, but they do aggravate this


present crime that he's being punished for.  And the way they


aggravate it is that -- is that this shows that it's a

repetitive offense.


Now, he can have a reasonable enhancement of the


normal penalty for grand theft based on the repetition aspect


of it, but at some point it becomes unreasonable.  And it


becomes unreasonable if you go from three years to life based


on his prior crimes.  At that --


QUESTION:  Why isn't it reasonable to say if he


commits another felony -- he's committed, you know, three


already and nine other convictions -- "One more felony,"


California tells him, "and you go away for life."  Why isn't


that reasonable?  And this -- and this was a felony.


MR. DENVIR:  Because of the nature of the crime that


he committed, which is stealing three golf clubs, a crime that


is not deemed either serious or violent under California law.


QUESTION: 


But is a felony under California law. 

MR. DENVIR:  It is a felony.  It's actually a


wobbler and could be charged either way.


QUESTION:  Why --


MR. DENVIR:  But in this case, it's a felony.


QUESTION:  Why can't California decide that enough


is enough, that someone with a long string like this simply


deserves to be put away?


MR. DENVIR:  Well, Your Honor, if that were true,


then there would be no limiting principle on recidivist laws


under the Eighth Amendment.  It would -- at that point, you

could say the mere fact that he broke any law -- if he broke a


traffic offense -- a petty offense would show that he couldn't


follow the law and could get a life sentence.


QUESTION:  Oh, I'd be with you there, if it was a


misdemeanor or, you know, some -- but this is a felony under


California law.


MR. DENVIR:  It is a felony, and it's one of the


least grave felonies in California.


QUESTION:  But we have given -- we've said, at


least, here, that we are going to give great latitude to state


legislatures in determining how many years to give, and how to


categorize an offense.


Why don't -- why don't we look to the Harmelin case


for the standards, rather than Solem?  Harmelin came later.


MR. DENVIR: 


Well, Your Honor, I think you do, 

because, as I understand the Harmelin case, if you take the


dissent and the plurality, they both agreed on the basic


principle here, which is that there cannot be gross


disproportion between the offense and the sentence.  And the


reason I go back to Solem versus Helm is that it was a


recidivist case and there was some further information.


I don't -- as I read the Court's opinion, at least


the plurality opinion, in Harmelin, the big change was that


you would -- you would not look automatically to intra­


jurisdictional or inter-jurisdictional comparisons.  You would

first have to find an inference of gross disproportionality


before you'd go to the second -- the other two steps.  That's


what I understood to be the major -- the major refinement of


Solem v. Helm that was in the plurality opinion.


QUESTION:  I'm slightly stuck on this, because I --


I'd like -- there is some relevant information that I can't


get a hold of, and you may have some in your experience, but


it isn't in the brief.


Imagine -- let's take the set of people who have


committed at least two serious crimes or more, maybe 50


serious crimes.  They're very serious criminals.  And they're


warned, "If you do anything again, you've had it."  So think


of that set of people.


Now, I would like to know, in light of that set of


people, now one of the members of that set commits a crime 

equal to stealing $1200 -- whether they steal $1200 or equal


to that; that's a very subjective judgment -- what's the


longest sentence such a person has ever actually served? 


Here, they are going to 25 years, real years.


And the second question I'd like to know is, What is


the least bad crime that such a person ever committed who did


serve 25 real years?


MR. DENVIR:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  I'd like to know both of those things. 


And, obviously, they're find-outable.

 MR. DENVIR:  I -- let me see if I can answer your


question.  As far as under the three-strikes law, there is --


because it sets this absolute minimum of 25 years -- it's a


life sentence, but it adds a kicker to it which says, unlike


other life sentences, you have to wait at least 25 years


before you can even be considered.  So we -- since this law


was passed in 1994, we have no experience with this law.


QUESTION:  Obviously, I don't want 


experience --


MR. DENVIR:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- under this law.  That would be


circular.


MR. DENVIR:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  What I'm looking for is, in the absence


of this law --


MR. DENVIR:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I understand --


QUESTION:  -- in the absence of this law, what is


the longest sentence a person like yours -- and I'm defining


"a person like yours" to be a really bad criminal who now will


commit another crime equal to or the same as stealing $1200. 


And there's loads of records -- I mean, in the California


Adult Authority before this law was passed, et cetera.


And the second question is, what is the least bad


thing such a person who really served 25 years did?


MR. DENVIR:  Your --

 QUESTION:  That -- those are empirical questions,


and you're talking about this being unusual.  I don't know if


it's unusual unless I know what happened to other people.


MR. DENVIR:  Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I --


there's nothing in the record that would answer that, but let


me see if I can answer it in a different way.  But for the


three-strike law, Mr. Ewing, with his record, could receive no


more than four years.  Now, there are other recidivist laws in


California besides the three-strike law.


QUESTION:  Under the California Adult Authority,


which was only the law in California for 70 years, people


could receive very, very, very long sentences.


MR. DENVIR:  They could, Your Honor, and California


is --


QUESTION: 


And -- not this long for this thing, 

but -- but -- but --


MR. DENVIR:  I think that's right.  I think the long


sentence -- the -- California substituted determinate


sentencing law for indeterminate in 1977, and -- but under the


old indeterminate sentencing law, my clear recollection is


that those long, indeterminate sentences were always triggered


by serious or violent felonies, and that is something that --


QUESTION:  No, they -- I've looked it up,


actually --


MR. DENVIR:  No?

 QUESTION:  -- and you're quite right that this is


not as -- you couldn't get this long a sentence, but you could


get a pretty long one for being a third offender and


committing a property crime.


MR. DENVIR:  And --


QUESTION:  But I -- that doesn't tell us how long


the people actually served.


MR. DENVIR:  Well, Your Honor, if you look for the


question of parole in California, which the -- which the State


suggests is -- saves his life sentence, the Court looked at


this in 1995 in the case California Department of Corrections


versus Moralez.  And what the Court said at that time was that


90 percent of all defendants who came up for their first


parole hearing were found unsuitable for parole and that


85 percent were found unsuitable at subsequent hearings.  Now,


that has not improved any, because, as you'll see in the


amicus brief of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, at page


18, as of 2000, the Board of Prison Terms, which is the --


which is the parole authority -- their official records show


that they only recommended parole in 1 percent of the 2000


cases that came before them with a life sentence.


QUESTION:  Mr. Denvir, can't the people of -- this


thing, by the way, was not adopted by the legislature, was it? 


It was adopted by plebiscite, of the people of California --


MR. DENVIR:  By both, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  By both.


MR. DENVIR:  Both by legislature and by --


QUESTION:  By plebiscite.  So the people of


California decided, "We want to be tougher."  Why do we have


to be bound by whatever the more permissive scheme was


earlier?  The people of California knew that scheme, and they


decided, "This is no good.  We still have too much crime. 


We're not punishing people enough, or we're not keeping


them -- keeping them incarcerated long enough."  Why do we


have to be bound by whatever the previous record was?


MR. DENVIR:  Well --


QUESTION:  It seems to me the question before us is,


is it unreasonable to put away somebody who has this record?


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, first of all, as to the


question of initiative versus legislation, it is my 

understanding that the Court, in other areas, has said that


there's no greater deference given to one than the other.


But the other question is, there's no doubt that


some deference has to be paid by this Court to legislative


judgments or initiative judgments in the questions of


punishment and in dealing with recidivists.  The Court has


made that very clear.  But it is that deference that has led


to the Court setting a very forgiving standard.  The Court


said that it would not require, in this area, or as excessive


fines, strict proportionality between the crime being punished

and the sentence.  It has said it was only when there was a


gross disproportion, and that's a very deferential standard. 


That is a standard that allows the legislature to make many


reasonable judgments, but says that --


QUESTION:  So how do you decide --


MR. DENVIR:  -- some judgments are unreasonable.


QUESTION:  -- how much is too much?


MR. DENVIR:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  What's the --


MR. DENVIR:  -- life imprisonment for -- for the


crime of stealing three golf clubs, we believe, is cruel and


unusual punishment.


QUESTION:  It's not life imprisonment.


QUESTION:  But we're just doing --


QUESTION:  It's 25 years.


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  It's 25 years that he'll really serve. 


We know that.  As far as -- what happens after those 25 years


is a matter of parole or a decision by other people.


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, the sentence that he's been


given is life in prison.  He's been consigned to die in prison


unless some administrative agency determines to let him out. 


And as I've just quoted you --


QUESTION:  But I mean, parole, in all the cases


you're citing, is relevant, so you can describe it as you

want.  We both know what the facts are.  The facts are he has


to be in jail for at least 25 years, and then he might be


paroled.


MR. DENVIR:  And he might be, but on -- there is


no -- there is nothing in this record that would suggest he


has a reasonable expectation in that regard.  In fact -- in


fact, what's before the Court would suggest that there is not


a reasonable expectation, particularly if the animus that


drives -- that drove the passage of this law continues for 25


years and they still think, "Well, gee, if they committed


these prior crimes, they ought to be locked up for life,


because they may commit other crimes."


QUESTION:  In the statistics that you were quoting,


though, those were not three-strikes cases.


MR. DENVIR: 


Those are not three-strikes cases. 

QUESTION:  Those are cases where people might have


gotten reduced time for good behavior --


MR. DENVIR:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  -- none of which is -- and one question I


wanted to ask you, in view of the infirmities of Mr. Ewing --


is he still alive?


MR. DENVIR:  He is alive, Your Honor.  He is --


QUESTION:  Counselor --


MR. DENVIR:  -- he's lost -- he's aged and has lost


eyesight in one eye as a result, but he's still alive at this

point --


QUESTION:  How old was he at the time of sentence?


MR. DENVIR:  He was 38 years old.  He's 40 years old


now.  So --


QUESTION:  Counselor --


MR. DENVIR:  -- as a practical matter -- I mean,


this -- 25 years is probably a life sentence for him, unless


there's some major medical development that --


QUESTION:  Mr. Denvir, you conceded a moment ago


that the prior offenses can be considered for purposes of


treating this offense as an aggravated offense, given the


prior record; and yet when you answer -- you've done this more


than once -- when you have answered the question of going to


disproportionality, you have said, "It's 25 to life for


stealing three golf clubs."


I don't think you can have it both ways.  Either


your argument is it's 25 -- the appropriate comparison is --


or the appropriate characterization is "25 to life for three


golf clubs," in which case you, in effect, are telling us,


"Ignore the priors; they don't aggravate," or you've got to


say, "It's 25 to life for stealing three golf clubs when you


have a prior record" -- whatever it was, nine prior offenses,


including four felonies, in this case.  Which is it?  Because


I assume it may well affect the result.


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, I -- if -- I misspoke.

What we say is the focus must be on the present offense.  It


is an aggravated offense.  He is a repeat --


QUESTION:  But when you said that --


MR. DENVIR:  -- a repeat offender.  He is a repeat


offender.  He is someone who committed this offense with a


prior record of nine offenses?"


QUESTION:  Is it inconsistent with your position --


when you say, "The focus must be on this offense," is it


inconsistent with that to say, "This offense -- is stealing


three golf clubs worth $1200 by somebody with a prior record


of nine offenses"?  Is that consistent with putting the focus


on this offense, in the terms that you're using?


MR. DENVIR:  I think it is, in the sense that it


shows that there has -- there has been some -- there has been


a series of repetition. 


But what I'm suggesting to the Court 

is that regardless of the repetition, the fact that it's a


repetitive offense, if the focus remains on what he did now,


the triggering offense, which, under Solem v. Helm, is the


focus, then no matter what he has done in the past, no matter


how much repetition, it is --it is grossly disproportional to


sentence him to a life sentence.  At that point --


QUESTION:  A hundred prior instances of stealing


three golf clubs would not affect the analysis then on your


view?


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, if there -- if there were

a -- if there were a series of crimes of the same nature --


for instance, if there --


QUESTION:  Well, I've just -- I've just given you


one.


MR. DENVIR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  A hundred prior -- three golf clubs every


time, a hundred times -- would that justify the treatment that


he has gotten?


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, I think that that would --


that would show a propensity to steal golf clubs, but, again,


I don't believe --


QUESTION:  I would concede that, but the --


(Laughter.) 


MR. DENVIR:  -- I don't believe --


QUESTION: 


Posit further that his score has not 

improved.


(Laughter.) 


MR. DENVIR:  He shouldn't be penalized for that. 


That may be beyond his control.


QUESTION:  Okay, but if we -- if we've got our crazy


example of a hundred priors exactly like this, and we follow


your verbal criterion at least of focusing on this offense as


aggravated, would this be disproportionate, grossly?


MR. DENVIR:  I believe that life is, because it is


still -- the crime that has to be punished -- I mean, and this

is what the Court said in Solem v. Helm -- this  is --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe we were trying --


MR. DENVIR:  -- you know, in Solem v. Helm --


QUESTION:  -- maybe we were trying to have it both


ways verbally because we were imprecise.  But with respect, I


think that's what you're trying to do.  Because on the one


hand, you concede, yes, it may be regarded as an aggravated


offense in light of the priors, and then in the next breath


you say, "But the focus has got to be on this offense."


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, I -- Your Honor, there's no


doubt that the prior record -- and the Court has said that is


relevant to the punishment for the present crime, and it does


aggravate it.  But there are limits to how aggravated


shoplifting three golf clubs can be, no matter what has


happened before --


QUESTION:  Even with the hundred prior instances?


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, it's still three -- it's


still stealing three golf clubs.  It's not robbery, rape,


murder, or something of that nature.  I mean, it is -- it is


still there.  I mean, the -- to raise your question, what if


someone had a long history of jay-walking and had seven or ten


or a hundred convictions for jay-walking and jay-walked again? 


I think the Court would not say you could get a life sentence


for that just --

 MR. DENVIR:  -- because it's repetitive.


QUESTION:  -- I don't think it would.  And the


reason it wouldn't is -- I assume you would concede -- is that


jay-walking does not hurt other people the way 100 instances


of stealing golf clubs worth $1200 hurts other people.


MR. DENVIR:  It hurts in the sense that it's a


property crime and causes --


QUESTION:  Well, you know, and --


MR. DENVIR:  -- a loss, that's correct.


QUESTION:  -- and may lead to something beyond


property crime.  Isn't grand larceny much more likely to


result in physical confrontation and --


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, I --


QUESTION:  -- physical injury than jay-walking?


MR. DENVIR: 


-- Your -- it is -- it is, Your Honor, 

and I think --


QUESTION:  Which is why it's a felony.


MR. DENVIR:  -- and I think that if there had been


some -- some violence that had actually occurred out of this,


then he undoubtedly would have been punished under a different


statute with higher --


QUESTION:  It's a serious crime, in part because of


that -- in part because of the risk of physical confrontation


that it poses.


MR. DENVIR:  But Your Honor, California determined

that when it set the ranges for grand theft --


QUESTION:  Would you like -- would you like to reserve time,


Mr. Denvir?


MR. DENVIR:  If the Court has further questions, I'd


rather answer the questions --


QUESTION:  Very well --


MR. DENVIR:  -- than reserve time.


QUESTION:  Very well.  You asked for it, you --


MR. DENVIR:  California considered that when they


set the penalties for grand theft.  And they set the penalty


as a maximum of three years in prison.  If they set different


penalties for grand theft from a person, and for robbery,


there is -- there is -- all those things are taken into


consideration here.  And the fact that this could have


eventuated into something else, the fact of the matter is that 

it did not.  And in fact, if anything, Mr. Ewing seemed to be


doing everything he can to be -- to get out of there


undetected, if that -- if you look at the facts of this crime.


QUESTION:  I'm curious about one thing.  Was he


really a very tall man, or were these irons rather than wood?


(Laughter.) 


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, to tell you the truth, I


have no idea how he could have done that.  It seems to me a


miracle that he could have -- actually got out the door, but


he apparently did.  He's not a very tall man, as I recall.

QUESTION:  Mr. De Nicola, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. DE NICOLA


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. DE NICOLA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:  First, I think, in answer to Justice Breyer's


question, I don't know what the statistics are under the old


indeterminate sentencing law that was in effect in California


until 1976.  But in a way, I think the -- Your Honor's


question triggers an issue that I think is central here.


The ISL, the old California law, was premised very


29

25

explicitly on a penological theory that emphasized


rehabilitation of the offender.  I think the question that's


raised in this case, and it's a question that's particularly


apt in light of the Harmelin opinion, is, when can a state


decide that they're going to move away from a more lenient


policy of rehabilitation or extending leniency to a first-


time offender, and move toward a policy, a tougher policy, of


incapacitation?


QUESTION:  So, tell me, am I fair to assume there


never, in the history of the United States, has been a person


who -- of the set -- I'm only -- I don't want to be


pejorative; I want to characterize it your way, and I'll


characterize it as taking the set of very serious criminals


with very serious records, and a person in that set commits


another crime, and the other crime is approximately theft of 

$1200 -- and am I fair in saying there hasn't been, ever, a


sentence in the history of the United States in the last


hundred years anywhere close to this one?  And I base that on


my knowledge -- which you could get; it's public -- of 35,000


real cases in the federal system where to get a sentence like


this one for a prior offender, you had to -- you have to now,


you know, hijack an airplane, commit murder, something really


serious beyond belief compared to this, and that the worst


sentence you could get for something like this is about four,


five years.

21

22

23

24

25

 And then I look to the California Adult Authority,


and I see, under that sentencing, nobody could have gotten


more than ten real years, and, indeed, the average was


somewhere around five.  And you have all those records, and


you have come up with nothing in your brief.  And therefore,


can I say -- my assumption is, this is by an order or factor


of two or three times higher than anyone ever was sentenced


before in the United States for such a thing?


You see, I'm making a very extreme statement


empirically, and I want to know what the response is to my


statement, and I want to know why I shouldn't hold you to my


statement since you have the information, and why I shouldn't


say that's just way too much.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Well, again, Your Honor, I -- the --


my answer is that I do not know what those records would have 

shown.


QUESTION:  I guess he shouldn't hold you to it,


since you don't have the burden of persuasion here, do you?  I


thought you're defending a -- a decision below.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Yes, and I did interpret the issue


to be a proportionality issue rather than an unusualness


issue.  But I do -- something in the recesses of my mind tells


me that we had a three-time loser statute in California, and I


think that put people away for life without parole.


QUESTION:  Well, all right, how do we decide --how

do we decide if you say, of this serious set of criminals, you


go to jail for life if you jay-walk -- I mean, the next time. 


Is that -- is that disproportionate?  How am I supposed to say


what is or was -- is not if I don't look to the empirical


facts?  And I'm not holding you to present empirical facts. 


I'm just saying, Why shouldn't I decide on the basis of


empirical fact that is available?


MR. DE NICOLA:  Well, in our view, the most


prominent, kind of, objective factor that this Court could


look to in weighing this sentence is what the legislature has


said are felonies.  What California has done in this case is,


they've narrowed their target to a subclass of felons who have


committed what the legislature has deemed to be -- and I think


what, on the face of it, can reasonably be interpreted as


being -- serious or violent crimes.


QUESTION:  What's the limit for being -- what is the


dividing line between grand theft and petty theft in


California?


MR. DE NICOLA:  Four hundred dollars, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  When I went to law school, it was $100,


except if it was citrus you stole, it was $50.


(Laughter.) 


MR. DE NICOLA:  Now it's $100 if it's citrus.


(Laughter.) 


MR. DE NICOLA:  But once there is that predicate of

serious or violent felonies set in place, then what the three-


strikes law does is, I think, reasonably moves toward a policy


of incapacitation upon the commission of, not just any new


crime, not a misdemeanor or an infraction, but a new crime


that the legislature has --


QUESTION:  One of the things that puzzles me about


the statute -- maybe you can enlighten me -- I thought that if


there were two priors that were violent but not related to


property, such as murder and rape, that the third related to


property wouldn't trigger the statute.


MR. DE NICOLA:  No, Your Honor.  The way the statute


is written is that if the prior felonies meet the statutory


definition of being serious or violent -- if you have two of


those, then any new felony triggers the three-strike sentence.


QUESTION: 


Even if you -- if you had, say, a murder 

conviction and a rape conviction and then you committed a


wobbler that was a property crime?  Would the statute treat


that as a third strike?


MR. DE NICOLA:  Yes, because wobblers are felonies,


by definition, in California, and any felony qualifies.


QUESTION:  Regardless of the character of the first


two strikes.


MR. DE NICOLA:  As long as the first two strikes


meet the level of being serious or violent, which --


QUESTION:  I see.  So -- and there's no requirement

that it be related to property.  I misunderstood.


MR. DE NICOLA:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  All right.


QUESTION:  Also, I don't know how to work with


felony and misdemeanor, because, across the nation, my


impression is that those are classified in very different


ways, and they're classified sometimes according to the prison


that you serve in, as in Massachusetts, and sometimes you can


find a felony that, in ordinary common sense, is a lot less


serious than certain misdemeanors.  That's why I'm very pushed


to know what to work with unless you work with empirical fact.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Well, we -- in California, the


felony is defined by the -- not just the locus of where the


term will be served, but also by the length.  It's more than a


year. 


And we think that that's a traditional line of 

demarcation between offenses that, over the course of time,


society deems to be of elevated seriousness.


QUESTION:  I think some of our constitutional


jurisprudence makes it -- makes -- turns upon the distinction


between felonies and misdemeanors, doesn't it?


MR. DE NICOLA:  Yes, Your Honor, I think that is so,


and there are political restraints on the legislature in


enacting laws in general applicability.  There are certainly


economic restraints on a legislature in deciding to set a


punishment scheme that provides for long terms of

imprisonment.  That's costly.  And that to -- for a court to


second-guess that, comes, we think, perilously close to the


court suggesting that the legislature can, in some instances,


not declare a certain crime to be a felony, but must declare


it to be a misdemeanor, and we don't think there's anything in


the Court's jurisprudence that would -- that would support


that type of an intrusion.


QUESTION:  Mr. De Nicola, there's a lot of


discretion built into this scheme.  It comes across as three


strikes and you're out, and that's it; but it's not.  There's


discretion in the prosecutor and discretion in the judge.  Are


there, in Los Angeles or in California, any guides to


prosecutors in exercising their discretion, say, whether to


treat a wobbler as a misdemeanor or a felony?


MR. DE NICOLA: 


There are no statewide standards. 

Each elected district attorney in the various counties in


California has the option of promulgating guidelines.  Some of


them have.  And the fact of the matter is some of them -- some


of them differ.  We think that's a rather unremarkable event


in light of the fact that prosecutorial discretion is always


going to lead to some sort of different approach depending on


local conditions.  But there is not, as far as I know, any


statewide guideline, and certainly nothing that would be


binding on the local prosecutors.


QUESTION:  The prosecutor can charge something as a

misdemeanor.  As far as the striking a strike is concerned, is


that solely for the judge?  Or, I suppose, it depends on


what's charged.  The prosecutor can decide not to charge two


strikes.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Yes, the prosecutor, under the


statute, is required to allege the priors, but the prosecutor


may seek dismissal of the prior strikes either in the


furtherance of justice, or because of problems of proof.  But


the judge also has authority to strike strikes, even without


the consent of the prosecutor, in California.  And so --


QUESTION:  And similarly, to reduce a wobbler to a


misdemeanor.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Yes, the prosecutor, in a way, has


that discretion, because he or she can charge a -- an


alternative felony or misdemeanor as a misdemeanor in the 

first place, but even under the three-strikes law, the trial


judge retains the discretion to sentence a -- an alternative


felony misdemeanor as a misdemeanor, and that would take the


case out of the three-strikes scope.


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question about your


theory of the limits of the constitutional protection here? 


Supposing the offense was speeding -- and it can be dangerous


speeding -- and you had a -- you said that -- 15 arrests for


speeding gives you this very sentence we got in this case. 


Would that be permissible, do you think?  Just on the theory

that Justice Scalia has explained -- where this guy is just


too dangerous, we just don't want him on the street anymore,


so we'll put him in jail for life, 25 years without


possibility of parole.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Well, we think that might possibly


be constitutional, Your Honor.  I --


QUESTION:  Possibly be constitutional or


unconstitutional?


MR. DE NICOLA:  Might possibly be constitutional.  I


think it's more likely that it would 


be --


QUESTION:  Well, why wouldn't it clearly be


constitutional if we're thinking about protecting the public


from repetitive offenders?


MR. DE NICOLA: 


Well, because I think the limiting 

principle that we're seeking here, Your Honor, is one that's


premised on the felony classification.  If 


the --


QUESTION:  Do you think the statute would have been


unconstitutional if they had said it's a misdemeanor when it's


$1200 -- if the legislature just, say, called the three golf


clubs for $1200 by a misdemeanor instead of by felony, would


that change the constitutional analysis?


MR. DE NICOLA:  It -- I think it would make the


constitutional -- it might change the constitutional analysis.

It might make the result different.  I think, again, once you


have the predicate in place of the serious or violent


felonies, then I think the reason you're --


QUESTION:  But serious or violent -- it really


doesn't have to be violent; it has to serious.  But you could


have had $1200 thefts, four or five of them, and he would


still qualify, wouldn't he?


MR. DE NICOLA:  No, Your Honor.  If -- the prior


crimes have to qualify as serious or violent under the


definitions of a separate statutory scheme, so they would


not --


QUESTION:  But are there not serious crimes that are


not violent?


MR. DE NICOLA:  Yes, I think that's true.  There are


serious crimes where no injury is inflicted, but the crimes, I 

think, by their nature, tend to be crimes where the prospect


of violence is rather imminent.


QUESTION:  But they're -- I'm just trying to -- I'm


trying to understand the theory.  Is violence an absolute


requirement, in your view, in one of the priors?


MR. DE NICOLA:  No, I think -- I think --


QUESTION:  Okay.  So then we could have something


equivalent -- maybe instead of $1200, $2000 or something.  But


if you just had five -- or three or four $2,000 burglaries,


that -- do you -- would that be permissible to put him in jail

on the same sentence that you have in this case?


MR. DE NICOLA:  I -- again, Your Honor, I -- it's


a -- it's a much tougher call.  I think it might be


permissible to do it, provided that the sentence allows for a


possibility of parole, after the --


QUESTION:  After 25 years.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Yes.  That would distinguish it from


Solem, Your Honor.  But nevertheless, here, the predicate,


even though the prior crimes don't necessarily have to involve


the actual infliction of violence, they are crimes that by


their nature --


QUESTION:  But in your view, violence is really more


significant than the number of prior offenses, if I understand


you correctly.


MR. DE NICOLA: 


Well, I think it might be a sliding 

scale, but I think violence does play a significant role and


can justify a scheme like this, even in the absence --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. DE NICOLA:  -- of a great number of priors.


QUESTION:  But you -- but I'm not quite sure what


your view would be if there were no violence, but just seven


or eight high-speed offenses, say, speeding, or $1200 golf


clubs.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Well, we think a lot would depend on


whether the legislature in the jurisdiction had determined

for -- for -- on an historical basis and for reasons


independent --


QUESTION:  Well, speeding is dangerous.  People get


hurt in automobile accidents.  It seems to me it's exactly the


same risk to the public that you have with this kind of crime.


MR. DE NICOLA:  But we think -- if the legislature


declares those to be a felony, then I think we become a lot --


we come a lot closer to --


QUESTION:  It depends on what the legislature calls


the offense.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Yes, it does, Your Honor, in a very


significant respect, because what the legislature calls the


offense in connection with it being a misdemeanor or a felony


does reflect, we think, a reliable longstanding consensus of


the -- of the community. 


And under the Harmelin principles of 

deference and reliance and objective factors, we think that's


a prominent objective factor.


QUESTION:  On Justice Stevens' hypo, taking it one


step further, I guess we would have to say that if there were


15 prior speeding offenses, and they had been classified as


felonies in California, that there was no disproportion


between 25-to-life for 15 -- with a predicate of 15 prior


speeding offenses, on the one hand, and the penalties for


torture and murder, on the other hand.  Because I think it's


undisputed that the only standalone penalties that are this

great are the penalties for torture and homicide.  That would


be rather a stretch, wouldn't it, regardless of whether the


legislature wants to put a felony label on them or not?


MR. DE NICOLA:  Well, again, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Speeding's important, but --


MR. DE NICOLA:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- I mean, torture and murder?


MR. DE NICOLA:  I do think that it is a much tougher


case for us, and I'm not at all certain that it would be


constitutional if all of the crimes, the predicate through the


new crime, were simply speeding.  I think --


QUESTION:  Might it be an abuse of the judge's


discretion not to reduce such a -- if it's a wobbler, in such


a case, or not to strike a strike?


MR. DE NICOLA:  Well, I don't -- in the  California


context, the question would only arise -- well, I don't think


it would arise at all, because you wouldn't have a speeding --


even as a predicate, any felony-triggering offense, and the


speeding wouldn't qualify as a serious or violent felony under


the statute anyway.  So this hypothetical is very far removed


from the three-strikes scheme that California has in place.


QUESTION:  I would have thought that your response


to Justice Souter would have been that it might seem


disproportionate insofar as the penal goal of punishment or


retribution is concerned, but it depends on what you want your

penal goals to be.  California has decided that disabling the


criminal is the most important thing, and in -- from that


point of view, it's not necessarily disproportionate.  The one


is disabled as the other.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Well --


QUESTION:  I mean, proportionality -- you


necessarily have to look upon what the principal objective of


the punishment is.  If the objective of -- if the objective is


retribution, then, sure, I guess it's disproportionate to


execute somebody for killing only one person, when you do no


more than execute somebody for killing 20 people.  But if your


purpose is disabling the criminal, I'm not sure that it --


that the example that Justice Souter gave is disproportionate.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Well, again, Your Honor, I don't --


I don't think I would absolutely concede that it would be 

unconstitutional.  I'm just saying that --


QUESTION:  Well, do you adopt Justice Scalia's


analysis?  I mean, this came up in the briefs, and this was an


interesting point.  Does the State, for purposes of


proportionality analysis, have the option to adopt a different


theory of penalty?  And he's given an example.  Do you -- do


you adopt that argument here?  And do you think that is a


justification that you want to rely on in this case?


MR. DE NICOLA:  Yes, we do adopt the theory of


incapacitation, and we do rely on incapacitation as a theory

that justifies the sentence in this case.


QUESTION:  All right.  Here's the problem that I


have with that, and this is -- this is -- this is what I wish


you would address.  If we allow, for purposes of


proportionality or gross disproportionality analysis, this


kind of -- the consideration of varying intentions --


retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, and so on -- and


every time the State gets to a very high offense, the State


says, "Oh, we've changed the theory.  We've gone from


deterrence to retribution," it seems to me that it makes this


kind of analysis of comparables -- this proportionality


analysis -- impossible because we no longer have two


comparable entities on either side of our comparison.  What we


have is a low sentence on the one hand for deterrence, and a


high sentence for incapacitation or retribution.  We have


apples and oranges instead of oranges and oranges.


So my question is, if we accept the State's option


to say, "We've changed the theory," don't we read


comparability analysis right out of the law?  Doesn't it


simply become logically impossible?


MR. DE NICOLA:  Well, I think it becomes much more


difficult, but I don't think it necessarily becomes logically


impossible, because I think there is still room for judicial


scrutiny, within the context of the Harmelin narrow


proportionality principle, to take a hard look --

 QUESTION:  But my problem is, I don't know what


we're supposed to -- what we can compare for comparable


examples on proportionality analysis if it can be


fundamentally affected by the State's change of intention from


one theory in one crime, or one set of penalties, to another


theory in another set of penalties.  I don't see what we can


compare.  We no longer have comparables.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Well, but I think the Court can


still look at whether the phenomenon of -- as in this case, of


heightened recidivism based on prior violence, or serious


offenses threatening violence and triggered by a new crime


that, say -- that's classified as a felony by the legislature


and that offers a sentence of -- a lengthy sentence, but that


still offers a possibility of 


parole --


QUESTION:  I guess the conclusion that Justice


Souter's questions would lead to is that a State cannot use


any factor except retribution.  Or if it uses any other


factor, it does so at the risk of our simply holding it to be


disproportionate.


MR. DE NICOLA:  Yes, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  And I don't know that our -- I'm sure


that our cases don't support that.


MR. DE NICOLA:  It -- and I acknowledge it -- to


Justice Souter, it makes it a very difficult situation.  But

under Harmelin, those, I think, are penological objectives


that the Judiciary ought to defer to the State.


QUESTION:  But maybe -- maybe, and I -- we've -- we


haven't said this -- maybe our assumption is that the State,


in establishing a penal system, is going to establish it on a


set of consistent and neutral principles from beginning to


end.  Would that be a legitimate basis for us to ground our


constitutional analysis?


MR. DE NICOLA:  No, Your Honor.  It disables the


states from changing -- from dealing with changing conditions.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. De Nicola.


Mr. Chertoff, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL CHERTOFF


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. CHERTOFF: 


Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court:  I think the last series of questions which Justice


Souter posed to Mr. De Nicola really framed the issue in light


of this case's most recent pronouncement in Harmelin -- this


Court's most recent pronouncement in Harmelin.


I would have read Harmelin as establishing two


principles, at a minimum.  One is, the analysis is not


proportionality; it's gross disproportionality, an extremely


rare basis to invalidate a statute.  Second, we recognize that


the states are entitled to adopt different penological


theories, or a mix of theories.  In fact, I would have thought


45

that a state's entitled to say, for example, that certain


types of crimes ought to be addressed in terms of retribution;


other types of crimes posing other kinds of issues can be


dealt with in terms of deterrence and incapacitation.


And if the consequence of that principle is that


this Court has very limited review on comparability of


sentences, at least where you're dealing with sentences that


allow for the possibility of parole, then I think the


conclusion is that it is the extremely rare case in which a


sentence gets --


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't that this case?  I mean,


I don't know how to approach proportionality other than to


say, what sentences are given for the same crime, or what


crimes are treated with the same sentence?


Now, suppose, looking at that, I find this is the 

rare case.  If it isn't, why isn't it?  I mean, all the


information we have, as I've said before, seems to suggest


that this is higher by a factor of two or three times anything


else you can find. 


MR. CHERTOFF:  Well --


QUESTION:  Now, if that isn't grossly


disproportionate, why isn't it?


MR. CHERTOFF:  It's not for several reasons, Your


Honor.  First of all, although there's nothing in the record


to speak to what the pre-1977 proportions were in terms of

sentencing, we do know, for example, that elsewhere in the


country there have been comparable sentences.  We've cited in


the United States --


QUESTION:  Cited a lot of instances in which the law


permits such a sentence, but that's quite different from


saying there was such a sentence.


MR. CHERTOFF:  Actually, I think in footnote 13,


we've cited several cases in other states where you have very


comparable punishments, where you have larcenies between 4-


and $700 as the third strike --


QUESTION:  And do you have instances where people


were sentenced to 25 real years in prison for having committed


such an offense?  Or were you citing that the law would permit


such a sentence?


MR. CHERTOFF: 


We cited review and rejection of 

disproportionality challenges in one case in Nevada to a life


sentence without parole for a grand larceny of --


QUESTION:  Good, okay, thank you.


MR. CHERTOFF:  -- $476, and a similar one, I think,


in South Dakota.


Also, of course, as we look at the current


sentencing regime, this is not, as in Solem versus Helm, where


you have single judge who is apparently an outlier under the


state sentencing scheme.  In this case, if one takes, in fact,


a petitioner's own figures, you have at least 2- to 300

individuals whose third strike, under the California scheme as


it now exists, has, in fact, been a property-based crime.


And I think the most compelling reason why this is


not that very, very rare case where we strike down a sentence


is precisely what Justice Ginsburg has been repeatedly asking


about, the discretion that the courts have to tailor the


particular sentence in this case to the facts of the case.  If


we look at the record in this case, in the joint appendix, the


sentencing judge carefully considered the entirety of the file


with respect to the trigger -- or the predicate offenses,


which involved, actually, three burglaries in the course of a


single month, one of which involved pulling a knife and


threatening somebody, as well as at least nine prior offenses.


And interestingly, in no case since 1988 had the


petitioner ever successfully completed probation or parole. 

He was always violating probation or parole by committing his


next offense.  And that's precisely what the sentencing judge


looked at and explicitly referred to in rejecting the request


on the part of the petitioner either to downgrade the


triggering offense to a misdemeanor, or to eliminate some of


the strikes.


And I would have thought that is precisely what we


expect and want judges to do in a rational sentencing system.


QUESTION:  In effect, you're -- going back to the


beginning of your argument, I think you're -- I think you're

saying that what the judge here did in rejecting the request


to downgrade or to disregard, in effect, was saying, "Yes, I


am finding that this is a case in which it is appropriate to


sentence on an entirely different theory, a theory of putting


them away, as opposed to a theory of deterrence," and I --


that seems to be the logic of what's going on.


MR. CHERTOFF:  That's correct; an entirely different


theory, though, that is embraced by the State in passing this


law.


QUESTION:  And may I ask you one more question on


that?  Because again, you started toward it in responding to


me at the beginning.  Like you, I came in here assuming that


the State could change its theories.  If that is so, then I


guess what that means for proportionate or gross


disproportionality analysis is this: 


A State can do it and 

can pass our Eight Amendment test if it has a reasonable basis


for saying, "We are going, under certain circumstances, to say


there is a changed theory of sentencing.  The theory changes


from deterrence or mere retribution to a theory or public


protection, putting away the person who simply will repeat and


repeat and repeat."


So, for purposes of our proportionality analysis,


the question would come down, do they have a reasonable basis


for doing that under their statute, in general?  And in


particular, is there a reasonable basis for saying that this


49

16

18

19

21

22

23

24

25

is a case for that?  And if the answers to those two questions


are yes, then it passes the test.  Is that -- would you adopt


that analysis?


MR. CHERTOFF:  I would absolutely agree that if it


satisfies those two, it passes the test.  That's not to say


that if it flunks those, it automatically fails the test.  But


certainly if you meet those conditions, I think you pass the


test.  And I think there's a common sense to that.


One could look, for example, at certain types of


violent crimes, like murders and rapes and say, irrespective


of whether it was a crime of passion or something that will


never happen again, "It is so heinous, our philosophy is we


have to punish it."  But one can also look at comparatively


small crimes, at least if they're felonies, and say, "If


someone is repetitiously unable to conform their conduct to 

the requirements of the law, we don't have to wait until he


commits the next felony or the next two felonies before we put


an end to it."


And interestingly, if one goes back to Blackstone,


who talks a little bit about the issue of proportionality as


it related back in his day, he discusses the fact that when


you deal with habitual offenders, it would be cruel to the


public to simply allow that person to get out again and commit


their next crime.


So, I don't know that it's so much that the State

25

changes its theory, as that the State adapts its theory to the


particular type of crime and particular type of offender.  And


that's, of course, what we want to have in sentencing.


And, finally, I would say this.  In a scheme like


California, where the state judge has the power to tailor to


the particular offender and the particular offense what the


right answer is, for the federal courts to come in under gross


disproportionality analysis and recalibrate that -- even if,


sitting as state trial judges, the justices might feel we


would do it differently -- would be essentially converting the


courts into a constitutional sentencing commission.  And if


one looks at the companion case --


QUESTION:  Excuse me, would be essentially 


to --


MR. CHERTOFF: 


Convert the court into a 

constitutional sentencing commission.  Doing the kind of


analysis that we now have, a sentencing commission --


QUESTION:  And that would be a very bad thing.  I


agree.


(Laughter.) 


MR. CHERTOFF:  It would be a -- certainly very


complicated thing, Justice Breyer.


So -- and if one looks at the companion case,


Andrade, and the subsequent cases in the Ninth Circuit that


have flowed from that case, one sees this phenomenon beginning

to emerge, where every fact pattern is evaluated slightly


differently.  One court views burglary as being a violent


offense; one court says it's not a violent offense.


QUESTION:  Could you argue that, because discretion


is consistent with the goals of the statute before the


sentencing, that some discretion is also permitted to a


reviewing court after the sentencing, and they can still


maintain the symmetry and the purpose of the statute?


MR. CHERTOFF:  The state law could certainly provide


for some kind of review as a matter of state sentencing law in


terms of abuse of discretion by the sentencing judge.


QUESTION:  But in this -- in California, does the


appellate court ever set aside sentences on the ground there


was an abuse of discretion to invoke the three strikes law?


MR. CHERTOFF: 


I know of cases where they have 

affirmed trial judges that have set aside strikes.  I don't


know of a case --


QUESTION:  No, I -- has -- has a trial judge ever


been set aside for imposing the third strike?


MR. CHERTOFF:  I'm not aware of it.


QUESTION:  I don't think --


MR. CHERTOFF:  I'm not aware --


QUESTION:  -- there are any --


MR. CHERTOFF:  -- of such a case.  Certainly the


state law could allow that to happen.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF QUIN DENVIR


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DENVIR:  Your Honor, the point I -- I'd like to


make two points.  One is, if the discretion in -- under the


California law is very limited.  One thing would be to treat a


wobbler, if it is a wobbler, and reduce it to a misdemeanor;


so you would go from 25 to life, or life, to one-year maximum


penalty.  That's not used very often.  The other one is to


strike a prior conviction.  But that's a -- the California


Supreme Court in Romero said that's a very limited discretion,


that it is only when you can find that this offender is 

outside the "spirit of the law," whatever that is.  And


there's an amicus brief filed by the Los Angeles public


defender in Romero that shows that that discretion has been


used very little in California.  So the -- this limited


discretion has no effect on it.


The only other point I'd make, as far as the


repetition -- as far as the labeling, if all the legislature


has to do is say, "What we're doing here is incapacitation,


and, therefore, the Court can't look at that," then it really


writes the Eighth Amendment protections against grossly


53 

disproportional sentences out totally.  If it's just a


question of -- they say, "Here's our reason," and you can't


even question that, because they can always claim they want to


incapacitate any criminal for any amount of time.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Denvir. The


case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
