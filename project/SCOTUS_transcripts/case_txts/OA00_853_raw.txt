CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 00-853, Porter v. Nussle.


General Blumenthal.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BLUMENTHAL


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may


it please the Court:


This case is about the meaning of the term,


prison conditions, and the reason it is here is because


the Second Circuit misinterpreted that term contrary to


the purposes of Congress and the meaning given that term


by this Court.


In fact, Congress adopted this Court's language


when it passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996


and adopted the meaning of that term given to it by this


Court in a line of cases, Preiser v. Rodriguez, the


Bronson case, McCarthy v. Bronson, and Wilson v. Seiter,


that very clearly include single episode and excessive


force cases, which the Second Circuit Court of Appeals


excluded in its decision.  It interpreted the term, prison


conditions, to exclude those kinds of single episode and


excessive forces instances of misconduct by prison


officials.

 QUESTION:  What's the universe of conditions and


nonconditions that you would suggest?  There was


considerable discussion in the brief about the distinction


between 1983 suits and habeas corpus suits.  You would not


draw the line there, would you, or would you?


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Preiser v. Rodriguez draws


the line between habeas corpus petitions on the one hand


challenging the fact or duration of confinement and the on


the other hand conditions of prison life, or conditions of


his prison life, as it refers to the petitions that we


think are the universe that would be included in 1983


actions.  Virtually any conditions of prison life ought to


be regarded as conditions of confinement cases.


QUESTION:  Well, can you give me an example,


under your theory, of a case that is not covered by habeas


corpus, but that also are not a condition of prison life


which is a 1983 suit?  When could a 1983 suit lie under


your theory?


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Our position would be that


all of those 183 lawsuits ought to be subject, are subject


to the exhaustion requirement.  There are no exclusions,


whether it's --


QUESTION:  You can't think of any suit brought


by a prisoner that is not controlled by the term,


conditions, unless it's a habeas corpus suit?

 GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Well, if it were completely


unrelated to prison life -- an example might be, for


example, a lawsuit against a State tax commissioner, for


example, just to take one that seems relevant in light of


the earlier argument today, where the prisoner is claiming


that he's been denied a refund to which he's properly


entitled, and --


QUESTION:  You're saying that all Eighth


Amendment claims under 1983, which is what most of the


prison cases are.


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  All --


QUESTION:  They claim that they've been deprived


of a constitutional right because they have been sentenced


to prison and the conditions of that prison, whether it's


an isolated beating by a guard or anything else, are


unduly -- are cruel and unusual?


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  All


Eighth Amendment constitutional claims, indeed all


constitutional claims under 1983, this Court has never


established a hierarchy among such claims regarding


excessive force claims as deserving greater priority, so


that they ought to be spared the exhaustion requirement.


In fact, it is specifically said in Wilson v.


Garcia that, for example, on statute of limitations


questions there ought to be uniformity, and certainty, so

as to avoid the kind of litigation that also was the


purpose of Congress in passing the PLRA, and that is


really one of the key points here.


QUESTION:  That's an easier line.  What you're


saying is that the minute you begin defining a universe of


conditions which is smaller than the 1983 suits --


generally we have a whole jurisprudence that has to be


tested and create satellite litigation, et cetera, and I


understand that.  I'm just wondering if your definition is


prevailing, Congress would have used those words,


conditions.  It would have just said all 1983 suits


involving prisoners, period.


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Justice Kennedy, Congress


used that term because it was used by this Court to


describe a category of the universe as set forth in


Preiser and again in McCarthy v. Bronson, where the court


faced a similar issue under the Magistrates Act, the


nonconsensual referral of petitions to magistrates, and


said that all of these cases, 1983 cases are, indeed,


conditions of confinement cases, and Congress wanted to


use that language and that meaning given by this term so


as to avoid corollary or, as you put it quite well,


satellite litigation that, in fact -- in fact has been


spawned in the Second Circuit by the Nussle case, and we


see it, for example, in Royster v. United States, which is

before this Court on cert, where excessive force is no


longer even involved.


It's a particularized instance, as the court of


appeals referred to it, of denial of the documents, legal


documents that the prisoner claims he is entitled to


receive, and courts then and now would have to decide what


kinds of cases are excessive force, if they are mixed with


other cases that may not be excessive force, if they seem


to involve in some respect ongoing conditions --


QUESTION:  You can certainly find some Eighth


Amendment claims that have nothing to do with excessive


force, I think.  A case comes to mind that we decided


earlier this term, a case called Molesco, which came from


the Second Circuit.  It didn't come here under the Prison


Litigation Act, but what happened there was that the


prisoner had a heart condition, he ordinarily was allowed


to use the elevator to go up to the sixth floor cell, this


day the prison attendant said no, you can't use the


elevator, so he walked up the stairs and had a heart


attack.


Now, that case was brought under the Eighth


Amendment. I take it under your view that if it were a


prison litigation action he should have to exhaust


administrative remedies.


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.

He ought to be required to exhaust because in that case,


for example, the prison administrator could and might well


make adjustments to the facilities, might do retraining,


different decisions on hiring, in fact, disciplining --


QUESTION:  General Blumenthal, on the other side


of that is the argument that Nussle makes that he said


that the guards told me if I report what they did they


would kill me, so are there assurances -- you said the


value of -- no risk to the prisoners, this is going on, so


that they can cure it.  He says, if I told they said they


were going to kill me.  Are there assurances in the system


that there isn't going to be retaliation of someone who


makes an internal complaint?


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Certainly in Connecticut's


system, Justice Ginsburg, there are such assurances, and


in the joint appendix at 11 and at other places there are


requirements for confidentiality, for example.  There is a


requirement for an informal contact or request.


In the Connecticut system, the commissioner


entertains, personally reads, is on the floor and, indeed,


there is the requirement that the lieutenant make two


rounds every day, that a captain make one round, that he


be or she be accessible in those circumstances, and that


protection be provided, and that is, as a matter of fact,


one of the advantages of exhausting, because it assures

timely, prompt attention.


QUESTION:  General Blumenthal, I don't really


understand this.  Was the threat that the guards made, if


you tell somebody through an administrative internal


procedure we're going to kill you, but it's perfectly okay


to go to a court directly.  We just really want you to


exhaust administrative remedies.  We'll kill you if you


exhaust administrative remedies.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  But if you go right to the court,


that's okay.  Is that realistically what the threat was?


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Justice Scalia, the --


QUESTION:  So this problem, you have it no


matter what, don't you?


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  You can't --


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  The threat of retaliation


was more general.


QUESTION:  I would think so.


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  And it was never verified,


of course.


QUESTION:  Prison guards don't --


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  It was a claim.


QUESTION:  -- administrative law generally, in


my experience.

 GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Well, they're learning,


Justice Scalia, and part of the claim here was one of


retaliation, but it --


QUESTION:  Was he still in prison when he


brought this case?


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  He was in prison when he


brought this lawsuit.  He waited for 3 years.  He waited


until literally 3 to 5 days, depending on whether you look


at the complaint or whatever, until the statute of


limitations was about to expire, and then he went to


court.


It was not a timely, emergent, exigent plea for


help, and if there had been a real threat physically to


him, the prison administration would have afforded a far


more effective means of protection than going to Federal


court and seeking some remedy -- and by the way, he sought


money damages.  He didn't seek any protection or


injunctive relief -- than going to Federal court and


seeking some remedy far in the future.


The excessive force claim -- and I want to be


very frank about it -- is intertwined with the single


episode contention on which the court of appeals also


relied, and in our view the excessive force claim, the


threat of physical harm, is a more difficult one because


it's raised in this Court's cases, in Hudson v. McMillian,

and Farmer v. Brennan, which deal with the element of


proof, the elements of proof that have to be provided to


make out a claim, with the standard of intent that has to


be shown.


QUESTION:  You acknowledge they do draw this


distinction between prison conditions and excessive force


cases?


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  They do, Justice Kennedy,


but only for the purpose of the standard of proof or


intent, and this Court has made that distinction very


clear in Crawford-El v. Britton, which is cited in the


briefs at 523 U.S. 574, and particularly at 585 the Court


draws the distinction, because in Crawford-El it is saying


that a heightened standard of intent need not be shown,


should not be required in order to protect prison


officials from frivolous lawsuits or from discovery.


And the Court says we have a law that will do


that, we have the PLRA, and it says about the PLRA, most


significantly, and I'm quoting from 585, most


significantly the statute draws no distinction between


constitutional claims that require proof of an improper


motive and those that do not, so the Court there -- and it


goes on to say, if there is a compelling need to frame new


rules of law based on such a distinction, presumably


Congress either would have dealt with the problem in the

reform act, or will respond to it in future legislation.


What the Court is doing there is saying, and it


does so after a footnote that cites Farmer, and refers to


the Eighth Amendment, that is to say, footnote 7, we don't


mean that prison conditions should exclude the excessive


force claims simply because we have said in Farmer and


Hudson v. McMillian that under the questions presented


there they would do so, so the Court I think as answer --


this Court has answered that question, and --


QUESTION:  Is this the citation to Crawford-El?


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Crawford-El is 523 United


States 574, and I have been quoting from 585.


QUESTION:  Thank you.


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  And 597.  The quote was


from 597, but I want to make clear, in fairness, that


quotation is not central to the holding of the case, which


I mentioned earlier.  It is a distinction that the Court


draws so as to in effect provide reassurance that the


Prisoner Litigation Reform Act will do the job of


eliminating frivolous litigation as, indeed, it did in


1997a(c), where it provided for dismissal of actions that


are frivolous, malicious, or seek monetary damage from an


official who is immune, and it uses the term, prison


conditions.


In fact, prison conditions is also a term used


12

in 1997e(f), where there's a reference to the pretrial


proceedings that can occur by means of video, or


telephone, or other telephone communications technology. 


There is no reason that the term, prison conditions, in


those sections of the statute, ought to exclude excessive


force cases or single episode instances of misconduct and,


indeed, it would do violence, it would be directly


contradictory to the purposes of Congress, which were to


reduce the volume of litigation, particularly frivolous


litigation, to give prison administrators a chance to


correct errors or mistakes and to reduce the interference


of Federal courts in prison administration, and to provide


a better record if there is going to be resort to the


Federal courts.


With the Court's permission, if there are no


further questions I'd like to reserve the remainder of my


time.


QUESTION:  Very well, General Blumenthal.


Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


For four reasons, actions that challenge


13

21

23

24

25

particular instances of unlawful conduct such as excessive


force are actions with respect to prison conditions that


must be exhausted under the PLRA.


First, in three cases, this Court has used the


terms, prison conditions, or conditions of confinement, to


refer to particular instances of unlawful conduct and, in


one of those cases, McCrary v. Bronson, it applied the


term to a single episode of excessive force.  There's no


reason to think that Congress intended any narrower


meaning here.


Second, the purposes of the exhaustion provision


are to give prison officials an opportunity to resolve


problems within the prison by themselves, and to reduce


the enormous volume of prison litigation in Federal


courts.  In terms of those two purposes, there's


absolutely no reason to distinguish between actions that


challenge particular instances of unlawful conduct such as


excessive force and any other sort of prisoner complaint. 


Prison authorities in fact have a particularly strong


interest in resolving complaints about staff misconduct on


their own, and grievance procedures are fully effective to


do that without any need for significant Federal court


litigation.


Third, as this Court has recognized, it is


extremely difficult to administer a line between isolated


14

episodes or particular instances and more systematic


practices, or actions undertaken pursuant to a policy. 


Any effort to do that would generate substantial


additional litigation on a threshold collateral issue when


Congress' goal was to reduce the amount of judicial


resources devoted to prisoner complaints.


And finally, creating an exception for


particular instances of unlawful conduct has the potential


to create an enormous loophole in the exhaustion


requirement.  Already, that exception has been applied by


the Second Circuit to retaliation claims, to confiscation


of property claims, and it has the potential and


capability to be applied to a wide variety of prisoner


complaints that are directed at the actions of individual


officers.


It is very unlikely that the Congress amended


this exhaustion provision for the express purpose of


making sure that a dramatically increased number of cases


would have to go through the exhaustion process, would


have simultaneously cut out that large category of claims


that could benefit from the exhaustion process.


QUESTION:  Could you tell me on your point 1,


you cited the case where excessive force applied to --


prison conditions applied to a single incident.  What was


that case?

 MR. GORNSTEIN:  McCrary v. Bronson.


QUESTION:  And was that pre or post enactment of


the litigation reform act?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  That's preenactment.


QUESTION:  Preenactment.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  And in that case was a


construction of the Magistrates Act that had nonconsensual


referral in cases involving conditions of confinement, and


the Court interpreted the phrase, Conditions of


confinement, to embrace single incidents, including


excessive force, and rejected an alternative construction


that is similar to the one adopted by the Second Circuit


here that prison conditions refers to systematic


practices, and it did so for the same reasons, really,


that you should reach the same conclusion here.


The Court said that the purpose of that act was


to reduce the workload of Federal courts, and that would


further that purpose, and it said that trying to draw that


distinction between individual actions and systematic


practices would provoke -- generate a whole new round of


litigation, when what we're trying to deal with here is


something that's trying to save time.


QUESTION:  What about Hudson and Farmer?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Hudson and Farmer show that the


term, prison conditions, can be used in a narrower sense,


16

and that context matters, but here the context was in


defining the substantive elements for proving a particular


kind of Eighth Amendment violation, and the substantive


standards for proving a claim really have nothing to do


with whether a claim should be exhausted.


The context we have here is an exhaustion


provision, and the purposes of exhaustion, as I have said,


are to give prison officials a chance to act first to


solve a problem and to reduce the volume of litigation


and, in light of those purposes, it simply makes no sense


to adopt a narrower meaning.  Instead, the Court should


adopt a broader meaning that comes from Preiser v.


Rodriguez, and McCrary v. Bronson, and Wilson v. Seiter.


QUESTION:  Of course, still in all, even in


Hudson, I guess, drawing a distinction between continuing


prison conditions and single incident prison conditions,


or single incidents that aren't prison conditions, still


involves you in the same problem of satellite litigation 


that you say would be one of the horrible effects of


adopting the same interpretation in the present case.  I


mean, that didn't stop us from coming out that way in


Hudson.  Maybe it should have, but it didn't.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Justice Scalia, two responses to


that.  One is that the line that was actually drawn in


Hudson as I read it is not between single instances and


17

systematic practices, it's between excessive force claims


and everything else, which is -- does still have its


difficulties in administration, but maybe not quite as


challenging as single instances versus systematic


practices.


The other difference is, we're talking about


applying something at the liability stage to make a


determination on whether there has been liability enough,


as opposed to, what do we do right at the outset of


litigation when somebody comes in with a complaint, it's a


threshold question, and generating additional litigation


about that on a threshold question on a collateral issue


it seems to me is something that you would want to


generate less litigation about, generally speaking.


If the Court has no further questions --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.


Mr. Williams.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. WILLIAMS


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. WILLIAMS:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:


When Congress enacted the Prison Litigation


Reform Act, it did so on the heels of at least three


decisions by this Court which clearly defined the term,


prison conditions, to exclude excessive force cases and

those cases start, of course, with Wilson v. Seiter, which


expressly held, and I will quote, the very high state of


mind prescribed by Whitley does not apply to prison


conditions cases.


QUESTION:  What was at issue in Wilson v.


Seiter?


MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, of course, that was a


medical indifference case, deliberate indifference case


involving the distinction between a single incident and


multiple incidents, and to the extent that the Second


Circuit, post Nussle, has gone on to attempt to draw a


distinction of that kind, we do not defend it.  The


distinction which I think is applicable here in defining


the term, prison conditions, is excessive force cases


versus all other types of cases, other than --


QUESTION:  So on the other side of the line so


far as you're concerned would be a number of single


incident types of thing that did not involve excessive


force?


MR. WILLIAMS:  Yes, indeed.  I think the


distinction is one that this Court has made it absolutely


clear the distinction is between -- has to do with the


mens rea that's required.  If the mens rea is a malicious,


sadistic, intending to cause pain, that's not a prison


condition.  If it is, however, deliberate indifference,

that is a prison condition.


QUESTION:  But why would Congress have made that


distinction and said that one -- the kind of cases you're


refer -- shouldn't exhaust administrative remedies whereas


the other one should.  It doesn't -- I can see -- you can


certainly draw a definitional line, but why would Congress


have said case A exhaust, case B don't?


MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, excessive force cases are


different.  They've always been different under this


Court's jurisprudence.  There are many protections that


are already built in to avoid frivolous litigation in the


excessive force context.


For example, the standard itself, cruel,


malicious, sadistic, is a very tough one to meet.  Second,


Leatherman, of course, did not remove or excuse getting


away with just notice pleading.  It required fact


pleading, so that when you combine the requirement of fact


pleading with the high standard that has to be met there's


a very -- it's a very rare case that will pass a 12(b)(6)


motion if it's an excessive force case in the first place.


QUESTION:  Isn't the answer to your argument,


though, the answer that Mr. Gornstein gave a moment ago


when he referred to the significance of context?  If the


issue before the Court involves a distinction among


different kinds of prison cases, then we can certainly

understand the distinction when we say conditions are


different from particular incidents, and if you refer only


conditions, you're meaning to exclude particular


incidents.


But if we're trying to draw a distinction


between prison cases and all kinds of -- all other kinds


of 1983 cases, which was the case when Congress passed


this statute, then I suppose it does make good sense to


use prison conditions in a much broader sense to cover


everything that might come out of prison litigation to


distinguish it from other kinds of 1983 cases, and isn't


that the answer to your argument based on our use of the


term in certain cases?


MR. WILLIAMS:  I think that's more a policy


issue than a statutory construction issue, and I think


that this is just a simple case of statutory construction.


QUESTION:  But the -- I mean, Mr. Gornstein's


argument is kind of a compared-to-what argument.  He's


saying, when you use the phrase, conditions, what are you


comparing the conditions against?  Are you comparing them


against other kinds of things that happen in a prison, or


are you comparing them against other kinds of cases that


might be brought under 1983, and the answer is possibly


going to be quite different, depending on which context


you're in.

 MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, I think the context in


which this Court has used it, and therefore in which


Congress is presumed to have used it, is the latter.


QUESTION:  The cases that, including the one you


cite, the Government cites for the opposite proposition.


MR. WILLIAMS:  I think --


QUESTION:  The cases say, and they have loads of


language there which seem to say it, that Wilson v. Seiter


and three other cases did focus on the issue of single


incident versus affecting several people.  They all


decided that single incident is within the meaning of


prison conditions or the like.


Senator Biden on the floor says, if you pass


this law, you are going to sweep within it excessive force


cases, and nobody denies it, all of which from the most --


and the language, the language admits of Justice Souter's


suggestion, and he provides a purpose.


So taking all those things together, why isn't


the law in this case precisely along the lines he


suggested?


MR. WILLIAMS:  There's no doubt that the cases


involved do not see a principal distinction between single


incident and multiple incident cases.  That, I think, is


where the Second Circuit in the post Nussle cases has gone


wrong.  I don't defend that.  I think that the distinction

is the one that this Court has always drawn, which is


between the excessive force mens rea, which is cruel,


malicious, sadistic, intending to cause pain and nothing


else, on the one hand --


QUESTION:  That's only excessive force?


QUESTION:  That's only excessive force?


QUESTION:  I see somebody in dire need of


medical attention and I sit there smiling cruelly --


please, get me a doctor.


MR. WILLIAMS:  That is exactly --


QUESTION:  You call that excessive force?


MR. WILLIAMS:  That's -- no.  That's deliberate


indifference.  This Court has often said that.  That's


exactly what we're talking about.


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. WILLIAMS:  There -- it's -- indeed --


QUESTION:  It has nothing to do with the things


you were saying, then, cruelty, and savagery, whatever. 


MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, the term is --


QUESTION:  You can be just as cruel and savage


without applying excessive force, if you do it right.


MR. WILLIAMS:  The -- we can have words mean


whatever we want them to mean, but this Court has made it


clear what it means when it refers to excessive force, and


that is the mens rea that we were just talking about

which, after all, comes from Judge Friendly's seminal


opinion in Johnson v. Glick.


That, however, is not what we mean when we talk


about prison conditions, and this Court has made that


clear, and made it clear at the time Congress enacted the


PLRA, and I think that the important distinction between


the PLRA and the Magistrates Act is that when the


Magistrates Act was passed, all they had -- and that's


what this Court held in McCarthy v. Bronson, all they had


to guide them on the meaning of the term was Preiser, and


so following Preiser, of course, that's what it meant, and


that's why they used it that way in the Magistrates Act.


But after this Court decided McCarthy and


Brennan, this Court then went on to address the issue,


focus on the language, and explain this very distinction


that I'm arguing for here, and it was after this Court had


done so in three cases, one after the other, that Congress


then passed the PLRA.


QUESTION:  That's what I don't understand.  Now,


I didn't realize this.  You're conceding, I take it, that


an individual incident is a prison condition, as long as


it isn't an excessive force incident, and at that point,


although maybe there are three cases that say this -- I'll


read them -- why would anybody want to say that a single


incident refusing to feed a prisoner, a single incident

refusing to give him medical assistance, a single incident


refusing to let him take exercise in fact is a prison


condition, but a single incident of hitting him is not?


MR. WILLIAMS:  I can't speak for Congress'


intention, but I can speak for the meaning of the words as


they've been defined by the Court, and there is an obvious


distinction under this Court's cases.  That's what we're


talking about when we talk about statutory construction,


and that's why I say that this is not a grand policy case. 


This is a traditional --


QUESTION:  Well, but we're also talking about


reaching a sensible result.


MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, the sensible result is the


result that this Court has often reached in the past,


which is to say to Congress, if this is what you want to


do, do it in the way that you're supposed to do it.


QUESTION:  But it really isn't quite that clear


what Congress wanted to do as between these two views.


MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, of course, if Congress is


ambiguous, then we go back to the default position, and


the default position is, we go back to dictionary meaning,


and this Court held in McCarthy v. Bronson that if you


just look to the dictionary definition of the term, prison


conditions, you're not talking about excessive force


cases, and in McCarthy this Court said, however, we don't

use the dictionary definition because when the Magistrates


Act was passed Congress is presumed to have been looking


to Preiser, but once Congress gets mushy, as they really


are in the PLRA, because some sections use the term prison


conditions, some sections don't, and that's even true in


the title 42 amendment, so --


QUESTION:  Mr. Williams, there's a case that has


come up in various forms where violence, random violence


is what characterizes the prison system.  There was the


litigation in Alabama, where the State Attorney General


said, this, the atmosphere in this prison is jungle-like,


and this Court said it in Dosset v. Rawlinson.  Where do


you put those cases?  Those are excessive force cases, but


it's pervasive in the prison, not just one beating by a


guard.  Would those cases come outside the prison


Litigation Reform Act, even though you're talking about


the kind of conduct that pervades the entire institution?


MR. WILLIAMS:  I'm not sure that this Court has


ever told us exactly what the mens rea is that must be met


in such a case, and I think that will be the answer to the


question when that case arises.  If this Court says that


in any given pervasive violence situation, then the


necessary mens rea remains the Johnson v. Glick one, then


that's an excessive force case and it's not a prison


conditions case.

 On the other hand, if this Court says that the


necessary mens rea is simply deliberate indifference, then


it is a prison conditions case.


QUESTION:  Well, it's hard to say it's


deliberate indifference when you're beating up on someone.


MR. WILLIAMS:  If you're suing the individual


guard, of course, you're dealing with an instance of


brutality.  What I was thinking of is the more interesting


question of where the warden issues a decree.


QUESTION:  The warden knows that this is going


on.  It's not deliberate indifference, because it's a


jungle-like atmosphere.


MR. WILLIAMS:  If the warden is aware of it and


is tolerating it, then it becomes policy, and then this


Court is going to have to say, well, what's the standard


of liability for the warden?  Is it deliberate


indifference or is it the Johnson v. Glick?  I don't know. 


I don't believe this Court has told us.


QUESTION:  I would think that just the usage,


ordinary English, what the words mean, when a condition


pervades a prison, then it's a prison condition.


MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, I think that that gets off


into the single incident versus multiple incident issue,


and I prefer to think of it in terms of the mens rea, and


I can conceive that an argument might well be made, and in

fact I would be happy to make it, that where it is so


pervasive that the warden is charged with actual knowledge


of -- there's the municipal liability cases under 1983 --


that he's charged with knowledge of it, then I would say


that the Johnson v. Glick standard applies, and it's not a


prison condition, but you could make the other argument


just as well.


In any event, it's an easy line to draw so that


we will know, the district courts will know in any given


case where it falls on the line of --


QUESTION:  Why in the world would Congress --


you can give us no inkling of why Congress would sit down


and say, whether there has to be exhaustion of


administrative remedies ought to depend upon what state of


mind the actor is going to be held to?  Why is there any


conceivable connection between those two issues, and


that's what you're saying they did, that they left it up


to the future law of this Court as to what mens rea will


be required, and if on the one hand the mens rea is going


to be, you know, just deliberate indifference, then you


have to exhaust, and if it's intentional cruelty you don't


have to exhaust.


MR. WILLIAMS:  I would think that the reason for


that, if Congress had a reason, is that Congress knew that


because of the very high bar this Court has a record in

excessive force cases, combined with the fact pleading


requirement, that the concerns Congress had about


frivolous litigation and undue meddling of the district


courts in their business are already met by existing law,


and therefore the PLRA need not be concerned with it and


indeed, I think just about everybody agrees that the


concerns of Congress in enacting the PLRA was precisely


those two things, neither of which readily fits the


excessive force model. 


QUESTION:  But if you have a guard who is


sadistically beating people, certainly that seems to be


the sort of thing that might easily be corrected, at least


for the future, by exhaustion.


MR. WILLIAMS:  But that, again, is a policy


question, Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Well, it is, but when we're trying to


figure out what Congress really intended here, I think one


shies away from a distinction which is perfectly


technically sound but doesn't seem to have anything to do


with what people thinking about the desirability of


exhaustion would have thought about.


MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, when you look at the entire


PLRA, and I was a little dismayed in preparing for oral


argument to realize that the entire PLRA isn't in the


joint appendix to our briefs, but when you look at it in

its entirety, the presence or absence of that phrase,


prison conditions, is quite interesting.


For instance, in title 42, prison conditions do


not apply to the attorney fee cap.  Rather, that relates


to prisoner suits, and similarly the distinction that


there can be no monetary award for emotional distress


unless it's accompanied by physical injury, those are


prisoner suits, not prison conditions cases.


When you look further, section 807, the lien


provisions under the act, again, there's no prison


conditions limitation, so clearly Congress had in mind


that there are some kinds of suits by prisoners where it


wants to impose more stringent limitations and others


where it wants to impose some limitations but not the


whole panoply of limitations.


QUESTION:  But here the prisoner suits, it


happens to be the caption for the provision.  They use in


the text prison conditions but the caption is prison


suits, isn't it?


MR. WILLIAMS:  Yes, it is, and then in the


context of the section they go on and draw the


distinction.  Sometimes it's all prisoner suits, sometimes


it's just prisoner suits about prison conditions, so I


think we really get no place in particular from the fact


of the caption.

 QUESTION:  What would we do with a case where


the prisoner said, these guards are beating up on me, and


the reason they are is that this prison doesn't give


guards any training, doesn't supervise them, so my 1983


suit is against the guards that beat me up, but they're


also against the officials in the prison who are


responsible for training and for monitoring?  Those have


to go to --


MR. WILLIAMS:  They go two different directions


and, of course, as we know, that is common place in


prisoner's suits, that they have multiple counts, multiple


claims, and some of them are dismissed early on, some of


them go a little bit farther, and so forth.  That is the


nature of prison litigation in this particular case, the


suit against the guard for beating him up would not


require exhaustion and would go forward.  Prison


conditions claims obviously would have to be exhausted,


had they not already been exhausted.


QUESTION:  Suppose I believe that policy was


relevant, would I then be right to think that the isolated


beating case is perhaps the strongest case where you


should require exhaustion, for the reason that the prison


doesn't want such a person on its payroll, and if the


prisoner is right, they'll find out about it fast and get


rid of him

 MR. WILLIAMS:  No, actually, the difficulties of


removing a civil servant who has --


QUESTION:  Oh, but I'll take action.


MR. WILLIAMS:  When you combine all of his


Laudermill rights with all of his rights under the


collective bargaining agreement, moving that guard or


taking meaningful disciplinary action against him is not


going to be necessarily that fast.


Of course, what you can do quickly is move the


prisoner to another unit, but then you deal with what we


know to be the reality of the prison guard grapevine, so


that there's not an easy solution.


QUESTION:  You say that a prison guard who


maliciously beats up on people is just there to stay, so


to speak?


MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, one would hope not.


QUESTION:  One would.


MR. WILLIAMS:  But the fact of the matter is


that, like all public employees, they enjoy a number of


due process protections and, like most public employees,


they also enjoy union protection.


QUESTION:  Many of them are not public employees


any more.


MR. WILLIAMS:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  Many of them are not public employees

any more.  That's one reason some States have moved to


having private companies manage prisons.


MR. WILLIAMS:  I agree.  I agree.  That is true.


QUESTION:  In those cases there wouldn't be a


problem in getting rid of a guard.


MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, there's probably still a


pretty effective union contract.  The guards' union is a


pretty powerful force and, indeed, in this case that was


present.  There were the references to the fact that the


guards' union was involved in a big dispute with the


Governor of Connecticut, who happened to be a friend of


Mr. Nussle, so that that was present.


The attempt by the State to take the title 18


definition and move it over to title 42 I think is equally


unsuccessful.  The fact that it's in a different part of


the code is one reason why Congress certainly wouldn't


have attempted to adopt it.  Indeed, it's in a part of the


code, title 18, that deals with different issues from


those which Congress was dealing with in its title 42


amendments.


Most importantly, of course, it is explicitly


limited by its terms to section 802, that is, title 18,


and is not applicable elsewhere and, as this Court held in


the Vermont Agency of National Resources case, that at


least suggests that it is inapplicable to title 42.

 Also of great interest, and I think not


addressed in the briefs, is that section 803 has its own


definition section, just as section 802 does, but in the


section 803 definition the term, prison conditions, or


conditions of confinement, is not defined, but


interestingly, in section 802 and in section 803 there is


a definition of the word, prisoner.  The words aren't


precisely the same, but the words appear to have the same


meaning.


Now, why would Congress find it necessary to


define prisoner in section 803 when they'd already done so


in 802, unless it was because they took seriously the


limitation in 802, that the definitions there were limited


to section 802?


So I think that the attempt by the petitioners


to borrow the section 802 language and incorporate that


into section 803 simply won't work, and what we are left


to fall back on is the statutory construction arguments


which I have previously made.


I hate to say it, but I think I'm out of time. 


Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BLUMENTHAL


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief


Justice, and may it please the Court:


I am not completely out of ideas.  A few brief


ones:  First, to expand, perhaps, on the point raised by


Justice Breyer, I can't speak for all the State prison


systems throughout the United States, but a prison guard


who did what Mr. Nussle claimed he or they did would be


transferred, disciplined, perhaps fired by this


commissioner.  I am certain of that fact, because we have


assisted in that process.


Indeed, some of those guards have been


criminally investigated, not guards involving this


incident, but some who have committed the kinds of acts


that Mr. Nussle might complain of.  There are speedy,


effective administrative remedies that can be applied to


protect prisoners, and it is in the interests, may I


respectfully suggest, of the State to do so to eliminate


or at least reduce prison unrest, to make sure that it


isn't held liable in more serious incidents, if they are


bad guards.

 The administrators of modern prison systems have


a very powerful and compelling self-interest in using the


grievance system as a management tool.  Now, that may not


have been on Congress' mind.  Congress undoubtedly was


concerned, as the legislative history clearly shows, with


the fact that there were 40,000 of these lawsuits pending,


prisoner petitions, constituting one-quarter of the entire


Federal case load.  Congress wanted to streamline the


system and force all of these prison petitions to go


through the exhaustion process, and there is no evidence,


absolutely no evidence in the legislative history or


elsewhere it intended to carve out or make an exception


for single incident excessive force cases and, indeed, the


evidence is all to the contrary.


McCarthy v. Bronson was a single incident,


single episode of excessive force, but this Court said


that it was included in the term, conditions of


confinement, for purposes of the Magistrate Referral Act. 


That is the term that Congress understood it to be. 


Crawford-El confirms at 597, where I quoted it.  It's in


our view conclusive on this point, but we would submit


that the interests of the statute are best served,


Congress' purposes are best served.  The distinction that


is suggested by the respondents is unsupported in


principle and unworkable in practice for many of the same

reasons that this Court said in Wilson v. Seiter that the


single incident versus continuing practice distinction was


simply illogical and impractical.


If the Court has no further questions, I have


nothing further.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, General


Blumenthal.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:48 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
