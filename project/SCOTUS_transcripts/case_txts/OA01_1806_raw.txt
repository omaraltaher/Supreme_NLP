CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-1806, Lisa Madigan, Attorney General of


Illinois, versus Telemarketing Associates.


Mr. Huszagh.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD S. HUSZAGH


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. HUSZAGH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


It cannot be true that charitable solicitors are


free to commit fraud just because they are charitable


solicitors.  Under long-established common law fraud


principles, it is unquestionably fraudulent to induce


someone to make a gift of money by saying it will be used 

for a specific charitable purpose when, in fact, only a


nominal amount goes to that purpose and the solicitor


keeps the vast majority.  The First Amendment does not --


QUESTION:  What about --


MR. HUSZAGH:  -- displace these principles.


QUESTION:  What about 25 percent going to the


charitable purpose?


MR. HUSZAGH:  25 percent may or may not be a


misrepresentation, depending upon what the public was told


about the ultimate purpose of --

 QUESTION:  The public's told, you know, I'm --


I'm soliciting for X charity, would you -- would you give


money, please, for X charity --


MR. HUSZAGH:  If the public --


QUESTION:  -- to help children in Cambodia.


MR. HUSZAGH:  Well --


QUESTION:  25 percent of the money actually goes


to that purpose, 25 percent.


MR. HUSZAGH:  If the public reasonably


understands that significantly more than that amount goes


to that purpose --


QUESTION:  I -- I --


MR. HUSZAGH:  -- then it would be a


misrepresentation to rely upon --


QUESTION:  What do we --


MR. HUSZAGH:  -- that assumption --


QUESTION:  -- public opinion poll as to whether


the public reasonably understood it was going to be more


than 25 percent?


MR. HUSZAGH:  Assumptions form a fundamental


part of human communication, assumptions about the meaning


of language, assumptions -- assumptions about events and


conditions.  If somebody were to say that they were


soliciting money to -- for -- for the family of people who


died on September 11, and the people they were referring

to were their parents who died of natural causes in


Topeka, Kansas, on September 11 of 1995, that's a


misrepresentation, because people are entitled to make a


reasonable --


QUESTION:  Sure.


MR. HUSZAGH:  -- assumption about what that


language means.


QUESTION:  That was misleading, but it is not


misleading to say, I'm going to -- this money is going to


go to this charitable cause when, in fact, you acknowledge


many charities have to pay substantial amounts,


substantial percentages in order to, in order to get


organizations to solicit for them, and who -- who is to


say that the 25 percent is too much.  I've no idea whether


it is.


MR. HUSZAGH:  I think that --


QUESTION:  You're just going to give that to a


jury and leave the fundraising to be liable criminally or


not, depending upon whether this jury thinks that


25 percent is too little to go, or -- I -- I just -- I'm


not comfortable with that at all.


MR. HUSZAGH:  I -- I think the Court needs to


distinguish between two different types of circumstances. 


One is the fact that there may be legitimate reasons why a


charity could have expenses above a certain level.  It

could be that they're an unpopular charity.  It could be


that it's a charity that's small, or has recently started


up, but those are the types of reasons that the Court used


to invalidate laws that declared expenses above a certain


threshold to -- to establish that the charity was a sham


entirely.  Those don't negate --


QUESTION:  It would still be a misrepresentation


even if they had good reasons for -- for giving the


fundraiser 90 percent of the money.


MR. HUSZAGH:  And --


QUESTION:  It would still be a


misrepresentation, wouldn't it?


MR. HUSZAGH:  And that's my point, that the


First Amendment should not displace that principle where


misrepresentations are determined based upon whether the 

defendant made a material misrepresentation of fact, and


it's -- i is no different from --


QUESTION:  Well, would this prosecution have


been brought if the fee, if the amount given to the


charity had been more substantial?


MR. HUSZAGH:  There's a substantial likelihood,


or there's less likelihood that such a prosecution would


bought, been brought, because --


QUESTION:  How would anyone know when the


Attorney General would be likely to charge them?

 MR. HUSZAGH:  I think really the ultimate


question is not whether they're going to know whether the


Attorney General is going to bring the case, but whether


they've committed fraud.  Ultimately, the Attorney General


is not going to prosecute every case of fraud that exists,


and --


QUESTION:  Is -- is there an intent requirement,


an intent to defraud requirement under the Illinois law?


MR. HUSZAGH:  As to what we've alleged for


common law fraud, yes, there is, and we've made that


allegation as -- with respect to all of the statutory


antifraud counts as well, and to the extent that there is


a concern about the uncertainty as to whether a specific


statement may be a misrepresentation, depending upon the


inability to predict exactly what the public may know, 

then certainly there's no such objection if the defendant,


it can be proved knew that they were creating a false


impression.


QUESTION:  But one of your affidavits says that


one of the solicitees expressly asked and was told that


90 percent or more goes to the vets.  Now, certainly


that's a classic misrepresentation, is it not?


MR. HUSZAGH:  Yes, it is, but our position goes


further, which is that there is no constitutional value in


intentional half-truths or artificial, contrived ways of

stating something that may be literally true --


QUESTION:  No, but the concern that we have is


that there's no -- there is no way to predict in advance


what is going to be treated or what is going to be found


as the half-truth.


Let me put the question to you this way.  Leave


to the side the moment the particular cases that in --


that you include among -- among those you have brought in


which at least the allegation is that a very specific


misrepresentation was made, no labor cost, 90 percent goes


to the -- to the -- the objects of the charity.  Put them


aside, and consider only the cases in which no


representation is made beyond the fact that we are


collecting money for this charity, and no representation


is made about the amount of money that's going to go for 

overhead and the amount that's actually going to get to


the charitable donees.


I don't see where any charitable fundraiser


could in advance draw a line and say, I don't have to


disclose anything under risk of being prosecuted.  I would


suppose that any charitable fundraiser, if you win this


case, would say, there's only one way I can cover myself,


and that is to disclose the percentages when I make the --


the solicitation.  Otherwise, I'm vulnerable to a


prosecution.  If that is the way the charitable

fundraisers are going to be forced to operate, then, in


fact, we have totally undercut the precedent that says you


can't require that disclosure, so my question is, how can


we, how could we sanction a system on your theory that


would be fair, without, in practical terms, whether we say


it or not, requiring the very disclosure that we have said


previously need not be required?


MR. HUSZAGH:  I would agree that if that were


the conclusion as to what would occur in -- in -- if the


law that we advocate were permitted, then the Court would


effectively be forced to reevaluate the validity of its


precedents, and we are not --


QUESTION:  And maybe we should.  I'm not saying


one way or the other there, but --


MR. HUSZAGH: 


But in this case we are not urging 

the Court to do so, but it is our -- our premise that


the -- that that conclusion does not necessarily follow,


and it has not been established in this case.


Ultimately, these speakers know how much is


going to be used for various purposes, or they certainly


have the ability to know that, and they are the masters of


their own speech, and to suggest that they have no ability


to know what the public is going to believe, or be led to


believe when they make specific representations about


seeking money for charity I think is somewhat unrealistic.

 QUESTION:  Okay, let's assume that it's


unrealistic in this particular case. 85/15, okay, let's


assume you win.  65/35, 60/40, 55/45 -- it's those cases


that we've got to worry about.


MR. HUSZAGH:  But I think that the -- the


question then becomes whether the Court should displace


common law fraud principles, which already provide a


measure of breathing room for that type of uncertainty. 


Ultimately --


QUESTION:  I suppose the breathing room is that


there has to be a false statement, a misrepresentation,


let's assume with knowledge of its falsity, which is


relied upon by the -- by the listener, that there's


some -- has to be damage and so forth.  Is that what


you -- what do you tell the jury, what a reasonable person 

would believe?


MR. HUSZAGH:  No.  It is important for the jury


to decide what, in fact, the donating public did believe


as to how much was going to be used for the purposes


described, that this is not some normative imposition by


the Government as to what's reasonable.  This is an


adjudicatory process to determine what the understanding


of the public was, and ultimately --


QUESTION:  What would the instruction, though,


to the jury be under the Illinois law?  What must the

State prove here?


MR. HUSZAGH:  The State would have to prove that


there were a material misrepresentation of fact, leaving


aside for a moment the intent requirement.  The material


misrepresentation of fact includes three elements which


provide the defendant with a breathing space for some of


the uncertainties that the Court seems to be sensitive to. 


First, the assertion must be factual, not some type of


representation like, this charity is a humdinger that


can't be disproved in a court of law.


The interpretation, the meaning to that statement has


to be a reasonable one, which is an objective requirement


subject to supervision by the courts, so if somebody


believed that 150 percent of every donation was going to


go to charity, that is objectively unreasonable, and the 

Court would eliminate that.


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what you say would be


very impressive and would eliminate my problems if you


were willing to go further and say, whenever you say, I'm


raising money for Vietnamese orphans, oh, 100 percent of


the money you collect is understood by the public to be


going to Vietnamese orphans, but you're not willing to say


that.


MR. HUSZAGH:  No, because that's not reasonable. 


It's not reasonable --

 QUESTION:  Because that's not reasonable.


MR. HUSZAGH:  It's not reasonable for the public


to assume --


QUESTION:  25 percent.


MR. HUSZAGH:  The -- there is no --


QUESTION:  So -- so the --


QUESTION:  So it has a reasonable understanding.


QUESTION:  -- what does -- what does the judge


instruct the jury?  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if


you think it's reasonable to send -- or -- or what?  No,


no, it wouldn't be whether it's reasonable.  It's what you


think the average person would have thought, right?


MR. HUSZAGH:  It's what the Government proves


that the donating public understood based upon what they


were told, what they were reasonably led to believe.  That


may include their background assumptions about how much


normally goes to fundraising costs or other administrative


overhead, and that can depend upon the nature of the


charity, as well as the statements made by the defendants.


The other elements, to finish my answer to


Justice O'Connor's and Justice Kennedy's questions, is


that there is in addition a materiality requirement.  It


is not enough that the statement be technically false,


like a difference between 95 percent and 93 percent.  The


difference has to be material, and that again provides

that certain falsity will go unprohibited because the


materiality requirement already gives a buffer zone.


QUESTION:  Look at all -- think of all of the --


of the green, dark green briefs.  Those briefs are filled


with examples of instances where the telemarketer kept a


large, maybe 90, maybe 100 percent, which seem perfectly


legitimate.  For example, it's a start-up campaign, and at


the beginning they have to keep up more, keep more.  For


example, it's an educational campaign, and what the


charity thinks is, we want to spend this money so people


will have heard our name, or will examine themselves for


possible breast cancer, or whatever.


Or, it could even be the Nature Conservancy,


where for accounting reasons the money that's going to


purchase land is not treated as if it were an expense on 

behalf of the charity, so they're filled with examples.


MR. HUSZAGH:  Well --


Now, suppose in your case the defendant proved


that he was within one of those examples.  Would you then


say, if the jury believes that, that you should win, or


the defendant, and the reason I ask is that I think most


people feel, and the relevance of your case is that the


money is going to help the charity, indeed, most of it,


and what they will have shown is that the money did go to


help the charity, but in this instance, helping the

charity was consistent with the telemarketer keeping a


very large percentage, so could you explain how, in your


view, the law works with all those examples in the dark


green briefs?


MR. HUSZAGH:  I -- I think there are two basic


answers to your question, Justice Breyer, and one is that


the reasonableness of the manner in which the expenditures


are made is not a proper subject of the Government's


paternalistic bureaucratic oversight to second-guess that


judgment, and I think the Court made that clear both in


Munson and more specifically in Riley, and we are not


arguing that the -- whether the -- the plaintiff's fraud


claim for actual specific misrepresentations turns -- they


will win or lose, depending upon whether there is some


reasonableness element to the manner of the


expenditures --


QUESTION:  No, well, if you're saying that they


lose, the telemarketer, even if all the money is being


used to help the charity, then I agree with the thrust of


the questions that have gone before.


MR. HUSZAGH:  Well --


QUESTION:  I don't see how you can possibly


prosecute people for fraud where there is no fraud --


MR. HUSZAGH:  But that leads to --


QUESTION:  -- and -- and that would seem to me a

case where there is no fraud.


MR. HUSZAGH:  That leads to the second point


that I was going to make.


QUESTION:  And it's a charity, too, so there's a


First Amendment right.


MR. HUSZAGH:  And I don't dispute that, but --


QUESTION:  Why -- why is there no fraud, just


because the charge is reasonable?  Fraud exists if you


have represented to the public something, whether the


something you've represented is reasonable or unreasonable


or not.  If the public is unaware that 95 percent is a


perfectly reasonable charge for this kind of fundraising,


and the public therefore believes, given what you've said,


I'm raising money for Vietnamese orphans, that at least


50 percent of that is going to go to Vietnam, then it 

seems to me you have a fraud case.


MR. HUSZAGH:  That is my answer to the second


part of Justice Breyer's question.


QUESTION:  All right.  In other words, you


intend to convict people -- you intend to convict them,


and this may be one of them.  You intend to convict the


Nature Conservancy because 98 percent of its revenue is --


is accounted for as -- as telemarketing expense, where in


reality, they're buying land with that.


MR. HUSZAGH:  No, I --

 QUESTION:  Or you intend to convict the -- the


organization that is simply trying to inform women about


the importance of self-examination for cancer.  Is that


the answer?


MR. HUSZAGH:  No, it is not.


QUESTION:  Okay, then -- then why don't you


elaborate on your answer.


MR. HUSZAGH:  Let me deal with the Nature


Conservancy first.  I think that's an example in which the


public who gives money to the Nature Conservancy


understands realistically that their money is going to be


used for the purpose of buying land, and to suggest in


some artificial sense by a prosecutor that no, really they


thought it was going to be used in an accounting format to


be treated as -- as an expense as opposed to a capital 

acquisition establishes fraud is -- is simply unrealistic.


The other example again focuses upon the


specific nature of the representation made, and there --


there is a wide variety of differences, but if the


representation is made that the money is going to be used


to feed hungry orphans in Vietnam, it does not somehow


become, per se, nonfraudulent if, in fact, those funds are


being used to -- to get out the word about the plight of


Vietnam veterans, which is different, and materially


different from what the representation was to the donors.

I think that is our basic --


QUESTION:  Counsel, let me ask you this.  Is --


is the State taking the position that there is a material


misrepresentation of fact here because the amount given to


the charity was a trifling amount?


MR. HUSZAGH:  It -- yes, because it was a


trifling amount --


QUESTION:  Is that -- is that how you bill the


material misrepresentation?


MR. HUSZAGH:  Well, materiality doesn't always


have to rise to the level that there will only be a


trifling amount that would go to the charity, but there


was a significant --


QUESTION:  But in this case?


MR. HUSZAGH:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And your -- the respondent's brief


says, well, the Governor had a charity ball, and just


17 percent --


MR. HUSZAGH:  Well, I -- I don't --


QUESTION:  -- was kept and no prosecution.


MR. HUSZAGH:  I'd rather not use my time to try


and explain the misleading --


QUESTION:  Uh-huh.


MR. HUSZAGH:  -- impression given by that


example.

 Let me just say that the facts of that case are


dramatically different than were represented, and the --


the argument that there has been any impermissible


selective prosecution in this case based upon some type of


discriminatory element that would violate the Equal


Protection Clause, there's nothing in the record to that. 


If there were such a case, the Court has said that there


is a reserved ability to do so.  What I would --


QUESTION:  Do you want to reserve the balance of


my time, Mr. Huszagh?


MR. HUSZAGH:  Yes, I would.  Thank you,


Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the


Government's authority to protect the public from fraud,


even though virtually every representation involves


speech.


Indeed, while striking down broad prophylactic


laws, every time this Court has addressed the issue of


charitable solicitation, it has reaffirmed the

constitutional viability of individual fraud actions.


Now, part of the reason that this Court has


distinguished between individual fraud actions and broad


prophylactic rules is that an individual fraud action can


bring into bear the entire context of a misrepresentation. 


The difficulty with a statute like that before the Court


in Riley was that it necessarily focused on a single


factor, fundraising costs, and didn't take into account


what was told to individual donors or anything else, and


then categorically --


QUESTION:  But isn't that essentially,


Mr. Clement, what is happening here?  That is, these


are -- to the extent that these are telephone calls, and


say, like you to contribute to Vietnam, and this money's


going to be spent on veterans, and that's the extent of 

it, it seems that the Illinois Attorney General is


measuring the decision whether to bring a fraud claim by


the percent that goes to the charity in comparison to


this -- this portion that goes to the fundraiser.


MR. CLEMENT:  I think that the fundraising costs


are part of the analysis of the fraud action, but I


wouldn't have read Riley as making that factor wholly


immaterial, and I think the important thing is that in the


calls in this case, they weren't just saying, we're here


to raise money for Vietnam vets.  The record suggests that

there was an emphasis on particular charitable services. 


We're raising money for food baskets.  We're raising money


to help veterans here in DuPage County.


QUESTION:  Well, that's fine.  I mean, those


specific misrepresentations that turned out to be false,


and some of them said 90 percent is going to go there,


those are no problems.  The ones we're concerned with are


the -- the fraud allegations that are sustained simply on


the basis of the fact this money is going to go to this


cause and, in fact, only 15 percent of it is going to that


cause.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, two responses, Your Honor. 


First of all, since there are these specific


misrepresentations in this case, that alone is a reason to


reverse the decision, because the Illinois Supreme Court 

seemed to be laboring under the misimpression that those


cases were wholly off-limits because the fundraising


percentage --


QUESTION:  We do have to write an opinion


though, you know.


MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. CLEMENT:  So let me bring you to the second


part of the question, which is, I think there are problems


when you have a situation where the only thing that is

said is, we're here to raise money for charity, but I


think in reality, you have to give -- you have to trust


juries in common law fraud actions a little bit to take


into account the broad nature of the representations that


are made.  The -- the virtue of a fraud action as opposed


to a broad prophylactic rule is that a fraud action can


take into account the entire mosaic of the representations


that are made, and there's no need to focus on one


particular tile and see whether it's literally true or


literally false.


QUESTION:  Would you be able to show to the jury


how reasonable it is for this particular fundraiser to --


to retain 85 percent?


MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I think so.


QUESTION:  Why?


MR. CLEMENT:  If every --


QUESTION:  Why?  What does that have to do with


what the effect of the representation was upon the public?


MR. CLEMENT:  Because there are other elements


of a common law fraud action.  You also have to show


materiality, and reasonable reliance.  If every single


person raised --


QUESTION:  How does that go to materiality? 


How does it go to reasonable reliance?


MR. CLEMENT:  Because if every single person

raising money has had these astronomical fundraising


costs, which of course is not true, but if that were true,


then a -- an individual donor who recognized that might


well not have any reasonable reliance on the


representations that money is going to charity, because


no -- no charity, apparently, can get any money to the


actual services that money is being raised, but that's not


true.


A very important element of common law fraud


that I think can provide sufficient protection to


legitimate charities is the intent to deceive, and the


intent to deceive I think is going to make a big


difference, because if you have a legitimate charity


that's asked by a donor what percentage of the money goes


to the specific service that you're raising money for, 

let's say, food baskets, and that charity responds and


provides forthcoming information, then I don't see how the


prosecution or plaintiff can ever show an intent to


deceive.


On the other hand --


QUESTION:  Okay, but let's take -- let's take


the cases, leaving aside the specific misrepresentations


here, let's take the case that we've got.  15 percent is


going.  I take it you believe that on the basis of that,


a -- a jury could infer that there was an intent to

deceive, from the silence?


MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I think that's right, but


I -- I would say --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. CLEMENT:  -- that part of the evidence I'd


like to put before the jury on intent to deceive --


QUESTION:  May I ask --

question --

QUESTION:  I thought it was a proceeding in --


before -- in Chancery in this case.


MR. CLEMENT:  I'm reliably informed that this


particular proceeding would go as a bench trial, which I


think would provide even further protection for free


speech.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. CLEMENT:  I think that -- my answer is in


terms of the jury because I do think that the -- the


decision that this Court announces is going to affect jury

trials as well, but what I'm saying is, I'd like to get


before the jury the fact that when these particular


fundraisers were asked the question, well, where does the


money go, at least the record suggests that they flatly


misrepresented where the money --


QUESTION:  You -- you bet, and that's -- that's


what you've got in this case, but as Justice Scalia said,


we've got to write the opinion, and -- and if we consider


the case in which there were not these quite specific


misrepresentations, all you've got is silence about the


percentage, and a statement that the object of the charity


is Vietnamese orphans or whatever it may be, it seems to


me that when you start getting below the 85/25, you get


into an area in which the -- the result is a dice throw,


and if that is the case, the only way the charitable 

fundraiser can protect himself, with the greatest good


faith in the world, is to disclose the percentage, and if


that's what we are going to require in fact, then we


better face the fact that we're going to have to retreat


from -- from what we've already held.


What's your answer to that?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I would say first that we


wouldn't have any objection if you wanted to retreat from


what you said in Riley.

QUESTION:  But isn't that what -- that's what

MR. CLEMENT:  No, that is not what you have to


do, and I think the important thing is the type of hypo of


just all they do is call up and say, I'm here to raise


money for charity, what that hypothetical tends to do is


force the analysis into the single variable analysis


that's reflected in broad prophylactic rules, and the


answer in these cases, and I think what the opinion should


suggest, is that the context does matter terribly, so to


take some of the questions --


QUESTION:  Okay --


MR. CLEMENT: 


-- that concern Justice Breyer, if 

I could, when he's worried about the start-up charity,


well, if a start-up charity says, hi, we're a start-up


charity, but we are trying to raise money for a new cause,


and here's what we hope to do with the money, that's very


different than if a start-up charity picks up the phone


and says, we're a start-up charity, and we're going -- if


you give us money, we're going to help this particular


child in this foreign country.


I mean, if a start-up charity avoids fraudulent


statements, then that's going to have a reasonable effect

on the mind of the donor, and the donor's going to


recognize that, okay, a) start-up charities may have


higher cost, but more importantly, the representation that


I received was not that you were going to provide food


baskets in DuPage County, but that you hoped to provide


special services that weren't being provided currently by


any extant charity, and I think that context can make all


the difference.


And there are many elements of common law fraud


actions.  You have to show knowledge of falsity, intent to


deceive, materiality, and reasonable reliance.  In


Illinois, as is typical, you have to show those factors by


clear and convincing evidence.  All of that is going to


provide substantial breathing room for First Amendment


values.


Indeed, much of this Court's jurisprudence in


the libel and defamation area has been a process of taking


the requirements of the common law for fraud, which were


much more onerous, and superimposing them on the law of


libel and defamation, where things like falsity was


presumed, and damages could be presumed, upon a showing of


defamation, and I think if you put it in that context,


that all of the safeguards that this Court has carefully


constructed over the years in the libel and defamation


context are in place to protect the -- the First Amendment

rights and provide breathing room, then I think that the


idea that the sky is falling is really mistaken in these


cases.


And I think to the contrary, if this Court were


to suggest in a case where the reality is that not just


85 percent is going to the professional fundraiser, but


fully 97 percent is going to something other than program


services, because VietNow only spends 20 percent of the


money they receive on program services, if this were --


Court were to suggest in this case that there's not a


fraud action, then it really will be open season for


charitable solicitation fraud.


And I think this Court has been particularly


concerned about broad prophylactic rules in the First


Amendment area. 


This is reflected in -- in, most 

critically in its prior restraint doctrine, and that --


that instinct is reflected in Schaumburg, Munson, and


Riley, but at the same time, there's a corollary


principle, which specific instances of fraud can be


prosecuted by the Government, and that instinct is also


reflected in Munson, Schaumburg, and Riley, and there's


simply nothing in the First Amendment that suggests that


charitable solicitation fraud need go unpunished, and with


respect, I think what the Illinois Supreme Court did here


in creating a broad prophylactic immunity for charitable

solicitation from the law of fraud is just as unjustified


as the broad prophylactic rules limiting charitable


solicitation that this Court struck down in Schaumburg,


Munson, and Riley.


If there are no further questions --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Clement.


Mr. Copilevitz, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. ERROL COPILEVITZ


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, members of


the Court:


What charities spend or pay for fundraising,


whether based upon a percentage or otherwise, are a


measure of the charity's judgment about how much to invest


in persuasion, a fully protected activity and it cannot be 

second-guessed.  The First Amendment guarantees the right


of unpopular organizations to zealously pursue their


causes.


The petitioner comes to this Court having pled


one case, but having argued another case.  The


petitioner's denial of any intent to impose a cost


limitation on charitable appeals, and the petitioner's


claim that its only purpose is to combat fraud, is simply


not supported in this record.  What is clear is that the


petitioner's claim is focused exclusively on the amount of

the respondents' fee.


QUESTION:  Well now, I don't read the record


quite that way, Mr. Copilevitz.  The affidavit that I


mentioned earlier on page 169, where the -- the woman said


that she specifically asked the question and was told


90 percent or more goes to the vets, that strikes me as a


straight common law fraud action.  Are you saying that


that -- that the State is prohibited by the First


Amendment from prosecuting that case?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  No, I'm not, Your Honor.  What


I'm saying is that if that violation had been pled in this


case, we would have a different result at the Illinois


Supreme Court.  Paragraph 74, at page 104 of the appendix,


is the paragraph that incorporates these affidavits, and


the allegation is simply that if the fee of the fundraiser 

had been disclosed, they would not have made


contributions.


The Illinois Supreme Court specifically found,


as did the Illinois appellate court and the trial court,


that there were no affirmative misstatements made.  In


order for the petitioner's case to be sustained, it has to


have two legs.  We know that cost alone is not an


indication of fraud, so it has to have some other positive


statement.


QUESTION:  Well, what if --

 QUESTION:  Why -- why is it that if -- if we


assume that the donors would not have given the money had


this statement been made, that that is not a large part of


showing a misrepresentation, I mean, I assume people


wouldn't buy automobiles or toasters if they knew that the


manufacturer was getting 95 percent of -- of the cost and


there was -- only 5 percent went into raw materials, so


there's always some problems here, but let's suppose that


95 percent, 100 percent of the donors would not have given


the money if they had known the facts.  Isn't that the


beginnings, at least, of a misrepresentation?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Well, you're dealing with the


lesser of two evils.  High undisclosed fundraising costs


are a lesser evil than compelling a point of solicitation


disclosure of information that is inaccurate, that this 

Court has held is not material, and risk creating for


smaller --


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't it material if -- if


the money would not have been given had the -- had the


fact been disclosed?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  The percentage doesn't --


QUESTION:  That doesn't -- isn't that another


way of saying the person is acting under a misimpression?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  No, because the whole concept


is built on the only return the nonprofit received is the

net dollars, and as this Court recognized in Riley, there


is a wide range of values that the organization receives


from the appeal itself.


QUESTION:  Mr. Copilevitz, it seems to me you


have to respond to Justice Kennedy, no, that it doesn't


constitute fraud simply to refuse to tell somebody


something which, if he knew, he would not have made the


contribution.  I mean, perhaps someone would not have made


the contribution if they knew what an inefficient charity


this particular charity was, or knew that, you know, for


the past several years there had been a lot of


organizational problems.  Does the person have to come out


with all this upon pain of being guilty of fraud?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  No.


QUESTION: 


Certainly you don't have to tell 

someone everything which, if he knew, would make a


difference.  That doesn't constitute fraud.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  I agree.


QUESTION:  But if you ask a question and you


give a false answer, the two examples were given -- I was


struck by another -- one of the affidavits' comments. 


This is the one at joint appendix 1 -- 182.  The receipt


says it's tax deductible, and now the donor asks, on being


told that only 20 percent went to the charity, is it?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Is it tax deductible?  Yes.

 QUESTION:  Is the 100 percent tax deductible


when 80 percent goes to the fundraiser?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  That presume -- the answer to


your question is yes.  The organization receives a benefit


beyond the net dollars.  The purpose of the organization,


and if you look at the appendix, Article 5 of the articles


of incorporation at joint appendix 16 says that one of the


primary purposes of this organization is to increase the


community awareness of the problems faced by Vietnam


veterans.  The contract that my client had with the


Vietnam veterans incorporated a part of that.  It


incorporated a magazine.  It incorporated an 800 number. 


It incorporated distributing information.


The difference between the 15 cents on the


dollar that was received and the fee is value that this 

organization received, so certainly the entire amount of


any contribution is tax deductible, and it's not fair or


proper to say that the organization received no benefit


other than the dollars.


QUESTION:  May I ask a question that's not


entirely hypothetical?  Suppose Congress, trying to get a


handle on fundraising operations that are really operating


to line the pockets of the fundraiser, rather than for the


benefit of the charity, would say, if more than 40 percent


of what is collected goes to the fundraiser, then the


32

donor will get a tax deduction only for the amount that


actually goes to the charity.


In other words, taking your theory, up to


40 percent, but saying if the fundraiser gets more than


40 percent, then the donor will not get a deduction for


everything the donor gave, but only for the part that went


to the charity, would that be -- would that violate the


First Amendment?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Yes.  An organization like


Mothers Against Drunk Driving exists to advocate a change


of attitude.  They could well enter into a contract that


says, every cent you raise I am giving to you to call that


many more people in order to -- to deliver our message, in


which case they would have 100 percent cost of fundraising


under the approach of the petitioner in this case, and 

they would be justified, and your gifts to that


organization would be fully deductible, as they should be,


and they have the First Amendment right to spend what they


believe --


QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm sorry, I don't -- that may


be the purpose of the organization, so that's for the


charitable purpose, to spread the word about drunk


driving, but the example that I gave you is, the


fundraiser says, you're not a very appealing charity.  If


you want us to raise money for you, we're going to charge

a great deal, and you get -- you'll get something, where


if you were doing it on your own, you'd get nothing.  In


that kind of case, not the example of MADD, where the word


about drunk driving is being spread, but just, the


economics of it is that the fundraiser takes 80 percent.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  You presume that the contract


is made at arm's length in the marketplace.  Unpopular


charities have the same right to have their message


circulated as does a popular organization.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I presume that just as


some charities pay too much for fundraisers, some of them


may pay too much for their corporate offices.  They may


enter into exorbitant leases that they could have gotten


for half of that had they been better negotiators.  Surely


we wouldn't reduce the tax deduction because some of those 

expenses were unreasonable.  It seems to me that's simply


the way the tax deduction works.  If it's an expense of


the charity, it's an expense of the charity.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  And the charity may have all


manners of expense that may be relevant to one donor but


not be relevant to another.


QUESTION:  Mr. Copilevitz, a moment ago you said


that in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois there


was a statement that the defendants had made no


affirmative representation.  I had not read the opinion

that way.  Could you either locate it during your


argument, or if you can't, file a statement afterwards


telling us on what page of the petition for writ of


certiorari that -- that statement appears?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  It appears in page 348 of the


opinion, and I quote:  Further, VietNow has never


expressed dissatisfaction with the fundraising services


provided by the defendants, and there is no allegation


that defendants made affirmative misstatements to


potential donors.


QUESTION:  What about the allegation in


paragraph 63, from 1987 through the present, in conducting


their charitable solicitations, the donors made


representations which induced the donors to contribute


funds for charitable purposes by representing that the 

funds they contributed would go to charitable purposes. 


Now, that doesn't say what the particular representations


were, but they had a lot of affidavits attached which did.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  But the affidavits were


inherently  unreliable.  They're -- the --


QUESTION:  No, no, I'm saying, in terms of


whether there is an allegation in the complaint.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  It's not -- those -- those


affidavits are incorporated for the sole purpose of


demonstrating that there was not a disclosure of the fee

paid.  If those affidavits were true and correct, each one


of them would have supported an independent action in


violation of a specific statute in the Illinois Charitable


Association Act --


QUESTION:  I'm not understanding.


QUESTION:  No.


QUESTION:  I thought that the question is simply


whether they've alleged that there were specific


affirmative representations, and the status, I gather from


the SG's brief and what I've just read, is that they


allege there were representations, and then they attached


affidavits which have in them, and there's a footnote in


the SG's brief that list the affidavits, statements as to


particular affirmative representations, and -- and


therefore, I want to know is that, if that issue isn't in 

the case, fine, but -- but I'm somewhat puzzled as to why


it isn't.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  It's not in the case.  There


are no allegations -- those would have constituted


violations of specific sections of the statute.


QUESTION:  But --


MR. COPILEVITZ:  There was no allegation in the


complaint.  The only place they're found are in the


affidavits which are incorporated as a reference that the


fee was not disclosed and, had it been, they would not

have given it.


QUESTION:  Yes, but the --


MR. COPILEVITZ:  That's the sole purpose of it.


QUESTION:  The Supreme Court of Illinois didn't


go off on the ground that there was a separate statute


regulating solicitation, and that therefore you couldn't


have a common law fraud action in Illinois.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  I'm not sure I understand the


Chief Justice's question.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I thought you were


suggesting that these allegations would have been a -- a


violation of a specific statute governing fraud, governing


charitable solicitation, but the Supreme Court of Illinois


didn't say that because there's a statute governing


solicitation you could not bring a common law fraud action 

in this case.  What they said was that the First Amendment


prohibits you from doing it, as I understood their


opinion.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Yes, sir.  What they said is


that the only allegation was that the fees were excessive


and they weren't disclosed, that there was no allegation


of any affirmative misrepresentation.  They did not say


that an action couldn't be brought for fraud if there was


an affirmative misrepresentation.

 QUESTION:  But I took the --


QUESTION:  This is -- this case -- something you


said I thought was not quite right.  This case went off on


a motion to dismiss, so there was no trial.  There was no


findings of anything and, given the liberality of


complaint amendments, even if you're right that they


didn't make those allegations, they surely could, so one


thing is to say, I thought your position was, no matter


what they said in the complaint, this kind of operation


must be allowed to go on, not simply that they -- they --


there's a defect in pleadings here, but no claim could be


stated, not that these -- these pleadings didn't state a


claim.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Well, maybe I'm not clear,


then. 


What I am saying, that high fund-raising costs 

alone, and the failure to disclose those costs, consistent


with Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, are not an indication


of fraud in and of themselves.  The State needed two legs


to stand on.


They might have had the high fundraising costs,


but they needed some form of misrepresentation connected


with the use of the money, and what the Illinois Supreme


Court found, what the appellate court found, and what the


trial court found on the motion to dismiss, that the


second leg did not exist, and therefore, the claim could

not stand, because to do so would have been contrary to


this Court's holdings --


QUESTION:  And --


QUESTION:  Well, why wouldn't --


QUESTION:  And supporting your, what you're


saying, the question presented gives us the naked question


if the 85 percent is enough.  There -- there's nothing in


the question presented that talks about these fringe


issues.  You're -- you're dead right on that.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Well, why can't -- why -- why isn't


it appropriate for us to say that the affidavits can


function for First Amendment purposes like a bill of


particulars, and that the Illinois Supreme Court ought to


consider that, and if, under Illinois practice, they could 

function as a bill of particulars, then there's nothing in


our First Amendment jurisprudence that prohibits the


prosecution.


That leaves open the broader question, but in


this particular case, why wouldn't that at least be an


appropriate response for this Court to make with respect


to the affidavits?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Those violations of the statute


are certainly subject to prosecution.  That's not the case


that was brought by the State of Illinois.  They amended

the complaint two times.


QUESTION:  No, I realize that that's not the way


it was originally brought.  All I'm saying is, isn't it


appropriate for us to say, if -- if we otherwise believe


it, that the affidavits can function consistently with the


First Amendment, consistently with our First Amendment


cases as a bill of particulars --


MR. COPILEVITZ:  The --


QUESTION:  -- and -- and when you get to that


particular level, it's okay to prosecute?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  The Illinois Supreme Court


found as a matter of law that those affidavits were not


part of the complaint, and this Court certainly has the


authority to --


QUESTION: 


So just as a matter of State 

procedure you can't do that, is what you're saying.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  That's what the Illinois


Supreme Court found --


QUESTION:  I -- I see.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  -- as a matter of law.


QUESTION:  And they said that in this opinion,


too?

 QUESTION:  It's all there, isn't it?


QUESTION:  Give me the citation in the


petition -- the petition for writ of certiorari.  If you


can't find it now, file it with -- file it with the Clerk


later.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  Could I ask you, taking it just as


you want to present it, fine, and I think -- I'm -- I'm


convinced that there are a lot of instances in which


somebody keeping 85 percent of the money would be


perfectly consistent with a charitable purpose, but there


may also be quite a lot of instances where keeping


85 percent of the money serves no charitable purpose, and


really, it isn't much of a charity, and there the public


is deceived.


Now, is there anything wrong with prosecuting


that kind of charity, and if it turns out to be the first


instead of the second, you could raise the claim later,


after the prosecution, or during the trial, that we don't


know what'll happen in such a circumstance?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Well, my reservation in


answering the question yes is, again, you are focused


simply on the value of the net dollars that are received.


QUESTION:  That -- that's correct.  That's


exactly my question.  I understand that there are

circumstances where that fact, that virtually all the


money goes to the telemarketer and little to the charity,


is absolutely justified in terms of charitable purpose,


but my question, which I'm repeating, is, there may be


many, many, many instances where it isn't, and so what's


wrong with prosecuting those people for fraud?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Well, I would -- I would refer


to the decision of Judge Posner in the UCC case, where we


had virtually that very set of facts, and the Solicitor


for the Internal Revenue Service proposed that, in dealing


with how would we know, the notice issue and the standard,


is there would be a case-by-case analysis, and it would


evolve, and Judge Posner, I believe correctly determined


that that's no standard at all, and if there's no


standard, we're back to the lesser evil.


QUESTION:  Oh, no, there's a perfectly good


standard, that if you're going to keep 85 percent of the


money, you better have documents showing that you're doing


it for a good, charitable reason, that's all, and the


people who will be prosecuted are the people that can't


show that.  Now --


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Well --


QUESTION:  Now, I'm not saying that's a


constitutional standard.  I'm not saying it's a State law


standard.  I don't know what standard it would be.  I want

MR. COPILEVITZ:  I don't believe that you can


measure the worth of an organization based upon its


financial efficiency.


QUESTION:  Would -- would you say that the State


of Illinois or any State could require charities every 6


months to report the percentage of money going to


telemarketers and the percentage going to the ultimate


beneficiaries in -- in direct payments and file this every


6 months?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Yes, sir, and there are some


States that do require that.


QUESTION:  I assume that the State Attorney


General or the State Secretary of State can, indeed, close


down charities which are being used as -- as private 

money-making ventures.  Aren't -- aren't -- isn't


that possible?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  There is statutory -- yes, Your


Honor, there's statutory authority --


QUESTION:  Not -- not through a fraud action,


but through investigating the books of the charity.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Yes, sir, and under section --

is the difference between good charities and bad charities


doesn't seem to me to have a particle to do with the

question of whether the State was a -- was a


misrepresentation or not.  You can get 85 percent from a


good charity, and 85 percent from a bad charity and keep


it, but the statement to the public is equally misleading


in either case.  I mean, maybe that's not enough, but


maybe it is.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Well --


QUESTION:  I don't see how the character of the


charity has any bearing on the -- on the kind of --


whether there's fraud or not.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  I would agree, and I would


point to the petitioner's reply brief at the footnote


referring to the brief that was filed by Disabled American


Veterans, explaining the problem of donor acquisition


mailings, that it can cost $1 or more to acquire $1, and 

that that should be something that the petitioner should


give deference to, and in footnote 13 of the petitioner's


reply, they took exactly the opposite position and said


the fact that it was donor acquisition mailings, trying to


acquire new donors, was not a reason to set aside the


principles that they've enunciated in their complaint.


QUESTION:  Let make -- let's make an assumption


that 95 percent of the donors in the case of your client's


charity would not have given the money had they known of


the amount being kept by the telemarketers.  Is there

anything the State can do to protect the people of -- of


the State from having -- from parting with their money


under those circumstances?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Yes, sir.  The State of


Illinois has a series of -- of disclosure requirements.


They're content-based, neutral disclosures.  You must,


before you ask for a donation in Illinois, if you're a


compensated professional fundraiser, disclose your


professional status.


You must also disclose that you can obtain


copies of financial records for the organization from the


Office of the Attorney General.


You must also answer, if asked, what your fee


is.  You must disclose it.


You must disclose, if asked, what portion of the 

monies will go to the charitable organization.


You must disclose the primary purpose of, the


charitable purpose of the organization.


The State of Illinois can publish reports, the


State of Illinois maintains a web site.  There are 800


numbers.  There are -- there is a requirement that, prior


to anyone parting with consideration, in the mail piece


that is sent, when you are sitting in the privacy of your


own home, having made simply a pledge in the mail, in


writing, there is a disclosure that you can obtain copies

of the financial information.  There is a disclosure --


QUESTION:  You can -- you said many times you


can ask, you can obtain.  It seems that, then, the


sophisticated person is protected, the sophisticated


person will ask, but the person who isn't, who doesn't


know, I mean, your -- your position is, it's okay, if


asked, must tell, but if doesn't ask, then it's against


the First Amendment to require a statement of how much


goes to the fundraising?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Yes, Your Honor, because it's


the breathing space of New York Times versus Sullivan and


Riley and Schaumburg and Munson that we require.  It's the


lesser of two evils.  A compelled point of solicitation


disclosure will disproportionately adversely affect


smaller, newer, and less popular charities.


QUESTION:  And disproportionately affect donors


who are unsophisticated, because those are the ones, by


and large, that don't ask.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  I would point to the concurring


opinion written by Justice Scalia in the Riley case that


the -- that it's the normal presumption of people to


believe that someone is being compensated.  They know when


they get something in the mail that you had to pay for the


stamps, you had to pay for the printing.

disclosure of the professional status and the information


before you part with any consideration how you can obtain


all the information if cost --


QUESTION:  Is it -- is it --


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Excuse me.


QUESTION:  In looking at this picture of this


fundraiser, one of the things that was alleged, it seemed


to me, is odd.  It said that the fundraiser does not give


the names of the donor to the charity, to VietNow.  In


other words, the fundraiser keeps the donor list itself,


and it seems if it were in business to collect for the


charity, rather than in business to collect for itself, it


would surely give the charity the -- the names of the


donors.


MR. COPILEVITZ: 


That's a subject of contract, 

and I would suggest that that's something Illinois could


address.  There are State laws in New Hampshire and


Arkansas that I can recall off the top of my head that


specifically require as a condition of a contract that the


list and the names be made available.


There is nothing in this record to refer to the


fact that this contract wasn't entered into at arm's


length and, in fact, the Attorney General's web site cites


the percentage of this contract as being the common amount


that professional fundraisers routinely charge, and as the

Court addressed in Riley, that the State's paternalistic


instinct in protecting attorneys --


QUESTION:  Can we go over that again?  That this


is the common amount that fundraisers usually charge,


80 percent?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  It can be.  That -- it's on the


web site of the Attorney General, that professional


fundraiser fees generally run between 80 and 90 percent.


There's also footnoted in the brief a reference


to a report that was done that veterans groups are among


the lowest receiving organizations because of the nature


of their appeal, and Nation-wide averaged 17 percent, and


in this case they allege 15 percent, but the reality is


something different than that.  Because of the magazines


that were published in the last contract they got $20,000 

in addition to their percentage.  If no phone call had


been made, they would have received 100 percent of the


money.


They got the benefit of a Nationwide 800 number. 


They got the benefit of 2,200 magazines.  They got the


opportunity to talk to nine of --


QUESTION:  You're arguing that it's a good


charity, and I'll -- I'll -- we'll assume that for


purposes of the decision, that they're -- they're perfect,


but it still seems to me --

QUESTION:  -- you've raised the suggestion that


maybe we should use the New York Times standard, and if


that were the case, would it not be arguable that your


people knowingly made these statements with the


understanding they would believe that they were literally


true, and that there was not an over -- you know, that


the -- that the charity was going to get a larger amount


of the money.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  It seems to me the New York Times


standard might cut against you, in other words.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  Well, it -- it's for me in the


breathing space concept, but what they allege is, in the


complaint is that they raised money for the charitable 

purpose.  What they don't allege is that no money went to


the charitable purpose.


It's a question of degrees.  Again, we come back


down to what portion of the gross dollar in hard dollars


went to the program purpose.


What we can't --


QUESTION:  No, the question is how -- how true


was the statement?  What is the reasonable understanding


of the person who listened to this solicitation?  I think


everybody sort of agrees that if they knew the facts, they

wouldn't have given the money and, as Justice Kennedy


suggests, therefore they were misled, and then the New


York Times standard suggests to me that you knew they


would be misled, because you say it in your own brief.


MR. COPILEVITZ:  No, they would -- there was a


value -- the -- one of the primary program services was to


raise the awareness of the plight of the Vietnam veteran


and, as a result of a phone call, 9 out of 10 people


called do not make a contribution, but the organization


got the benefit of every one of those conversations, and


maybe next year or next month they got a bequest, or they


got a donation of a car, or they acquired a donor by


direct mail.  They're only focusing on one campaign.  They


don't look at every campaign.


In the footnote in the DAV, referring to them, 

they did not limit themselves.  It can be campaign-by-


campaign.


QUESTION:  Well, that's an argument that the


85 percent is an incorrect figure.  That's -- then I think


the case that's presented by the -- the certiorari


position is, assume that 85 percent is the correct figure,


then, is it -- you know, is it fraud?


MR. COPILEVITZ:  No, sir.


QUESTION:  Yes.

Mr. Huszagh, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD S. HUSZAGH


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. HUSZAGH:  I'd like to first correct two


clarifications in the record.  In fact, the Illinois


Supreme Court never said that the affidavit should not


properly be treated as part of the complaint.  They refer


to the affidavits, but our allegations stand on their own


without the need for those affidavits, which would simply


be an elaboration of the types of misrepresentations made


to donors.


A second, the web site that the Illinois


Attorney General keeps does not hold up 90 percent kept by


fundraisers as the ordinary and usual thing that's 

regularly practiced in this area.  They indicate that as


another one of several egregious examples that people


should be warned against, but that is not the only weapon


they should have in their arsenal against actual fraud.


This case is not a claim based upon a mere


nondisclosure of a high fee.  It is a claim based upon a


particular instance of actual deception based upon


statements made to donors that constitute


misrepresentations under the common law of fraud, not


explicit misstatements as the Illinois Supreme Court said,

or affirmative misstatements, not explicit lies, but


misrepresentations in the form of half-truths, and we ask


this Court not to hold that half-truths are


constitutionally protected.  I think the Court said as


much in Milkovich and the Masson cases, and no different


rule is warranted here.  There is that semantic


distinction.


Let me point out, however, that the key


allegation in this complaint, in the body of the text at


joint appendix page 9, paragraph 34, says that the effect


of representations that were made was that people were


told that a significant amount of each dollar donated


would be paid over to VietNow, and the defendants knew


that was false because 15 cents or less of each dollar


would be given to VietNow for its purposes.


The allegation is that people were told that


their money was going to be paid to VietNow and used to


buy food baskets, to provide job training for veterans. 


That is an actual representation.  Whether it constitutes


a misrepresentation turns upon whether it reasonably led


people to believe something that was false, and we ask the


Court to continue to uphold those principles in this


context.


There is no plausible claim that in this case


what these defendants are alleged to have done is beyond

the State's power to prohibit by a properly drafted law,


that these circumstances are egregious, and there is also


no possible claim that -- that any law invoked here cannot


be applied against anybody.


The fallback position of the defendants in this


case is that the Court should take the draconian step of


saying that unless there is an explicit misrepresentation


of fact, not an implied one, that there should be blanket


immunity for charitable fundraisers to lead people to


believe that their money is going to be used for specific


purposes and have no liability if that is one percent


true.  That is not something that's justified by the First


Amendment.


They have conjured up dire scenarios about all


sorts of charities disappearing from the landscape simply 

by the type of examples that they have given for a


chilling effect.  There is nothing in the record to show


that, and there is nothing in common experience to show


that, but what they're asking the Court is to say no, it's


not enough for as-applied claims of that variety to be


brought in other cases, but that there should be no


prosecution ever.  The State is categorically prohibited


from bringing a fraud claim in such circumstances.  That


is not a value that the First Amendment supports.


The First Amendment value that's most important
