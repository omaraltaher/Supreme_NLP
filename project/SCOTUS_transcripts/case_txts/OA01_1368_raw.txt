CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-1368, the Nevada Department of Human


Resources versus William Hibbs.


Mr. Taggart.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. TAGGART


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. TAGGART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


There are three reasons Congress did not validly


abrogate State immunity when it adopted the Family Medical


Leave Act's family leave provision.  First, the FMLA is


everyday economic legislation, a national labor standard,


not antidiscrimination legislation, second, Congress was 

not responding to a discernible pattern of


unconstitutional behavior, and third, even if such a


pattern were discernible, the 12-week family leave mandate


enforced by abrogating State immunity is not a


proportional and congruent response.


The Family Medical Leave Act is no different


than the minimum wage and other national labor standards. 


It is, in its operation and effect, it is simply Commerce


Clause legislation.


QUESTION:  Well, but now in the statute, the

findings, or the beginning, they refer to the Equal -- the


Equal Protection Clause.  They say it's consistent with


the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,


don't they?


MR. TAGGART:  Yes, they do, but they do not --


Congress did not invoke Section 5 of the Fourteenth


Amendment, as it did in the ADA and the ADEA statutes.  It


told us exactly why, in the House and Senate reports, it


was mentioning the Fourteenth Amendment in the text of the


statute.


QUESTION:  Well, as applied to private


employers, I suppose Congress had to rely on Commerce


Clause powers, but as applied to States, there is specific


reference in the statute, of course, to section 5 -- to


equal protection.


MR. TAGGART:  Yes, there is specific reference


to equal protection --


QUESTION:  Yes, right.


MR. TAGGART:  -- but Congress told us why they


mentioned equal protection in the House and the Senate


report, where Congress stated that if --


QUESTION:  Why do you need the House and Senate


report?  I mean, the very text of the statute doesn't say,


in order to assure equal protection of the laws in the


States.  That's not what it says.  It says that what we're

doing, what we're requiring, the leave that we're


requiring, we are requiring in a manner that, consistent


with the Equal Protection Clause, minimizes the


protection, the potential for employment discrimination.


I read that as saying what we're doing here is


being done with an eye to being sure that it's in


conformance with the Equal Protection Clause.  That's


quite different from saying that we're doing it in order


to enforce the Equal Protection Clause, which is being


violated by the States.


MR. TAGGART:  We agree with that position,


Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  But Mr. Taggart, we --


QUESTION:  But the statement in the text goes to


the manner, goes to the manner, not to the purpose at all. 

QUESTION:  The first rule of statutory


construction is to read on, and if you read on with me --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: 

--  

you will find it said, to promote


the role of equal employment opportunity for women and men


pursuant to such clause, to promote the goal of equal


opportunity for women and men.


Throughout your opening brief, you never


referred to that statute.  You told us there was only the


(4), the one that Justice Scalia referred to, and it

wasn't until your reply brief that you even acknowledged


that Congress has said, we're doing this to promote the


goal of equal opportunity for men and women.  Why didn't


you mention (5) in your opening brief?


MR. TAGGART:  Well, why we didn't mention (5),


I -- I apologize if we did not -- if we did not mention


it, but the -- the Senate report and the House report


describe exactly why Congress was talking about equal


protection.


QUESTION:  Well, one would look to the statute


before one looks to the House or the Senate report.


MR. TAGGART:  Yes, that is correct, but the


operation of the statute clearly shows that it is just


everyday Commerce Clause legislation.  Congress was deeply


concerned that the Family Medical Leave Act itself would 

be challenged on equal protection grounds, and that's why


it said it was promoting the goal of equal employment


opportunity.  Everything else about the statute, the way


it operates, the economic benefit that it provides, the


fact that it doesn't prohibit discrimination at all, show


that this is nothing different from the minimum wage, and


that -- that is what -- that is what this -- this was


adopted in the tradition of.


QUESTION:  Mr. Taggart, I -- I thought the


reason you didn't refer to the reference to equal

opportunity for men and women is that that is not a


reference to the Equal Protection Clause.


QUESTION:  Pursuant to such clause --


QUESTION:  People -- people -- people --


individuals could fail to provide equal -- equal


opportunity for men and women without violating the Equal


Protection Clause.


MR. TAGGART:  That's true, but the --


QUESTION:  The -- the statute says, pursuant to


the Equal Protection Clause.


MR. TAGGART:  Well, it does say that, but in our


view, it is more important to look at the operation and


the text of the amendment, and how -- how the -- or of the


act, and how the act works.


QUESTION:  Why? 


If you're looking at the text, 

then just a few lines above, in the text, where it talks


about findings, it says that, due to the nature of the


roles of men and women, primary responsibility for family


care-taking often falls on women, and then it says


employment standards that apply to just one gender have


serious potential for encouraging employers to


discriminate against people of that gender.  So what I


take that to mean is that, without this, State employers


as well as others tend to say to the woman, You go take


care of your sick mother, and because employers know that,

they won't hire women.  That's what it says in (5) and


(6), and I would have thought that sounded like equal


protection of the laws, as if this statute is designed to


help remove one of the major reasons why employers


discriminate against women.  That's what (5) and (6) says,


and then the -- 10 lines down it says, pursuant to the


Fourteenth Amendment.


MR. TAGGART:  Well, Justice Breyer, the


statement here, in our view, indicates why Congress


adopted a gender-neutral statute.  If it adopted a gender-


specific statute, the statute itself would have been


subject to challenge under the Equal Protection Clause.


Our -- our concern here is that any everyday


economic legislation that may have a disparate benefit to


one suspect classification or another will all of a sudden 

be -- have the power to abrogate Eleventh Amendment


immunity, and then State immunity will be subject to


abrogation at -- at any expense where Congress deems that


Commerce Clause legislation is appropriate.  Congress


should not be allowed to do indirectly what it's


prohibited from doing directly.


QUESTION:  Mr. Taggart, would you comment on


this argument, which I think is really an elaboration on


the findings in the purpose statement that Justice Breyer


was referring to.

 I think you can distill those statements down to


something like this.  We know for a fact historically


that, whenever burdens of family responsibility are


allocated, they are allocated to the woman, not to the


man.  If we do not have an employment standard that


expressly says you have got to treat them exactly alike,


the women will always get the short end, and that will be


reflected in hiring decisions, among others.


Secondly, in order to make this determination a


practical one, we can't simply leave it that whatever you


do for men you should do for women, or vice versa.  We've


got to put some kind of a threshold there that will mean


something, and so we've come up with a particular period,


a particular number of weeks.  That's the only way to make


this work. 


I think that is the argument that is based, in 

effect, on these two sections.  That doesn't sound to me


like simply an end run, a phony Commerce Clause argument. 


Would you comment on that argument?


MR. TAGGART:  Well, even if that were true, even


if that effect occurred from the statute, the failure, the


utter failure of the statute to satisfy this Court's City


of Boerne test shows that it is purely economic


legislation.  There were absolutely no findings by


Congress regarding State conduct, or whether State conduct


was unconstitutional, and it's difficult to discern from

the record before this Court or --


QUESTION:  Well, given the fact that we have


accepted in prior cases the pervasiveness of the


phenomenon that seems to be quite clearly reflected in the


findings and purpose, is that necessary here to say, well,


yeah, it -- we've already said, the Supreme Court has


already accepted its pervasiveness, but we've got to go a


step further and say, well, yeah, that pervasiveness even


goes to States.  Isn't there a point at which the point


has been made?


MR. TAGGART:  Well, first of all, if that were


true, then any law that Congress passes that has any


arguable fact on discrimination based on gender would be


sufficient for satisfying an abrogation of State immunity. 


In 1993 --


QUESTION:  Well, we can't -- what about the


Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer decision, where the Court


unanimously found Title VII was a valid abrogation of the


Eleventh Amendment immunity, and there was no inquiry into


the history of gender discrimination, it was just


accepted?  Do you think that that case would stand up


under your analysis?


MR. TAGGART:  Yes, it would.  There -- or we


would take the position that it would.  There is --


QUESTION:  Because this is rather similar.

 MR. TAGGART:  Well, there is no requirement, and


we are not urging the Court to adopt a requirement that


Congress make findings.  Congress simply helps the Court


when it makes findings about what it is -- whether there


is unconstitutional State behavior that would justify a


12-week family leave benefit that's abrogated by State


sovereign immunity.  But Title VII is closely hewed to


this Court's section 1 jurisprudence, and there's every


reason to believe that Title VII would stand up to the


City of Boerne test.  So the difference with this statute


is that there is absolutely --


QUESTION:  Mr. Taggart, I thought that part of


your argument was, if the discrimination doesn't exist


anymore in the State, even if it did at one time, then the


provision would have to sunset, and as far as Title VII is 

concerned, many States, the vast majority of States have


their own Title VII laws, so at this point in time I


guess, under your reasoning, Fitzpatrick and Bitzer would


have to go.


MR. TAGGART:  Well, we are not arguing that


position and, in fact, in our view Title VII is so closely


hewed to this Court's section (1) jurisprudence that it --


it -- there's every reason to believe that it would


satisfy this Court's test.


In -- in -- in this case, though, the question

is, in 1993 was there a pattern and practice of State


behavior that would justify a 12-week mandatory family


leave benefit for all State employees that's -- that's


enforced through abrogating State immunity, and the


standard --


QUESTION:  What was the -- in the title of Title


VII what was the pattern and practice that justified that


result, because when the original Title VII was passed


this Court had never declared any law that differentiated


on the basis of gender unconstitutional, and when it was


extended to public employees -- was it in '72? -- this


Court had just begun to address the issue.


MR. TAGGART:  Yes, that --


QUESTION:  And yet the Court said Congress could


do that in '72 with no special record of any kind.  The


record, to the extent it existed, was made for race, not


sex.


MR. TAGGART:  Well, we're not challenging Title


VII in this case.  We're challenging that in 1993, when


the --


QUESTION:  But she's asking you to distinguish


Title VII from this.  We know you're not challenging it.


MR. TAGGART:  Well, in our view --


QUESTION:  What about the fact that Title VII


goes to discrimination on the basis of sex in general, and

there was no doubt that States have engaged in that and


were engaging in it at the time.  You could have said it


was -- it was general knowledge.  But the statute we're


construing here doesn't go to sex discrimination in


general, it goes to a very particular type of sex


discrimination, and that is in the granting of leave, and


on that, at least I can't say as a matter of general


knowledge that the States were in violation of provisions


of leave.  I've no idea what the state -- what the state


was.  Certainly you -- you need evidence to show that they


were violating that particular aspect of -- of -- of equal


protection.


MR. TAGGART:  Well, in order to show a pattern


and practice in 1993 it's this Court's section (1)


jurisprudence on violations of the Equal Protection Clause 

that governs, and Washington v. Davis, incorporated into


the gender cases through State Administrators v. Feeney,


is a test which requires purposeful and invidious


discrimination.  There's no showing that there was a


pattern and practice of State managers in 1993 of using a


gender stereotype when they granted leave.


QUESTION:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, because if


you accept, I take it, you accept the proposition that


Congress has sufficiently shown, as far as anyone need do,


that State employers discriminated in their hiring against

women, the gener -- you accept that, is that right? 


That's your -- your -- your -- your, for -- because if


that's not so, I guess goodbye to Title VII, a whole bunch


of things, but is -- do you accept that?


MR. TAGGART:  Well, Title VII, and the circuits


have said this already, is that Title VII is so closely


hewed to this Court's section (1) --


QUESTION:  No, I'm not asking you to distinguish


Title VII.  I'm asking you if, for purposes of this case,


you accept the proposition that it is adequately shown


that State employers, like a lot of other employers, did


discriminate against women in hiring people, in general.


MR. TAGGART:  If --


QUESTION:  I'd like a yes answer or a no answer,


if I could.


MR. TAGGART:  Well, a qualified yes if you're


talking about 1972, when --


QUESTION:  Okay, so at the time of this statute?


MR. TAGGART:  Not at the time of this statute.


QUESTION:  Oh, okay.  You do not accept the


proposition that it is adequately shown that State


employers discriminated against women when they passed


this law?


MR. TAGGART:  No, and even if there was a --


QUESTION:  Okay.  No, then, I don't see the

distinction with Title VII.  It's goodbye if I accept that


argument, I think.  It's just that it was earlier?


MR. TAGGART:  No, it's that title -- it's


unclear whether Title VII even prohibits things that this


Court's section (1) jurisprudence wouldn't also prohibit.


Title VII basically codifies what this Court


said in Washington v. Davis.  It allows a give-and-take in


the courtroom of the evidence to -- to flesh out the


totality of facts that surround an employment activity,


and at the end of the day in the Title VII lawsuit an


inference can be made of whether purposeful discrimination


actually occurred.  It allows a defense not based upon


heightened scrutiny or strict scrutiny.  It allows just a


simple defense by the employer.


Unlike the Family Medical Leave Act, which just 

takes away any defense at all for States to defend the


policies that they have, that it doesn't even elevate


State policies to a heightened scrutiny standard, but in


1993 State policies were gender neutral, and under this


Court's section (1) jurisprudence those policies should be


subject to a rational basis review.  But instead, the FMLA


just makes all of those policies unlawful.  Any policy


that doesn't have 12 weeks of leave is simply unlawful. 


It doesn't give the State the ability to come in and prove


that that policy was -- was applied --

 QUESTION:  Suppose you have two statutes, one is


a congressional statute that says, all States must have


employment and pay policies that do not differentiate on


the basis of gender, and the second is the FMLA.  It seems


to me that the FMLA is much more limited.  It's just 12


weeks, the damages are capped, it's simple to operate --


MR. TAGGART:  But --


QUESTION:  I would think that that is much more


proportional and congruent than the other statute that I


described.


MR. TAGGART:  Well, the -- this statute, in


our -- our position is is not proportionally concurrent,


because first, there's no pattern of State behavior that


would justify a 12-week leave benefit.  But to completely


make unlawful any act, any State policy that's less than 

12 weeks would require a substantial showing that States


were engaged in discrimination in the employment, in


employment practices.


QUESTION:  Why?  Why?  Because if you imagined,


and you won't concede this, but I think, take it as a


hypothetical, then, if you imagined that State employers


had been shown to discriminate against women in hiring,


wouldn't Congress have quite a lot of leeway in choosing


the remedy for that discrimination, and wouldn't this


statute be part of the remedy?

 MR. TAGGART:  Absolutely.  If your


hypothetical --


QUESTION:  So in other words, if it's


absolutely, then the answer as far as you see it in this


case is whether there has been an adequate showing that at


the time of this statute State employers discriminated


against women in hiring, and if the answer to that


question in your view is, there was an adequate showing,


this is an appropriate remedy, but if the answer in your


view is, it wasn't an adequate showing, then, of course,


you would win.  That's how you're basically seeing the


case.


MR. TAGGART:  Well, I don't want to agree with


you 100 percent, but -- but the --

QUESTION:  I would think your-- your brief --


your brief agreed with him zero percent.


MR. TAGGART:  Well --

QUESTION:  Your -- your --


MR. TAGGART:  We didn't --


QUESTION:  Under your brief, the answer is quite


clearly no, you don't think it's proportionate even if


there had been a violation shown.  Isn't that what your


brief said?

 MR. TAGGART:  Well, the hypothetical was, if


there was enough of a showing, and I think that's the


question.  We argue there was no showing, which would


justify no remedy, but even if there was a showing, the


remedy has to be proportional, and this 12-week leave


benefit just goes far out of proportion of any discernible


pattern of conduct by States which would justify it.


QUESTION:  Mr. Taggart, there have been scores


of Title VII cases where there's a nice, neutral standard,


and then there's a decision maker, and the decision maker


is exercising discretion under these general standards. 


And time after the time, the decision maker is duplicating


himself, whether race, sex, and the people who don't look


like the decision maker say, gee, we suspect


discrimination. 


There have been countless Title VII suits that


have prevailed on that, that the standards are nice and


neutral, but the discretion whether to hire is made by


someone who is coming up with results that exclude these


people.


Now, do you think that State employers, that the


people who do hiring and promotions for States are so


nonbiased, so unprejudiced that that doesn't affect the


decision makers on the State level, as opposed to the


municipal level, and in private employment?

 MR. TAGGART:  Our position is that the


presumption has to be that States act in a constitutional


manner, and I'm not going to stand here before the Court


and say that States are perfect, but there's certainly no


pattern which would justify a 12-week mandatory family


leave benefit enforced through the abrogation of State


immunity.  This -- the FMLA is simply not based upon


any -- any pattern of State conduct.


The Congress knew in 1993 that 30 States had


laws just like the Family Medical Leave Act.  Congress


wasn't thinking about whether States were violating law


and whether States needed to be corrected.  Congress was


trying to supplement what States were already doing with


the leave benefit.


QUESTION: 


In Title VII, too, the lead was taken 

by the States.  Several States had human rights laws long


before there was any Federal law.  At least as to those


States Title VII should not have been valid legislation,


should it?


MR. TAGGART:  Well --


QUESTION:  Because there was no sign that they


were not at least as good as the Federal Government.


MR. TAGGART:  Well, Title VII is, in our view, a


-- a -- clearly, a law that's clearly antidiscriminatory. 


It doesn't -- it isn't -- wasn't adopted for Commerce

Clause purposes, and in our view in this -- the Family


Medical Leave Act is just a round peg being forced into a


square hole.  It's not -- wasn't adopted with the


operation -- with the idea of acting like


antidiscrimination legislation.  It, in fact, would


completely allow for discrimination.  It would -- and that


wouldn't be prohibited by the law at all.


QUESTION:  Okay, if they had passed this statute


without the 12 weeks in it, and the statute had simply


said, on family leave decisions, the decisions have got to


be the same, the standard for making them has got to be


the same, whether the employer, employee is a man or a


woman, would that be constitutional?


MR. TAGGART:  Well, that --


QUESTION: 


Under section (5)? 

MR. TAGGART:  Well, certainly that would sound


more like an antidiscrimination law that would require


leave, if it's granted --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. TAGGART:  -- to be granted on a gender


neutral basis --


QUESTION:  Now, the difference between that case


and this -- I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.


MR. TAGGART:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  I was trying to get in another

question before Justice Scalia did.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  The difference between the case I


just put to you and the case that we've got here is 12


weeks, and I suggested that one reason for the 12 weeks is


a decision on the part of Congress that if we don't put


some period of time, some threshold period of time, our


nondiscrimination standard isn't going to be worth


anything.


For example, just outside this case, the States


could say, okay, we're going to give a 1-week maternity


leave, men or women.  Obviously, that isn't going to


accomplish anything.  So Congress says, we've got to have


some kind of a threshold in order to make this requirement


of neutrality really work. 


Why is that not a reasonable 

way to get to the point which I think we both agree would


be a perfectly lawful exercise of power under section (5)?


MR. TAGGART:  Well, first on the latter part, a


prohibition or a requirement for gender-neutral leave


would -- for -- if leave is allowed, it must be allowed on


a gender-neutral basis, I would still argue that that


would be, that would require some predicate of a pattern


of unconstitutional behavior, but --


QUESTION:  Okay.  We'll take that as a given. 


You don't concede that.

 MR. TAGGART:  Okay, but on the 12 weeks point,


this Court would have to assume, without any indication


from Congress, that that's why it used 12 weeks, because


that is not why it used 12 weeks.  12 weeks --


QUESTION:  How many States are covered by the


act?


MR. TAGGART:  Well, at the time the act was


adopted --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. TAGGART:  -- 30 States had family leave


laws.


QUESTION:  How many are covered by the act?  To


how many States does the act --


MR. TAGGART:  Every State is covered by the act.


QUESTION:  50 of them. 


How many private 

employers are covered by the act?


MR. TAGGART:  Every private employer.


QUESTION:  Yeah, like how many do you think that


is, hundreds of thousands?


MR. TAGGART:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And the 6 weeks was adopted with the


50 States in mind, is the argument that's being


propounded.  It's clear that the 6 weeks was designed for


the 50 States, never mind the hundreds of thousands of


private employers.  Does that seem plausible?

 MR. TAGGART:  No, and it -- first it's --


QUESTION:  Doesn't it seem plausible, however,


that the period of time was designed in view of the


pervasive history of discrimination in and out of


Government, and that it is just as applicable when it is


applied to the Government, just as reasonable or


unreasonable, however you come out, as it is when it's


applied to private industry?  Isn't that a fair argument?


MR. TAGGART:  No, because it's not so simple as


to draw the conclusions about the society in general


directly to States and impute States with unconstitutional


behavior without presuming first that States act in a


constitutional way.


QUESTION:  No, I recognize that you're not


conceding the -- the -- the point that a predicate for 

applying it to the States, even a -- a -- a non-6-weeks


antidiscrimination has been shown, but if we assume that


point is past, then is the argument, is the


appropriateness of the means somehow categorically


different for States from the appropriate --


appropriateness of the means with respect to private


employment?


MR. TAGGART:  Well, it's our view that the two


questions can't be split, that -- that the State conduct


is so critical that -- that it -- the answer cannot be

derived from saying that if -- if there's this conduct in


general, then 12 weeks fits both State and non-State


actors.  The -- the 12-week benefit was not designed at


all by Congress to target unconstitutional conduct.  It


was designed to give children 12 weeks of child


development time with their parents when they're born.


QUESTION:  Insofar as the statute applied to


private employers, could it possibly have been directed at


unconstitutional conduct?


MR. TAGGART:  It may be possible, but -- but


any --


QUESTION:  I presume --


QUESTION:  But the real question is whether it's


directed at discriminatory.


QUESTION: 


At discriminatory conduct. 

QUESTION:  If it's private discrimination, it's


not constitutional; if it's State discrimination, it is a


constitutional question.  Isn't the question whether it's


directed at discriminatory conduct?  Isn't that the basic


question?


MR. TAGGART:  Well --


QUESTION:  Or do you concede it is directed at


discriminatory conduct.


MR. TAGGART:  No, we do not concede that it's


directed at discriminatory conduct.

which to base the direction of this onto the States, and


I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal,


please.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Taggart.


Ms. Pillard.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNELIA T. L. PILLARD


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. PILLARD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The Family Medical Leave Act is an appropriate 

response to enduring problems of State sex discrimination


bias against women in hiring and promotion because


employers assume that women are more likely than men to


leave their jobs to go take care of their family members,


and bias against men in the dispensing of family leave.


Congress gathered ample recent evidence of these


mutually reinforcing problems, and Congress also built on


a known foundation of State laws and decisions fostering


different roles for men and women in work and family. 


Those different roles and beliefs about them persist.

 Offering a threshold amount of leave to men and


women alike is responsive to the problems.  The act has


successfully encouraged more men to take the leave, and in


narrowing the gap between men's and women's leave rates,


the act erodes the very basis of employers' bias against


women.  If you will, it makes men and women equally


unattractive.


(Laughter.)


MS. PILLARD:  The act also responds to


discrimination against men in the dispensing of leave.  A


bare prohibition against discrimination doesn't do that


and, in fact, the bare prohibition against discrimination


in the dispensing of leave had been in place.  That's


Title VII, and that, for the generation during which Title


VII applied to the States, that had not succeeded in 

eradicating sex-based dispensing of leave, and in the real


world --


States?


QUESTION:  Sex-based dispensing of leave by the


MS. PILLARD:  By the States.


QUESTION:  Well, what statistics are there that


support that statement?


MS. PILLARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to


highlight four aspects of the evidence of sex-based


discrimination in leave specifically about the States.

 First, Congress learned of the pattern of State


granting leave through the Bureau of Labor Statistics'


figures.  In 1987, 50 percent of women in State and local


government, as compared to 30 percent of men in State and


local government, were offered parenting leave.  Yale also


did a 50-State survey to which --


QUESTION:  Excuse me, what --


QUESTION:  You know, I presume to get parenting


leave you have to be a parent, and it doesn't seem to me


that that -- that is a terribly instructive statistic


unless it -- it's shown that equal numbers were parents,


or equal numbers applied.


MS. PILLARD:  The statute --


QUESTION:  Could you tell me what, before we go


on with the discussion, what you mean by, were offered 

parenting leave?


MS. PILLARD:  Parenting leave was available to


them in their State --


QUESTION:  Was available, whether they took it


or not?


MS. PILLARD:  Whether they took it or not.  This


is not rates of people taking.  This is rates of people


who had it available.


QUESTION:  Who had the opportunity to take it?


MS. PILLARD:  Should they choose, yes, and the

Bureau of Labor Statistics is very clear on that.


QUESTION:  How -- how could that be?  The


States' laws were written in such a way that --


MS. PILLARD:  The States' laws and the States'


policies, and this is confirmed by other pieces of


evidence.  Yale did a 50-State survey to which 36 States


responded, and 19 of those States themselves said they


offered parenting leave to women and not to men under


their policies.


QUESTION:  Well, that's 19, 19 out of 50 States.


QUESTION:  Excuse me, when you say parenting --


QUESTION:  Let her respond to my question.


(Laughter.)


MS. PILLARD:  That's 19 out of the 36 responded


that themselves admitted that they -- they had these 

policies.  The president of the labor union that


represents State employees said, the vast majority of our


contracts really cover maternity leave.  They're not --


QUESTION:  Exactly, and that explains the


discrepancy.  I'm trying to figure out -- what you're


saying is that some States provided for maternity leave,


but did not provide any leave for the father, but that's


quite a different thing.


I mean, does one have to think that parenting


leave, which is the ability to go home and take care of a

child, is the same as allowing a woman who's just gone


through childbirth some leave to recuperate from the


childbirth?  I don't think that proves anything at all. 


It just proves that some States had a policy of maternity


leave, and presumably if, you know, if one of their male


employees gave birth they'd give him maternity leave, too.


(Laughter.)


MS. PILLARD:  Justice Scalia, let me clarify,


each of these studies and all the figures that I'm citing


are not talking about pregnancy disability leave.  We're


talking about maternity leave over and above pregnancy


disability leave, so we're talking about whether it's


unconstitutional for a State to assume that women and not


men can appropriately go home and take --


QUESTION: 


I thought we were talking about the 

medical leave act here.  We're not talking about


parenting, are we?


MS. PILLARD:  We're talking about both.  Part of


the medical leave provision allows parents to take care of


their seriously ill children as well as their spouses or


parents, and Congress saw these as part and parcel of the


same phenomenon.


QUESTION:  Did any State have parenting leave


laws which say, we just want you to have time to take care


of your family, which applied only to men -- only to women

and not to men?


MS. PILLARD:  Yes, all --


QUESTION:  I know plenty of States had maternity


leave.  I consider that a different category entirely. 


Were there any States that had parenting leave, time to


take care of your family, that applied only to women and


not to men?


MS. PILLARD:  Justice Scalia, each of these


States, when they called it maternity leave, the important


distinction is that it encompassed but was not restricted


to a period of pregnancy disability.


We're talking about, for example, in our lodging


appendix at page 31, the Rhode Island agreement that


applied from 1992 to 1995.  In provision 13.7, maternity


leave is available for up to a year, without regard to 

pregnancy disability.  Another example at page 47, 48 of


our lodging, maternity leaves not to exceed 6 months, but


may be extended, and paternity leaves are available for 3


months, so someone -- a woman can take a maternity leave


up to a year without a showing of maternity disability,


and a man can take 3 months.  And on page 40 of the


lodging, again the Pennsylvania agreement says that women


can take a period of 6 months, and it may be extended for


6 months, no provision for a man who is so inclined and


who wishes to do so, to go take care of his infant child,

and I think these stereotypes are very alive and well


today, and the act was --


QUESTION:  Kind of the successor of the man


going down with his babe in arms to ask for an excuse from


jury duty and they said, would tell him no, you don't get


any excuse, but you give excuses to women.  Yes, because


women take care of children.  I take care of children. 


That's the same thing.


MS. PILLARD:  It's precisely these assumptions


that have caused State employers and other employers to


discriminate against women in hiring, promotion, and


retention, and against men in the dispensing of leave, and


these are really two sides of the same coin.  And the act


is working.  In the 5 years that were studied from 1995 to


2000, there was a jump from approximately 14 percent to 21 

percent of the percentage of male --


QUESTION:  Would the act be any less valid if we


were to conclude it weren't working?


MS. PILLARD:  No, but I think the point is that


there's an ongoing problem, and that Congress was correct


in discerning that this was really at the core of the


problem.


QUESTION:  And why couldn't Congress have solved


that problem adequately by simply prescribing that no


State shall discriminate in -- in the -- in the giving of

MS. PILLARD:  Justice Scalia, Congress


already --


QUESTION:  No maternity leave, kind of no State


can have maternity leave as a separate category, and all


family care leave must be offered equally to men and


women.  Why -- why wouldn't that have been a proportionate


response to -- to the defect that they had found?  Why --


why did the Federal Government, in order to solve the


problem, have to impose upon the States 12 weeks, just


pulled out of the air, 12 weeks, this is the solution to


this constitutional problem?


MS. PILLARD:  Justice Scalia, that prohibition


was already in place from 1972, and the problem also is


that a bare prohibition against discrimination cannot 

respond to discrimination against men in the dispensing of


leave, because in the real world a facially neutral policy


without a threshold leave entitlement really equates to a


discretionary practice of dispensing leave tainted by


stereotypes about who should need it.


QUESTION:  I don't understand what you said.


MS. PILLARD:  Even if employers do not


affirmatively provide for any leave, they equally have a


no-leave policy for men and women that is formally equal. 


In the real world, some workers ask for leave and some do

get family leave, but by leaving it up to supervisor


discretion we open the door --


QUESTION:  But there's --


MS. PILLARD:  -- to discrimination.


QUESTION:  But where -- is it supervisor


discretion?  You -- the supervisor cannot discriminate on


the basis of sex.  I think what you're saying is that


without this 12-week period, many men just wouldn't take


the leave.  That's probably right, but then many men


wouldn't necessarily take the 12-week leave either, if


it's available.


MS. PILLARD:  Many men would be deterred, if


they didn't have an affirmative right to take the leave,


by the assumption that their employers would not grant


them leave if they requested it, by the assumption that 

they would be retaliated against in the employment process


if they took it, because it is still much more


unacceptable for men to take family leave than for women.


QUESTION:  Let me ask this question about the


operation of this law in light of our recent cases on the


Eleventh Amendment.  Is it your understanding that because


of the exercise of the Commerce Clause power, that the


States are bound by this law --


MS. PILLARD:  That's right.


QUESTION:  -- to grant the leave?

you think that State attorney generals like -- probably


Mr. Taggart would be the better one to ask that


question -- would tell their Governors and their officials


you are bound, by law, to grant the family -- to follow


the Family Medical Leave Act?


MS. PILLARD:  So the question is, why damages? 


Once Congress has found a problem, a serious problem of


unconstitutional discrimination, that we assert exists


here, the standard remedy to enforce rights in the


employment context is make whole monetary relief, the


centerpiece of which is lost wages.  Title VII uses


damages, the Equal Pay Act uses damages, and here, in the


Family Medical Leave Act, these are limited damages. 

Congress took great care to ensure that they wouldn't


overburden the States --


QUESTION:  I understand that, but it seems to me


if there's a big problem you can have an Ex Parte Young


suit or, if the Government just is -- the United States is


concerned about this, the Government of the United States


can intervene, and why isn't that wholly adequate --


MS. PILLARD:  Congress determined --


QUESTION:  -- to enforce this law?


MS. PILLARD:  Congress considered very carefully

that damages were needed, and limited the damages. 


They're just enough to spur enforcement and not burden


employers, including the States.  You need money damages


to make sure cases get the attention of higher-ups in


State government as well as in private industry.


States at the highest levels may be fully


responsive, but the application of stereotypes is


typically at the lower level of the supervisor with


hiring, promotion, and assignment discretion, the line


supervisor in the State university, in the State hospital,


in the State troopers, in the State human services


agencies, like where Mr. Hibbs worked, and without the


clear commitment by Congress that a threshold of family


leave is going to be made available not on an ad hoc


basis, not according to supervisor decisions about who 

really needs the leave, but because Federal law requires


it as a remedy for past discrimination.  Only then will


that message really reach the line supervisors who are


making these decisions.


So I would emphasize that the act is working,


the damages are limited, and the problems at which it aims


are clearly unconstitutional, and petitioners are just


wrong that there was no evidence in the legislative


record.  Congress clearly identified the problems, the


problems of the States as on a par with problems of other

sectors.


Congress was well aware of the body of recent


judicial decisions, finding State sex discrimination in


employment.  We've included some illustrative examples in


our brief at footnote 23.  The United States has included


some examples of the most recent cases in their brief at


note 15 and, as I was discussing before, Congress learned


of the patterns of States granting leave to women but not


to men, and Congress saw the family medical issue as part


and parcel of the parenting leave issue.  These were all


responsibilities, family care responsibilities


traditionally performed by wives.  And so Congress aimed


in subsections (a), (b), and (c) at a common problem of


employers' assumptions of women taking leave burdening


their employment prospects, and employers' assumptions 

that men did not need the leave, hindering their ability


to take it, which in turn exacerbates the discrimination


problem against -- against women.


So denial of employment opportunity to women and


of family leave to men are two sides of the same coin. 


Congress clearly identified the problems, had facts


showing that they continued.  Nearly every State, until a


generation ago, overtly placed discriminatory restrictions


on womens' workforce participation.  That history --

a generation?


MS. PILLARD:  Well, when Congress was acting in


1993, it was only 20 years since Title VII had been


extended to the States, and less than that since this


Court had adopted heightened scrutiny of sex-based


classifications based on the recognition that public


agencies have a -- have a tendency to rely on overbroad


sex-based generalizations, overbroad sex-based


classifications, so it was -- it was only since the 1970's


that we started to recognize that discrimination that we


had previously seen as benign, as often intended to help


women, was really hindering their advancement, and to --


and to seek to try to dismantle that system.


QUESTION:  And the changes in the unemployment


and Workers' Compensation laws, those persisted. 

Wasn't


the Wengler decision in 1980?


MS. PILLARD:  That's right.  We have


decisions --


QUESTION:  And States all have that kind of one-


way law, where the woman did not -- if the woman wage


earner died, then her husband got nothing because she was


not considered really an equal worker.


MS. PILLARD:  Really her wages were


supplemental.


QUESTION:  And that went on till 1980.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIET D. DINH


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES


MR. DINH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may


it please the Court:


The Family and Medical Leave Act is just one


part of a broader statutory scheme to eliminate sex-based


employment discrimination in the hiring, retention,


promotion, and granting of leave benefits for both men and


women, and that's the key point to emphasize here. 


Congress was acting not simply to remedy discrimination in 

leave-granting policies, but more fundamentally Congress


sought to remedy and prevent sex-based employment


discrimination based on impermissible presumptions about


the role of women in the home and the role of men in the


office.


QUESTION:  I --


QUESTION:  In our cases, is there any difference


between Congress' prohibiting something under its section


5 power and creating a substantive entitlement under that


power?

 MR. DINH:  I have not seen a distinction in the


cases, in the section 5 cases of this Court.  They are few


and far between, as you can --


QUESTION:  Uh-huh, right.


MR. DINH:  -- as you can appreciate, but the


distinction is not readily made.  One can characterize the


entitlement here as simply a prohibition on discrimination


for men and women who take leave.  It is simply an --


QUESTION:  No, it isn't, it's 12 weeks.


QUESTION:  -- entitlement to come back to a job.


QUESTION:  Well, it's a 12-week period.


QUESTION:  It says you get 12 weeks, and if --


if we approve this, we are establishing the proposition


that in order to eliminate, to enforce any of the


provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, but in particular 

equal protection, the Government may establish whatever


substantive requirements might further equal protection,


and I just don't know where the Government plucks 12 weeks


from and says that it -- we have to stop discrimination,


and therefore everybody's entitled to 12 weeks of leave,


and it's an extraordinary leap.


MR. DINH:  Your Honor, I disagree that there is


no limiting principle here, and the limiting principle is


precisely provided by this Court's jurisprudence in


congruence and proportionality.  That's precisely the

limiting principle as to what is the constitutional


violation that Congress seeks to redress, and whether or


not the remedy is congruent and proportional. 


The constitutional violation here that Congress


seeks to redress or to prevent is employment-based


discrimination based upon presumptions about leave-taking


habits of men and women.


QUESTION:  And was that the big fight in the


statute?  Is that what was really going on when this 12-


week -- I mean, I -- I was around at the time, and I


remember the big -- the big discussion was whether there


ought to be a Federal law that requires all employers, not


States in particular, but all employers to give all


workers 12 weeks of family leave if they wanted it.  That


was what all the discussion was. 


I didn't hear any 

discussion at the time of sex discrimination, and you


present it to us as though this was the motivating factor


of the legislation.  I find that hard to believe.


MR. DINH:  Your Honor, I was not there at the


time, and I --


(Laughter.)


MR. DINH:  But I will take your word for it, but


more importantly, I think we should take Congress' word on


its face.  Congress says at 29 U.S.C. 2601(b)(5) that the


purpose of the, one of the purpose of the statute is,

quote, to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity


for women and men pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause,


and the further evidence --


QUESTION:  Justice Scalia is right, is he not,


that it -- the bill that he's talking about was the '87


bill, and that didn't say anything about the Equal


Protection Clause, and that's the startling difference


between the bill that actually passed in 1993.


MR. DINH:  That's precisely right, Justice


O'Connor -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg.  Justice Scalia was


talking about S. 249, the 1987 bill.  The first time that


the section (5), the promotion goal that entered into the


statute was in the next iteration, H.R. 925 in the House,


in 1987, and concurrent with the insertion of the


promotion of equal opportunity, Congress also included the 

provision for family leave for care of parent illnesses,


as opposed to simple -- simply children illnesses.  And so


there is some concurrency with respect to Congress'


reliance on, for the first time, section (5) authority and


the grant of family leave, and that's consistent with the


legislative record that was before Congress.


Congress was facing a situation where it was


finding more two-worker families entering in the workforce


and increased demand for family care in the workforce, and


it said that, based upon the evidence, as Justice Souter

had summarized, that when push came to shove, women would


be expected to take leave to take care of the family, and


Congress was finding that push was, indeed, coming to


shove, and was adopting a remedy that was directly


proportional and congruent to the period of constitutional


violation.  It adopted a gender-neutral entitlement to


leave so as to eliminate the underlying presumption that


this Court has said is impermissible.


QUESTION:  Would 24 weeks have been


proportional?


MR. DINH:  Your Honor, I'd -- that would be a


more difficult case.  I do not think that --


QUESTION:  6 weeks?  Would 6 weeks be


proportional?


MR. DINH: 


It would -- the -- the -- I do not 

think that this Court's jurisprudence on proportionality


has fine -- is so finely tuned, and this Court's lack


of --


QUESTION:  Of course, that jurisprudence came


after the statute was enacted anyway.


MR. DINH:  And I do not think that this Court's


evaluation of congressional enactments under section (5),


the unique remedial powers of Congress under section (5),


would turn on whether it's 10 weeks or 12 weeks or 13


weeks.  Of course, if it is more an increase, then it

would be less proportional, if it is less, then it would

QUESTION:  I agree that it shouldn't turn on the


length.  That's the point I was getting to.  I can't


imagine that it would turn on the length.


QUESTION:  Perhaps Justice Scalia should ask


this question, but I was just wondering --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  -- if you have to get to the --


QUESTION:  Pass it to me.  I'll --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  You have to get to the 1993 version


of the statute to introduce the equal protection notion,


and it's interesting to me that precisely the same remedy


was provided after the equal protection became an 

ingredient of the problem as was provided before the equal


protection rationale was introduced.


MR. DINH:  You mean, that same remedy, you mean


number of weeks?


QUESTION:  The same 12-week period.  Wasn't that


true?


MR. DINH:  Not exactly, Your Honor.  H -- the


first time that the family leave was introduced and the


first time the section (5) authority was invoked was in


H.R. 925, and there were differing leave times for

different provisions.


I believe there was one that for section (d),


for the personal disability, it was 24 weeks.  Some was at


6 weeks.  It turns out that when Congress passed this


statute, a prior version of which was 1990, 1991, and this


version in 1993, it pretty much reached the equilibrium of


12 weeks.  This is the normal give-and-take of the


legislative process, and nowhere in this Court's


jurisprudence --


QUESTION:  And this was the statute that was


repeatedly vetoed, as I remember it, the bill, by


President Bush, and the basis for the veto had nothing to


do with discrimination, that it really was based on the


length of the provision.


MR. DINH: 


No, Your Honor, you are right, the --

I have reviewed the veto statements.  They concern the


imposition that these types of policies would have on


small businesses and the economy of the United States,


rather than on the discrimination provisions at issue. 


But it's clear that Congress, in passing the statute, was


relying on the discrimination, discriminatory effects that


these types of leave policies would have on women.  And I


think the crux of this case, if I may, turns exactly,


Justice O'Connor, on your comparison with the evidence


that was before Congress when it enacted Title VII, when

it extended that, when it included that into the gender.


As you may recall, this Court in, I believe in


Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, recounted the legislative


history of how gender entered into Title VII, and it was


entered there as the legislative equivalent of the poison


pill in order to attempt to kill Title VII, and so not


much evidence was put into the record regarding gender


discrimination, and yet, as you noted in 1976, in


Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, this Court assumed that that was


adequate in order to invoke section (5) authority, or


justify section (5) authority.


QUESTION:  Do -- do you want us to say that


before the Family Medical Leave Act was enacted there was


a discernible pattern of intentional and purposeful


discrimination by the States in violation of the Equal 

Protection Clause with reference to the granting of leave?


MR. DINH:  There was evidence, with respect to


the granting of leave, of such discrimination in the


record before Congress, yes, Your Honor, but in addition


to that, there was a discernible pattern of employment


discrimination that this Court had taken judicial notice


of and Congress had before it and, in particular, Congress


has evidence of employment discrimination based on leave-


taking presumptions that this Court has found to be


illegal.

 QUESTION:  I guess you're thinking under this


Court's cases, which we accept as a given, Congress would


have more leeway to create a remedy for the general


discrimination than it might have if the discrimination,


that if the leave discrimination were at issue?


MR. DINH:  It goes into both the --


QUESTION:  You think there's enough for both,


but the remedial power is greater, is that right?


MR. DINH:  There's no question that under the --


under Kimel the Court has said that difficult, intractable


problems often require more powerful remedies, and that


would certainly be the, how the Court would evaluate --


QUESTION:  It's hard for me to see there's a


discernible pattern of intentional and purposeful


discrimination when in the legislative history of this act 

the States were cited as being in the forefront of


enlightened policies.  That's what the record shows, and


you're up here arguing just the opposite.


MR. DINH:  Your Honor, some States were in the


vanguard, some States were laggards in the granting of


leave policies.


QUESTION:  But the latter was not mentioned.


MR. DINH:  Yes, there -- yes, it was, Your


Honor.  I would refer Your Honor to the United States


brief at pages 36 to 40, and also the brief for the

petitioner at pages 29 through 30, which recounts some of


this -- some of this evidence.


The key here -- but nevertheless, the statement


in the record that you noted was about States' leave


policies, whether or not they had leave policies at all. 


We know 30 States had -- had leave policy.  The position


of the United States rests upon not whether States had


leave policy, but the character of such leave policies.


QUESTION:  Mr. Dinh, would it violate this


statute for a State to provide the 12-week family leave to


men and women both, but also to continue a policy of 6-


week maternity leave?  Would that violate the statute?


MR. DINH:  In addition to a 12-week, Your Honor?


QUESTION:  In addition to the 12 weeks.


MR. DINH: 


6 weeks, if I can characterize the 6 

weeks not as maternity leave, but as pregnancy disability


leave --


QUESTION:  Call it pregnancy disability leave.


MR. DINH:  Well, this is actually a matter of


quite -- quite good -- quite --


QUESTION:  What's in a name?


MR. DINH:  No, no, it is a matter of substance,


not form alone, because pregnancy disability, medically


and in insurance terms --


QUESTION:  No necessity to prove disability,

can't walk, or anything else, just, if you have a child,


you have 6 weeks off.


MR. DINH:  If --

MR. DINH:  If the grant of the additional 6


weeks is on a sex-based basis --


QUESTION:  Well, it is.  It's maternity.  I


mean --


(Laughter.)


MR. DINH:  If that is the case, then that


would -- that may very well violate Title VII.  It would


not violate this particular statute.


QUESTION:  Would it violate the Equal Protection


Clause?


MR. DINH:  Yes, it may very well violate the


Equal Protection Clause if it is above and beyond the


pregnancy disability leave that this Court has recognized


can be accommodated, unconstitutionally though --


QUESTION:  That would solve the problem, unless


your answer is categorically yes, it would violate it,


because then the discrepancy, the 30 percent versus 80


percent that we're talking about would continue.

 MR. DINH:  Well, the -- the key here, Justice


Scalia, is that after the period that is recognized as


pregnancy disability, and therefore constitutional under


Geduldig, beyond that, parental leave, infant care leave


is simply parental leave, and there's no difference


whether the mother or the father takes care of the child.


Indeed, the law would not countenance such a


difference, because that would be relying on the very


presumptions that the law condemns.  And so the key here


is that if there is an additional grant of leave to either


sex beyond the period of pregnancy disability, that would


constitute a violation of Title VII.  It would not


constitute a violation of the FMLA. 


The reason for that is very simple.  The FMLA


was enacted as part of the overall antidiscrimination 

scheme.  It supplements and does not supplant Title VII. 


It paints a little bit more broad -- more broadly than


Title VII in the sense that it grants affirmative leave


rights, but in one further, in one important respect it


paints very much more narrowly, as your -- as your


question to my colleague, Mr. Taggart, had indicated,


Justice Kennedy.  That is because it is very narrowly


tailored to the particular problem that Congress was


facing, which is the problem of employment discrimination


based on leave-taking propensities.  And so in that sense

it is perfectly congruent to the constitutional problem


that Congress was addressing.


Congress could not very well have addressed the


problem of gender-based differentials and the presumptions


in law and in practice that arise from those differentials


by granting additional leave rights only to women, or


granting leave rights only to men that would perpetuate


the discrimination and the presumptions, rather than


eliminate it root and branch.


The key to the money damages is the same key as


it is in our general antidiscrimination statutes.  That


should not be a surprising -- Title VII has the same type


of damage remedies, and the reason for that is that


discrimination, whether it be for race or for gender, is


pervasive and pernicious and historically recognized by 

this Court, and so Congress has made a judgment that it


needs as many hands on deck as possible in order to


enforce the effort to eradicate discrimination, and money


damages is part of the normal remedy in order to ensure


that plaintiffs are made whole and State actors are


deterred from acting unconstitutionally or, in this case,

The fact that -- if I may return to the point


that the fact that it should not be surprising that this

Court assumed in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer that the -- that


Congress had authority under section (5) to include gender


discrimination in Title VII, because in the same year was


the year that the Court for the first time extended


heightened scrutiny in Craig v. Boren, so --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. TAGGART


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. TAGGART:  First, it's important to


distinguish that paternity leave and leave for childbirth


and when a child is adopted is not the question that was


presented to this Court today.


The question presented to this Court is family


leave, and there's certainly no record of family leave


differentials, as has been argued with respect to


parenting leave, and second, it is not possible under any


jurisprudence of this Court to simply presume that State


managers discriminate based upon some stereotype.  Title


VII doesn't do that, the Equal Protection Clause, this


Court's section (1) jurisprudence that interprets the


Equal Protection Clause doesn't do that, the heightened


scrutiny test does not do that, it does not allow someone

to simply presume that State managers are using some --


some outdated stereotype in making their decisions.


The third point I want to make is, it's our


position that one who reads the text and the history of


the Family and Medical Leave Act would hardly recognize


the statute that has been described here today.  This was


simply every-day economic legislation, and upholding the


FMLA would simply tear section (5) from any remedial


moorings by allowing a general legislative power of


Congress to grant economic benefits so long as there is


some incidental benefit to some suspect class.


QUESTION:  You mean holding, upholding money


damages under the FMLA, because I take it you concede, or


don't you, that Nevada is bound to follow this law?


MR. TAGGART: 


Since -- I do concede that, and 

since 1993 Nevada has had a -- a State policy of giving


our workers Federal family medical leave.  We also have


our own State medical leave laws, so States have joined,


and have actually led the Federal Government in providing


family leave for their employees, and to simply say, and


ignore that -- that pattern and say instead that States


are engaged in a pattern of discrimination, or were


engaged in 1993 in a pattern of discrimination, in our


view does not stand up to any of this Court's section (1)


jurisprudence.
