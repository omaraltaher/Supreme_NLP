CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next this morning in Case No. 15-1248, McLane Company v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- excuse me -- EEOC. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Ms. Ho. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HO 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The language and structure of the statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme, the tradition of appellate review, and the sound 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administration of justice all counsel in favor of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewing EEOC's subpoena enforcement decisions for 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse of discretion. 

 

 

            

First, under the statutory scheme, the 

 

 

 

 

 

EEOC's investigative authority is not plenary, like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other agencies, but is cabined by the statutory limit of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevance to the charge under investigation, as this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court said in Shell Oil. 

 

 

 

 

            

Because this inquiry is extraordinarily 

 

 

 

 

contextualized, the district court's fact-intensive 

 

 

 

 

determination should be reviewed under a unitary 

   

 

 

 

 

abuse-of-discretion standard, as this Court has held. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second, the tradition of deferential

appellate review is robust, not only for administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

subpoenas, but also for close analogs, such as search 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants and grand jury subpoenas. 

 

 

 

 

            

Third, the district court is the judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actor best positioned to decide the issue for any number 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of reasons that this Court articulated in Pierce and is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied in subsequent cases.  The fact-intensive and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

context-sensitive --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Pierce you --

  

 

 

 

MS. HO:  -- natures. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Pierce you mentioned. 

  

 

 

 

Rule 11 is another.  A district -- a proceeding is going 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on in the district court.  The district court judge is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intimately familiar with -- with the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But a subpoena enforcement is different.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

comes to the district court cold.  He knows nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the case.  He's not, as he -- in Pierce and in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 11, thoroughly familiar with the parties and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controversy.  It just -- it's an application to enforce 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a subpoena. 

 

            

MS. HO:  I think, your Honor, in -- I think 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

this case shows that an action to enforce a subpoena is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more like those.  And this Court in Highmark talked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the district court living with a case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

In -- in our case, the district court had

experience, not only with the parties in the context of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the subpoena at issue, but also with a parallel 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding that the agency brought under the ADEA, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

had experience in that.  So I think this case shows that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are instances where the district court does live 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a case longer. 

   

 

            

But even if that were not so, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg, I think the other factors in Pierce, and Koon, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Cooter & Gell, and the other cases that this Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has articulated and given, put meat on the -- on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pierce factors. 

 

              

I think perhaps the most important is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact-sensitive, context-sensitive nature which I think 

   

 

 

 

is very much like the other inquiries that -- that Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why -- why was the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way with a fact sensitive, fleeting facts, multifarious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

facts, according to Judge Watford, the pivotal issue is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a legal one; that is, what does relevance mean within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the context of the EEOC's investigatory authority?  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated that as a question of law.  What -- what is the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope of relevance? 

 

 

            

MS. HO:  Your Honor, I think the answer to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that question lies in what is, I think, critical here, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both with respect to the proper standard of -- of review

and the ultimate resolution.  And that is, in this case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevance is determined not in the abstract, but in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relation to the charge under investigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the district court in this circumstance, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just like district courts do when they are determining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevance in the Federal rules context, is looking at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the language of the charge in the context of the facts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the district court and the universe of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation as a whole.  And I think that's -- that's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

likely why, Your Honor, every -- every court of appeals, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

save the Ninth, has reviewed subpoena enforcement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions for abuse of -- of discretion, because there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a close --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they would say, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's a question of law, if the district court got the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law wrong, that is ipso facto an abuse of discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because he has no discretion to misapply the law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HO:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  And I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

believe that is one reason, perhaps the most important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason, why this Court, I think most clearly in Cooter & 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gell, but also in Koon and other cases, embraced a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unitary standard of review for abuse of discretion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because an abuse of discretion standard does allow a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewing court to correct errors of law and errors of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact while still affording appropriate discretion to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So --

  

 

 

7 

MS. HO:  -- the district court. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you clarify for me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what's on appeal?  There are essentially two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulings by the district court, one on the pedigree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information sought -- the name, address, Social Security 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number, et cetera, of the people who had taken the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strength test at issue -- and a second part, a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosure of the reasons for the termination of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees who had failed the test. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As I read the record below, the district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

court did not give a reason for denying the second 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

request.  And the court of appeals basically said, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't under any standard of review credit a non-reason 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for denying something, so we reverse the district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on that. 

 

            

Are you challenging that particular ruling, 

 

 

 

 

 

that reversal of that part of the request? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HO:  Well, what the -- what the Ninth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit did -- and thank you for the opportunity for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarification -- is it -- it reversed and it actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remanded for the district court to make that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination in the first instance.  And I think the --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So are you reversing 

  

 

 

 

 

that?  Are you -- are you appealing that part of the

remand? 

            

MS. HO:  No, Your Honor.  Because we -- we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

did not -- we did not advance an argument for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevance -- or for irrelevance as -- as to -- as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  That was an undue burden -- an undue burden --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So the only 

  

  

 

 

 

 

thing that's at issue here is the district court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to order the release of the pedigree, what I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calling the pedigree information. 

 

 

 

            

MS. HO:  That's correct.  Because the Ninth 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Circuit has already reversed and remanded at -- for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court to make a proper factfinding in the first 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance.  And --

  

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On the second question. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. HO:  On the second. 

  

 

 

 

And -- and our -- our position is that one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference that an abuse of discretion standard makes is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that under an abuse of discretion standard, as opposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the de novo standard that the Ninth Circuit applied, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proper course for a holding that the district court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not apply the correct legal standard as the Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit held here.  We disagree.  But even if that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were -- that were the case, the proper resolution is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reverse and remand for the district court to either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarify what it did and explain, no, that wasn't what I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

was -- I was doing, I did apply the proper standard, or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

to apply the proper standard in the first -- in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first instance. 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why would you remand it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to the district court?  Because if it went back to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit could very well say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we -- we decided a question of law, the scope of what's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant.  We had a footnote that says we -- we applied 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

de -- de novo review.  That's our -- that's our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent. 

            

But nothing in the rest of the opinion seems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to turn on that.  It seems that the Ninth Circuit has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made a ruling of law.  If you remand it to the Ninth 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit, they might -- I expect they would say, we made 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a ruling of law.  And whether it's abuse of discretion 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the same result because the district court made an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error of law. 

 

 

            

MS. HO:  They might say two things, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, and we -- we don't know.  In the footnote, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's -- it's certainly not dispositive, but I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it is telling that the Ninth Circuit did not go on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say, well, we would have reached the same result 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under either standard.  But, again, under the de novo 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard that the Ninth Circuit applied, it was stepping 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the shoes of the district court and making a

Our position is that even if -- under an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse of discretion standard, even if the Ninth Circuit

believed that the district court made an error of law,

district court to apply the proper legal standard in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first instance. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That, I -- I -- I'm -- I've 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

always been somewhat uncertain about that.  You used the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word "relevance," but a fact is relevant if its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

existence makes the conclusion more likely than if it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't exist. 

 

            

Now, under that standard, I guess the EEOC 

   

 

 

 

 

 

or any other agency could require any company, no matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how big or how small, to turn over everything that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ever had because they might find something in there that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would make a discrimination or failure to pay taxes or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some other thing more likely than not.  So we find that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language, and we also find language that say of course 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they can't authorize a fishing expedition. 

   

 

 

 

            

Well, what's the right standard?  What 

  

 

 

 

 

happens, for example, in the subpoena?  What happens? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

What is the standard?

JUSTICE BREYER:  Anything?  They can just go 

  

  

 

 

 

 

11 

into your house and -- I mean, you know, absent the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment protection -- go to a business and say, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we want every document you've ever had.  What stops 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

MS. HO:  This -- what stops that, I think, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

are two features of the statutory scheme here.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first feature is that the standard of relevance is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

free-floating.  It is relevant to the charge --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well --

  

 

 

MS. HO:  -- under investigation --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- relevant to the charge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that a person has already brought.  I mean, can the EEOC 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, you know, we have an idea there are companies in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States that are violating -- and there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could -- probably are -- they are violating various 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

antidiscrimination things.  So what we want to do is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just go to every company in alphabetical order and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interview every employee.  Can they do that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS. HO:  No, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because? 

  

 

MS. HO:  Because -- and I think what Your --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Your Honor is posing is a commissioner's -- is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commissioner's charge. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

MS. HO:  And the -- the EEOC has its own 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

regulations which govern what must be in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commissioner's charge.  And that was actually at issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the seminal Shell Oil case that this Court decided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and interpreted. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So there has to be enough 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

information --

 

            

MS. HO:  So the language -- the language 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this Court used in Shell Oil --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well --

  

 

 

MS. HO:  -- was relevant to the charge under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation and what "relevance" means in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context.  And I don't know that the language is -- is --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is much more clear, but it said that it tends to shed --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can reasonably be expected to shed light on the charge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under investigation. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where does that come from? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. HO:  That comes from Shell Oil.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's the language that courts have -- have used. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Reasonably expected to shed 

  

 

 

 

 

light on the charge under investigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. HO:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So the law is fairly clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that when the EEOC asks for a piece of information, they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to be able to meet that standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MS. HO:  Yes, Your Honor.  And it's the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

EEOC's burden to meet that -- to meet that standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And, again, Your Honor, I think that line -- that line 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of questioning demonstrates how contextualized the 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry is in this context. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you briefly explain 

  

 

 

 

 

what you understand to be the charge here, and why the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so-called pedigree information is not relevant to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge? 

            

            

MS. HO:  Certainly, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

And the charge here, we don't think -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to use the language that I was using with Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer, we don't think that anything the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluation-taker knows or has experienced in this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can shed light on the charge under investigation for two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons. 

            

First, the evaluation itself does not mimic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

job duties.  It was developed, administered, and scored 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by third parties using computer modeling and Labor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department job classifications. 

 

 

            

And second -- and, again, I think this goes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the very fact-specific nature of the examination --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is an isokinetic evaluation.  It's taken on a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

machine, like an exercise machine, that measures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resistance, range of motion and speed, and it provides

14 

resistance equal to the force that you generate.  So --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That may be so, but how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do you answer Judge Watford's simple point, that if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're dealing with a test and in -- both men and women 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have failed it, when you want to ask the test-taker what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened after you -- you failed the test.  Were you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kept on the job?  And the same question to -- to -- put 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that question to men and women.  If it turns out that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the men who failed the test are sometimes kept on, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all the women who failed the test are discharged, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would certainly support the claim of gender-based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination. 

            

MS. HO:  And, Your Honor, in this case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

McLane voluntarily provided all of the information with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to, at that time, the over 14,000 evaluation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

takers. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Except number one --

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HO:  To the --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So -- so there's no way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the -- that the EEOC could contact these people and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask the question that Judge Watford posed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So you flunked the test, what happened to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you after? 

 

            

MS. HO:  Your Honor, the -- the information 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did include gender and it also included the -- the --

took place with respect to that individual. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

So to answer that question, Your Honor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which we -- we don't disagree would be relevant, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information has already been -- been provided to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency.  So the only sort of remaining question on that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I think this is what -- what my friend from -- from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government presses on, is well, we need to talk to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them to find out whether the test serves a legitimate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business purpose. 

 

            

            

And I would share your --

   

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm -- I'm sorry.  I --

    

  

 

 

 

 

I thought I understood that you disclosed who took the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test, who failed it, and whether someone was later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terminated.  But not the reason for the termination. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HO:  That's correct.  And that -- that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is the term --

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so --

  

 

 

 

MS. HO:  -- termination that is back --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't the reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for termination relevant to the charge?  If your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

terminating keeps only women for failing the test, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keeping men and maybe some terminating later for some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other reason, doesn't that show that there's a problem?

MS. KOVNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

Historical and functional considerations 

 

 

 

strongly support an abuse of discretion standard of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review here.  And with respect to the functional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations, if I could turn to Justice Ginsburg's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

question about why district courts are better situated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to address this question even though it comes to them on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a largely documentary record, we think there are a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple reasons. 

 

            

The first is that this Court indicated in

Buford that when a district court just sees a lot more 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

of a fact-specific question, the district court is often 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to have more expertise in answering that question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And this Court has also indicated that when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a determination is very case specific, the costs of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate review are unlikely to justify the benefits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of -- are unlikely to justify the added time and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expense that appellate review takes because a decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

on case-specific facts is unlikely to yield substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits -- substantial guidance for future cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And we think those concerns are really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accentuated here under administrative subpoena 

 

 

 

 

enforcement schemes, because a central purpose of those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

schemes is to get a quick disposition so that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation can move forward.  And that's particularly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

true under Title VII where this Court has repeatedly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphasized in Shell Oil and in the University of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pennsylvania case that delay frustrates the objectives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the statute. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Ms. Kovner, here the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question whether to enforce the subpoena is the whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ball of wax, right?  This is an action to enforce the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subpoena.  So that question is the end-all and be-all of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case. 

 

            

Are there any other contexts in which we use

an abuse of discretion standard for not a subsidiary or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

an ancillary finding or, you know, a partial finding, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

but for the finding that decides the case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Yes, there are.  I mean, so we 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

think the most analogous context to the administer of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subpoena contexts is other subpoena contexts.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're deciding the whole ball of wax, but the decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the district court has reviewed for abuse of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion. 

            

So, example, this Court's decision in Nixon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says trial subpoenas -- pretrial subpoenas under Rule 17 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for information duces tecum, that's reviewed abuse --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for abuse of discretion.  Grand jury subpoenas, courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeals, you know, formally review for abuse of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion. 

            

With respect to other types of 

 

 

 

 

 

determinations, under the Fourth Amendment consent 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions, whether somebody consented to a search is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

going to be dispositive, but that's reviewed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferentially for clear error. 

 

 

 

            

With respect to abuse of discretion, courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeals apply abuse of discretion to, as Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points out, venue decisions, going to be dispositive of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case if there's not venue.  So there are a number of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions that decide the case, but they're reviewed for

abuse of discretion. 

 

 

19 

            

As Justice Ginsburg observes, it's true that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal questions may come up and may be what the actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute is about in a subpoena enforcement case, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

even under an abuse of discretion standard, that piece 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the inquiry is going to be reviewed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you please tell 

  

 

 

 

 

me -- walk me through exactly what you think, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government thinks, is what the court, district court is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing when it makes a decision to enforce a subpoena? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

What are the legal steps?  What are the factual steps? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm not quite sure.  And -- and then embodied in that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your -- Petitioner says there's an undue burden part of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this test as well.  I don't know where that comes from 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it certainly doesn't come from Morton Salt or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shell Oil. 

 

            

 

 

So you tell me what you think is at issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Yes, Your Honor.  We think 

  

  

 

 

 

 

there are five questions that the Court is answering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it decides --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- and tell me where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're getting that from.  I mean your standard.  Okay? 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  So four pieces of it come 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from Shell Oil, and they are that the charge is valid, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the information that's being sought is relevant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the charge, that the subpoena is not too indefinite, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

that there's no improper purpose. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, the Court in Shell Oil didn't mention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this unduly burdensome piece of the inquiry, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court relied on the Morton Salt standard, and Morton 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Salt suggests that that unduly burdensome inquiry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists.  So courts of appeals have uniformly said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's an unduly burdensome overlay on that as well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So they are the five pieces. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We think that all five of them involve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application of law to particular facts.  They involve 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case-specific determinations that involve looking at a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular charge, a particular subpoena, considering 

   

 

 

 

the relationship between those things, and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering any submissions of that burden that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company makes.  So we think these are all the kind of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case-specific determinations that are particularly 

 

 

 

 

well-suited to district courts. 

 

 

 

            

If I could turn to the second piece of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  The Court certainly has discretion to just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

address the standard of review question and then remand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But we think it's entirely appropriate here to simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirm the decision of the court of appeals, because we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think this is a relatively straightforward relevance 

   

 

 

 

 

question where the district court just made a legal

error in not applying the test that Justice Breyer is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of could this information shed light on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge, but instead demanding more.  Demanding that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

essentially there be a necessity for the information and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

that's just not the right legal test. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

As the court of appeals indicated --

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could you explain to us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your view of how -- how this information, the names of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the test-takers, would shed -- shed light on the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge? 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  So we think there are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

two -- two ways.  The first has to do with disparate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact, and the second has to do with disparate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treatment.  May I take the second one first? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

As -- as Your Honor observed, as Judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Watford said, in order to figure out whether disparate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treatment occurred here, you need to talk to test-takers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and see whether male and female test-takers were treated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same. 

 

            

And if I could just clarify why the existing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

record doesn't shed light on that.  You can see at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 33A of the petition appendix, what the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court ordered to be turned over, and it's whether an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adverse employment action was taken within 60 days. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well, what we don't have is, was that action

termination, which is the action that occurred here, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

what was the reasons for the termination, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company's -- there's obviously litigation ongoing, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the company says that turning that over would be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undue burden.  So in order to figure out what happened 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with these applicants, we really do need to talk to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicants and the test-takers. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  That's the part I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

don't understand.  I mean, it's -- there's a woman who 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

says, I took a test, physical, and I failed it.  Period. 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

And she was terminated.  She doesn't say that they are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treating women more harshly.  She doesn't say that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't a qualified reason. 

   

 

            

            

MS. KOVNER:  Well, she's --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Saying so -- you could have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that every day of the week.  People are terminated for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failing tests, and they can come in and complain.  Now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at that point, the agency doesn't just say, let's find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some samples, let's do a little sampling here and see 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how this is being applied.  Let's go invite -- let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interview a few people at random and see what these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tests are about.  Rather, they say we want to talk to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every single employee in the company. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, hey.  What's the basis for that on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the basis of that information?  Why isn't that an undue

burden? 

            

            

            

23 

MS. KOVNER:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MS. KOVNER:  So I think there are two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

pieces; one is, is it relevant, and the second is, is it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an undue burden. 

 

 

            

With respect to whether it's relevant, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think if you look at page 39 of our brief, this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has said time and again --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course it's always 

  

 

 

 

 

relevant when anyone complains about anything to go and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see if really there's something suspicious going on by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interviewing every single employee, even if there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

500,000 employees.  You can't say that an answer might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not make it more likely.  That's why I was looking at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undue burden. 

 

            

And I would think maybe you have to do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something before you would decide to spend -- require 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the company to spend millions of dollars to get every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single employee on tape or something.  I mean, something 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than that.  That -- that's what I want to know. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How does -- what about that? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  That's right.  So I think 

   

  

  

 

 

whenever the information is relevant, and I think, as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your Honor alludes to, it's clearly relevant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

interview other employees and see if this policy is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

being administered the same.  The overlay that Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

created is that overlay of is it burdensome to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company to give you that information.  And here, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's pretty clear why Petitioner abandoned the argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's an undue burden to produce the pedigree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information.  The names and the Social Security numbers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these individuals were already in the records that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the company had of the tests.  The company stripped out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that information.  It went to added burden to not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide us with the information to identify these people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by name and Social Security numbers. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Additional information like addresses was 

 

 

 

 

also already in company databases with respect to all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the people who were employed by the company.  So --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As you say, Counsel, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there is a bit of tension between your position that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse-of-discretion is the appropriate standard because 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court is more familiar with the proceedings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and all that, and that we should make a ruling on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there was an abuse of discretion as a matter of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law without any intervening review. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Well, we think that in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrow class of cases where the decision rested on an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual legal error, and where it's clear what the

appropriate relevance determination is, it's 

 

 

 

 

25 

appropriate, then, for a court of appeals, or in this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, this Court --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, relevance 

  

 

 

 

determination is something that is pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

fact-intensive. 

            

MS. KOVNER:  That -- that's right.  But we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

think that this is actually a relatively clear case for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reasons that the court of appeals set out.  We're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking the basic --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It was -- I'm left at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moment -- I'll go back and read it.  I just don't know. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's simply when I read this, it struck me as I haven't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seen something like this where all that happened was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody come -- came in in one place and says, I took a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test and failed it, and then they start to interview 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody in the whole company.  I mean, that --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundreds, thousands.  I mean, something struck me as odd 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

about that. 

 

            

So when the district judge then said this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an undue burden or they can't do it, they have to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than this, I was reluctant to say this is an abuse 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of discretion, even though he thinks, you know, it's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right thing to do.  I mean, that's what judges are there 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for in the district courts.

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. KOVNER:  So -- so with respect to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

geographic scope, Your Honor, I think it's really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

important that we didn't initially seek this information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to the entire company.  We sought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

information that was limited to information about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test that was complained about at the particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facility in question, in Goodyear, Arizona, where this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person was employed. 

 

 

            

It's only when the company came in and said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our defense here, our explanation is we have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide policy, and we are using this test in all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our facilities that we sought information in a broader 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

geographic scope. 

 

            

And if we could just touch on one other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why this information is relevant.  It's with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to a disparate impact theory.  The crucial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question under a disparate impact theory in this case is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely to be is this practice justified by business 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessity.  And in order to know that, you have to know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether this strength test, which seems to be exerting a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial disparate impact on male and female 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees, is actually representing the skills that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need in order to -- to perform these jobs.  Because if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is a strength test that doesn't correlate to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work that you have to perform as an employee, then it's

not justified by business necessity.  And interviewing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

people who actually do this job is a way to determine 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could you say a little bit, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Ms. Kovner, about how it is that you're persuaded that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court did make a legal determination that was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

affecting its judgment, as opposed to maybe using some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

careless words, but was really making a relevancy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

determination? 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Yes, your Honor.  So I think 

   

  

  

 

 

 

the key portion of the district court's opinion is on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 29 to 30 of the petition appendix.  And what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court says is, I'm not persuaded that this is relevant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the reason why I'm not persuaded this is relevant is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there's an additional step that the agency could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take to investigate whether this charge of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory first, and that's to conduct a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statistical analysis and use statistical information to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shed light on the charge.  So we think that's just an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorrect understanding of relevance.  It's a necessity 

   

  

 

 

 

test.  And this Court has pretty clearly rejected the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessity test.  It's not the test in Shell Oil.  It's a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test that this Court rejected in University of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pennsylvania, where the petitioner there was looking for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a much narrower necessity test, and the Court said

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD 

 

 

 

 

 

           

FOR COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE 

 

 

 

              

DEFENDING THE JUDGMENT BELOW 

 

 

 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

There can be no abuse-of-discretion review 

 

 

 

 

 

if the district court has no discretion.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

vested the EEOC, not the district court, with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion to determine if particular relevance --

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular evidence is relevant to the charge.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion cannot reside in two places. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The D.C. circuit said it best:  Where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

deference is owed to the agency, including in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application of law to fact, it is, quote, "analytically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible," unquote, for the court of appeals to defer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the district court if the district court disagrees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the agency. 

 

 

            

That case is -- that's not in our brief.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did supply the parties with a copy.  It's Novicki v. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cook, 946 F.2d 938 1991.

And why is the party's double-discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

theory analytically impossible?  So the government says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with regard to relevance, that the district court must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce the subpoena unless the EEOC is obviously wrong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the court of appeals must uphold that determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absent an abuse of discretion, i.e., the district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must be obviously wrong in holding that the EEOC is or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not obviously wrong. 

 

 

 

            

That framework is not only illogical, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unworkable.  If the district court disagrees with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

EEOC, and the court of appeals must defer to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court's putative discretion, than the court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals denies the EEOC the full measure of its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion. 

            

Conversely, if the district court upholds 

 

 

 

 

 

the subpoena, then the court of appeals gives excessive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference to the EEOC.  It cannot reverse simply because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the EEOC is obviously wrong.  It's only if both the EEOC 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the -- and the district court are obviously wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress did not adopt that scheme. 

 

 

 

 

 

Instead, Congress prescribed the standard that denies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion to the district court.  Section 6 of the APA 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides that the district court shall sustain an agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subpoena if it is in accordance with law.  That is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

typical judicial review where the courts, district and

appellate, police the lines in which the agency must

operate. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'll -- I'll look up the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, but in an evidentiary case, civil case or a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal case, the question of relevance, I suppose at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the end of the day, relevance is a legal matter.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't we give substantial deference to the trial court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in order to administer the trial in an orderly way?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so don't we give substantial deference to their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevance ruling?  And how is that applicable here or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inapplicable? 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  It's applicable, and it 

  

 

 

 

 

supports my position about double discretion. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Relevance is a judgment about the 

   

 

 

 

relationship of certain evidence to a claim.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

because it's a judgment of relationship, there always 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is, in the primary decision maker, some discretionary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment about how to apply the legal -- the legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  In discovery and trial evidence, that primary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision maker is the trial court, and therefore, its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determinations of relevance are -- are reviewed for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse of discretion. 

 

 

            

In this context, the primary decision maker, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the one with discretion, is the EEOC.  And so it is its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion that is reviewed simply for whether or not it

Alderson Reporting Company

has crossed the legal lines.  A district court does not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have discretion to tell an independent branch of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government conducting an investigation, you can't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that evidence.  It can simply refuse to enforce in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal subpoena. 

 

            

            

And -- and two-stage review under the APA --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Why 

  

  

 

 

 

isn't that telling them they can't have that evidence? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  It's telling them because 

  

 

 

 

 

they're drawing the legal line and saying, you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross that line.  That's different from exercising 

  

 

 

 

 

 

discretion about whether evidence is relevant.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

discretion belongs wholly to the EEOC. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if the line 

  

 

 

 

 

 

depends on relevance, it's exactly the same thing:  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

telling them whether it's relevant or not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, that's why the courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have adopted a standard of "obviously wrong." 

   

 

 

 

 

"Obviously wrong" is not a discretionary determination. 

   

 

 

 

 

So the district court really has no discretion.  And in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-stage review under the APA, it is always the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the district court and the appellate courts apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same standard of review to agency action, whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferential or not. 

 

 

            

But here, under the in-accordance-with-law

theory, that means this is illegal or not, that should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be the same standard applied in the district court and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

in the -- in the court of appeals.  It's a legal line, a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal determination.  And nothing in Title VII departs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from that. 

 

            

Now, the parties have said that this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual determination, fact-intensive determination of 

 

 

 

 

relevance.  It is not.  The EEOC has submitted here no 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declarations on relevance.  It was all attorney argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a motion.  And the reason is that relevance is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceptual -- especially in the agency subpoena 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context -- is a conceptual determination of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

relationship to the charge of a category of evidence of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unknown content.  And so it is not making a factual 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination from evidence; it's a legal theory of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential value of the evidence to the EEOC. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What about the nature of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge, the contours of the charge?  Isn't that factual? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, that's legal.  I think 

    

  

 

 

 

that it's --

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Contours of the charge in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular case is a legal question? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  Absolutely.  You cannot look 

  

  

 

 

 

at extrinsic evidence.  It's just analyzing the text of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the charge.  And I think that courts are fairly

33 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the 

  

 

 

 

 

burden on the other party?  It would seem to me that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court would have a considerable degree of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

familiarity with the nature of the -- the defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operations, how burdensome it is in light of what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've produced so far. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  And that's an analytically 

  

 

 

 

 

separate inquiry.  That's a Fourth Amendment inquiry. 

   

  

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor, earlier you asked, and we quote --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's the Donovan case says that the undue burden is part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Fourth Amendment requirement --

 

 

 

 

 

            

Salt and --

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I think she said Morton 

    

 

 

 

 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Morton Salt is --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  And I -- it doesn't 

   

  

  

 

 

 

have to be constitutional, I -- I would think.  Let's --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

regardless, I think that's something of a red herring. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

I don't think an agency, even if it's constitutional, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can impose undue burdens.  I can't imagine law to the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary. 

            

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So isn't that -- what about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question was asked?

Honor, I think that's not true. 

   

 

 

 

34 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, okay.  Is the answer 

  

  

 

 

 

 

just, well, that's constitutional; therefore, it doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

count, or whatever? 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The other --

  

 

 

 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, it's constitutional, 

  

 

 

 

and constitutional should be de novo.  But my -- my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point is that Congress has said the EEOC shall have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access to this evidence on two conditions, neither of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which have anything to do with burden. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So in other 

  

  

 

 

 

 

words, in your view, the law is that the -- an agency, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when somebody complains about anything, can go and ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if that's anywhere in the agency -- anywhere in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company and ask every single employee and require them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to spend millions of dollars because, after all, it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant.  Is that the -- your --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, there's a Fourth 

   

  

 

 

Amendment limitation on that, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Fourth Amendment, let's --

  

 

 

 

 

let's take -- I mean, there's some places don't --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment.  And, therefore, the Court has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

review it.

Fourth Amendment determinations are de novo --

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see how we'd do it, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

frankly.  I mean, you know, there are thousands of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

district courts.  They -- they hear these things at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

length.  We don't have the time to do all that.  We're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at a cold record.  They have the lawyers in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

front of them.  The lawyers can explain what went on in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the agency and they can take their time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You, unfortunately for us, 

  

 

 

 

 

because you wrote an excellent brief, only have about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 -- 20 minutes or so. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

difference? 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so do you see the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, to be clear, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, the fact question of what the burden is, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewed for clear error, just like in the Ornelas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historical fact questions.  And by the way, that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimal proof.  It's just the cost in terms of staff or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resources to produce the information and what's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect on operations or finances of the company. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

My point there is that the Court will take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the finding as given for clear error.  The -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional rule is, is this excessive?  Is it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

constitutionally excessive relevant to the public 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

purpose?  And like all constitutional excessiveness 

  

 

 

 

 

determinations, under Bajakajian or Cooper Industries, 

 

 

 

 

 

that's de novo. 

 

 

            

The other element of the Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim in proper purpose, this Court said in Clark, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a question of law.  And then specificity of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

subpoena, that's a question of law.  There is no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional issue decided here, but relevance has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been decided. 

 

            

            

And I would only point out --

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I -- I --

    

   

  

 

 

under 401, which is a discovery rule, we review that for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevance for abuse of discretion. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why is that any 

  

 

 

 

 

different here than it is under Rule 401? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  Because the -- the district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court is -- has the -- is the initial decision-maker in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining relevance, because relevance is inherently a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary judgment about the relationship of 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence to a claim.  There always will, be with the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

primary decision-maker, discretion.  It's the EEOC that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has that discretion here. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if we take the -- so

you don't have a problem in saying that it's within the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion of the district court reviewing the EEOC --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

            

            

            

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- to decide relevancy? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No.  I'm saying --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- and it's only the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court of appeals, then, who has to review it as a matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of law?  I'm a little --

   

  

 

 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm a little --

   

  

 

 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  I'm sorry that I wasn't 

   

  

 

 

 

clear.  The -- the EEOC makes the initial determination 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of whether particular evidence, such as pedigree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, is relevant to a charge.  They're the ones 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that make that discretionary determination.  When it --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but the discretion can only reside in one place.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it comes up --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It doesn't under 401. 

  

 

 

 

 

Under 401, it resides both in the district court and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- on the -- in the court of appeals as an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse-of-discretion standard of review. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  No.  The court of appeals --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

as I understand it, the district court has discretion, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

will rule it relevant or not, and the court of appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will say, is that an abuse of discretion, right?  And

it's notable here that Congress actually denied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

abuse-of-discretion review to the district court.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't use the Section 10(e) arbitrary and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capriciousness abuse of discretion or 

 

 

 

 

in-accordance-with-law.  It limited the district court's 

  

 

 

 

 

inquiry for subpoena enforcement to whether it was in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordance with law.  And the legislative history is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite clear that they did it so that they wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revisit the discretionary determinations of the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  You're only preventing illegal action. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And that's why in two-stage review, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court always applies the same standard as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court of appeals in review of agency action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Kinnaird, do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think that your whole argument might be taking the words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"abuse of discretion" a bit too literally?  In other 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

words, your idea is that you can never use that term 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless there is some discretion, some real choice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KINNAIRD:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, you know, it might be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that sometimes we use that term when that's not really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true, but what we just mean to say is that a certain 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount of deference should be given because the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because we're at the right institution to make a -- to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make a particular kind of judgment.

MR. KINNAIRD:  Right.  Well, I think if 

   

  

  

 

 

39 

you're looking to institution -- first of all, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there has to be discretion to be abuse of discretion.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think there has to be.  But if you're looking just at a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functional analysis of, you know, how you draw the line 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to cabin the -- the EEOC's discretion, there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institutional advantage.  This appellate court can 

  

 

 

 

 

construe the charge, construe the subpoena, and resolve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the legal claims of the potential value of unknown 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence just as well as a district court.  These are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply not factual determinations. 

 

 

 

            

Pedigree information is a perfect example of 

   

 

 

 

 

that.  And -- because there should be -- pedigree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information is basically saying it's relevant to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interviewed, test taking if you're investigating --

 

 

 

 

 

 

excuse me, and interview test-takers if you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigating a charge of discriminatory testing.  That 

   

  

 

 

 

is not a determination that should vary from district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge to district judge.  There really is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary determination, and the APA forecloses it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I would also point out there is real no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument in terms of practical considerations about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inducing additional appeals by adopting de novo review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First of all, as a practical matter, in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

last 25 years, our research discloses only 6 Ninth

Circuit EEOC subpoena enforcement decisions out of 37 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

total.  So that's only 16 percent, less than its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normal -- normal 20 percent share of appeals.  And one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not expect otherwise.  Standard review is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to deter an appeal.  It's going to shift the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battleground, as it did here, from fights about whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is discretionary to whether it's an implied use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of an erroneous legal concept, and the problem is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that because relevance is a question of law and not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of discretion, for the appellate courts to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiring into whether there was abuse of discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply distorts appellate decision making. 

 

 

 

 

            

This should be -- this is about vindicating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the congressional scheme for the balance of power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between agencies and courts, and courts police the legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits on agency action.  That's something that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

appellate courts are just as capable of doing and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to respect discretion, because if you recognize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion in the district court you ipso facto diminish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the discretion of the EEOC. 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd also like to address one point on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment.  Both parties say it's not Ornelas. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's the de novo review that applies, but rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Illinois v. Gates, where this Court held that courts

should review that decision deferentially. 

 

 

 

 

            

Gates supports our position, and the reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

is that the analogue to the magistrate issuing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subpoena is -- or issuing the warrant is the EEOC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issuing the subpoena.  The district court reviews the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

magistrate's decision deferentially, just as it reviews 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the EEOC's decision deferentially. 

 

 

 

            

But on appeal, the court of appeals applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same deferential Gates standard to the magistrate as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court, meaning that it engages in de novo 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review of the district courts's decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I am aware of no -- no support, either in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Fourth Amendment, I don't -- or in administrative 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

law for this idea of double discretion or double 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference.  This would be the first time that a district 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court has been -- would be given deference over Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment considerations and where the -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court of appeals is enjoined to give deference both to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court and the court of appeals.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that simply destroys appellate decision making, deprives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it of any coherence, and this Court should affirm the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district -- affirm the court of appeals.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HO 

 

 

 

 

 

                

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. HO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Let me make one point and then, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor, respond to your -- your questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I heard both my friend Mr. Kinnaird and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and my friend from the government make very categorical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutist statements about a case -- about cases that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve testing, and the cases that involve testing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pedigree information will always be relevant. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This is a case that shows that facts matter. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And we don't dispute that in a case where you have a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test that mimics job duties or involves subjectivity, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps talking to people would shed light on the charge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under investigation. 

 

            

But in this case, this evaluation that is at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, talking to people simply can't shed light on it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it doesn't mimic job duties and everyone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experiences the test the same way, so I think that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underscores the importance --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't -- I don't follow 

    

   

 

 

 

that.  I still -- going back to what Judge Watford said, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he said we don't know why these people were terminated.

terminated for a reason having nothing to do with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

flunking the test. 

 

 

            

But what the Ninth Circuit said is -- is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must be responded to is, were the men and women who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flunk the test treated the same.  And we can't know that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without talking to the people, finding out whether they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were discharged because of the test or for some other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason. 

            

MS. HO:  Two responses to that, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

But first, I think it's important to underscore that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data that McLane voluntarily provided to the agency, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data does disclose whether -- it discloses the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gender, men or women, it discloses who passed or who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failed, and it also discloses whether any adverse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment action was taken within 90 days.  So the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but adverse --

  

 

 

 

 

adverse employment action can cover a wide range.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't necessarily mean discharge. 

 

 

 

            

MS. HO:  And -- and, Your Honor, perhap --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps that is why the district court in our said -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our case did not -- did not -- said information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depending on what the data shows may -- may be relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depending on the facts that are uncovered.

time with your answer.  I've never heard of any test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's given that's not in some way job-related.  I mean 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

--

            

MS. HO:  And I apologize for being --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You can -- you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

basically give a test that says is your hair true blonde 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not? 

 

            

MS. HO:  No -- no, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And even though it has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

no relationship to the job, you can give that test and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fire people basically because they are not true blonds? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HO:  May I respond --

   

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

            

MS. HO:  Mr. Chief Justice? 

  

 

 

 

            

No.  That's not our position.  And I think 

   

  

  

 

 

 

the distinction we're drawing, we -- we absolutely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintain that there is a business purpose.  There's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

business necessity for the evaluation. 

 

 

 

 

            

That is a separate question from how the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

evaluation operates, and the evaluation here does not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mimic job duties, which in a line of cases courts have

This case -- this evaluation, it does

that affects whether talking to people who have taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the evaluation can say something that will shed light on
