 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear 


argument next in Number 03-1027, Donald Rumsfeld 


versus Jose Padilla.  Mr. Clement. 


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 


 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 


9 

it please the Court: 


10

 Unlike the Hamdi case, which raised not 


11 

only the question of the President's and the 


12 

military's authority to detain, but also questions 


13 

the process and access to counsel.  This case raises 


14 

only two relatively discrete questions, first, 


15 

whether the habeas petition in this case, challenging 


16 

Padilla's present physical confinement in South 


17 

Carolina, was properly filed in Manhattan, rather 


18 

than against the immediate custodian in South 


19 

Carolina, and second, whether the President has the 


20 

authority to detain a citizen who travels abroad, 


21 

affiliates and associates with the enemy abroad, 


22 

receives training in enemy camps in wiring and 


23 

explosives and then returns to the United States at 


24 

the direction of the enemy to commit hostile and 


25 

warlike acts.

9 

 Now, there are many aspects of this case 


that raise issues that are really extraordinary, but 


the habeas petition that was filed in this case was a 


standard, indeed ordinary, use of the writ to 


challenge the prisoner's present physical confinement 


and the habeas rules are settled that when the writ 


is used to challenge the present physical 


confinement, the proper custodian, the proper 


respondent, is the immediate custodian and the suit 


10 

should be filed in the district where that custodian 


11 

is present. 


12

 In other words, in a case to your present 


13 

physical confinement, the case should be filed in the 


14 

district of confinement. 


15

 QUESTION:  May I ask you on that point, 


16 

Mr. Clement, supposing this petition had been filed 


17 

while he was still in New York, and then he was 


18 

removed to South Carolina.  Would the petition be 


19 

okay, then? 


20

 MR. CLEMENT:  There would be jurisdiction 


21 

in that case, Justice Stevens, under the Endo 


22 

decision.  Now, I think in that case, there would 


23 

still be a question, especially if there was the, the 


24 

habeas petition was filed and he was immediately 


25 

removed, there would still be the question of venue 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

at that point and there is a Seventh Circuit case 

that's not in the briefs but Ross against Mebane that 

you may want to look at that says that in a case like 

that presumptively --

 QUESTION:  I'm not quite sure what your 

6 

answer is to my question. 

7

8 

9 

10

11

 MR. CLEMENT:  Oh, my answer is 

jurisdiction yes, under this Court's decision in 

Endo. 

 QUESTION: I see. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  But then there would still 

12 

be a subsidiary question that's not raised here about 

13 

venue. 

14

 QUESTION:  Which the government would 

15 

presumably would be free to raise. 

16

 MR. CLEMENT:  Exactly, and we would raise 

17 

in the case where there was in fact jurisdiction. 

18

19

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  But in this case our 

20 

position is there is no jurisdiction whatsoever, and 

21 

I think that --

22

 QUESTION:  Jurisdiction under the Habeas 

23 

Statutes has been a bit of a confusion because, for 

24 

instance, on behalf of aliens, I think we have 

25 

allowed jurisdiction to be obtained in the manner it 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

5 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

was here, have we not? 


2

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

 MR. CLEMENT: No, I don't think so, Justice 


O'Connor.  I don't know which case have you in mind, 


but I'm aware of no case of this Court that takes the 


unprecedented step that the court below took, which 


is basically to allow a habeas petition to go forward 


in a case where neither the prisoner nor the 


custodian is in the jurisdiction where the habeas 


petition is filed. 


10

 QUESTION:  What do you do with ex parte 


11 

Endo? 


12

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, as 


13 

I was suggesting to Justice Stevens, that case 


14 

involves a kind of unique situation where a habeas 


15 

petition is filed, challenging a certain kind of 


16 

confinement, and then after the petition is filed, 


17 

and after jurisdiction attaches, the prisoner is 


18 

moved.  In that case, it was an individual moved from 


19 

California to --


20

 QUESTION:  They never, they never named 


21 

any custodian in that case, did they? 


22

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't know for sure, 


23 

Mr. Chief Justice, but I would say a couple of 


24 

things.  One is on the immediate custodian rule, I 


25 

think that is a rule that perhaps the government 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

6 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

could waive in a case, and so if you have a situation 


- - -  


 In a way Hamdi is that case where when the 


habeas petition in Hamdi was filed, he was being 


detained in Norfolk, which was in the Eastern 


District of Virginia.  It did not matter in that case 


whether the immediate custodian was Paulette, who is 


the brig, the commander of the brig, or Rumsfeld 


because in the government's view, they are both 


10 

territorially present in the Eastern District of 


11 

Virginia. 


12

 So the immediate custodian rule I think is 


13 

something that government can waive.  I don't think 


14 

that the territorial jurisdiction limit on the 


15 

courts, though, is something that the government is 


16 

in a position to waive.  I think that is a 


17 

restriction on the power of the court to issue the 


18 

writ of habeas, and again, as I was indicating --


19

 QUESTION:  Well, is there a circuit split 


20 

on whether aliens can name the attorney general? 


21

 MR. CLEMENT:  Yes, Justice O'Connor. 


22 

There is a circuit split on that issue, and I think 


23 

in some ways that issue is sort of tied up with this 


24 

case, though even there as I understand most of those 


25 

cases, there is a case from the Ninth Circuit called 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

7 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8

Armentero, which in the government's view goes the 


wrong way.  There is favorable precedent in the Sixth 


Circuit, the First Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit, 


but even the Ninth Circuit, I think, envisions a case 


where they view the attorney general as the proper 


custodian, but they, you know, it's not clear where 


they think that individual can be served. 


 Now, I suppose that the Ninth Circuit 


9 

applying that rule might also take the unprecedented 


10 

step here.  It's also true if you want a sort of 


11 

sense of the potential for abuse in these cases, I 


12 

think you could point to the Ninth Circuit case where 


13 

the Ninth Circuit held that the Central District of 


14 

California had habeas jurisdiction over a claim filed 


15 

by a petitioner in Guantanamo.  I mean, obviously 


16 

there is the issue that this Court has, but there is 


17 

a question of if there were jurisdiction, I wouldn't 


18 

have thought that it lay in the Central District of 


19 

California. 


20

 And I think that happens when you relax 


21 

these traditional rules.  And I think particularly in 


22 

a case like --


23

 QUESTION:  Where does jurisdiction lie for 


24 

someone in Guantanamo, do you suppose? 


25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, if, let me answer the 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

8 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3

4

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

question this way, which is if you had a citizen in 


Guantanamo. 


 QUESTION:  Yes. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  And under this Court's cases 


like Toth against Quarles and Burns against Wilson, 


that citizen is unable to file a habeas petition. 


Our view is that the proper place to file that would 


be either in the Eastern District of Virginia, if you 


were naming the Secretary of Defense or if were you 


10 

naming some official present in the district, you 


11 

would sue in the District of Columbia. 


12

 But the important thing is even in that 


13 

case, the court where you filed the petition would 


14 

have jurisdiction, territorial jurisdiction over the 


15 

Respondent and what is so anomalous here is in a 


16 

sense, it doesn't, I mean it matters to us in the 


17 

sense that we think the proper Respondent is 


18 

Commander Marr, but even if you assume the proper 


19 

Respondent here is secretary Rumsfeld, the case still 


20 

shouldn't be brought in the Southern District of New 


21 

York. It should be brought in the Eastern District of 


22 

Virginia. 


23

 QUESTION:  But why?  Why, what difference 


24 

does it make to the government where they defend? 


25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think there are a 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

9 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

number of --


2

 QUESTION:  I mean, there are offices all 


3 

over the country. 


4

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

 MR. CLEMENT: I think that's right, Justice 


Stevens.  I think it only makes sense to have the 


defense mounted in the place where the detention is 


taking place.  And I think that's particularly true 


in this case, because this isn't a petition that only 


challenges the fact of confinement.  If you look at 


10 

the, the petition in this case, the amended petition, 


11 

joint appendix page 56, the relief that's sought here 


12 

also goes to the conditions of confinement in 


13 

Commander Marr's brig.  Now, in a case like that, it 


14 

seems --


15

 QUESTION:  Yes, but I'm not sure that's, 


16 

that's appropriate relief in a habeas petition, 


17 

anyway. 


18

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think you can file a 


19 

mixed petition and seek that kind of relief, but in 


20 

any event, I think that what they are looking for is 


21 

not just release from detention, but the stopping of 


22 

the interrogations. 


23

 QUESTION:  -- how this particular case was 


24 

pleaded, which it wasn't, because we don't have any 


25 

flushing out of this, but you keep talking about 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

7

9

jurisdiction and it seems to me, this is essentially 


a venue question.  There is no question that Federal 


courts have habeas jurisdiction.  They have that 


authority. 


 And you are talking about not the large 


question, what kind of case can a Federal court hear, 


you are talking about a where question, not a what 


question.  So it's essentially a venue question. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  I mean, unless the word 


10 

essentially is going to bear a tremendous amount of 


11 

weight, I disagree because I think that what you have 


12 

here is not general venue principles.  You have a 


13 

situation where the relevant statute that gives 


14 

courts habeas jurisdiction restricts their ability to 


15 

issue the writ to their territorial jurisdiction. 


16 

And this Court has been clear in cases like Carbo and 


17 

this is even consistent in Justice Rutledge's dissent 


18 

in the Ahrens case, that for that provision to have 


19 

any meaning at an irreducible minimum, it has to mean 


20 

that a writ that goes to the proper custodian has to 


21 

be filed within the territorial jurisdiction of the 


22 

District Court. 


23

 QUESTION:  Although, if the prisoner is 


24 

moved, so prisoner goes someplace else, they still 


25 

have jurisdiction over the case, although the 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

11

1

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

original custodian no longer has the prisoner in his 


or her care. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  That's right, Justice 


Ginsburg.  And this Court decided that in Endo long 


before Ahrens when it reaffirmed an even stricter 


rule and there is nothing in the post-Ahrens cases 


that suggests that this Court has ever deviated from 


this understanding.  And indeed I would point the 


Court to the decision in Schlanger against Seamans, 


10 

because I think in some ways, it shows how, that that 


11 

case really decided this issue, because what the 


12 

court there had was an individual who was trying to 


13 

get ROTC scholarship in Arizona, but he was assigned 


14 

to a unit in Alabama, and he filed his habeas 


15 

petition in Arizona, and he named as Respondents an 


16 

individual in Arizona who had no custody over him 


17 

whatsoever, so that individual was out.  He also 


18 

named the Secretary of the Air Force.  The court did 


19 

not rely on that, and the court said that his true 


20 

custodian is his commanding officer in Georgia, and 


21 

what this Court said is there was no jurisdiction in 


22 

Arizona over that custodian in Georgia, and just to 


23 

be clear about it, the Court noted and rejected an 


24 

argument based on 28 U.S.C. 1391(e), which among 


25 

other things provides nationwide service of process 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

12 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

against Federal officials. 


2

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

 Now, if that statute had applied, then it 


would have been perfectly appropriate to bring the 


case in Arizona against a Georgia Respondent who was 


a Federal officer.  But the Court said no.  1391(e) 


does not trump the habeas statute.  Now, if that is 


true of a Federal statute that provides for 


nationwide service of process, it seems like it would 


be true a fortiori for Federal Rule of Civil 


10 

Procedure 4.  But that's the theory under which the 


11 

courts below exercised jurisdiction in this case. 


12

 QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Clement, is Schlanger 


13 

still good law after Strait and Braden? 


14

 MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  And 


15 

I think the best evidence of that, there is two 


16 

things I'd like to point to.  But maybe the simplest 


17 

way is that both Strait and Braden cite Schlanger 


18 

favorably and, indeed, if you look at the very end of 


19 

the Braden opinion, when the court says that the 


20 

proper Respondent there is within the court's service 


21 

of process, it sites Schlanger for that proposition, 


22 

which makes sense because in that case the petition 


23 

was properly filed, challenging a Kentucky detainer 


24 

in Kentucky, so the proper Respondent was within the 


25 

territorial jurisdiction of the court in that case. 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

 The second reason I would say that 


Schlanger is very much good law as we pointed out in 


our reply brief, is that the court in Schlanger went 


out of its way, because at that point, Ahrens was 


sort of already teetering on the verge of 


obsolescence, to state that the rule would be exactly 


the same even under Justice Rutledge's view in 


Ahrens, so I think for those two reasons, Schlanger 


continues to be good law, and clearly would trump any 


10 

service of process that would be provided by Rule 4. 


11

 And I think, and this is consistent with 


12 

what the unanimous three-judge court in the Fourth 


13 

Circuit said in the Hamdi case, that particularly in 


14 

cases that raise such sensitive issues as the cases 


15 

that are involved on the merits in this case, it is 


16 

particularly important that the court try to avoid 


17 

unnecessarily reaching Constitutional issues by first 


18 

ascertaining that it has jurisdiction.  Now, if I --


19

 QUESTION:  You recognize that it isn't a 


20 

jurisdiction question like, can the Federal courts 


21 

entertain this kind of suit.  Can they entertain a 


22 

fender bender between people from the same state? 


23 

No.  Can they entertain Federal habeas cases.  So we 


24 

have one Federal system, and there are classes of 


25 

cases that can go into that system and then we have 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

3

5 

6 

7 

8 

9

an allocation of where, so this isn't jurisdiction 


writ large, it is where in this Federal system do you 


bring this case? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Ginsburg, its 


statutory jurisdiction, but I agree.  It is at some 


level it is a which District Court question, not 


whether District Courts are open to these claims at 


all. 


 QUESTION:  All right.  If it's a which 


10 

District Court question, I mean, I don't know how 


11 

long you want to spend on the procedural issue, but I 


12 

take it if we follow your thing, never can you 


13 

entertain a habeas petition unless the body is in 


14 

this district, then immigration cases, military cases 


15 

are going to be a nightmare.  If we follow a venue 


16 

principle, you are going to get just the right 


17 

result, which is we bring the case where it's most 


18 

convenient. 


19

 MR. CLEMENT:  With respect, Justice 


20 

Breyer, I would disagree.  I think that this Court, 


21 

it is true, in situations where it has relaxed the 


22 

notion of custody, and has allowed habeas petitions 


23 

to be brought in circumstances where they previously 


24 

weren't available, Strait against Laird is an 


25 

example.  This Court's decision in Braden, basically 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

15 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

is an example because it was accommodating the 


overruling of McNally against Hill and Payton against 


Rowe.  So in those contexts, where there is more than 


one custody or some kind of metaphysical custody, 


this Court has relaxed the rules in a way to 


accommodate those, but it has never deviated.  Never, 


from the rule that you have to file the habeas 


petition where the custodian is, and equally 


important, it has never, there is no need to expand 


10 

the notion of custody, because you have a classic 


11 

habeas case where you are challenging your present 


12 

physical confinement.  The courts never relax the 


13 

rules. 


14

 QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question to 


15 

get you to the merits, if I can. 


16

17

 MR. CLEMENT:  That would be fine. 


 QUESTION:  Suppose, suppose that you're 


18 

right about your basic claim that the uniform, what 


19 

is it called, the Use of Force Act is in fact a 


20 

statute of the kind contemplated in 4001.  Still, the 


21 

words in that act are, they can use necessary and 


22 

appropriate force.  So why would it be necessary and 


23 

appropriate in a country that has its courts open, 


24 

that has regular criminal proceedings, that has all 


25 

the possibility of adjudicating a claim that I'm the 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

16 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

9 

wrong person?  Why is it a necessary and appropriate 


thing to do once you have such a person who is a 


citizen in this country to proceed by other than a 


normal court procedure? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Breyer, I will 


answer the question.  I would preface it by saying 


that I certainly wouldn't read the authorization of 


force's use of the term necessary and appropriate as 


an invitation for sort of judicial management of the 


10 

executive's war-making power.  I would have viewed it 


11 

as a delegation to the executive to use its 


12 

traditional authority to make discretionary judgments 


13 

in finding what is the necessary appropriate force. 


14 

And the Prize cases, I think, stand for that 


15 

proposition. 


16

 Now, if I can address the specifics, 


17 

though, why it might be necessary and appropriate 


18 

and, indeed, why is the Government asserting this 


19 

authority?  It is precisely because, in this war on 


20 

terrorism, the Government can confront an individual 


21 

who is not only guilty of past war crimes, but 


22 

also --


23

 QUESTION:  Can I ask you just one last 


24 

question on the jurisdictional issue?  If you assume 


25 

it's a question of venue rather than jurisdiction --

I know you're arguing in the alternative, but if you  


assume it was venue rather than jurisdiction, would 


New York not have been the proper venue since he was 


held there as a material witness and he had a lawyer 


appointed in that case? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Even if, contrary to our 


position, it was a venue question, we would still say 


no.  And I think that you have to understand -- I 


mean, the fact that he was in New York in the first 


10 

place is a bit of a happenstance.  He tries to fly to 


11 

Chicago.  He is seized in Chicago --


12

 QUESTION:  No, but the Government is 


13 

responsible for him being in New York, which it seems 


14 

to me, that they should not be complaining about 


15 

litigating there. 


16

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, with respect, Justice 


17 

Stevens, I don't think anybody would think that if 


18 

you filed a habeas petition to challenge Padilla's 


19 

detention as a material witness while he was being 


20 

detained in New York, that that should be filed in 


21 

Chicago. 


22

 And I think by the same logic, it doesn't 


23 

make any sense from what the gravamen of the -- the 


24 

gravamen of the challenge is to the conditions and 


25 

legality of the detention in South Carolina, why that 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

18 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3

ought to be filed in New York just because he was 


there under a different authority. 


 QUESTION:  He had a lawyer appointed, 


4 

didn't he, there? 


5

6 

7 

8 

9 

 MR. CLEMENT:  He did have a lawyer 


appointed there.  But again, I don't think -- I mean, 


I think Mr. Dunham or his equivalent in South  


Carolina would be available to provide whatever role 


is necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. 


10 

I don't think there are only lawyers in New York. 


11

 QUESTION:  I suppose it's a little easier 


12 

for the Government to find a lawyer wherever it needs 


13 

it than it would be for a prisoner being moved from 


14 

district to district. 


15

 MR. CLEMENT:  In none of these cases have 


16 

we seen a problem with the detainees finding legal 


17 

representation. 


18

 QUESTION:  Getting back to the merits, 


19 

merits part --


20

 QUESTION:  Could I hear the end of his answer


21 

to the 


22 

previous question?  You were in the middle of an 


23 

answer and I was waiting for the end of it. 


24

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I hate to disappoint 


25 

you.  I'm not sure that I had anything in particular 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

left other than to say that we would still -- I mean, 


I think all I would say, and maybe I can reference  


that there are Court of Appeals cases, the Seventh 


Circuit has decided this Ross against Mebane case 


that basically say that even if you're in a venue 


situation, even if you're within the rule of Ex parte 


Endo, there is still a strong, strong presumption 


that a habeas petition belongs in the district court 


where the individual is being detained. 


10

 Now, maybe if you had a situation where 


11 

the habeas petition was up and running and close to a 


12 

final judgment or whatever.  And then the individual 


13 

is detained, it makes sense to keep the proceeding in 


14 

the first venue.  But in a case like -- if you had a 


15 

case where the day after the first petition is filed, 


16 

he's moved for independent and good reasons, I think 


17 

you would also say that the case belongs in the place 


18 

of detention. 


19

 QUESTION:  What rights does Padilla have, 


20 

if any, in your view, that a belligerent who is 


21 

apprehended on the battlefield does not have?  Is 


22 

Padilla just the same as somebody you catch in 


23 

Afghanistan? 


24

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think for purposes of the 


25 

question before this Court, the authority question, 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

he is just the same.  It may be that in an 


appropriate juncture when the Court has before it the 


question of what procedure should be applied, that 


you would want to apply different procedures in a 


case like this. 


 QUESTION:  Can we punish him? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Could we punish him? 


Certainly we could punish him if we decided to change 


the nature of our processing of him.  As this Court 


10 

made clear in Quirin --


11

 QUESTION:  Would you shoot him when he got 


12 

off the plane? 


13

 MR. CLEMENT:  No, I don't think we could 


14 

for good and sufficient reasons --


15

 QUESTION:  I assume that you could shoot 


16 

someone that you had captured on the field of battle. 


17

 MR. CLEMENT:  Not after we captured them 


18 

and brought them to safety.  And I think in every 


19 

case, there are rules of engagement, there are rules 


20 

for the appropriate force that should be used.  And I 


21 

don't know that there are any --


22

 QUESTION:  If they're an unlawful 


23 

belligerent? 


24

 MR. CLEMENT:  Yes, even if they're an 


25 

unlawful belligerent.  Once they're -- I mean, we 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

couldn't take somebody like Hamdi, for example, now 


that he's been removed from the battlefield and is 


completely -- poses no threat unless he's released 


and use that kind of force on him. 


 QUESTION:  But if the law is what the 


executive says it is, whatever is necessary and 


appropriate in the executive's judgment, that's the 


resolution you gave us that Congress passed, and it 


leads you up to the executive, unchecked by the 


10 

judiciary.  So what is it that would be a check 


11 

against torture? 


12

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, first of all, there 


13 

are treaty obligations.  But the primary check is 


14 

that just as in every other war, if a U.S. military 


15 

person commits a war crime by creating some atrocity 


16 

on a harmless, you know, detained enemy combatant or 


17 

a prisoner of war, that violates our own conception 


18 

of what's a war crime.  And we'll put that U.S. 


19 

military officer on trial in a court marshal.  So I 


20 

think there are plenty of internal reasons --


21

 QUESTION:  Suppose the executive says mild 


22 

torture we think will help get this information. 


23 

It's not a soldier who does something against the 


24 

Code of Military Justice, but it's an executive 


25 

command.  Some systems do that to get information. 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, our executive doesn't

and I think -- I mean --

6

7 

8 

9 

 QUESTION:  What's constraining?  That's 


the point.  Is it just up to the good will of the 


executive?  Is there any judicial check? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  This is a situation where 


there is jurisdiction in the habeas courts.  So if 


necessary, they remain open.  But I think it's very 


important -- I mean, the court in Ludecke against 


10 

Watkins made clear that the fact that executive 


11 

discretion in a war situation can be abused is not a 


12 

good and sufficient reason for judicial 


13 

micromanagement and overseeing of that authority. 


14

 You have to recognize that in situations 


15 

where there is a war -- where the Government is on a 


16 

war footing, that you have to trust the executive to 


17 

make the kind of quintessential military judgments 


18 

that are involved in things like that. 


19

 QUESTION:  So what is it that military --


20 

go back to Justice Kennedy's question.  I'm trying to 


21 

push you down the road a bit.  And maybe we don't 


22 

have to decide this now.  But I want to understand 


23 

your vision of it.  I mean, a person has come to the 


24 

United States.  He has, according to the Government, 


25 

committed a serious crime and is dangerous.

 Well, those are people we deal with all 


the time in the criminal process.  So if you're even 


assuming this resolution authorizes some kind of 


force, why isn't the appropriate force, where he's in 


the United States and the courts are open, what we 


would call ordinary criminal process?  I mean, that 


harmonizes everything. 


 Now, maybe there is an answer to that in 


9 

your vision.  I want to find out your vision of 


10 

what's supposed to happen here and why. 


11

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Breyer, let me 


12 

give you a practical reason answer and the legal 


13 

reason.  You may prefer the former.  But I think that 


14 

the practical reason is if you capture somebody who 


15 

is not just somebody who is guilty of a war crime or 


16 

a violation of some provision of Title 18, but also 


17 

has a wealth of information that could be used to 


18 

prevent future terrorist attacks, then it seems to me 


19 

that the military ought to have the option of 


20 

proceeding with him in a way that allows him to get 


21 

actionable intelligence to prevent future terrorist 


22 

attacks, and should not be forced into a choice where 


23 

the only way they can proceed is to proceed 


24 

retrospectively to try to punish him for past acts. 


25

 In doing so, whether it's a military 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

commission or an Article III, requires you to give 


him a counsel who likely is going to say that you 


shouldn't talk to the Government about any of these 


things. 


 QUESTION:  Would you have that authority 


in the absence of the authorizing resolution?  Would 


the President have that authority? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  I think he might well, 


9 

Justice Souter, and you in fact suggested that 


10 

yourself, which is if there was actionable 


11 

information --


12

 QUESTION:  No, I suggested that he might 


13 

have on September 12th.  I don't think my suggestion 


14 

went much further.  But I'll grant you that's an 


15 

argument, but do you believe he would have that 


16 

authority today in the absence of the authorizing 


17 

resolution? 


18

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think he would 


19 

certainly today, which is to say September 12th or 


20 

April 28th. 


21

 QUESTION:  Two and a half months later. 


22 

But I mean, based on the rationale that there is a 


23 

need to bar him from what would be the normal process 


24 

that Justice Breyer is describing because of the need 


25 

to interrogate effectively.  Your answer, I take it, 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2 

3

9 

is he would have that authority even without the 


authorizing resolution? 


 MR. CLEMENT:  That would be my answer.  I 


would say the President had that authority on 


September 10th, but I guess I would --


 QUESTION:  How does he get that from just 


being commander-in-chief?  I mean, I understand the 


commander-in-chief power to be a power over the 


military forces, when they're being used as military 


10 

forces, the General Washington power, you know, to 


11 

command the forces tactically and everything else. 


12

 It doesn't mean that he has power to do 


13 

whatever it takes to win the war.  I mean, the Steel 


14 

Seizure case demonstrates that well enough.  How does 


15 

this come within George Washington's 


16 

commander-in-chief power, which is what I read this 


17 

congressional resolution to be directed at?  It 


18 

doesn't say you can do whatever it takes to win the 


19 

war. 


20

 MR. CLEMENT:  No, but Justice Scalia, 


21 

presumably the authorization of force is read against 


22 

prior history and this Court's precedents.  And those 


23 

precedents include the Quirin case where it is 


24 

absolutely clear that in fighting a war, you have the 


25 

authority to detain individuals, even if they're not

formal military officers who are affiliated with the 


enemy and come into the United States intent on 


committing hostile and warlike acts. 


 QUESTION:  But Quirin rested on the fact 


that there was congressional authorization for a 


military commission to try on such charges. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, two things, Justice 


Souter.  First of all, I mean, you asked me a 


hypothetical but we do have the authorization of 


10 

force here.  Second of all, I don't think Quirin can 


11 

stand for the kind of clear statement rule that 


12 

others want to attribute to it for two reasons. 


13

 One, to the extent it applied any clear 


14 

statement rule, it runs in the opposite direction. 


15 

The Court said they would not strike down the 


16 

detention and try the individuals there absent a 


17 

clear conviction that it violated an act of Congress. 


18

 QUESTION:  I guess I would settle, as a 


19 

rhetorical point, for the fact that it's not a clear 


20 

statement for you either. 


21

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, it actually -- it 


22 

purported to be.  It said absent a clear conviction, 


23 

it wouldn't strike down the authority.  But what I 


24 

would -- just to be clear, I think as we point out in 


25 

our reply brief, if you applied a clear statement 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

rule to Quirin, it would have to come out the other 


way because Article II of the articles of war that 


were in force at the time were restricted to members 


of the United States military. 


 Article 15, which the Court relied on, 


didn't expressly authorize military commissions 


expressly.  It did so by negative implication.  So 


it's simply not the case that you need an express 


statutory authorization.  If I could reserve my time 


10 

for rebuttal.

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Clement.

Ms. Martinez, we'll hear from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER MARTINEZ 


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 


16 

it please the Court: 


17

 Even in wartime, America has always been a 


18 

nation governed by the rule of law.  Today the 


19 

Government asks this Court for a broad ruling that 


20 

would allow the President unlimited power to imprison 


21 

any American anywhere at any time without trial 


22 

simply by labeling him an enemy combatant. 


23

 We ask this Court for a narrow ruling that 


24 

leaves for another day the grave constitutional 


25 

question of whether our system would permit the 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

9 

indefinite imprisonment without trial of American 


citizens on American soil based on suspicion that 


they have associated with terrorists. 


 We simply ask this Court to hold that at a 


minimum Congress would have to clearly and 


unequivocally authorize such a departure from our 


nation's traditions.  And since Congress has not done 


so, Mr. Padilla is entitled to be charged with a 


crime and to have his day in court. 


10

 The detention at issue in this case is 


11 

exactly the type of detention that our Founding 


12 

Fathers were concerned about based on their 


13 

experience with the British Crown, where the king had 


14 

locked up citizens based on --


15

 QUESTION:  Ms. Martinez, the authorization 


16 

passed by Congress is quite broad and it talks about 


17 

force against individuals. 


18

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor, but there 


19 

is no reference in the text of that authorization to 


20 

any power to detain American citizens on American 


21 

soil based on suspicion.  And there is no indication 


22 

whatsoever in the debates that Congress contemplated 


23 

that it might be used in such a way. 


24

 QUESTION:  Well, you surely don't think 


25 

that it excluded American citizens.  I mean, 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

29 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3

certainly it gave the President authority to wage war 


against American citizens if they're on the other 


side, didn't it? 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  Certainly, Your Honor, 


5 

as --


6

7 

8 

9

 QUESTION:  So whatever authority it gave 


him, there is no indication that it's limited to 


non-citizens. 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  No, but what is limited to 


10 

citizens is Section 4001 in which Congress 


11 

specifically provided that no citizen shall be 


12 

imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States 


13 

except pursuant to an act of Congress. 


14

 QUESTION:  And you would say that 4001 


15 

prevents the President from detaining on the 


16 

battlefield? 


17

18

 MS. MARTINEZ:  No, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  Well, then it doesn't mean what 


19 

you just said it meant. 


20

 MS. MARTINEZ:  What we are talking 


21 

about -- first of all, there is a general presumption 


22 

against extraterritorial application of statutes. 


23 

And so in the absence of an indication that Congress 


24 

intended 4001 to apply overseas, that general 


25 

presumption would limit it to this country. 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

30 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

Moreover, the history of 4001 --


2

 QUESTION:  So the clear statement rule 


3 

doesn't apply to 4001? 


4

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Which clear statement rule, 


5 

Your Honor? 


6

 QUESTION:  Well, I thought you were 


7 

arguing for the clear statement rule. 


8

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor, we are and 


9 

our argument is limited to detentions within this 


10 

country --


11

 QUESTION:  But your qualification is only 


12 

implied from the statute. 


13

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Our argument is that what 


14 

there needs to be a clear statement of is of the 


15 

authority to detain an American citizen on American 


16 

soil.  And the reason for that is given, one, by the 


17 

history of section 4001 in which Congress looked at 


18 

the Emergency Detention Act that had been passed 


19 

during the Cold War which would have allowed the 


20 

President, in case of an internal security emergency 


21 

or war, to imprison individuals based on suspicion 


22 

that they were associated with a foreign power and 


23 

were going to engage in acts of sabotage. 


24

 QUESTION:  What about hijackers?  The 


25 

resolution has to do with 9/11.  And the people were

9 

hijackers and a lot of the hijackers are up in the 


airplane and then they land.  Do you think that the 


resolution wasn't aimed at them in part? 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  Your Honor, our position is 


that certainly the President would have inherent 


authority with or without this resolution to seize an 


individual who is engaged in an act like that that 


took place on 9/11.  But after that individual had 


been seized, in order for that person to be held 


10 

in detention in this country, if they are a citizen, 


11 

in particular, there must be some express statutory 


12 

authorization that provides a framework for that 


13 

ongoing detention.  And that comes not only from 


14 

4001, but also from the Due Process Clause, and --


15

 QUESTION:  And if they are captured on the 


16 

battlefield and then brought here, 4001 clicks into 


17 

operation, in your view? 


18

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Our position is that 4001 


19 

applies within the United States and its text means 


20 

what it says, that no, no person --


21

 QUESTION:  Well, then your answer to my 


22 

question is yes? 


23

24

25

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  So if you were --


 QUESTION:  So if we found American

citizens in Iraq who were firing on our forces and 


brought them back here, they would have to be given 


an Article III trial? 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  Your Honor, our position is 


that Congress could provide for some alternative 


legislative scheme for dealing with such individuals. 


 QUESTION:  What about my question on Iraq? 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  At this time, our position 


9 

would be that such persons would have to be given an 


10 

Article III trial, unless Congress came in with some 


11 

other provision.  Yes, Your Honor. 


12

 QUESTION: Why do you distinguish citizen, if 


13 

we are talking about someone like Padilla, who is in 


14 

the United States, the Due Process Clause refers to 


15 

person, not citizen?  So I can see a distinction 


16 

between brought into the United States, but within 


17 

the United States, if it's someone who is, is an 


18 

alien, but is here with permission, a resident alien, 


19 

say --


20

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  We would 


21 

agree that such persons are protected by the Due 


22 

Process Clause.  4001 refers only to citizens.  But 


23 

we would agree that aliens within this country might 


24 

certainly be protected as well.  This case simply 


25 

does not present that question, but we would not 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

disagree with that.  I think what is important --

question.  Let's assume that we disagree with you 


about 4001, and we think the authorization for use of 


military force supersedes that.  Then what, then what 


is your position with respect to the rights of your 


client? 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  If Your Honors believe that 


9 

4000 -- that the authorization was meant to 


10 

specifically authorize the detention of American 


11 

citizens on American soil, we would contend first 


12 

that there is no limiting principle within that 


13 

authorization for who may be detained. 

The 


14 

Government claims that anyone who is associated with 


15 

Al Qaeda falls within this definition. 


16

 QUESTION:  So the principle would be that 


17 

if somebody is like a missile sent over here, you 


18 

know, he is actually one of the hijackers or the 


19 

equivalent thereof, that's an obvious limiting 


20 

principle, that people who are sent offshore, sent 


21 

right over here and we catch them in mid-air. 


22

 MS. MARTINEZ:  I think when you start 


23 

trying to draw those lines on a case-by-case basis 


24 

where this individual because they are actually in 


25 

the midst of a hijacking is close enough whereas some

other individual who is merely in the early stages of 


a plot might not be enough, the difficulty of drawing  


those lines shows the need for clear Congressional 


action here. 


 This is primarily a job for Congress to 


create, if there is a need in this country for 


preventive detention of terrorists, that's a 


legislative job for our legislature to undertake. 


 QUESTION:  Declarations of war are just 


10 

not written this way.  The Iraq declaration is not. 


11 

The recent declarations of war, formal declarations 


12 

are not, and AMUF is not. 


13

14

 MS. MARTINEZ:  That's correct. 


 QUESTION:  That's just not the tradition. 


15 

The President is given the authority. 


16

 MS. MARTINEZ:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


17 

But broad authorizations for use of force in wartime 


18 

have also not traditionally been interpreted to allow 


19 

the executive unlimited power over citizens.  So in 


20 

cases like Duncan and Endo, this Court has said that 


21 

a wartime authorization for action by the executive 


22 

should not be construed broadly, but should be 


23 

construed narrowly to give only the power that it 


24 

clearly and unequivocally indicates. 


25

 QUESTION:  Well, Endo was concededly

loyal, and Duncan were civil crimes, a stockbroker 


who was embezzling, right? 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


But what 4001 was intended to prevent was a claim by 


the executive that his broad inherent powers in 


wartime, which was specifically what 4001 addressed, 


would be enough to allow the detention of American 


citizens. 


 QUESTION:  Right.  Can you give me a 


10 

minute or so on the, or as long as you want or short, 


11 

but suppose you get to the similar place by saying 


12 

that this resolution, suppose hypothetically, I'm not 


13 

saying what my view is, but hypothetically, suppose 


14 

you get to the same place by saying, yes, that 


15 

wartime resolution still doesn't authorize departing 


16 

from use of the criminal system, the ordinary 


17 

criminal system for somebody in the United States, 


18 

but for an unusually good reason. 


19

 Now, we have two possible reasons 


20 

advanced, one orally that we need to question him, 


21 

and one in the briefs, a suggestion that this man is 


22 

a ticking time bomb, and we can't reveal the evidence 


23 

without destroying intelligence.  Now, I'd like your 


24 

vision of how this is supposed to play out under an 


25 

ordinary criminal system in response perhaps to what 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

36

those claims are.

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Our view would be that 

because of the difficulty of the question of 

determining, for example, as I believe Justice 

Kennedy asked earlier, how long would such 

interrogation be necessary?  Would the district court 

be required to take evidence on those sorts of 

issues? 

 In the event that there were no other 

10 

alternatives, we believe that would be appropriate, 

11 

but we also believe that's quintessentially a 

12 

question for Congress, which could hold legislative 

13 

hearings.  And after due deliberation, come to some 

14 

conclusion about what was required in this context. 

15

 And that is in fact what our democratic 

16 

allies, United Kingdom and Israel, have done in 

17 

passing specific legislation about the preventive 

18 

detention of suspected terrorists based on a 

19 

legislative finding about what periods of time --

20

 QUESTION:  Well, that would be, of course, 

21 

perhaps, desirable, but we are faced with a situation 

22 

of the here and now, and what do we do? 

23

24

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Your Honor --

 QUESTION:  We just turn loose a ticking 

25 

time bomb?

 MS. MARTINEZ:  No, Your Honor.  I believe 


that, first of all, were this Court to rule that it 


was -- that Congressional action was required, I have 


no doubt that Congress would step into the breach 


very quickly to provide whatever authorization the 


executive branch deemed necessary.  And so I think 


there is no doubt that Congress would fill that 


measure. 


 Here in this particular case, the 


10 

Government has already said that Mr. Padilla no 


11 

longer possesses any intelligence value, and so his 


12 

interrogation is at an end.  And at this point, after 


13 

two years in detention, without any sort of hearing, 


14 

without any access to counsel, it's more than 


15 

appropriate that he be charged with a crime unless 


16 

Congress comes forward with some alternative scheme. 


17

 Now, if I may turn for a moment to the 


18 

issue of jurisdiction.  Contrary to Mr. Clement's 


19 

suggestions, this case does primarily involve issues 


20 

of venue and not jurisdiction.  This Court has never 


21 

held that there is a hard and fast rule requiring an 


22 

immediate custodian, and this Court has also not 


23 

applied rigid territorial requirements about the 


24 

location of a suit. 


25

 And in particular, in the Strait case, 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

38 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2

this Court made clear that the type of jurisdiction 


that was necessary was jurisdiction making the 


Respondent amenable to service of process under the 


long arm provisions by citing International Shoe and 


McGee, which are provisions applying normal rules of 


personal jurisdiction. 


 Given the particular circumstances of this 


case, the extensive personal involvement of Secretary 


Rumsfeld in this matter, makes him an appropriate 


10 

Respondent and New York is an appropriate venue for 


11 

this suit.  The Government brought Mr. Padilla to New 


12 

York.  They placed him in court proceedings there. 


13 

Counsel was appointed and litigation had begun.  It 


14 

was the Government's choice to remove him from that 


15 

forum, but that does not change the fundamental fact 


16 

that jurisdiction was proper in New York. 


17

 QUESTION:  Are you -- are you suggesting 


18 

then that this case might be an exception to some 


19 

more general rule because of the peculiar facts that 


20 

you have just recited? 


21

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think 


22 

that -- I think there is no hard and fast general 


23 

rule as the Government states it.  There are numerous 


24 

exceptions already to the rule that the Government 


25 

articulates that can be found in prior cases.

 QUESTION:  Well, maybe there should be 


some more definite rule.  Supposing we were to say 


that generally it's the Secretary of Defense and his 


venue is in the Eastern District of Virginia. 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  This Court might very well 


decide to make such a venue rule, but I would note 


that the Government at this point in the case has 


waived their objection to venue by not pursuing it on 


appeal.  They challenged venue in the district court, 


10 

and they did not appeal that. 


11

 QUESTION:  Well, but they have certainly 


12 

challenged the proper custodian here. 


13

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  They have 


14 

challenged the proper custodian, but as this 


15 

court's decisions in cases like Endo, like 


16 

Eisentrager make clear, that the identity of the 


17 

proper Respondent is not a hard and fast or absolute 


18 

jurisdictional rule. 


19

 QUESTION:  That doesn't change it from 


20 

jurisdiction to venue.  I mean, venue is venue and 


21 

jurisdiction is jurisdiction.  You may say that the 


22 

jurisdictional rule has been so haphazard that 


23 

effectively it amounts to the same thing.  And that 


24 

argument will stand and fall on the basis of the 


25 

cases that you and Mr. Clement have discussed. 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

 But to say that this is, this is venue is 


simply wrong.  I mean, it is a matter of the 


jurisdiction of the Court, and it's always been 


treated by that way in our opinions.  We have not 


discussed it as a venue rule. 


 MR. MARTINEZ:  Well, Your Honor, I do agree 


that there is a jurisdictional question, and we 


agreed that -- we argued that jurisdiction is proper. 


But what Braden says is that the rule that Ahrens had 


10 

announced as a hard and fast jurisdictional rule 


11 

reflected nothing more than traditional venue 


12 

concerns. 


13

 And so Braden specifically says that 


14 

that -- that which was discussed in Ahrens went to 


15 

venue and not to jurisdiction.  Returning --


16

 QUESTION:  Where you had conceivably 


17 

proper jurisdiction in several places. 


18

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  And we 


19 

would argue that jurisdiction was proper in New York 


20 

in this case because --


21

 QUESTION:  We are talking if we are using 


22 

the jurisdictional label, it's personal jurisdiction, 


23 

and not subject matter jurisdiction. 


24

 MS. MARTINEZ:  That's correct, Your Honor, 


25 

and under this Court's decision in Strait, there was 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

41 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2 

3

5

9 

personal jurisdiction over Secretary Rumsfeld in New 


York because of his contacts with that forum. 


 Returning to the merits of this case, what 


I think is important for this Court to realize is  


that the war on terror presents many difficult 


questions about the proper balance between civil 


liberties and national security.  Congress is the 


body of our government that has been -- that was 


entrusted by the Founders for making law to deal with 


10 

new situations.  And Congress is fully capable of 


11 

considering the various parameters of any sort of 


12 

scheme of detention that might be necessary. 


13

 And certainly this Court would have the 


14 

power to review, to determine whether that system 


15 

established by Congress were constitutional, but what 


16 

we have here is a claim by the executive to a 


17 

virtually unlimited system, where any person that the 


18 

President deems an enemy combatant --


19

 QUESTION:  But on the basis of the, of the 


20 

Congressional authorization.  He is not claiming it 


21 

just by virtue of executive power. 


22

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Well, he claims them both 


23 

on the basis of inherent executive power and on the 


24 

basis of the authorization. 


25

 QUESTION:  Well, but since they are, since 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

42 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

they are both the weakest -- weakest claim is 


probably solely the executive.  But I think you have 


to deal with the claim that it's Congressional 


authorization. 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  There is 


simply no indication that when Congress passed the 


Authorization for Use of Military Force which enabled 


us to deploy our troops overseas, the Congress also 


thought that they were authorizing the indefinite 


10 

military detention without trial of American citizens 


11 

on American soil.  There was no debate of such a 


12 

dramatic departure from our constitutional 


13 

traditions.  And just a few weeks later when Congress 


14 

passed the Patriot Act, it extensively debated a 


15 

provision that allowed the detention of aliens for 


16 

seven days. 


17

 QUESTION:  The trouble is, I don't see how 


18 

you can -- I mean, I think I can understand your 


19 

saying it doesn't give him any power except a 


20 

battlefield power.  I can understand that.  You might 


21 

read it that way.  But I can't understand reading it 


22 

to say it applies to everybody, but not to United 


23 

States citizens.  That line is just not there in the 


24 

resolution. 


25

 MS. MARTINEZ:  We would say it does not 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

43 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

apply off the battlefield, certainly to U.S. citizens 


on U.S. soil.  And this Court --


 QUESTION:  But it does apply to aliens. 


We -- the President could use force against aliens 


under that resolution. 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  This Court need not decide 


7 

that in this case, and I certainly don't --


8

 QUESTION:  I understand, but you are 


9 

proposing to us an interpretation of the resolution, 


10 

which I suggest makes no sense, unless you are 


11 

willing to say that it also doesn't apply to aliens 


12 

that are being brought -- that are committing these 


13 

acts within the country. 


14

 MS. MARTINEZ:  I would agree that it does 


15 

not -- the authorization does not clearly indicate 


16 

that it's applicable to aliens either. 


17

 QUESTION:  He might have the power to take 


18 

up the aliens and arrest them any way because 4001 


19 

doesn't prohibit it? 


20

21

22

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Correct, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  Is that your point? 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  Correct, Your Honor.  That 


23 

is our point, which is that the degree of specificity 


24 

that would need to be required to authorize this kind 


25 

of extraordinary detention of citizens would be 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

9 

greater, and in particular with aliens, there has 


always been a greater power of the executive because 


they have no right to be here. 


 QUESTION:  Then I take it then you have 


no, assuming -- assuming that 4001 has been 


superseded by the authorization.  I assume you have 


no principal basis for distinguishing between 


citizens and aliens insofar as detaining an enemy 


belligerent? 


10

 MS. MARTINEZ:  No, Your Honor.  As to 


11 

individuals within the United States, if 4001 is not 


12 

at issue because of its specific reference to 


13 

citizens, we would say aliens within the United 


14 

States would have the same, would be in exactly the 


15 

same position.  Correct. 


16

 QUESTION:  So you would make no 


17 

distinction between the two. 


18

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Correct, Your Honor, were 


19 

it not for 4001.  But we think 4001 calls for not 


20 

just for broad authorization of executive power, but 


21 

specific authorization, because 4001 was concerned 


22 

with the situation where there was a general 


23 

declaration of war, or where there was some type of 


24 

internal emergency. 


25

 And the concern was that the executive 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

45 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6

8 

9

should not be able to rely on that general 


declaration of war or that general situation to lock 


up citizens.  That was precisely the situation with 


the Japanese internment camps, the President --


President Roosevelt had been authorized the broadest 


possible force you can have to fight a war.  There 


was a declaration of complete war against Germany and 


Japan. 


 Congress looked back on that and did not 


10 

want a future President to be able to find in such a 


11 

declaration of war the power to imprison American 


12 

citizens.  They wanted it to come from specific 


13 

legislation. 


14

 QUESTION:  So you say that has no 


15 

application on the battlefield because of the 


16 

principle of no extraterritorial effect of 


17 

United States statutes? 


18

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Your Honor, certainly as to 


19 

an overseas battlefield, 4001, because of the 


20 

presumption against extraterritoriality, would not 


21 

apply. 


22

 QUESTION:  Now, what if you capture an 


23 

American combatant and bring him back to the 


24 

United States, then 4001 --


25

 MS. MARTINEZ:  4001 would apply upon his 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

return. 


2

3

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

 QUESTION:  It would apply? 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  Correct.  And let me say 


also, in respect to the Japanese internment camps, 


Congress was very specific in passing 4001 that what 


it wanted was democratic deliberation by our 


lawmakers about the necessity of this kind of extreme 


measure, where American citizens might be detained 


without trial. 


10

 It didn't want that to slip under the 


11 

radar, under the umbrella of a general declaration of 


12 

war or general use of force.  It wanted to ensure 


13 

that there was specific debate by Congress on those 


14 

very different constitutional questions presented in 


15 

those situations by the power of detaining citizens. 


16

 QUESTION:  Did Congress at the time of 


17 

4001 consider other systems that do allow for 


18 

preventative detention, but then require the person 


19 

periodically to be brought before a judge to make 


20 

certain that the conditions still exist, like, as is 


21 

alleged in this case, the need to get evidence? 


22

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Your Honor, there certainly 


23 

are many other systems that provide for that sort of 


24 

judicial review.  In the United Kingdom and Israel, 


25 

for example, people detained under preventive 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

47 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

9 

detention schemes are entitled to access to counsel, 


they are entitled to prompt and periodic judicial 


review under legislative standards to determine 


whether those detentions can be continued. 


 And certainly there are many comparative 


examples out there where legislatures have made those 


kind of fact-findings about what's appropriate.  And 


there is no reason why our legislature could not 


undertake such --


10

 QUESTION:  The reason -- and this is why 


11 

I've been harping on this thing of necessary and 


12 

appropriate.  It seems to me if you take into account 


13 

the traditions of the United States ordinary criminal 


14 

processes, and you say, well, the forces act, the use 


15 

of force act, doesn't apply at all, then there is no 


16 

way to take care of the real emergency, the real 


17 

emergency, the real ticking time bomb, et cetera, 


18 

except to go back to Congress, which may or may not 


19 

act. 


20

 But if you get to the same result by 


21 

reading the necessary and appropriate thing to take 


22 

into account our traditions, you do leave the opening 


23 

there for the possibility of a real emergency which 


24 

would warrant an extraordinary proceeding.  I'm just 


25 

exposing my thought on this so that I can get your 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1 

reaction. 


2

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think 


that's absolutely correct.  You could certainly read 


the necessary and appropriate language that way.  And 


let me also make clear that we are not arguing that 


the President would have no power either under the 


AUMF or under his inherent powers to seize an 


individual in the case of imminent violent activity. 


 We are simply talking about his power to 


10 

continue to detain that individual over many months 


11 

prior to that initial seizure.  And so regardless of 


12 

how you read the AUMF, that's simply not what they're 


13 

arguing about.  We're arguing about, once the 


14 

individual has been prevented from carrying out the 


15 

harmful attack, and once they're in Government 


16 

custody, can they simply be held forever without 


17 

trial until the end of the war on terror, or instead, 


18 

once they're taken into custody, must they be treated 


19 

in accordance with our positive laws. 


20

 QUESTION:  So I take it you would say that 


21 

the resolution was inadequate to continue to hold 


22 

your client in the manner in which he is being held, 


23 

even on the day in which it was passed?  This is not 


24 

a two and a half years later argument, it would be an 


25 

argument on the day it was passed?

 QUESTION:  I just want to make sure I 


understand you.  But you would not necessarily have 


objected, let's say, a week after September 11th, 


even though there was no resolution? 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  If there were a situation 


where an individual, not like my client, but an 


individual that were on the verge of engaging in 


10 

imminent violent conduct, certainly the President 


11 

would have the power, even under the Fourth 


12 

Amendment, to seize that individual without a warrant 


13 

and bring him into custody on the basis that they 


14 

were about to engage in a violent act. 


15

 But that's a far different situation from 


16 

seizing someone like my client who is not alleged to 


17 

be on the verge of imminent lawless activity, was not 


18 

in the process of hijacking an aircraft but was 


19 

simply alleged to be part of a plot --


20

 QUESTION:  Let me interrupt.  When you say 


21 

it is clear he could do it if the defendant was about 


22 

to engage in that kind of conduct, by what standard 


23 

would you decide that he was about to?  Probable 


24 

cause, proof beyond a reasonable doubt or just 


25 

suspicion?

 MS. MARTINEZ:  For the initial seizure, we 


2 

would say probable cause.

 QUESTION:  Reasonable suspicion based on 


4 

confidential intelligence would not be sufficient? 


5

6 

7 

8 

9 

 MS. MARTINEZ:  We would submit no, but 


it's possible that when that question came up, the 


quantum of evidence might be weighed against the 


danger that the executive perceived.  If the 


executive had some amount of suspicion that there was 


10 

about to be a very violent activity, it could be 


11 

possible that some lesser amount might be required 


12 

for the initial seizure.  But we're not talking --


13

 QUESTION:  That's really a reasonable 


14 

suspicion standard, then, isn't it? 


15

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  But we're 


16 

not talking about that question of initial seizure 


17 

here.  In this case we're talking about the ongoing 


18 

detention for two years of someone after there has 


19 

been --


20

 QUESTION:  You wouldn't just say two 


21 

years.  You would certainly say that as soon as the 


22 

President prevented the act that he feared by taking 


23 

the person into custody, he immediately had no more 


24 

authority to detain him, wouldn't you? 

I mean --


25

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  That's the way the statute 


you're relying on reads, that he shall not be 


detained.  So two years has nothing to do with it. 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor. 


 QUESTION:  The next day he should, I 


suppose, you know, hand him over to civil prosecution 


authorities. 


 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor, we would 


9 

say at 48 hours under this Court's decisions.  If 


10 

Congress thinks that a longer period of time is 


11 

appropriate in terrorism cases, it can do as other 


12 

countries have done and provide for a longer period 


13 

of time. 


14

 In the United Kingdom, there is a 48 hours 


15 

plus a maximum of 7 days without charge for suspected 


16 

terrorists.  In the United Kingdom, up to 14 days. 


17 

Congress might come in and provide some legislative 


18 

extension.  But in the absence of that, our normal rule 


19 

of 48 hours under County of Riverside would be 


20 

appropriate. 


21

 QUESTION:  But we are not just talking 


22 

about terrorists here.  We're talking about 


23 

terrorists associated with foreign forces. 


24

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  And let 


25 

me say that those are exactly the sort of individuals 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

that the passage of 4001 was designed to address. 


The Emergency Detention Act, which 4001 repealed, 


specifically talked about the possibility of 


saboteurs in this country who are under the direction 


and control of the communist empire. 


 And so there was a specific concern with 


individuals who might be under that kind of power in 


4001.  And Congress wanted to make very clear that 


such individuals could not simply be detained at 


10 

executive discretion, but could only be detained 


11 

pursuant to positive law.  Positive law that is 


12 

simply nonexistent in this case. 


13

 The type of association with a terrorist 


14 

organization is also unclear based on the 


15 

Government's allegations in this case.  Surely the 


16 

Government cannot claim that anyone who associated 


17 

with any member of Al Qaeda at any time would be 


18 

subject to indefinite military detention without 


19 

trial. 


20

 Mr. Padilla's mother, because she is 


21 

associated with her son, may be argued to have 


22 

associated with Al Qaeda, and clearly that's not what 


23 

Congress had in mind, to allow that person to be 


24 

locked up with no right to a lawyer, no right to a 


25 

hearing for as long as the war on terror lasts.

That's simply not consistent with our nation's 


constitutional traditions, it's a limitless power and 


there is no call for it in this case. 


 QUESTION:  So you say that Judge Mukasey's 


5 

solution for this case was not adequate, then? 


6

7 

8 

9 

 MS. MARTINEZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  We do not 


believe that Judge Mukasey's solution was adequate. 


We believe that in the first instance, clear 


authorization and parameters for such detention must 


10 

come from Congress, defining who ought to be detained 


11 

and what procedures ought to accompany those 


12 

detentions. 


13

 And at that point, this Court could review 


14 

them for consistency with the Constitution.  But no, 


15 

while certainly Judge Mukasey's order was better than 


16 

what the Government offered, which was no process at 


17 

all, no opportunity to be heard and no access to 


18 

counsel, certainly Judge Mukasey's order was better 


19 

than that. 


20

 But when the indefinite deprivation of a 


21 

citizen's liberty is at stake, we would argue that 


22 

the Government must come forward with more than some 


23 

evidence consisting of any evidence in the record 


24 

that might support the Government's position that 


25 

he's associated with terrorists.  When this type of 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

9 

extreme deprivation of liberty is at issue, something 


more than that is required by the Due Process Clause 


and by our Constitution. 


 So certainly what we would say is that 


this Court needs not to decide those issues today, of 


what precise standard of proof ought to be given, 


exactly when an individual ought to be allowed access 


to counsel and what the limits are on how long such 


an individual could be held, et cetera, because those 


10 

are primarily questions for Congress. 


11

 And this Court ought to wait until 


12 

Congress has come in and provided that kind of 


13 

guidance before it passes on these grave 


14 

constitutional questions, which really go to the core 


15 

of what our democracy is about, which is that the 


16 

Government cannot take citizens in this country off 


17 

the street and lock them up in jail forever without a 


18 

trial.  That's never the way our country has operated 


19 

and it's fundamentally inconsistent with our 


20 

traditions.  And so I would submit today is not the 


21 

day for this Court to decide whether that's 


22 

permissible. 


23

 The Government asks in this case for 


24 

basically limitless power and however grave the 


25 

circumstances of the war on terror may be, this

nation has faced other grave threats.  We've had war 

on our soil before and never before in the nation's 

history has this Court granted the President a blank 

check to do whatever he wants to American citizens. 

 So the fact that we're at war does not 

mean that our normal constitutional rules do not 

apply.  Even in wartime, especially in wartime, the 

Founders wanted to place limits on the ability of the 

executive to deprive citizens of liberty.  And they 

10 

were concerned, based on the history of the British 

11 

Crown, of the possibility that an unchecked executive 

12 

using excuses based on national security, using the 

13 

military power to render that superior to civilian 

14 

authorities, could exercise the exact type of power 

15 

that's at issue in this case.  Thank you, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Martinez.  And 

17 

Mr. Clement, you have four minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

21 

Justice.  I would like to make just three points. 

22 

First, on jurisdiction, it is true that the immediate 

23 

custodian rule is not a hard and fast rule and it has 

24 

been -- exceptions have been made.  But the 

25 

territorial jurisdiction rule, as statutorily 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1 

2

prescribed, limits the Court's jurisdiction and is a 


hard and fast rule. 


 And the best evidence of the relationship 


between the two is in those cases where you had to 


relax one or the other, when you had a citizen 


detained abroad where the immediate custodian was 


abroad outside the territorial jurisdiction of any 


district court, rather than relax the rule of 


territorial jurisdiction, the Court said you could 


10 

sue the Secretary of Defense in a district where 


11 

there is territorial jurisdiction over the 


12 

individual. 


13

 It is true there are situations like 


14 

Strait against Laird that don't involve normal 


15 

physical confinement, where the Court has had to come 


16 

up with some rule to deal with the fact that you only 


17 

have a metaphysical custodian.  But in the case of a 


18 

physical detention of an individual, the Court has 


19 

never relaxed the rule that you file it in the 


20 

district where the immediate custodian is located. 


21

 And if you look at this Court's decision 


22 

in Carbo and Justice Rutledge's dissent in Ahrens, 


23 

you'll see that if you don't respect the rule in a 


24 

situation like this, there is nothing left to the 


25 

statutory language and nothing left of the intent of 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

57 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

the Congress that passed it.

6

8

 The second point I would like to make is 


that in looking at this case and the authority that's 


asserted and the role of 4001(a), it's important to 


recognize that there is a significant difference 


between civilian authority and the military authority 


over enemy combatants. 


 This Court, when it decided Endo and 


9 

addressed the situation of the detention of the 


10 

Japanese, specifically carved out the situation of 


11 

the military detention of enemy combatants and said 


12 

that that is not involved here.  It stands to reason 


13 

that if Congress, in passing 4001(a) to effectively 


14 

prevent another Japanese internment camp of 


15 

concededly loyal citizens also probably wanted to put 


16 

to one side the issue of military detention of enemy 


17 

combatants. 


18

 In any event, the Court need not 


19 

ultimately decide whether 4001(a) has any application 


20 

because the authorization of force clearly provides 


21 

the necessary act of Congress.  It authorizes not 


22 

Article III courts for these individuals.  It 


23 

authorizes military force. 


24

 And the relevant line here is provided by 


25 

this Court's case in Quirin, when somebody goes 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

58 

Alderson Reporting Company

abroad, associates with the enemy, takes weapons 


training or explosives training with the enemy, and 


then returns to the United States with the intent to 


commit hostile and warlike acts at the direction of 


the enemy, that classically falls within the Quirin 


side of the line. 


 It's much different than a Landon Milligan 


who never left the State of Indiana.  And the 


military has authority over that individual. 


10

 Lastly, let me just address the argument 


11 

that somehow you can constrain the authorization of 


12 

force and read it only to apply in a battlefield 


13 

setting.  With respect, I think that ignores the 


14 

context in which it was passed.  It was passed seven 


15 

days after September 11th.  The resolution itself 


16 

recognizes that we face continuing threats at home 


17 

and abroad. 


18

 It was not passed as a matter of 


19 

retribution for those attacks, but to prevent future 


20 

attacks.  To read it to deny the Government the 


21 

authority to detain a latter day citizen version of 


22 

Mohammed Atta is to simply ignore the will of 


23 

Congress.  Thank you, Your Honor.
