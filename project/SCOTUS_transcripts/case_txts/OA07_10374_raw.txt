 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 
argument next in Case 07-10374, Haywood v. Drown.

 Mr. Murtagh.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JASON E. MURTAGH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MURTAGH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In a 4-3 decision, the New York Court of 

Appeals affirmed Correction Law Section 24, which 
prohibits Petitioner from bringing a Section 1983 claim 
for money damages in any court of the State of New York.
 Instead, that statute relegates Mr. Haywood 
and anyone else seeking money damages under section 1983 
to either bring their case in Federal court or to accept 
what the New York legislature has deemed a State law 
alternative.  That State law alternative does not allow 
Mr. Haywood to sue the prison guards who violated his 
civil rights; instead he can only sue the State.  It 
provides for no punitive damages, it provides for no 
attorneys' fees; a shortened 90-day notice of claim 
provision, 30 days shorter than what this Court found 
violative in Felder; and provides for no right to jury 
trial.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It does provide for a 
waiver of sovereign immunity and says that the State 
will respond in damages.  It might be -- I'm not sure --
that many prisoners would prefer this.  They have got a 
solvent -- I hope they're solvent -- defendant.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. MURTAGH:  Your Honor, it is true that 

the State has waived sovereign immunity for claims 
brought in the Court of Claims under that State law. 
But, Your Honor, they haven't waived sovereign immunity 
for punitive damages or for attorneys' fees, both of 
which are remedies that are specifically available to 
Petitioners, to plaintiffs, in section 1983 actions.
 This State law alternative, even if it 

didn't independently violate the supremacy clause by 
substituting New York's judgment for that of Congress, 
would not actually be a real alternative for Mr. Haywood 
or for anyone else who wanted to bring a suit against 
prison officials.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, we can just mark 

that place in the record.  It -- it does seem to me that 
there is some real benefits to the prisoners under --
under the New York scheme.  It's -- many counsel may 
think it's preferable than to sue under 1983.

there may be -- reasonable minds I think could differ, I 
think, about whether it's preferable to have the State 
as a solvent entity or the -- or the prison employee as 
a defendant.  But I think there's two important points 
on that.

 Number one, in their briefing, the 

Respondents have argued that they will indemnify State 
employees regardless of where the case is brought.  If 
the State has already agreed to provide indemnification, 
then you don't need the State as a defendant simply to 
be solvent.  The State has already --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, except in --
they said except in cases where the guards are acting 
outside the scope of their employment.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Yes, Your Honor.  Under 
Correction Law Section 24, if the guard is acting 
outside the scope of the employment, then the case can 
be brought in New York's courts of general jurisdiction.

 The important point here, Your Honors, is 

there are two separate related reasons that this law is 
unconstitutional.  The first is because New York's 
legislature has redefined the remedies available under 
section 1983, they have, in effect, substituted their 
judgment about what constitutes good policy for 
Congress's judgment.

In this particular case, Mr. Haywood or any 
other plaintiff in New York State, could bring a section 
1983 claim in State court, but only if he agrees to give 
up his right to seek money damages.

 Congress determined, in setting forth the 

purpose and the effect of section 1983, that plaintiffs 
ought to be entitled to both money damages and equitable 
damages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He can still get that in 

Federal court, can't he?

 MR. MURTAGH:  Your Honor, it's --

Justice Scalia it's absolutely true that Mr. Haywood 
could bring his case in Federal court and would be 
entitled to all the remedies available under section 
1983 had he brought it in Federal court.  But that issue 
is not dispositive in this case.  And the reason it's 
not dispositive is that in the whole line of cases that 
this Court has considered where it has required States 
to hear actions as long as they hear similar or 
analogous actions, a Federal forum was available in each 
of those cases as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess there's a 
difference.  I mean, obviously Felder is significant 
help to you.  But I suppose it's a difference to say 
they've redefined the cause of action under Federal law

and said they are just not going to hear it at all.  It 
may seem paradoxical, but the latter may be from a 
constitutional point of view the sounder 
characterization, because it's obviously not the 
responsibility or the authority of States to say, well, 
this is how the Federal law is going to be applied.

 But it might be their -- their -- within 
their authority to say, look, this is what our State 
court system provides and if you don't like it for a 
Federal claim, you have always got the Federal courts.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Your Honor, under this Court's 
decisions not only in Felder but going back to Martinez, 
this Court has said that -- that it hasn't decided 
whether a State is required to create a court to hear 
Federal claims.  And I don't think the Court needs to 
reach that issue in this case, because New York has 
already established courts of general jurisdiction, its 
supreme court, the trial level court, that are competent 
to hear these cases.

 These courts regularly hear common law tort 

cases, they regularly hear section 1983 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, but `they are 
not really or at least you can view it as they are not 
discriminating against the Federal cause of action, 
because they don't allow the State cause of action of

the sort you want to pursue either.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Your Honor, that seems to be 
the crux of the Respondents' argument.  And I think the 
fundamental problem with that argument is that, although 
New York specifically exempts prison -- cases against 
prison officials, that's not enough.  And the reason 
it's not enough is that if you can merely invoke the 
word "jurisdiction," as this Court pointed out in 
Howlett, the mere -- the force of the Supremacy Clause 
is not so weak that it can be evaded by the mere mention 
of the word "jurisdiction."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's --

that's true.  And Howlett does say that.  But as we've 
pointed out on many occasions, "jurisdiction" is a term 
that covers a lot of different things.  And at some 
point something starts to look jurisdictional, which is, 
look, we're not going to hear your case at all.  In 
other areas, even if they call it jurisdictional, it 
really doesn't seem that way, such as, well, you've got 
to give this much notice or you've got to -- you know, 
maybe those things aren't really jurisdictional.  But 
saying you can't bring the case at all strikes me as 
really jurisdictional.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

think there are a couple of points on that.  The first

is that in the cases where this Court has found that 
there was a neutral jurisdictional rule, Herb v. 
Pitcairn, Douglas, Mayfield, and then later in 
Johnson v. Frankell, in every single one of those cases 
the underlying rule of jurisdiction did not speak to the 
identity of the parties and did not address the 
underlying substance of the claim.  Those were rules 
that simply talked about how a case could move through 
the courts.

 For example, in Douglas neither party was a 
resident of the State of New York and the New York court 
said:  If you're not residents, you can't come in and 
use our courts.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's not how it moves 
through the courts.  That is, you don't have a forum. 
That sounds to me like a jurisdictional ruling.  Those 
cases that say, our courts don't sit to hear cases where 
the parties are nonresidents, both sides; our courts 
don't sit to hear cases about accidents that happened in 
Timbuktu, those sound like, we don't offer a forum for 
that type of case, as distinguished from here, where New 
York does have a forum, it just won't kind of give one 
kind of relief.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Justice Ginsburg, I think -- I 

think that that is exactly right.  The point here is

that in -- in -- in Douglas, where the court did not --
where the New York courts did not allow any party --
where both parties were nonresidents of New York they 
wouldn't hear the case, that applied regardless of the 
identity of the employee.  It didn't matter whether the 
defendant was an employee of the State of New York or 
not.

 And it also applied regardless of what the 

underlying substantive claim was.  It didn't matter 
whether it was a tort action or a contract action or 
anything else.  If you weren't in New York, if you 
weren't a resident of New York, you couldn't take 
advantage of its -- of its courts.

 And in -- in Herb v. Pitcairn, where you had 
the situation where there was a -- there was a railroad 
accident brought in one county court in Illinois, it 
should have been brought in a different county court, 
the Court went -- went out of its way to say the State 
of Illinois has provided other forums, other State 
courts where you could have brought this case.

 And if the State, for example, in the 

present case had said, Mr. Haywood, you filed this case 
in Wyoming County Supreme Court and it really should 
have been brought down in Syracuse, that would be a 
neutral rule of jurisdiction.  It just dictates where

the case ought to be brought.

 By contrast, what New York has done here is 
that they have absolutely forbidden anyone to seek money 
damages against a prison official.  And the reason that 
they did that, as conceded in the Respondents' briefing, 
is because they don't want prison officials to be 
distracted from their duties.  They don't want prison 
officials to have to face the fear of vexatious 
lawsuits.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the -- the New 

York legislature said, you have a choice, you can bring 
a 1983 suit or you can bring this sort of suit against 
the State, and the State will respond to damages, but 
you can't do both.  Can they do that?

 MR. MURTAGH:  No, Your Honor, I don't think 

they could.  Once the State -- this Court's 
jurisprudence teaches us that once a court -- once a 
State opens its courts to hear analogous State law 
claims, it cannot then close its doors selectively to 
Federal claims.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What Justice Kennedy has 
asked you:  Say, you could have this Federal claim, but 
we are going to offer you a substitute under New York 
law, which the Federal authority could not force us to 
do, because it's a State waiving its sovereign immunity.

MR. MURTAGH:  I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg; 
certainly the State of New York could offer a State law 
alternative in addition to section 1983.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no, I said in the 

alternative.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Okay.  I don't believe, 

Justice Kennedy, that -- that New York could force a 
plaintiff to give up the right to sue section -- sue 
under section 1983 if the courts are otherwise open to 
tort actions in similar circumstances.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  Now, suppose 
they do it -- they say -- we are just talking about the 
State courts:  you can't bring both types in State 
courts.  You can still have your Federal cause of action 
in the Federal court, and we will also give our cause of 
action where the State's law is violated, but not both 
in the New York courts.

 MR. MURTAGH:  No, Justice Kennedy.  Once --

once New York establishes courts of general jurisdiction 
that are competent to hear these kinds of cases, it 
can't close its doors to section 1983 claims for money 
damages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it's okay for the State 

to say, we don't want any tort actions in our courts? 
That would be all right?

MR. MURTAGH:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  It 

seems --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's strange.  Why -- but 

it can't do the lesser thing of saying, we don't want 
this particular type of tort action.  One is 
jurisdictional -- you would say it's jurisdictional, 
right?  And this one is not jurisdictional, just because 
it's narrower?  It's still directed to the type of 
action.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Justice Scalia, I think the 

distinction is -- relates to the relative power of 
Congress and the States.  Once Congress has spoken and 
has provided a Federal cause of action, that becomes New 
York law.  And New York, as long as it has a court, is 
required to enforce that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but not if New York 
said, we don't want any tort actions.  What about if New 
York says, we don't want any -- uh -- personal injury 
tort actions?  Would that be enough, or is that too 
narrow?  And I'm going to narrow it down after that 
until I get down to your case.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. MURTAGH:  Justice Scalia, I -- I am not 
sure exactly where the line is in terms of the analogy. 
I think this case is very far on the other side.  In

other words, because New York State here -- even here, a 
section 1983 claim, this isn't a situation where they 
say, we have a court that's not competent to hear 
section 1983 claims.  They simply say:  We're not going 
to allow them to hear section 1983 claims for money 
damages where there is a prison official who's -- who is 
the defendant.

 If the defendant here, Justice Scalia, were 

a police officer who had engaged in the same conduct, 
New York State courts would have to hear that case.  So 
this is not the sort of thing --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that.  I just 

don't understand -- you acknowledge it's okay if it's 
jurisdictional; and you acknowledge that it is 
jurisdictional if you don't allow any tort actions.  I 
just don't know what makes this to be 
non-jurisdictional.  I don't know.

 MR. MURTAGH:  I think it -- intellectually, 
Justice Scalia, it seems to me that the distinction is 
that -- that there has to be a point at which you do 
respect the relative authority of the State and the 
Federal Governments.  By saying that a State may -- we 
are not going to require that a State establish a court 
to hear a whole kind of action that they otherwise 
wouldn't hear, that's providing some deference to the

authority of the State, as the Respondents point out, 
part of the core sovereignty of the State, to establish 
their courts and to run their courts.

 By contrast, once they have done that, once 
they provided that court system, then the power balance 
shifts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if this were at 
the beginning of whenever New York was establishing a 
court system, and they said from the outset, look, we 
are not going to hear these types of cases, then this 
would be okay?

 MR. MURTAGH:  Your Honor, I think under this 
Court's jurisprudence that would -- if the State of New 
York said we are not going to hear any kind of tort 
action, regardless of whether it's Federal or State, and 
it doesn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, that's 

mixing the two points.  Your point I understand it --

MR. MURTAGH:  Okay.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is that once the 
court has opened it up to a particular type of claim, 
they can't say, say no more.  So if they are setting 
up -- obviously we are not going to go back to whenever 
the New York State courts was established.  But if they 
suddenly said, we are going to revise our court system

or - or modernize it, and from now on we are not going 
to do this?

 MR. MURTAGH:  As long as -- as long as the 

withdrawal of jurisdiction was across all analogous 
State law claims as well as the Federal claim, then, 
yes.  I mean, we could discuss whether that would be a 
good idea or not, but I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, we would discuss what 

is analogous.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Yes, and that's -- that's a 

very good point, Justice Scalia; and this Court has told 
us as litigants what it thinks are analogous claims.  In 
Felder, this Court said an analogous claim for purposes 
of section 1983 is a common law tort.  That's the thing 
that's most like a section 1983 claim.  So the real 
question here is does New York State provide courts that 
can hear common law tort claims?  There is no dispute in 
this case that they do.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now, why can't New York 
take the position, we want to be realistic about these 
suits?  New York has provided that it is going to --
it's going to pick up the tab.  If you sue a 
correctional officer, New York is going to pick up the 
tab.

 So -- so we are going to channel this suit

to the court, the one court in the State that deals with 
the State, the sovereign, paying money, the court of 
claims.  So all they are doing is recognizing the 
reality that this is a suit against New York, not the 
correctional officer because it won't cost the 
correctional officer a dime; New York is going to 
provide counsel and is going to pay any judgment.

 So really where this case belongs is in the 

court that hears claims against the State of New York.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Justice Ginsburg, the problem 

with that analysis, I think, is that in the court of 
claims there are all sorts of other limitations.

 This -- this notion that this is simply a 
substitute claim and that it's just as good enough, I 
think really is a red herring in this case; because what 
has happened here is not that New York has created a 
separate court with specialized expertise that knows how 
to try these cases, which it probably could do under 
this Court's jurisprudence.  Rather, what it has done is 
it's required you to sue the State instead of the 
individual, and then put a whole host of limitations on 
the sort of relief that you can seek, and on the way 
that you can bring your case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's done exactly 
what the Federal system has done.  So that if you have a

money claim against -- that is going to be against the 
Federal Government, here's what you do:  You go to the 
Court of Claims, you have to go to the Court of Claims; 
and in that court all sorts of special rules apply about 
notice and other things.

 MR. MURTAGH:  And that is absolutely true, 

Justice Roberts, if the claim initially were a claim 
against the State.  But of course section 1983 doesn't 
provide for a claim against the State.  In Will v. 
Michigan this Court held that the State is not a person 
for purposes of section 1983, and so the only way you 
can have a section 1983 claim --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but in the 

Federal system if you sue a Federal official or a 
postman and in fact in reality it's going to be a claim 
against the United States, that has to go to the Court 
of Claims, too.

 MR. MURTAGH:  And Your Honor, that is 

absolutely something that Congress can decide to do with 
respect to Federal law, and New York can decide with 
respect to State law to do whatever it wants in terms of 
setting up where those claims can go.

 What New York cannot do is to impose that 
policy judgment on the Federal claim, because Congress 
has already determined --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess my point is 
that there's nothing fishy about what New York has done 
here.  Which leads me to think, well, maybe it's not 
really discrimination against the Federal claim, it's a 
rational way to handle claims against the State 
treasury, just as the Federal system is a rational way 
to handle claims against the Federal treasury.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Regardless of how rational an 
idea this is or how good an idea this is, for this Court 
to adopt a rule that says that once a State disagrees 
with Congress about how people ought to be liable under 
a Federal remedy would require this Court in essence to 
say that the rationale of several of your previous cases 
could be undone.  And I think this Court pointed out in 
Howlett that if all you had to do was say, our courts 
won't have jurisdiction over a certain category of 
claims that -- the Wisconsin legislature in Felder could 
have said:  Our courts shall have no jurisdiction unless 
there is 120-day notice of claim provided.

 The courts in Martinez in California -- the 
California legislature could have said, our State courts 
will have no jurisdiction --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that just goes 
back to our previous colloquy about what jurisdiction is 
and what it means.  I mean, are you saying that if we

look at this and we decide yes, this does really look 
like jurisdiction in the real sense, rather than just a 
jurisdictional label -- if we do that, then you lose?
 MR. MURTAGH:  I think that if this Court 

found that this were a jurisdiction -- a neutral rule of 
jurisdiction that constituted a valid excuse, that, yes, 
that would probably -- that would probably undermine my 
argument significantly.

 I think to get there, Chief Justice, you 
would have to -- you would have to sort of engage in 
some interesting thinking which I haven't gotten my mind 
around, to be quite honest.  The -- what this Court said 
in Howlett is, when we talk about jurisdiction, when we 
talk about what constitutes jurisdiction, we are talking 
about whether there is power over the subject matter and 
power over the parties involved.  And I don't think the 
Respondents in this case even argue that the New York 
supreme courts don't have the power over the parties 
here or don't have competence over this kind of subject 
matter.

 This case doesn't have any of the 

attributes, this rule, this correctional law section 24, 
doesn't have any of the attributes of a neutral 
procedural rule --

the legislature says it is?  Do you think there is some 
sort of -- you know, a Platonic ideal of jurisdiction 
versus non-jurisdiction, and that's what we apply here?
 MR. MURTAGH:  Justice Alito, I think that 

jurisdiction -- that to determine whether a rule is 
jurisdictional requires that this Court look at the 
purpose and the effect of the underlying statute.  And 
if all a State has to do is say it's jurisdictional and 
if jurisdiction is whatever the State says it is, then 
that means that, going back to Felder and Martinez and 
some of those cases, a State could -- could evade this 
Court's rulings merely by reframing the statutes in the 
words of jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So what is the -- what is 

the standard for determining whether it's jurisdictional 
or not?

 MR. MURTAGH:  Well, Justice Alito, the --

the important points, I think, come out of Felder:  That 
it is a neutral rule that is applicable to all cases and 
that is not concerned with the underlying substance of 
the claim.  So, for example, when we go back to the old 
cases, Douglas, Mayfield, Herb v. Pitcairn, this Court 
was looking at situations where there were rules that 
applied everywhere.

that it would be okay and would be a jurisdictional rule 
if the court -- if the State courts did not entertain 
tort actions.  That's a rule that goes to the substance 
of the claim, isn't it?

 MR. MURTAGH:  Well, Your Honor, it goes to 

the substance of the claim, but it applies generally 
across all claims.  It's not -- it's not picking and 
choosing.  It's not targeted towards a specific --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, it's picking and 

choosing tort claims.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Well, it's picking and 

choosing tort claims as opposed, I suppose, to contract 
claims.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
 MR. MURTAGH:  But it's not, Your Honor, 

saying:  We're going to accept this kind of tort claim 
but not that kind of tort claim.  We're going to allow 
to you sue a police officer who beats you up, but you 
can't sue a corrections officer who beats you up. 
That's the real difference, I think.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there something you add 

-- you add to your statement of your rule?  A neutral 
rule not related to substance, but related to the 
administration of the courts?

 MR. MURTAGH:  Yes, Justice Breyer.  I think

that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Don't just be agreeable to 

be agreeable.  Do cases actually say that?

 MR. MURTAGH:  I think, Your Honor -- I'd 

have to get the exact language from Felder, but I think 
that it is a neutral rule regarding the administration 
of the courts that is unrelated to the underlying 
substance of the matter or the nature of the parties.

 Your Honors, the most recent -- going on a 
little bit about this jurisdictional issue -- the most 
recent case that held that there was a neutral rule of 
judicial administration, a neutral procedural rule, was 
Johnson v. Fankell.  And this Court will recall that, in 
that case, Idaho had a rule that required that there be 
a final judgment before an intermediate -- before an 
appeal could be taken from that.

 This Court allowed Idaho to impose that rule 
on a section 1983 claim because the defendants there had 
argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity. 
They lost at the trial level.  They then sought an 
interlocutory appeal.  And this Court said certainly 
Idaho can set forth the ways in which you take appeal 
from any kind of a case, and, more importantly, this is 
not a rule that is targeted at civil rights claims and 
in fact may lead to over-enforcement of civil rights

claims because it prevents a defendant from getting out 
of the case very early.

 That's the kind of case where there's a 

neutral rule.  That's not what we have here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You are being generous 
when you said that we would recall -- at least that I 
would recall the case.  Is it Idaho, did you say, or 
Johnson?

 MR. MURTAGH:  In Johnson v. Fankell, I 

believe --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It was Johnson.  I thought 

you said Idaho.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Yes.  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 
I just said that the Idaho courts were involved in that 
one.

 Your Honor, the approach that's urged by the 
Respondents in this -- in this case really would dictate 
different results, as I mentioned.  You'd wind up -- in 
Felder and in Martinez, the courts could just use the 
word "jurisdiction."  And actually, even if you go back 
to three of this Court's earlier cases, Mondou in 1912, 
McKnett in 1934, Testa v. Katt in 1947 -- in Testa v. 
Katt, this Court required Connecticut to hear an 
Emergency Price Control Act even though Connecticut 
regularly refused to hear cases that they thought were

penal in nature.  And what this Court said was:  You 
hear analogous claims; you have to hear the Emergency 
Price Control Act.

 Now, if this Court were to adopt a rule that 
the State could simply say, we have no jurisdiction over 
certain categories of claims, then in Testa, Connecticut 
could simply have said:  We are not going to have 
jurisdiction over any case seeking penal or punitive 
types of damages.  That would require that we really 
undo a lot of this Court's jurisprudence.

 If there are no further questions at this 

point, I would reserve my time, Mr. Chief Justice.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. 

Murtagh.

 Ms. Underwood.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The Federal Constitution permits State 

courts to hear Federal claims, but it does not require a 
State to hear them so long as the State does not 
discriminate against Federal claims in comparison with 
similar State claims.

 New York's statute fully satisfies that

requirement.  New York courts cannot hear damage actions 
against prison officials for conduct in the scope of 
their employment.  And it doesn't matter whether State 
or Federal law is the basis for the claim.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Ms. Underwood, if that's 
going to be the criterion, that they exclude a State 
cause of action as readily as they exclude a Federal 
cause of action, then isn't the State always going to 
win every case in which there is an issue like this one? 
Because unless the State is so blatantly discriminatory 
or so blatantly inadvertent as to leave a cause of 
action of its own making on the books, when it says, "We 
won't hear the Federal one," what you posit is always 
going to be the case.  And if that's -- if the rule is 
that as long as there is no State action comparable to 
the Federal action that is disallowed, the State wins, 
in practical terms the State always wins.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, that's not so.  This 

Court has in fact invalidated statutes and found 
discrimination.  There were -- three of the early FELA 
-- two FELA cases and the Testa case itself.  In Testa, 
contrary to what was just suggested, the Court -- this 
Court found discrimination.  When Rhode Island said that 
it wasn't going to hear the emergency price control 
penal statute --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose a State 

extends --

MS. UNDERWOOD:  -- the Court --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose a State extends 

sovereign immunity to a broad class of State employees 
with reference to State law claims.  Would that mean 
that the State could close its courts to all 1983 
actions --

MS. UNDERWOOD:  No.  Immunity --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- against those same 

defendants?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No.  Immunity and 

jurisdiction are really quite different.  They both have 
the result that the defendant loses.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if they phrase it 

in terms of jurisdiction?  There is no jurisdiction in 
courts of New York to hear any intentional tort action 
against a correctional official for action taken during 
the performance of the correctional officer's duties. 
Do they then close the New York courts completely to 
1983 actions against correctional officials?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  If they not only used the 
word "jurisdiction" but gave the rule jurisdictional 
effect -- that is to say, a jurisdictional bar is one 
that can't be waived by the defendants, whereas immunity

can be waived.  So it protects courts, not defendants.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Underwood, there is a 
feature of this case, even assuming that you were right 
about -- New York has not withdrawn jurisdiction from 
its courts over a 1983 claim; it has simply limited, 
taken away, one mode of relief.  That is, you can sue a 
correctional official for declaratory relief, you could 
sue for injunctive relief.  All New York has taken away 
is one mode of relief.  That's not jurisdictional unless 
you say that every element of damages is jurisdictional.
 New York allows this type of claim in their 

courts.  We are talking about jurisdiction over the 
person?  Yes, they have jurisdiction over the 
correctional official's person.  Subject matter --
subject matter is a 1983 case?  Yes.  All they are 
cutting off is one form of relief.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, it's not just any form 

of relief.  It's not just, for instance, the type of 
damages.  The difference between law and equity has a 
long tradition in this country.  They are really two 
different actions, an action for injunctive relief or an 
action for damages.  The courts now hear them together. 
But what New York has said is it has no jurisdiction --
its courts have no jurisdiction against -- over damage 
actions against corrections officials.

And as I was saying earlier, jurisdiction is 
different from immunity, both because it can't be waived 
-- so it's about courts, not the defendants -- because 
it -- because a dismissal won't bar litigating the 
matter in Federal court.  A dismissal -- an immunity 
would result in a judgment --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Practically --

practically, hasn't what New York has done is to confer 
on its correctional officers absolute immunity, not 
merely qualified immunity?  So if you want to be 
realistic about what is the effect of New York's law, it 
says you are going to be subject to equitable relief, 
declaratory relief, but as far as money is concerned, 
you are absolutely immune.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I don't think it's immunity. 

I think it's a refusal to hear the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What's the difference 

of -- practically?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Practically --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't the -- isn't the 

practical effect -- if you tried to explain to 
correctional officers what is your exposure, you would 
say:  You have absolute immunity from anything that's 
going to try to reach into your pocket.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Not at all.  This is like a

forced removal, is what it really is.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're -- they are liable 

in Federal court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes, that's exactly correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're certainly not 

immune in Federal court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  They are fully liable in 

Federal court.  That's where these cases are being 
brought right now.  Congress has never expressed any 
policy for mandating that they be brought in State 
court, because even if these cases could have been 
brought in the first place in State courts, the Federal 
-- the State defendant could remove it to Federal court.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the theory was 

that in our Federal system, Federal law is State law, 
too?  That is the highest law for a State.  Federal law 
by virtue of the Supremacy Clause is State law; and 
sometimes Congress creates an exclusive Federal 
jurisdiction over certain types of claims.  But if 
Congress doesn't do that, the assumption is there is 
concurrent jurisdiction.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  That's correct.  But that's 
if the Court is open to the case.  The Fender case, the 
line of cases that Petitioner has been pointing to, is 
simply not applicable here where the State opens its

courts to the cases.  If the State were hearing damage 
actions against corrections officers, it couldn't give 
them immunity.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But what is the neutral 
reason related to the administration of courts that 
leads the State to close its door to a damage suit under 
1983 against correctional officers?
 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- taking as the assumption 

exactly what Justice Ginsburg said.  I mean, I can't 
find any reason that's neutral and administrative other 
than what Justice Ginsburg said, which is neither: 
namely New York does not like 1983 actions for damages 
against correctional officers.  What other reason is 
there?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  First of all, these -- this 
-- I would like to correct an observation.  This -- this 
is not aimed only or even principally at 1983 actions. 
This law does predate the -- not the enactment of 1983, 
but the proliferation, the use -- the widespread use of 
1983; and in fact it affects a great many State cases. 
It's not only --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But Testa v Katt was a case 

in which the Court found that the State allows some 
State action that are analogous to the Federal action

and you can't discriminate against a Federal action.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  That's true.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  This is not that case. 

This is a case where the State doesn't allow -- doesn't 
allow -- damage actions like the Federal action --

MS. UNDERWOOD:  If --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and this Court has not 
decided to my knowledge how we apply the basic rule in 
such a situation.  So I would think that the way we 
would apply it is take the standard and ask the State, 
what is the neutral administrative-related reason? 
Because what they are saying is, if you look at this, 
from an administrative point of view, it's that 
red-haired, one-eyed man with a limp.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Prisons are large 

institutions in rural counties that generate a vast 
amount of litigation.  This particular prisoner was in a 
prison in a rural county like Wyoming County that had I 
think 3,000 or so prisoners in it, and the litigation 
generated by the prisons isn't just actions by 
prisoners.  This statute doesn't apply only to actions 
against -- by prisoners.  It also applies to actions by 
prison employees against other prison employees --
actions by anybody against a -- corrections officials. 
So it's all the vast forms of litigation, principally

but not exclusively prisoner complaints, that arise out 
of prisons.

 That is a very large and burdensome amount 
of litigation, unlike litigation against State police, 
which some have said is comparable, which is dispersed 
all over the State.  This is concentrated where the 
large prisons are; and it is a reasonable decision -- a 
neutral reason, if you will -- for the State to decide 
to take those actions out of the courts of general 
jurisdiction, to take actions -- damage actions arising 
out of the prisons out of the courts of general 
jurisdiction, where it would be concentrated in a few 
counties where the large prisons are.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  General Underwood, your 

friend on the other side acknowledges that if New York 
states closed its courts to tort actions, that would be 
okay.  But I don't see how closing your courts to tort 
actions has any administrative -- particular 
administrative rationale behind it, do you?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, and I don't believe that 
this Court's cases about jurisdiction, as distinguished 
from its cases about case handling rules, require that 
kind of neutral administrative feature.

 I only was suggesting that there exists such 

an explanation for this rule; but in fact, this Court

has treated quite differently cases about case handling, 
and that makes sense.  Because if you hear a claim -- if 
the State hear a claim and then impose even a 
nondiscriminatory -- but it's certainly a discriminatory 
rule that tends to defeat the claim, the State might 
induce plaintiffs to bring their claims in State court 
and then lose them under disadvantageous procedures.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose that the State of 

New York said that in suits against corrections --
against the corrections department, against the State, 
there should be no damages awarded to a prisoner in 
excess of $3,000; and then the --

MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- and then 1980 -- and 
then the prisoner tries to bring a 1983 suit in State 
court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would the case -- would 

the analysis be just the same?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, I don't think the 

analysis would be the same.  I think once the State 
opens its doors to a damage action against corrections 
officials, the question would be -- the answer might or 
might not come out the same way, but I think it probably 
would come out differently.

The -- the question would be, does that 
procedural rule -- there are two questions:  Is it 
discriminatory?  You're saying -- your hypothetical is 
that it's not discriminatory as between State and 
Federal, and the second question would be does it 
undermine the Federal cause -- does it undermine the 
Federal claim?

 And so in Martinez, when this Court said 
State immunities can't apply to Federal 1983 actions, 
only Federal immunities can apply, the Court was careful 
to observe that California had opened its courts to this 
case and had an immunity, whereas --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In my hypothetical, do you 

think it undermines the Federal claims?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No.  I think it could be 

argued, I think it would be argued that limiting damages 
undermines a Federal action that is meant to bar courts 
from interpretation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why can't it be argued 
here that Congress has an important mechanism in holding 
prison officials -- prison correctional officers --
personally liable, so that they are themselves aware 
that they have a constitutional obligation that is 
enforceable against them, and New York has taken this 
away?

Now you may -- we may argue that if the 

State responds in damages, the prisoner is better off; 
but Congress has not made that judgment.  Congress has 
made the judgment that the correctional officer himself 
or herself should be responsible.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, I don't believe 
Congress has made that judgment.  So that I -- and 
that's my answer to why I don't think this undermines 
the Federal cause --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, it has made that 

judgment.  That's the whole purpose of 1983.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, the purpose of 1983 is 

to -- actually was two things.  It's to provide a 
Federal forum and it was to provide compensation for 
these torts, and I believe that these --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  He's still responsible, 

right?  I mean --

MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He's still responsible.
 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I think there is no Federal 

policy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, the correctional 

officer, under the scheme we are talking about, is not 
responsible in damages.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  He is responsible to exactly

the same degree as he would be, were he sued personally, 
because New York indemnifies him and there is no 
requirement -- Congress has never shown any objection to 
indemnification.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- does your case turn 
on whether or not there is an indemnification agreement?
 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I don't know that our case 

turns on whether --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I shouldn't think so. 

That hasn't been your argument so far.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, what I'm saying is to 
the extent -- I don't believe we need to -- if you think 
that we need to -- that there may be a conflict with a 
Federal policy, I think the statute stands because it's 
nondiscriminatory and jurisdictional.  But if there is a 
question, it's not a question of whether -- yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Just you ask an offshoot 

of Justice Kennedy's question.  Supposing you had a 
statute that said in railroad cases there should be no 
damage -- railroad tort cases, brought by employees of 
railroads, there was no damage judgment in excess of 
$10,000, in State court?  Would that be okay?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, I don't think so, for 

the same reason I don't think -- that is, if you have a 
tort remedy that the State is hearing than a limit on

recovering that goes -- that is inconsistent with 
congressional policy is not permitted.  But if the State 
were to say we won't hear any tort cases or we won't 
hear any tort cases involving railroads or we won't hear 
any tort cases --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you think --

consistently with our FELA cases it could have a rule 
that no tort -- no tort cases may be brought by railroad 
employees against the railroad in a State court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  State or Federal.  There is 
nothing in your FELA cases that says that as long as the 
State is closing its doors equally.  And there are, of 
course, political reasons --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, they shouldn't have 

closed the Federal doors under the FELA.  They surely 
could bring the suit under Federal.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, but -- but --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  But you are saying they 
could -- as opposed to State courts, the suits against 
railroads where the damage gets -- over $10,000?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, I don't think they could 

put the damage requirement on, because then they would 
be --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But they could totally 

close it?

MS. UNDERWOOD:  They could totally close the 

doors, and I think that's different.  That is not 
hearing the case, and in closing -- closing the doors of 
the court evenhandedly to State and Federal cases.  That 
is -- that is --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  If you leave the door open 

to suits against every other possible defendant except 
railroads?  I mean, it seems to me your hardest case is 
really the FELA cases here.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I think the FELA cases, some 
of which were -- some exclusions were upheld and some of 
which were struck down, support our position, because 
they only strike down exclusions of jurisdiction where 
there is a discrimination, where the Court finds a 
discrimination between the Federal and State claim.

 In Mondou, Connecticut was hearing suits 

against railroads under State law.  It was even hearing 
suits against railroads under other States' law that 
imposed -- liability, but it was refusing to hear only 
suits under Federal law.  And that's why the Court 
struck it down.

 Similarly, in McKnett and in Testa, in each 

case this Court struck down in limitation on the 
ground -- not that the State had an absolute obligation 
to hear the Federal claim, but that it had an

obligation, if it was going to exclude jurisdiction, to 
exclude it evenhandedly.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that in Testa 
the State said we are evenhanded, we don't bring -- we 
don't allow penal actions to be -- to be brought on the 
civil side of our court?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  But what -- but what this 

Court pointed to in Testa was that while they said that, 
they did, in fact, hear pun -- double damage actions, 
which is what this was.  It was penal in a sense not of 
being a criminal, but as being a double damage -- a 
multiple damage action.

 And what the Court said was because Rhode 

Island does hear double damage actions arising under its 
own law and under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, 
essentially the rational they gave for excluding the 
Emergency Press Control Act had been proven false and 
must -- unless as the only explanation unwillingness to 
enforce the emergency press control.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So what you have now is you 

have one reason, I think, would be clearly wrong; I 
think, I assume that.  But if the State closed their 
doors to this kind of suit because they say we think our 
correctional officers should be immune from damages, now 
we know they can get money under the Federal law, but we

want nothing to do with this.  That, I think, would be 
discrimination against the suit if that were their 
reason.

 Now, there is a neutral reason, and it's 

demonstrated, and it is, well, you see, there are just 
too many -- there are just too many lawsuits by 
prisoners against prison officials.  And we don't want 
all that business in that court, and here's how we deal 
with it.

 One, we take away their cause of action, 
that's what we do under State law, and then we -- the 
feds -- we throw them back to Fed court?  Without --
MS. UNDERWOOD:  Or -- or we offer them a 

court of claims.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't offer them a 

court of claims, because what you offer in the court of 
claims is an action against the State.  And you can say 
that isn't a big deal because after all, most of these 
really are actions against the State anyway, because 
they get compensated.

 Okay, so if I treat that as neutral, I have 
one bad reason and one good reason.  And how do I know 
which is which?  That is, is it really true that there 
are a lot of suits brought in State courts in places 
with prisons under 1983 for damages rather than Federal

courts?  I don't know what the numbers are?  Have you 
looked them up at all?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, they aren't -- this is 
what I can tell you.  I think 1983, they are -- I mean, 
suits against --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- 1983 actions, but maybe 

they bring them mostly in Federal court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  They do bring them in 

Federal court.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So one way to test 
this out would be the following:  If we had numbers and 
knew, you know, about how many State -- how many damage 
actions against prisoners were being brought in State 
courts in districts that have prisons there, and then we 
saw how much New York was really hurting and then we 
asked another question, maybe there is some Federal 
security actions, you see, where there is no State 
comparable action and we found out, well, the State lets 
them bring these actions in State court.  So, there are 
ways of dealing with this empirically.  Have you any 
sense of it?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, what I can tell you is 

that there are a great many State law -- I can't tell 
you numbers -- a great many State law actions against 
corrections officers.  They are either in the court of

claims or they are in Federal court because this statute 
says that the courts have no jurisdiction over the 
damage actions, and it doesn't matter whether they are 
1983 or state law.  But there are a great many -- I 
mean, it says to -- read them.

 The State law actions -- there are many 

state law actions that can't be constitutionally 
characterized.  There is all kinds of, you know, 
damaging loss to property, medical malpractice, 
negligence, failure to protect from harm, things that --
many things that the prisoners bring suits against that 
are not constitutional.  They aren't in the Supreme 
Court.  They would be if you struck this statute down.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  It's not really that they 
are not the Supreme Court, but the -- the damages are 
limited, aren't they, because in the court of claims, as 
I understand it or under the statute, there can't be any 
punitive damages?  Whereas if it were a straight 1983 
action in the State supreme court, punitive damages 
would -- would be a possibility.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, there are two things 

to say about punitive damages.  One is that, yes --
there are three things -- there are no punitive damages 
in the court of claims.  Punitive damages, of course, 
are available in Federal court, which is fully available

to these plaintiffs and is where they normally are if 
they think they have a punitive damage claim.

 It is also case that actions outside the 
scope of employment are not covered by this statute.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  They could be brought into 

the state supreme court --

MS. UNDERWOOD:  They could be brought into 

the state court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- which is a -- which is 

one of your jurisdictional problems because the --
the -- in effect, New York is saying the most -- the 
most egregious class of cases, the cases in which the 
correctional officers are not only doing some actionable 
but something outside the scope of their duty, well, we 
will hear them, they are fine.  And we will provide 
punitive damages for them.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Which -- which makes it a 

little tough to say that in the less egregious cases 
there is a -- that the -- that the exclusion of the less 
egregious cases is a jurisdictional exclusion as 
distinct from an exclusion based upon policy about how 
less egregious cases ought to be handled.

treated as jurisdictional.  The New York courts say --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but aren't you simply 
saying, look, we go around calling it jurisdictional. 
And -- and my point was, that isn't it difficult, isn't 
it, in fact, inappropriate to call it jurisdictional 
when you have a class of the most egregious cases under 
1983 which the State supreme courts hear, and there is, 
nonetheless, a second class of cases, also 1983 -- they 
simply happen to be less egregious -- that they don't 
hear?  Isn't it difficult, using jurisdictional in the 
normal sense of the term, to say that is a 
jurisdictional distinction?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, because what the 
jurisdictional bar is for damage actions against 
correctional officers where actions is the scope of 
their employment -- and the New York courts don't just 
say it's jurisdictional.  They give it the effect of a 
jurisdictional bar.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  What if the New York 

legislature passed a statute saying the -- the State 
court supreme court will not have jurisdiction over 1983 
actions for -- for harm committed on Wednesday, would 
you say that that was a jurisdictional rule?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, what I can tell you is 

that there are a great many State-law -- I can't tell 
you the numbers.  There are a great many State-law 
actions against corrections officers.

 They are either in the Court of Claims, or 

they are in Federal courts because this statute says 
that the courts have no jurisdiction over the damage

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, I think the rationale 

for that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Which makes it a little 

tough to say that in the less egregious cases there is a 
-- that the -- that the exclusion of the lesser cases is 
a jurisdictional exclusion as -- as distinct from a --
an exclusion based upon policy about how less egregious

jurisdictional --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  You might call it crazy 

outside of court, but the one thing you wouldn't do is 
walk into a court and say it's jurisdictional.  And my 
-- the -- the point that I am getting at is:  The finer 
the comb that -- that keeps the certain class of case 
out, the less plausible it is to say that this is a 
jurisdictional kind of criterion at work here.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, in --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  And that's what I -- that's 

why I keep getting at the point that when -- when you 
lay in some 1983 actions, the worst ones, the ones with 
the highest potential damages, but you say, well, the --
the less awful ones, the ones that may be within scope 
of employment, they can't come in, it seems to me that 
the -- that the teeth on the comb are getting rather 
fine.  And in terms of our normal usage in -- in 
applying this criterion, it -- it is not plausibly 
jurisdictional.

out of the courts of general jurisdiction the cases that 
are most numerous and that are most appropriately 
indemnified by the State.  But it leaves in the courts 
of general jurisdiction the ones that are less numerous 
and that are not appropriately indemnified or turned 
into actions against the State.  So it's rational unlike 
the Wednesday cases.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  One of the concerns I have 

in this case is the scope of employment is often 
litigated, and it would seem to me that the State of New 
York might routinely say, oh, this is not within the 
scope of employment.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, there is a body of 

cases that are quite generous --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Which -- which means that 

this is a very difficult distinction and is a further 
burden on the 1983 ride.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  The law of the State of New 

York is relatively clear on this.  The kinds of cases 
that are outside the scope of employment are prisoner 
rapes and things that are done by corrections officers 
that do not in any way further the -- the objective. 
They are simply --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think that's a rather 

routine defense.  But why are they -- why are they left

in the supreme court?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Because they are not 

appropriately -- because the State doesn't want to take 
responsibility -- when the State statute takes them from 
the supreme court, then actions on such matters can be 
brought against the State in the court of claims.  And 
the state is not taking responsibility for those cases 
and will not indemnify them.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When was this statute 

first enacted?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, the statute was first 

enacted in -- in about 1947, or so.

 JUSTICE:  And then you say they were not --

that 1982 is on the books, but, gee, it wasn't -- it 
wasn't --

MS. UNDERWOOD:  It was not -- it was nothing 

--

JUSTICE:  It pretty clearly was not aimed at 

defeating Federal actions.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Correct.  It was not aimed 
at defeating Federal actions.  It was aimed at just --
at -- at managing the --

JUSTICE:  It had not even been held then 

that State Farm was available for 1983 actions.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  That's correct.

 JUSTICE:  Can I -

MS. UNDERWOOD:  The rise of Federal 1983


actions came subsequently and -- and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that's an important 
factor, I would think.  Let me ask another question.  It 
-- it's a standard rule of international law that no 
State will enforce the penal laws of another State.  I 
assume the Federal Government could not -- maybe I am 
wrong to assert this, but could the Federal Government 
require New York to prosecute federal crimes?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I don't know the answer to 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't, either, but I 

think it can't.  I think it can't, probably.  Then my 
next question is going to be:  Why aren't punitive 
damages penal laws as well?  And if that's the same 
principle, maybe there's no big deal about New York 
excluding penal damages --

MS. UNDERWOOD:  There may be, but there is 

no --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  1983 does not -- correct 

me if I am wrong -- does not allow punitive damages 
against a State, does it?

MS. UNDERWOOD:  1983 does not allow any 
liability.  1983 has been construed not -- the State 
isn't a person; it can't be a defendant.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Not -- if I got that 

right, not in Monell.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  The State in Monell --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Even in Monell -- even in 
Monell there is no punitive damages against the State, 
which is another reason you -- you were discriminating 
against the employee here -- against the prisoner. 
Because the prisoner could get punitive damages against 
the correctional officer but not against the State in 
either court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Where he can -- where he can 
bring his 1983 action, he can get punitive damages.  The 
State has closed its door to damage actions, 1983 or 
otherwise.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In neither court can you 
get -- and correct me if I am wrong -- punitive damages 
against the State, which never --

MS. UNDERWOOD:  He can get damages -- under 

1983 he can get damages against --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  In county --
MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes.  In fact, what I was 

going to say is that one of the things that shows there 
is no congressional policy focused only on individuals 
is that municipalities and other government entities are 
proper defendants.  The State is not.  Likely, the 
government -- the Federal policy was -- found by this 
Court in construing 1983 for not making the State a 
defendant was not that that would undermine deterrent 
and that it was preferable to sue individuals, but that 
there was some reluctance -- concern about power or 
wisdom of -- of imposing liability on the States.

 And, in fact, that is what this Court said 
in Monell and Will about why the State is not a person. 
So I don't think 1983 is fairly read as embracing a 
congressional judgment that it's better to have 
liability against individuals, better from the 
plaintiffs' point of view, than against the State.

 But the way this works is it is, in effect, 

a mandatory removal.  And since Congress has no 
objection and has not prohibited removal the way it did 
in FELA cases, it's hard to see how the congressional 
policy is frustrated by this mandatory removal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JASON E. MURTAGH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MURTAGH:  Mr. Chief Justice, just very 
briefly, General Underwood just mentioned that -- that 
this could be analyzed as a mandatory removal statute. 
But the distinction, Your Honors, is that what New York 
State does when it removes these cases to Federal court 
is it uses an avenue that is provided by Congress.  And, 
certainly, if Congress wants to provide for removal to 
Federal court, Congress can do that.

 What the State cannot do is come in and 

interpose its policy judgment over and above what 
Congress has decided with respect to Federal claims.

 Very quickly, I would like to address the 

second point.  General Underwood pointed out that there 
are a lot of large prisons in rural counties in New York 
State; and, therefore, there are a lot of cases that 
might be brought in those courts.  There is no dispute 
in this case, Your Honors, that if New York wanted to 
have a statute that said those cases will be transferred 
to the less busy courts of our State, that would be 
okay.  That would be a neutral rule of judicial 
administration related to the operation of the courts 
that is unrelated to the substance or the identity of 
the parties.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In that same act they 
might rescind the -- the laws allowing the State to 
respond in damages, in which case you won't obtain very 
much.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Well -- well, Your Honor, my 
client can't bring his Section 1983 claim in any State 
court because he can't bring it against the employees, 
because Correctional Law Section 24 keeps him out of the 
supreme court.  And he can't sue the you State in the 
court of claims because in Will v. Michigan this Court 
said the State is not a person.  So he simply cannot 
bring his Federal action in any State court if he wants 
money damages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I find it hard to regard 
this as a non-neutral law when it was put on the books 
before there were any of these 1983 actions.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Well, Justice Scalia, the --
the very first iteration of this law was in 1947.  The 
law was actually amended -- and it is discussed in -- in 
the joint appendix and there is some in the beginning of 
our brief -- in the early 1970's after there were a 
significant number of -- of Section 1983 claims that had 
begun to be filed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was there any substantive 
change from what the original enactment to the amendment

-- the one that's currently enforced?

 MR. MURTAGH:  Justice Ginsburg, I don't 

recall whether there were any.  We actually researched 
the legislative history and had a bit of difficulty 
going back that far.  I don't recall whether there were 
a lot of substantive changes or not, quite honestly.

 This is a statute, though, that the -- that 
the New York Legislature has -- has dealt with over the 
years.

 One of the important things is that in the 
1970's -- and I apologize for not having the exact date 
-- the New York Legislature said that the purpose of 
this was to provide immunity to corrections officials. 
And as we pointed out in our briefing, there is a bill 
currently pending before the New York Legislature that 
says we want to extend the same immunity that we provide 
to prison officials to employees of the Office of --

JUSTICE BREYER:  They are saying -- they are 

also saying there is a neutral reason.  The neutral 
reason is the State sees there are just too many cases 
in which prisoners are suing correctional officials.

 So then they say:  Here's what we are going 

to do about it.  First, under State law, we will wipe 
out all the suits and give them instead an action 
against the State.  But we know there are still some

Federal cases about the same thing.  So what we are 
going to do is we are going to say bring them in Federal 
court.  Why bring them in State court?  So now we've 
dealt with our administrative problem.

 So that's their neutral administrative 

reason.  Now, people would like to bring 1983 actions 
still in State or Federal court.  It may be more 
convenient.  They get attorneys' fees, and the 
attorneys' fees you don't get under the State law.  So 
why isn't -- or why is -- I guess that's the question 
for me:  Is this an adequate, neutral, administrative 
reason or not?

 MR. MURTAGH:  No, Justice Breyer.  The --

the reason that is given in this particular case, if you 
-- if you go through the Respondent's briefing, the 
reason that is given is that there -- is that this 
statute exists because there are lots of frivolous, 
vexatious lawsuits.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, forget all of the 
characterizations.  If we could look into the motive, 
maybe we would have a different view.  But all we have 
is the statute on the books.  And, as in many cases, the 
people who are charged with defending those statutes 
think of very good reasons which are very plausible that 
could have motivated the people involved, and they have

come up with the one that you have heard.  Now, what's 
-- what's wrong with that one?

 MR. MURTAGH:  And I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. 

The reason?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The reason is, you see, 

there are so many cases in which the person is suing --
the prisoner is suing the prison official that our 
courts are clogged.  So what we are going to do is: 
One, give the prisoners a good remedy under State law in 
a different court; and, two, close our doors to the 
comparable Federal case.

 MR. MURTAGH:  Justice Breyer, the answer is 
that the State can certainly do that with respect to the 
State-law claims.

 What it can't do is try to shuttle Federal 

claims off to the Federal courts and close its doors for 
a hearing on similar State claims.

 Your Honors, thank you for your time.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
