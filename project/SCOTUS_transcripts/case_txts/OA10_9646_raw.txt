(10:25 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 10-9646, Miller v. Alabama. 

Mr. Stevenson. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. STEVENSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

In Graham v. Florida, this Court recognized 

that children are inherently characterized by internal 

attributes and external circumstances that preclude a 

finding of a degree of culpability that would make a 

sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of 

parole constitutionally permissible under the Court's 

Eighth Amendment excessiveness analysis. 

While the issue in Graham involved juveniles 

that were convicted of non-homicide offenses, these 

deficits in maturity and judgment and decision-making are 

not crime-specific.  All children are encumbered with 

the same barriers that this Court has found to be 

constitutionally relevant before imposition of a 

sentence of life imprisonment without parole or the 

death penalty. 

In fact, in Roper, this Court acknowledged

that these differences between children and adults exist 

even in the cases involving the most aggravated murders. 

These deficits, these differences, are even more 

pronounced in young children. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Stevenson, but in 

Roper, the Court also made the point -- when it ruled 

out the death penalty, it said, "To the extent the 

juvenile death penalty might have residual deterrent 

effect, it is worth noting that the punishment of life 

imprisonment without the possibility of parole is itself 

a severe sanction." 

So, the Court in Roper seemed to be 

anticipating this case and suggesting that -- that it 

was all right, it was constitutional. 

MR. STEVENSON:  There's no question, Justice 

Ginsburg, that the -- the default sentence in Roper was 

life imprisonment without parole, but we actually think 

that, specifically with regard to that provision, there 

is no greater deterrent effect, and these deficits, that 

these problems that children experience, lend themselves 

to an analysis that is subject when the punishment is 

life imprisonment without parole.  Like the death 

penalty --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about 50 years?  Is 

that -- is that too much?

MR. STEVENSON:  What the Court held in -- in 

Graham --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you know, once --

once you depart from the principle that we've enunciated 

that death is different, why is life without parole 

categorically different from 60 years or 70 years or --

you know, you'd be back here next term with a 60-year 

sentence? 

MR. STEVENSON:  Justice Scalia, I think 

you're absolutely right, that there is a point at which 

a term-of-year sentence could constitute the same kind 

of judgment --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay. 

MR. STEVENSON:  -- as life imprisonment 

without parole. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Good. 

MR. STEVENSON:  But there is a distinction 

obviously between life imprisonment without parole and 

any other term sentence.  Those sentences in most 

instances, if the sentence is not too extreme, do permit 

the possibility of release.  And what this Court held in 

Graham is not that the State forfeits the ability to 

incarcerate for life --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'll change my -- I'll 

change my question to 50 years without possibility of

Official 

MR. STEVENSON:  I – in --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then you have no -- no 

distinction, right? 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I think there, it 

would be a tough case.  I think imposed on a juvenile, a 

50-year sentence --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Without --

MR. STEVENSON:  -- would not create the 

meaningful possibility of release that this Court 

ordered in the Graham context.  It would be right on the 

line, but I think 50 years would actually be on the 

other side of a meaningful possibility of release.  It 

would be sort of a cynical reaction, if this Court were 

to say we ban life without parole for these kinds of 

offenders, it would be somewhat problematic to suggest 

that we're going to get as close to death as possible 

and then facilitate some kind of review.  I think what 

we're interested in --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about 15 years old? 

15, 60 years; or 14, 70 years? 

MR. STEVENSON:  I think all of the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what's the 

distinction between 14 and 15? 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I think from a

sentencing perspective, all of those sentences would be 

problematic.  But the distinction between a 14-year-old 

and a 15-year-old for constitutional purposes is that, 

of course, the younger you are, the more compelling are 

these deficits, these distinctions, that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand, but how are 

we -- how are we to know where to draw those lines?  We 

can't do it on the basis of any historical tradition, 

certainly. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The common law left it up 

to the jury to take account of the youthfulness of the 

offender. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well -- well I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're all entitled to 

jury trial, right --

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- before they're --

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, that's true.  But, of 

course, in this case, Justice Scalia, and in the other 

case, there was no discretion for the sentence.  Neither 

the judge nor the jury could give any effect to the age 

of Evan Miller, who was 14.  But I also think that we've 

identified lots of laws that make these distinctions. 

We do provide for greater responsibilities -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would that satisfy you if 

the -- if it were not a mandatory term and it was left 

to the trier, and you could put in all the mitigating 

circumstances? 

MR. STEVENSON:  That would not satisfy me, 

Justice Ginsburg, for all the reasons that this Court 

acknowledged in Graham, that -- that the problem with 

many of these crimes is that the offense itself can 

overwhelm all of these mitigating factors, all of these 

aspects of juvenile decision-making that we think are 

constitutionally permissible.  The other problem is that 

we still can't make good judgments about whether a 

child -- whether these characteristics are transitory or 

permanent. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, you're saying it would 

be unprincipled for us to say -- or at least unsupported 

for us to say -- that the sentence cannot be mandatory, 

but that in some cases, it might still be imposed. 

MR. STEVENSON:  I think it would be 

principled to -- to kind of strike down mandatory 

sentences, but I think constitutionally what this Court 

has recognized in Roper and in Graham, that it would be 

a -- a mistake to equate kids with adults.  And we don't 

have the ability to make those judgments even if we 

create a different kind of process.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you take that off the 

table, then you leave us with nothing but saying that 

the sentence is never permitted or that it's always 

permitted. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I -- I don't mean to 

take it off the table; I just mean to argue, as we did 

previously, that a categorical ban would be consistent 

with the Court’s understanding about child status and 

development. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If you could write the 

opinion for us, what would you hold? 

MR. STEVENSON:  I would hold that children 

are categorically prohibited from being subjected to 

sentences --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What's -- what's the 

definition of a child for that purpose? 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, we presented data in 

this case that would exclude a youth 14 and younger.  No 

State that has set a minimum age for life without parole 

has set it beneath the age of 15, other than one.  And 

so, we -- we would make that holding.  I do think it 

would be --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So, you -- you would hold 

you can't -- there cannot be a sentence of life

1  imprisonment without parole for anyone under 15, but for 

2  anybody over 15, it would be permissible. 

3

 MR. STEVENSON:  No, I would also hold, Your 

4  Honor, that a mandatory sentence for that cohort would 

5

also be in violation of this Eighth Amendment principle. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Or you could say you 

7  reserve that question for another day. 

8

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I think that the 

9  problem, Justice Ginsburg, is -- is that these cases 

10

with the mandatory sentencing aspects to them create 

11  kind of a data issue that this Court has usually relied 

12  on to kind of generate an interest. 

13

 I think right now we know that excluding 

14  considerations of age and character in a sentencing 

15

determination of life imprisonment without parole is 

16  problematic.  The Court in --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, can you tell us where the 

18  age line needs to be drawn for constitutional purposes? 

19

20

 MR. STEVENSON:  I -- I would draw it at 18, 

Justice Alito, because we've done that previously; we've 

21  done that consistently.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  That's where you think the 

23  logic of your argument leads.

17 -- a person of 17 years and 10 months, 11 months, who 

commits the worst possible string of offenses still --

and demonstrates great maturity -- still cannot be 

sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. 

MR. STEVENSON:  That's right, for the same 

reasons that we made that determination in Graham and 

that the Court made that determination in Roper.  And I 

understand that there are some tensions when we draw 

those kinds of lines --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I thought 

you just said a second earlier that you had a bifurcated 

rule:  No life without parole whatsoever for 15 and 

under, and no mandatory life for 16 -- 15 and over. 

MR. STEVENSON:  That -- that would be -- I'd 

have two rules, Justice Sotomayor.  My preferred rule 

would be a categorical ban on all juveniles under the 

age of 18.  And I don't want to retreat from that in any 

way.  All of these deficits, all of these 

characteristics, that we're talking about have been 

recognized to apply to all youth up until the age of 18. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you -- how do you 

write the opinion to do the bifurcated rule?  What 

justifies an absolute ban at a certain age and a 

modified ban above an age, and how do you deal with 

Harmelin with respect to the second part of your rule?

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, how do we get rid of 

the mandatory if that's what we're were going to do? 

MR. STEVENSON:  It's a challenge, and I --

and I concede that.  But I -- and so, the first part of 

my answer would be that I think the easier rule to write 

would be that there is a categorical ban on all life 

without parole sentences for all children up until the 

age of 18, acknowledging --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How -- how do I come to 

that decision?  What do I -- just consult my own 

preferences on this matter?  Something like 39 States 

allow it.  I mean, the American people, you know, have 

decided that that's the rule.  They allow it.  And the 

Federal Government allows it. 

So, I'm supposed to impose my -- my judgment 

on -- on what seems to be a consensus of the American 

people? 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, at least in this case, 

you'd look to your precedent in Roper and in Graham, 

which drew that line.

help me, you know. 

Official 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I understand --

(Laughter.) 

MR. STEVENSON:  I understand, 

Justice Scalia, but I don't think you can draw much 

comfort in the fact that 39 jurisdictions make this 

theoretically possible.  That same number existed in the 

Graham context.  Most of those jurisdictions have not 

addressed a minimum age for life without parole. 

In fact --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you mean when you 

say that, that they have not addressed it?  If a State 

law allows it, have they not addressed it? 

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  That is, what the 

State permits is that --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So, legislators don't 

understand that their law permits this? 

MR. STEVENSON:  I don't think we can read 

into a transfer judgment, which is the only judgment 

that they've made.  They've said that some children of 

some age can be treated like adults.  They haven't 

talked about what that -- what the punishment should be. 

And the reason why I say that, Justice Alito, is that in 

many of these States, there's no minimum age for trying 

a child as an adult.

JUSTICE ALITO:  But I don't really 

understand this argument.  You mean the legislatures 

have enacted these laws, but they don't realize that, 

under these laws, a -- a person under the age of 18 may 

be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for --

for murder.  They don't understand that? 

MR. STEVENSON:  They -- they have not 

considered that or adopted or endorsed it, would be more 

accurate. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's difficult because 

the statistics show there are 2300 prisoners now under 

sentence of -- with life without parole for juvenile 

murders and they're -- that were committed under 18; 

2300 nationwide. 

MR. STEVENSON:  That -- that's correct. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, it's very difficult to 

assess your answer to Justice Alito that, oh, the 

legislatures don't know about this. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, in -- that answer --

that number, Your Honor, is partly rooted in the fact 

that these sentences are mandatory.  There is no one 

capable, once the court makes a decision to try the 

child as an adult, to do anything to consider the status 

of children.

JUSTICE ALITO:  If you think these 

legislators don't understand what their laws provide, 

why don't you contact them?  And when they -- when you 

tell them, do you realize that in your State a -- a 

16-year-old or a 17-year-old may be sentenced to life 

imprisonment without parole for murder, they'll say: 

Oh, my gosh, I never realized that; let's change the 

law. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I -- I mean, I don't 

think there are any legislatures that are -- that are 

quick to make their sentences less -- more 

compassionate, more responsive to -- to juvenile crime 

of any sort.  But --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So, they've made a decision 

on this.  Now, maybe it's a bad decision --

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- but I really don't 

understand how you can argue that they have not made a 

decision on this --

MR. STEVENSON:  I think --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- and they are not aware of 

what their law provides. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  I think the strength 

of my argument, Justice Alito, is that the States that 

have actually considered, discussed, and passed laws

setting a minimum age for life without parole have all 

set that minimum age above 15.  That's my primary 

argument.  Thirteen States have done it; all of them 

except for one have set it at 18 --

JUSTICE ALITO:  And you think there's a 

difference between the State that says expressly a 

juvenile below a certain age may be sentenced to life 

imprisonment without parole and a State that says that 

if a person is convicted of capital murder, that 

sentence may be imposed and, in another -- in another 

provision, says that juveniles may be transferred for 

prosecution as adults. 

MR. STEVENSON:  I --

JUSTICE ALITO:  There's a difference between 

those two? 

MR. STEVENSON:  There is.  And that's 

because the -- the transfer question, which is what 

informs whether children can be subject to these 

sentences or not, is a very different question.  It's a 

question about whether the juvenile system that may 

mandate release at age 18 or age 21 is adequate for an 

offender.  It's not a judgment that that child should 

therefore be subject to life imprisonment without 

parole. 

And so, you have this disconnect.  You have

transfer judgments, which this Court recognized in 

Thompson and in Graham were not proxies for sentencing 

judgments.  And because of that, it is a very different 

calculation. 

The second point is that if there is no 

minimum age for trying children as adults or even 

prosecuting children as adults, I think we'd have to 

concede that there is an age at which a life without 

parole sentence would be constitutionally impermissible 

for any crime.  And to the extent that the State hasn't 

addressed that, which they clearly haven't -- you know, 

in this cohort of 79 children with life without parole 

for crimes at 14 and younger, more than half come from 

States where there's no minimum age for trying children 

as adults. 

That means in that State, a 10-year-old 

child would arguably have been contemplated by the 

legislature to be an appropriate person for life without 

parole, or an 8-year-old child and a 6-year-old child, 

and I think that asks too much of these statutes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, there is no 

question that you're dealing with a much smaller 

universe of children sentenced to life without parole 

who are 14 and under.  There's an argument that that's 

because so few of them commit the crimes.  But putting

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  There is a 

much, much larger group, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, 

for life without parole for juveniles at 15 and above. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I need an answer to it. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which is, assuming --

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the bifurcated theory 

that you proffered, tell me how we get around Harmelin. 

How would you write that decision? 

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  Well, I think that, 

first of all, what this Court has relied on when it has 

looked at these numbers, what it has been trying to 

figure out, are these objective indicia of society's 

standards, its mores, its decency meter, if you will. 

And we've looked at these numbers to inform us, are 

these sentences that are -- that are consistent with 

evolving standards of decency, or are they now beyond a 

maturing society?  And we've always found in these data 

some measures.

In the death penalty context, we've looked 

at that in the Roper area, in the Atkins area, and we've 

been able to make some judgments.  The reason why we 

could do it in these death penalty cases is that, unlike 

the cases here, the death penalty determination is 

discretionary.  The sentencer is required to consider 

and evaluate a range of mitigating circumstances and 

facts, including age, that help us assess whether the 

determination that death is the appropriate punishment 

means something in a society still trying to evolve. 

Here that's not true.  The majority of these 

sentences are mandatory.  So, the number tells us less 

about what the Constitution requires if it --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stevenson, do you have 

statistics about how many of these sentences are imposed 

on under 18-year-olds in non-mandatory States? 

MR. STEVENSON:  The -- the data on the 

larger population is not as precise, Justice Kagan, as 

it is with our younger population, but the majority of 

States are mandatory States, and the estimates are about 

that 85 percent of those sentences are mandatory 

sentences.  Certainly, the States that have the largest 

populations -- Michigan, Pennsylvania -- these 

States have mandatory regimes.

true, going up to age 18, that 80-plus percent are 

imposed in States that have mandatory systems? 

MR. STEVENSON:  That -- that's correct. 

And, in fact, the overwhelming majority of those 

sentences come from a handful of States where there is 

very little discretion to impose a sentence other than 

life imprisonment without parole. 

And because of that feature, I don't think, 

Justice Sotomayor, that the -- that the reliance on the 

number is quite as powerful here as it has been in the 

death penalty context, where that number represented a 

very communal judgment with a lot of factors. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There wasn't a majority 

in theory in Harmelin, and -- but at least three 

Justices spoke about a gross disproportionality. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is it your views that 

life -- a mandatory life without parole for someone like 

a juvenile is grossly disproportionate? 

MR. STEVENSON:  It is, for the very reasons 

that the Court articulates in both Roper and Graham. 

We're not arguing that life without parole is 

disproportionate to the crime of aggravated murder. 

We're arguing that the status of children, with all of 

the deficits that childhood status creates, makes that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If we can focus on the 

mandatory aspect of the case, I think -- I know you'd 

prefer a more general rule -- it may be that we have to 

have your general rule.  I'm not sure.  If I'm the trial 

judge, and I have to determine whether or not I'm going 

to give life without parole, and it's discretionary, 

what -- what do I look at?  Are -- can I get social 

scientists to come in and tell me what the chances of 

rehabilitation are?  Are there -- are there statistics? 

Now, we have some quite compelling stories 

of rehabilitation in this case.  I don't know if they're 

isolated; I don't know where they are in the statistical 

universe of how often rehabilitation is -- is 

demonstrated and is real.  What do I look at?  What's a 

judge supposed to do? 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I think one of the 

problems, Your Honor, with -- with trying to make these 

judgments is that -- that even psychologists say that we 

can't make good long-term judgments about the 

rehabilitation and transitory character of these young 

people.  That's the reason why in Graham this Court 

didn't permit that kind of discretion.  We know that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I thought that modern 

penology has abandoned that rehabilitation thing, and

they -- they no longer call prisons reformatories or 

whatever, and punishment is the -- is the criterion now. 

Deserved punishment for crime. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, if that's the 

criterion, is everything that you say irrelevant? 

MR. STEVENSON:  I --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's assume I don't 

believe in rehabilitation, as I think sentencing 

authorities nowadays do not.  Both at the Federal and 

the State levels, it's been made clear. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I -- I -- no.  I think 

it would still be relevant, Justice Scalia, but -- but I 

also don't think that correctional facilities have 

identified themselves as having no role to play in the 

rehabilitative process.  I mean, one of the problems 

with this sentence of life imprisonment without parole 

is that it actually bans and shields this population 

from a whole range of services that are specifically 

designed to rehabilitate:  education services, treatment 

services, anger management programs.  All of these 

programs exist within prisons, including the Federal 

prisons, because we do care how people perform when they 

are released.  And so, corrections is still very much 

the heart and soul of what we do.

But even if it wasn't, punishment 

nonetheless has to be proportionate, and recognize that 

it can be excessive.  And what this Court has said is 

that when you're looking at children, to equate the 

failings of a child and an adult would be cruel.  It 

would be unfair to -- given our knowledge and 

understanding of what developmental science has taught 

us and what we know about kids. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, again, it seems 

you're just forcing us into a -- a bipolar position. 

We're either going to say that you can't prevail at all 

or that everyone under 18 is -- cannot get life without 

parole.  I don't see this middle course --

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- which you seem to have 

abandoned, and you can't tell me how a judge would apply 

it if we -- if we chose not to abandon it. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I -- I don't intend to 

abandon it, Justice Kennedy.  I mean, obviously, I'm 

arguing for this categorical ban, but I think the Court 

could obviously do something else. 

We think that there is a basis for 

concluding, unquestionably, that a child under the age 

of 15 should not be exposed to life without parole based 

on this Court's precedents and on the data that's

presented.  The Court could set a categorical line there 

and, at the same time, make a determination that 

subjecting any child under the age of 18 to life without 

parole where there is no ability to consider age is 

fundamentally at odds with what this Court has now 

constitutionally recognized in both Roper and Graham. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Stevenson, may I ask 

you a case -- a question specifically about the Miller 

case?  There were two boys involved in this horrendous 

crime.  The older one took a plea and got life with 

parole.  Was the plea offered to Miller? 

MR. STEVENSON:  No plea was offered to 

Miller.  The -- what tends to happen, and there was some 

evidence of this that was developed earlier, is that the 

question was who was going to give a statement first, 

who was the most cooperative, whose lawyer is most 

effective at accomplishing that.  There were some 

complaints.  There's a postconviction pending now that 

makes some allegations about what the lawyer didn't do 

to facilitate a plea.  But, no, there was no offer of 

life with parole made to Evan Miller. 

And one of the difficulties, of course, in 

these cases is that, you know, the younger you are, the 

more vulnerable you are, the less experienced you are, 

the less capable you are of managing these dynamics

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Any idea how many 

juveniles subject to a sentence of life without parole 

do plead to a lesser sentence? 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, no, it's very hard to 

determine, mostly because States don't keep data --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

MR. STEVENSON:  -- on the issue. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there any reason,

think prosecutors would view that as a particularly 

attractive offer to someone who's young in the sense 

that they may regard the sentence as extraordinary 

themselves, that it may be particularly attractive to 

someone who's young in a way that it wouldn't be a 

40-year-old, a -- an offer of 25 years may not be as 

attractive as it is to a 15-year-old? 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, they might.  And I 

would concede, Your Honor, that this population is kind 

of less equipped to make determinations about whether to 

take a plea or whether to not take a plea than an adult.

MR. STEVENSON:  They may not be, Your Honor, 

but we haven't found sort of -- at least in this 

population, any evidence that they are capable of 

protecting children who, we believe at least, should be 

protected. 

And one of the interesting things, at least 

looking at this cohort of 79, a great number of them 

have older codefendants.  Both of the kids in the cases 

before the Court today have older codefendants who got 

sentences that were less than life without parole.  In 

the Kuntrell Jackson case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but those 

statistics aren't very helpful because we have no idea 

in the particular cases as to whether or not perhaps the 

older offender was less -- less guilty than the 16-, 

17-, 15-year-old. 

MR. STEVENSON:  That -- that's right. 

Although in some of these cases actually, when you read 

the opinions, you do see the evidence of the shooter not

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did that happen in

And my point would be that it -- this younger population 

is going to be disadvantaged in managing this aspect of 

the process that I think is quite important when the 

Court is trying to consider whether there should be a 

categorical ban or something less than a categorical 

ban. 

And, Justice Kennedy, I don't mean to 

suggest that the Court cannot, consistent with its 

precedents, make a categorical ban under 17.  But I also 

don't mean to suggest that if the Court can't do that, 

that there aren't ways of reconciling the precedents, 

with drawing a line at 15 and striking down mandatory 

life without parole.  I would urge, for the reasons that 

we've stated, that in these circumstances it's better to 

have a sentence where you can make a judgment about 

rehabilitation and public safety later in life. 

We're not arguing that the State has to give 

away the authority to incarcerate someone even for the 

rest of their life -- life without parole, which is 

available in this State, Alabama, would facilitate

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. NEIMAN, JR., 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. NEIMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Imposing life without parole sentences on 

aggravated murder offenders like Evan Miller is in line 

with the national consensus, is morally justified, and 

is consistent with legitimate penological goals. 

I'd like to touch on all three of those 

points at some juncture today if I can, but I'd like to 

start if I can with the conversation Mr. Stevenson was 

having with a few of the Justices about the national 

consensus issue in this case and more particularly what 

we can infer about the judgment of legislatures and 

ultimately the people, based on the statutes we have in 

this case and the very different set of circumstances 

we're looking at here than the circumstances the Court

was looking at in Graham. 

Official 

Exhibit A on that front is the fact that out 

of the 39 States or jurisdictions that allow this 

sentence, as Mr. Stevens has indicated -- or Mr. 

Stevenson has indicated, a good chunk of them, 27 in 

all, make the sentence the minimum sentence under the 

statute.  That's an important fact both because it tells 

us a little bit about the retributive goals that the 

legislatures were trying to achieve through these 

statutes, but it also --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Life without parole is the 

minimum? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Life without parole is the 

minimum sentence for anyone who commits an aggravated 

murder or at least certain kinds of aggravated murders 

in 27 of those jurisdictions. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's also -- that's also 

the maximum because there could be no death penalty. 

MR. NEIMAN:  For a juvenile, yes, Justice 

Kennedy, that's correct.  And effectively the message 

that the legislatures are sending is that with respect 

to aggravated murders, the worst of the worst kinds of 

murders, there are effectively two sentences.  There is 

either the death penalty or there is some sort of 

mitigating circumstance.  The person is at least going

that number around in my mind, that 1 percent of those 

who might have obtained this terrible penalty, 1 percent 

are actually given it? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, as Graham 

indicated, that denominator is crucial.  But the 7500 

number cannot be the appropriate denominator for 

determining whether actual sentencing practices indicate 

a national consensus against this practice.  The reason 

why is because that 7500 number is not the number of 

convictions; it's not the number of opportunities that 

judges have had to impose this sentence.  It is the 

number of arrests, and it's the number of arrests over 

the course of 40 years in every jurisdiction, including 

those that don't impose life without parole at all. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.  All right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel --

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's not even for homicide 

offenses that would qualify for life imprisonment 

without parole for an adult.  It's for any non-negligent 

homicide; isn't that right? 

MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Justice Alito. 

And the real denominator here, the one the Court ought 

to look at when it considers the role that actual 

sentencing practices play in the analysis, ought to be 

the number of aggravated murder convictions.

8  the justification -- giving all those statistics that 

9  you've seen and that was in Roper and so forth --

10

procedurally speaking, what is the justification for not 

11  giving the defendant any opportunity to point to 

12  mitigating features in his lack of development, in his 

13  age, in his upbringing, et cetera?  That to me is a 

14  difficult question, but before we get to that topic, I 

15

16

don’t want to --. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Actually, I do want to 

17  ask, and it dovetails with what Justice Breyer is 

18  asking, the Enmund/Tison line for adults, which is we 

19  can't execute someone who hasn't killed, intended to 

20

kill, or was reckless in killing.  This is a question 

21  more in the Jackson case, because I think it's an issue 

22  there.  But although all murder is heinous and 

23  regrettable, there are different kinds of murder. 

24  That's why some people are subject to the death penalty

and others are not.  And I do see a world of difference

between the Miller killing and the Jackson killing 

vis-à-vis the individual defendants' personal liability. 

So, assuming there are different kinds of --

of killings, of murder, should we be looking at the 

Enmund/Tison line at all?  Should we be talking about 

its application to juveniles in a different way?  Being 

Enmund/Tison basically, okay, felony murder if you know 

that there's a gun involved, but should that line be the 

same for juveniles? 

And, if so, then how do you go back to 

justifying, as Justice Breyer spoke about, the mandatory 

nature of life imprisonment without parole, given that 

not every juvenile is equal and not every murder is 

equal with respect to them? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Justice Sotomayor, the clearest 

line the Court could draw on this front would be the 

line that the Court initially set out in Graham as 

between homicide and non-homicide offenses.  Perhaps 

there would be some question about whether an 

Enmund-type felony murder counts as a homicide offense 

or not, but my suggestion is that it would, at least if 

the Court is looking for a clear line that wouldn't 

undermine too much of what the Court set out in Graham 

in terms of clearly distinguishing between homicide and 

non-homicide offenders.

Nonetheless, I certainly agree that there 

are fundamental differences between certain kinds of 

murders, and I think that judgment is reflected in the 

legislation we have in at least 27 of these States, 

where aggravated murder in the very -- in the very least 

carries with it a life without parole sentence for any 

defendant regardless of the mitigating circumstances or 

the like. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's not an 

individual legislative determination.  That's -- that's 

just a --

MR. NEIMAN:  It is a legislative 

determination that aggravated murder as a class of 

offenses is so contrary to society's values and so 

contrary to the dignity that we assume that every victim 

ought to be afforded, that life without parole is the 

appropriate sentence. 

So, I think there is a -- there is an 

inference to be made there about the legislative 

judgment, particularly because the sentence is a minimum 

one.  The three-Justice concurrence you mentioned, 

Justice Sotomayor, from Harmelin makes this point --

point quite vividly. 

In Solem v. Helm, the Court had struck down

1  and the Harmelin concurrence indicated that the Court 

2  was a little more comfortable doing that, because the 

3  sentence in that case was above the minimum and, thus, 

4  did not reflect the judgment of the legislature. 

5

But when we're talking about the minimum 

6  sentence, it's fair to infer that that's the sentence 

7  that the legislature thought as a class, in terms of a 

8  class of offenses, that would be the minimum appropriate 

9  sentence for that particular crime.  Now,

Justice Breyer --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, when you – 

12  it's a little confusing to me, but when you refer to 

13  "minimum," I assume that was because of the statutes prior 

14  to Graham had death as one of the other options, that that 

15

is no longer an option.  So, it's -- it's a little 

16  awkward to refer to it as minimum when it's also the 

17  maximum. 

18

 MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, 

19  Mr. Chief Justice. 

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you have --

21  when an individual is prosecuted for an aggravated 

22  murder that carries this sentence, is it typical to also 

23  charge lesser included offenses? 

24

 MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and --

general, what is the distinction between exposure to 

the -- the maximum crime and a lesser included crime? 

In other words, what is the difference between 

aggravated murder and manslaughter?  It typically turns 

on the state of mind, doesn't it? 

MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, is there any 

reason to think that juries in a case where they have 

the option for lesser included offenses might be 

concerned in light of the age of the defendant about 

whether or not the requisite intent was formed? 

It seems to me that some of the issues that 

we've suggested justify a different treatment of 

juveniles have to do with mental development, and those 

same issues would be taken into account by a jury in 

considering which of a list of offenses the juvenile 

should be convicted of. 

MR. NEIMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, it's 

certainly within the realm of reason and possibility 

for --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was it -- was it a factor 

in Miller's case?  Was there a lesser -- lesser offense 

that was charged? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there

were lesser included charges of at least felony murder, 

which has a very different intent type element to it. 

But Miller, at least with respect to the charge on the 

capital murder committed in the course of arson, which 

is an intentional murder, was found guilty by the jury 

on that charge. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He was -- the -- there 

was also a felony murder charge in the Miller case? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there 

were two felony murder charges, one as to the robbery in 

the case and one as to the arson in the case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so, it may not be 

realistic to speak of mandatory life without parole. 

It's only mandatory if the youth is convicted of the 

highest charge brought, but it remains within the power 

of the jury, in light of the youth, to convict him of a 

-- of a lesser offense which would not produce mandatory 

life imprisonment without parole. 

MR. NEIMAN:  I suppose that's so, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Neiman --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are juries instructed that 

life without parole is a necessary consequence of their 

decision?  I suppose a defense attorney could argue it. 

MR. NEIMAN:  Justice Kennedy, actually, I 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  think you are right to the extent you're suggesting that 

2  juries probably don't -- aren't actually instructed on 

3  that point.  And, in fact, it would probably be 

4  reversible error, I suppose --

5

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I would think so. 

 MR. NEIMAN:  -- for a jury to be instructed 

7  on that point.  Nonetheless, the judgment that 

8  legislatures have reached in terms of setting life 

9  without parole as the floor for any murderer 

10

is one that was -- that's reasonable and justified 

11  and --

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Neiman, I am wondering if we 

13  can go back to the issue that Justice Breyer left on the 

14  table, and this doesn't have much to do with how many 

15

States do what, but instead just to say that in the 

16  death penalty context, we've insisted on individualized 

17  sentencing.  And in Graham, of course, we equated 

18  juveniles who were sentenced to life without parole to 

19  people who -- to adults who were sentenced to death and 

20

21

said that those two should be treated equivalently. 

 And I'm wondering whether that doesn't 

22  suggest that the rules we have in the death penalty 

23  context about individualized sentencing ought to apply 

24  to juveniles who are sentenced to life without parole? 

25

MR. NEIMAN:  Justice Kagan -­

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Regardless of, like, how 

2  many States do what and how many times this happened, 

3  but just, you know, two facts:  We've insisted on this 

4  in the death penalty context, and we've equated the 

5

death penalty context to juveniles without life --

6  parole in Graham. 

7

 MR. NEIMAN:  Justice Kagan, the answer on 

8  that front, I think, is that Harmelin effectively sets a 

9  bright line here such that individualized sentencing is 

10

only required in a -- in a death penalty case.  And it 

11  does so --

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but of course Harmelin is 

13  pre-Graham, and in Graham we equated these two things, 

14  adults sentenced to death and juveniles sentenced to 

15

16

life without parole. 

 MR. NEIMAN:  Well, the reason why Harmelin 

17  drew that line and, I guess more to the point, the 

18  reason why Woodson v. North Carolina and Lockett v. Ohio 

19  held that individualized sentencing was required in the 

20

death penalty context was not because the sentence 

21  happened to be the highest sentence that someone could 

22  receive, but because the sentence was death.  And there 

23  were certain --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  In Graham, didn't the Court 

reject the idea of individualized sentencing in which

youth would be taken into account on a case-by-case 

basis? 

MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Justice Alito. 

The States were here jumping up and down asking for that 

precise result, and we did not get it.  And the reason 

why, the result the Court thought was appropriate was 

rather than allowing the defendant to argue for 

mitigating circumstances and for the State to respond 

with aggravating circumstances in one of these cases, 

the answer was for the juvenile to get a mitigation 

trump card. 

And in one of these sentencing proceedings, 

the juvenile would be able to say:  I'm a juvenile, and 

that means that I don't get the highest sentence I 

otherwise would get.  I win the sentencing phase as --

as a matter of law. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the fact that we've said 

that individualized sentencing was not enough in one 

context does not suggest that individualized sentencing 

ought not to be the rule in a different context where 

there is no categorical bar. 

MR. NEIMAN:  Justice Kagan, the response on 

that front, I think, is that the rule from Woodson and 

Lockett requiring individualized sentencing was one 

that's specifically tailored to the unique aspects of

the death penalty, aspects that remain unique, 

notwithstanding Graham and the rule it imposed with 

respect to juveniles. 

But also Woodson and Lockett -- although I 

realize that the premise of your question is that we 

should not look at what other States are doing, the 

premise of Woodson and Lockett was that States had 

widely rejected mandatory death penalty sentencing, and 

we know from the legislative record here that States 

have done quite the contrary when it comes to mandatory 

life without parole sentencing --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, is that -- I have -- I 

understand their arguments, both sides.  I think I've 

pretty much got the arguments on the question of the 

individualized sentencing.  You can make an argument 

that it should be individualized, life without parole, 

up to age 18; say 7 through 17.  And there's an argument 

the other way which you're making.  Okay. 

What I want to know is your argument the 

opposite way on this one.  What's the minimum age, in 

your opinion, or is there any constitutional minimum at 

all in respect to which you could give for a murder a 

child life without parole?  I mean, you could have an 

instance of a 10-year-old or an 8-year-old.  I mean, is 

it totally up to the States, or is there a minimum?  And

commit to a minimum without --

development. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do your best.

I'm going to say:  And why not 14?

(Laughter.) 

MR. NEIMAN:  I will say -- I would argue if 

I were the State up here trying to defend a 

12-year-old's sentence, I would argue that that was the 

line.  So, a 12 -- well, no -- well, yes.  Someone who's

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- about this case, because 

I thought you were appealing to what the American people 

think about the line or maybe to the common law.  Now, 

the common law had a rule of -- of the age of reason. 

I 

think below 12, you couldn't -- at least you couldn't 

impose the death penalty.  Maybe you couldn't even 

convict for a felony.  But you just pluck some number 

out of the air. 

MR. NEIMAN:  No -- no --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why can't I pluck a number 

out of the air if you pluck one out of the air? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Justice Scalia, I was about to 

give Justice Breyer the arguments that I would make if I 

were the State in those circumstances about why that's 

the line.  Reason number one is national consensus. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If we look to objective 

indicia, as all of the cases in this line have, what is 

the lowest age as to which you can say there is any 

indication of a societal consensus that this is okay? 

Wouldn't it be 14? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Well -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  How many States allow it for 

2  a 13-year-old or a 12-year-old? 

3

 MR. NEIMAN:  The number of States that allow 

4  it for a 12-year-old are somewhere around -- well, I 

5

suppose that number is close to 10 or so. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is --

 MR. NEIMAN:  So, that's one reason why I 

8  would draw the line around 12 or so.  If you look at, 

9  for example, the table --

10

JUSTICE ALITO:  So that 10 States will allow 

11  it for a 12-year-old.  How many would allow it for a 

12  13-year-old?  Do you happen to know? 

13

 MR. NEIMAN:  At that point, we're getting up 

14  to much more substantial numbers.  I guess when we get 

15

16

up to 14, we're up to somewhere in the realm of 30 or more. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it taken into account 

17  when the -- the child is in the juvenile system 

18  initially, has to be moved to the adult system.  Is the 

19  judgment -- is there any cutoff on the transfer?  Or can 

20

21

a child be transferred to the adult system at any age? 

 MR. NEIMAN:  Well, that I think is the 

22  appropriate line in terms of thinking about what the 

23  minimum is here.  The answer depends on the 

24  jurisdiction.  In Alabama, 14 is the minimum.  But that 

25

number is, compared to a lot of other jurisdictions, a

little high.  There --

Official 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, if you're -- if 

you're under 14, you can't be transferred out of the 

juvenile system? 

MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct.  In Alabama, if 

you're under 14, you can't be transferred out.  Now, 

many other States, at age 13, you can be transferred 

in -- or you can be transferred into the adult system, 

which is why there are few 13-year-olds serving this 

sentence.  But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, if he were only 13, 

he would get out when?  When he was 21? 

MR. NEIMAN:  In Alabama, the juvenile 

justice system's jurisdiction terminates at 21, yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's why he's arguing 

that the legislatures don't focus on it.  If you do a 

public opinion poll, or just ask me, for example, or ask 

anyone, you say the question is:  Should -- at what age 

should juveniles be able to be transferred out of the 

juvenile system into the adult system? 

You might get one answer.  Maybe 14, maybe 

15, maybe 12. 

But if you put the question, at what age 

should they be receiving a mandatory life without 

parole, the answer might be different.  And his point is

they never ask that question.  They ask the first 

question, not the second.  And that disturbs me enough 

to think that I can't think the answer to this question 

that I asked you just relies on public opinion polls or 

even just the number of States.  I'm not sure about it. 

But that's why I want to hear your response, 

because it sounds like we're arguing between whether it 

should be 13, 12, or 14, in terms of an absolute cutoff. 

So, how do I approach that?  I'm asking you for help on 

that one.  I know you have a side in this.  But I say, 

well, we're talking about 14, and we have all this 

scientific literature and so forth. 

MR. NEIMAN:  Justice Breyer, the reason why 

it's fair to infer that legislatures would have 

concluded that a 14-year-old, for example, in Alabama 

would be subject to a mandatory life without parole 

sentence is precisely because it's mandatory.  Surely, 

the legislatures understood that when they were 

transferring persons who committed crimes like 

aggravated murder that were well within the heartland of 

the crimes for which the transfer statutes were 

intended, those offenders would be subject to the 

minimum sentences at least. 

It's quite another thing to say, well, the 

legislature might have enacted a statute providing for

transfer for a 14-year-old; and for a non-homicide 

crime, they might have assumed that the person would get 

less than the maximum in terms of life without parole. 

But, surely, the legislators understood that those 

offenders would at least get the minimum. 

And the reason why the line is more safely 

drawn at 13 or 12, it's because if you look at, for 

example, the tables from the Department of Justice 

reports that both sides and the amici have cited listing 

the transfer ages, by and large, the number seems to cut 

off at 12 or so.  And 12 would be on the very bottom end 

of the range; and if I were a defense attorney, I'd be 

arguing much harder for a line at 13 than 12.  I imagine 

if I were a defense attorney, I'd be arguing for an even 

higher line than that. 

But the point is that if we're going to 

judge this in terms of objective indicia of what society 

has decided, that seems to be the line that society has 

drawn.  That line is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In the -- in the 

Petitioner's briefs, the idea of deterrence kind of 

drops by the way side.  Have there been any studies that 

show that there is a deterrence value?  I remember in 

Roper, there was actually discussion among the young 

people before they committed the crime as to whether or

not they could get the penalty.  It was actually right 

there in the record.  Does the State rely on the 

deterrence component of the punishment here? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Justice Kennedy, we think that 

deterrence is in the mix, but it's certainly not the 

primary goal that these statutes serve when --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it retribution? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Retribution, Justice Kennedy, 

would be the primary goal, bringing society's 

retributive force to bear on those who commit the worst 

sort of crimes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Retribution, of course, is 

related to personal culpability.  We said that in Tison, 

and that loops back into the minor problem. 

MR. NEIMAN:  That's exactly right, 

Justice Kennedy, but I think one point on which Mr. 

Miller and the State fundamentally disagree here is what 

we can conclude about a juvenile's culpability when the 

juvenile has committed aggravated murder.  The reason 

why Graham came out as it did, the reason why life 

without parole was not permissible, was because Graham 

himself had not committed murder.  The Court there said 

that meant that Graham's culpability was twice 

diminished, once because he was a juvenile and once 

because he had not committed murder.

Well, here we have the hypothetical from 

Graham where the one level of diminishment is gone.  And 

Miller has -- Miller is entitled to a one-level 

diminishment because of his juvenile status, but he's 

not entitled to that second level of diminishment, which 

he is what he's seeking here. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you aware of any 

statistics that give us some quantitative sense as to 

how many juveniles after years and years of prison show 

significant rehabilitation?  Do we know anything about 

that? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Justice Kennedy, I know of no 

statistics on that particular front.  I imagine that 

some vignettes could be told about success stories and 

some vignettes could be told about stories that were not 

success stories and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have any reason to 

think that juveniles are any better than anyone else as 

far as learning from prison is concerned?  I mean, 

recidivism is a big problem, isn't it?  People who've 

been to prison go out and commit the same crimes again, 

don't they?

think that juveniles are any different? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Justice Scalia, I haven't seen 

any studies that would suggest that juveniles do better, 

particularly when they're subjected to the sorts of 

crimes that I think everyone would have -- or the sorts 

of offenses, let me say, that I think everyone would 

agree the Constitution would have to permit a sentence 

of, say, 40 years minimum or the like. 

So, I just don't think -- I think society --

society's primary goal here or the government's primary 

goal here is expressing the retributive judgment about 

the wrongfulness of murder and why it's different from, 

not homicide, but I think governments are quite 

legitimate and quite reasonable when they also say that 

they don't want to roll the dice on convicted murderers. 

Society acts with particular revulsion when a convicted 

murderer commits a crime again. 

And even if -- and even if that difference 

in terms of recidivism is no different, or even if the 

possibility for recidivism is no different, the fact 

that the person committed a murder once and might commit 

a murder again is reason enough for legislatures to be 

hesitant to allow for parole in these circumstances. 

With respect to the penological purposes, 

there's also an important purpose here with respect to

the unique factors and the unique circumstances that 

murder victims and their families face. 

I think a lot of people hear about 

life-without-parole sentences, and if they oppose them 

on political grounds or policy-based grounds, one of 

their sort of pragmatic responses is, well, what's the 

cost to all this?  Why not just let these guys get their 

parole hearings, give them that hope, and likely they 

won't get parole anyway? 

And there's really no cost to society at 

least in allowing that process to occur, but the cost is 

to the victims and their families who have to endure 

what are often very painful hearings and parole 

hearings.  And when those come up on a frequent basis, 

that sort of re-traumatization process is something that 

governments can legitimately take into account when they 

decide that for aggravated murder -- and not for other 

crimes but for aggravated murder -- a 

life-without-parole sentence is an appropriate sentence. 

On the moral culpability point, there would 

be some anomalies created by the rule that Miller is 

seeking here.  Miller's asking the Court to effectively 

hold him in the same place in terms of his moral 

culpability as the defendant in Graham.  In other words, 

Graham can only get life with -- life with parole

because of his reduced moral culpability.  And Miller is 

saying he should only get life without parole because of 

his reduced culpability. 

So, that would mean one of two things: 

Either the Eighth Amendment would put a murderer on the 

same moral level as someone who committed a non-homicide 

crime as in Graham, or Graham himself would be back in 

this Court or a court of another jurisdiction arguing 

that because Graham held that Graham himself had 

categorically less culpability than someone like Miller, 

then Graham himself is entitled to a lesser punishment 

than the one that Miller, in fact, received. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  When you look -- Mr. Neiman, 

if you look at those two cases and you look at the 

individuals, the child's actions in the two cases, they 

really are remarkably similar.  They're sort of a piece. 

Don't you agree?  I mean, how -- how is it that the 

child's actions in this case were any different from 

that in Graham? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Justice Kagan, I think that 

Miller's actions were dramatically different from 

Graham's actions, in part because Miller intended to 

kill this victim and killed the victim in a rather 

gruesome way.  So, there's not an element of luck here 

in terms of the fact that, oh, well, Graham was simply

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's in -- in the 

Jackson case.  In the Jackson case, the crime was very 

similar to --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  Justice Ginsburg 

is, of course, right. 

MR. NEIMAN:  Well, I defer to my colleague 

from Arkansas in terms of the distinctions between 

Jackson and Graham, but certainly with respect to 

Miller's crime, his moral culpability is greater, and 

the law should recognize that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the judge were to 

determine under a rule that the sentence can't be 

mandatory whether or not life should be imposed, what 

would be the sorts of factors that he would look at, or 

do you think those are just too ineffable, too imprecise 

to be considered? 

MR. NEIMAN:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I think 

it certainly would be possible to have a regime under 

which a judge considered mitigating circumstances in a 

case like this.  Many jurisdictions have reasonably 

opted for that route rather than the one that Alabama 

and 26 other jurisdictions have, and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They're the standard sorts 

of mitigating circumstances that we see in capital

cases, you think? 

Official 

MR. NEIMAN:  Absolutely.  I think that's 

exactly what would happen.  You would have arguments 

about certain murders being worse than others.  And Mr. 

Miller would have an opportunity to argue about other 

mitigating circumstances relating to his background and 

the like, as he's argued in his reply brief here. 

But at the same time, it's reasonable for 

legislatures to conclude that they're going to draw a 

line in the sand with respect to aggravated murder, such 

that -- as a floor in terms of the appropriate 

punishment, the defendant is going to get at the very 

least life without parole, a punishment that's no doubt 

severe but one that is less severe than the impact that 

the crime has had on society. 

And for those reasons, we'd ask the Court to 

affirm. 

Mr. Neiman.

Mr. Stevenson, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. STEVENSON:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice.

seek would not require States to impose the same 

sentence on juveniles convicted of homicides from 

juveniles convicted of non-homicides.  The States would 

be free to do that if they chose to, but they could 

certainly create a regime where it's life with parole 

where there are different ages for eligibility.  In 

fact, the State of Nevada makes you eligible for parole 

after 15 years if the crime is a non-homicide, 20 years 

if it's a homicide. 

The States would still have a great deal of 

flexibility to create, consistent with this Court's 

rule, a regime that makes these distinctions. 

Justice Kennedy, I did want to point --

direct your attention to two amicus briefs that I think 

respond to two of the questions you've raised.  There is 

an amicus brief submitted by criminologists in this 

case, and it looks specifically at the question of 

deterrence.  And what they've found is life without 

parole has not had any measurable deterrent effect.  The 

States that don't put juveniles -- don't subject 

children to life without parole have actually 

experienced the same level of decrease in violent crime 

and homicide as the States that do.  And, in fact, in 

some of those jurisdictions, the decrease is even more 

significant.

I also want to address your question, 

Justice Scalia.  There is -- there are some studies that 

have established that juveniles are more likely or less 

likely to recidivate after an intervention than adults. 

Generally speaking, homicide offenders are categorically 

less likely to recidivate than many non-homicide 

offenders.  Drug offenders and property crime offenders 

are much more likely to recidivate than -- than homicide 

offenders. 

And so, there's a lot to support that a 

judgment rooted in these penological concerns would be 

well-supported here. 

I also want to return, Justice Breyer, to 

your question.  Mr. Neiman has -- argued that we can 

read into these statutes a commitment to imposing life 

without parole at a particular age, and that age is the 

age of transfer.  I just want to highlight that the two 

States with the largest populations of juveniles serving 

life without parole by a huge margin are Pennsylvania 

and Michigan, neither of which has a minimum age. 

That means in those States, a child of any 

age can be subject to a mandatory sentence of life 

without parole.  It's simply not true -- true that we 

can read into those statutes in those jurisdictions any 

kind of conscious commitment to thinking about age.

The other point I want to make --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think the legislators 

in Pennsylvania and Michigan don't understand what their 

laws provide? 

MR. STEVENSON:  I -- I think that they 

haven't thought about it.  Yes, I do think that.  I 

mean, for example -- this goes to the next point I was 

about to make -- my colleague keeps talking about 

aggravated murder.  In the State of Pennsylvania, it's 

not just aggravated murder that subjects you to a 

mandatory life without parole; if you're convicted of 

second-degree murder -- no intent -- diminished -- it's 

still mandatory life without parole. 

We have 14-year-old children -- and, again, 

that's the largest cohort in our group -- in the State 

of Pennsylvania convicted of clearly unintentional 

killings that have been subject to mandatory life 

without parole. 

South Dakota does the same thing.  I think, 

where there is no minimum age and where you have that 

kind of regime, I cannot -- I don't think we can 

conclude that they've thought about, yes, it's 

appropriate. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if they -- what 

if they do?  I mean, what if, after our decision or even

after the argument, States go back and say, look, the 

decision is based on the fact that they don't think we 

know our law, that we haven't thought about it; so, 

let's have a hearing about it, and then we vote that, 

yes, there should be or, no, there should not be a 

minimum age; we think at 16 -- whatever age they do. 

Then does the constitutional rule change? 

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Once we get 30 

States saying, look, we've thought about it and this is 

our answer, then whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits 

it or not changes? 

MR. STEVENSON:  No, I -- I don't think it 

changes, because there is an age at which this Court is 

obligated under the Eighth Amendment to say a sentence 

of this sort, a permanent judgment that life-long 

incarceration is -- is required --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But one of 

the things we take into account is societal consensus, 

and you say we should ignore the 30 -- whatever it is --

States that allow this because they didn't really think 

about it. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well --

MR. STEVENSON:  Sure. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- let's make --

let's see if they have thought about it. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Yes. 

Well, in -- in that regard, Justice – 

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that we do have 13 

States that have thought about it, that have expressly 

looked at this question of what the minimum age should 

be.  And in 12 of those 13 States that have set the age 

above 14, most of those States have set the age at 18. 

So, if that's the Court's lens, then I think that would 

support the kind of rule that we're seeking here --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if, instead of 

striking down the laws in these States, why don't we 

just require the State legislatures to think about it? 

All right?  And -- and then see how many think about it, 

and -- and come up with, you know, something that agrees 

with you or doesn't agree with you. 

MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I think that's in 

part --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wouldn't that be more 

democratic somehow? 

MR. STEVENSON:  It might be more democratic, 

but I don't think it would be consistent with the 

constitutional obligation that this Court has to protect
