CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We  will  hear 

  

 

 

 

 

argument  this  morning  in  Case  No.  14­614,  Hughes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chairman  of  the  Maryland  Public  Service  Commission,  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Talen  Energy  Marketing  and  the  consolidated  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Strauss. 

 

            

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  SCOTT  H.  STRAUSS 

 

 

 

 

 

         

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  NO.  14­614  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Maryland  determined  that  new  generation  was 

 

 

 

 

 

needed  for  local  reliability,  so  it  directed  its  retail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utilities  to  sign  20­year  contracts  with  a  competitively 

   

 

 

 

 

 

selected  project  developer. 

 

 

            

Maryland's  action  did  not  intrude  on  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority,  primarily  for  two  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  first  reason  is  that  Maryland's  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resource  did  not  distort  the  wholesale  capacity  auction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  revised  its  auction  bidding  rules  to  require  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  resource  to  bid  on  the  basis  of  its  cost, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backing  out  any  State  contract  revenue.  The  developer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bid  in  accordance  with  the  rules  and  cleared  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction. 

            

FERC  says  that  means  that  the  resource  is

economic,  needed,  competitive,  and  does  not  suppress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prices,  any  State  revenue  notwithstanding. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

The  second  reason  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  if  it  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

suppress  prices,  why  did  Maryland  do  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  Maryland  did  it,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  saw  a  need  for  generation  going  forward. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

As  is  clear  in  the  generation  order,  Maryland  perceived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  problem.  It  had  large  coal  units  that  it  believed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  going  to  retire  in  the  coming  years,  and  it  needed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  resources  in  place  to  be  able  to  meet  that  need. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  it  undertook  to  have  those  resources  built  pursuant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  contract  mechanism  before  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  if  that  hadn't 

  

 

 

 

 

happened,  prices  would  have  been  higher.  So  it  was  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppress  prices. 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  No,  it  was  not  to  suppress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prices,  and,  frankly,  Your  Honor,  could  not  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppressed  prices. 

 

            

FERC  revised  the  rules  in  2011  to  be  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  resource  had  to  bid  on  the  basis  of  its  costs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  regard  to  the  State  revenue.  So  there  was  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  for  it  to  suppress  prices.  If  the  costs  had  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too  high  for  the  resource,  it  would  never  have  cleared. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  wouldn't  have  been  in  the  market  at  all.  It  was  only

in  the  market  because  it  was  able  to  clear  on  the  basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  its  cost,  which  showed  it  was  efficient. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  FERC  made  that  finding.  FERC  found  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed,  competitive,  and  not  suppressive  of  prices 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding  the  subsidy. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  why  was  this  done 

  

 

 

 

 

 

through  stepping  on  FERC's  turf  at  all?  I  mean,  could 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  have  been  done  by  requiring  long­term  contracts  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  new  generator? 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  It  was  done  through  long­term 

  

 

 

 

 

 

contracts,  Your  Honor,  but  the  question  of  getting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  with  FERC's  turf  is  as  follows: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

FERC  has  ­­ has  set  up  the  capacity  auction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  PJM,  and  when  under  that  auction,  PJM  procures  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  in  advance  for  a  one­year  period  all  the  capacity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  region  needs,  and  then  it  allocates  the  cost  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity  among  all  the  utilities.  But  it  tells  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utilities  that  you  have  a  way  to  hedge  against  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costs.  If  you  have  long­term  resources,  resources  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  bought  or  procured  through  contract,  you  can  bid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  in,  and  if  they  clear,  they  will  offset  the  cost. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Maryland's  concern  was  this:  It  wanted  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

needed  the  resource,  but  it  was  concerned  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resource  clear  so  that  it  hedge  against  the  cost  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customers  not  pay  twice  for  the  same  resource.

So  in  order  to  do  that,  it  entered  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  for  differences.  And  the  way  it  did  that  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  did  a  competitive  procurement  and  found  a  developer 

   

   

 

 

 

 

who  was  willing  to  undertake  the  risk  of  nonclearance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  was  the  issue.  The  contract  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

differences  assigns  and  allocates  that  risk  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developer,  not  the  State,  and  that  enabled  the  resource 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  go  forward  in  a  way  that  would  not  result  in  any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility  of  a  double  charge. 

   

 

 

            

The  contract  developer  ­­ the  developer 

 

 

 

 

 

receives  the  contract  price.  The  utilities  paid  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  price  and  no  more  than  that,  received  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market  price.  That  is  exactly  the  way  this  would  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worked  if  we  had  simply  done  it  as  a  bilateral,  with  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

key  difference.  The  difference  is  that  the  risk  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonclearance  is  with  the  developer,  not  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  there's  another  key 

  

 

 

 

 

difference.  If  you  had  done  it  directly  with  ­­ if  CPV 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  contracted  directly  with  the  distribution  utilities, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  have  been  subject  to  regulation  by  FERC, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  it  not? 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  Yes.  This  contract  was  as 

  

  

 

 

 

 

well. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Only  after  you  lost  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth  Circuit  did  you  concede  that,  isn't  that  correct,

on  the  very  day  of  the  Fourth  Circuit's  decision? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  No,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  No. 

  

 

MR.  STRAUSS:  In  the  district  ­­ let  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  why.  In  the  district  court,  during  the  district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  litigation,  CPV  obtained  market­based  rate 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  from  the  FERC  and  filed  a  motion  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  telling  the  court  that  the  case  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed  because  the  contract  was  being  entered  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to  that  authority.  And  that  made  it  a  FERC 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  that  could  be  reviewed  at  FERC.  So  any  party 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  filed  the  complaint. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  your  initial  position 

  

 

 

 

 

was  that  it  did  not  have  to  be  reviewed  by  FERC;  wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ isn't  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  That's  ­­ that's  correct.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

position  below  was  that  it  was  either  of  two  things, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  Either  it  was  a  non­jurisdictional 

   

  

 

 

 

financing  arrangement  or  it  was  a  FERC­jurisdictional 

   

 

 

 

 

contract.  But  either  way  it  was  not  preempted,  and  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  question.  It  was  either  subject  to  FERC's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  or  outside  it.  But  the  question  of  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  preempted  would  not  have  been  ­­ the  answer  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  the  same  regardless.  The  district  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  that  it  would  deal  with  that  motion  in  its

order,  and  decided  in  its  opinion  that  while  it  probably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  FERC­jurisdictional  contract,  the  judge  went  ahead 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  found  what  Maryland  had  done  unconstitutional. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I'm  not  sure  why  it  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  say  it  was  subject  to  FERC's  jurisdiction,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  end  the  case  right  there  against  you,  because  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  subject  to  FERC's  jurisdiction,  that  means  it's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  sale.  And  that's  for  FERC  to  do  is  to  set  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rates  and  other  terms  of  wholesale  sales,  and  that's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  States  to  do.  So  that  means  you're  preempted. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  No,  that's  ­­ no,  no.  No,  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not.  You're  exactly  right,  Your  Honor.  Wholesale 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

sale  is  for  FERC  to  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  way  the  statute  works,  sellers  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  are  permitted  to  set  rates  as  an  initial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  by  contract  or  tariff.  FERC  superintends  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

process,  as  this  Court  decided  in  the  NRG  case  a  number 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  years  ago.  In  this  case,  the  developer,  the  seller 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  the  rate  through  a  contract  entered  into  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  utility.  That  contract  would  be  subjected  to  FERC 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review.  That's  just  another  day  on  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Are  you  saying  that  Maryland 

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  set  the  rates  just  because  they  use  an  auction? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is  that  what  you're  saying? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  Maryland  did  not  set  the  rate

because  Maryland  did  not  select  the  price.  The  price 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  selected  by  the  seller. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That's  true  of  FERC  itself. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  doesn't  set  rates  anymore,  either.  It  allows  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction  to  set  rates,  but  we  would  never  say  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  mean  that  they  are  FERC  rates,  that  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC­approved  rates.  And  so  here,  the  fact  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  decided  not  to  set  rates  directly  but  to  allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  auction  to  do  it,  I  mean,  that's  just  a  mechanism 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Maryland  chose.  They  are  still  Maryland's  rates. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  The  ­­ the  auction  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction  that  FERC  designed,  the  wholesale  auction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permits,  if  not  incentivizes,  exactly  what  was  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  FERC  has  made  that  very  clear.  The  purpose  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  auction  is  to  ­­ in  part,  to  provide  information  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  market  about  what  kinds  of  long­term  contracting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ are  needed,  what  is  needed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  you  used  the  auction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

dynamic,  the  auction  mechanism  to  go  outside  of  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  that  dynamic. 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  What  we  did  was  perfect  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  Your  Honor,  but  that's  perfectly  permissible. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Remember,  the  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That  ­­ that's  ­­ I  ­­

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  ­­ I'm  sure  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  one  of  the  issues  in  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  The  auction 

  

  

 

 

 

 

dynamic  allows  for  parties,  and  indeed  encourages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties,  to  enter  into  long­term  contracts  for  capacity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resources  and  bid  them  into  the  auction.  But  they  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  the  auction.  They  don't  become  auction  resources 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless  they  are  able  to  do  so.  And  in  this  case,  FERC 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  in  front  of  it  exactly  what  Maryland  and  a  related 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program  in  New  Jersey  were  about  at  the  time  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revised  the  rules. 

 

 

            

What  FERC  sought  to  do  was  to  reconcile  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  of  the  State  programs  and  how  they  would  interact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  auction,  and  FERC  did  that.  It  set  a  different 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bidding  process,  and  Maryland  followed  that  bidding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process.  The  CPV  resource  bid  in  accordance  with  it  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cleared  on  that  basis. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  the  ­­ as  originally  set 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

up,  CPV  had  no  incentive  to  ­­ to  bid  anything  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  zero;  isn't  that  right?  All  it  was  interested  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  clearing  the  market. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  That  is  ­­ that  is  correct. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  that  affects  the  dynamic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  ­­ of  the  PJM  auction,  does  it  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  Yes.  Yes,  Justice  Alito,  it

does.  And  that's  why  in  2011,  FERC,  when  it  became 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aware  that  this  had  happened,  changed  the  rules. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Remember,  originally,  when  FERC  approved  the  auction  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2006,  it  said  that  State  resources  that  were  being  built 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  reliability,  which  is  exactly  what  this  resource  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  bid  in  at  zero,  a  zero  price,  and  clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automatically  in  order  to  ensure  that  States  could  meet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  responsibilities  to  ensure  of  a  liability. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

In  2011,  when  FERC  became  aware  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  and  New  Jersey  programs,  it  revised  the  rules. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  it  didn't  prohibit  those  resources;  it  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclude  them.  It  changed  the  rules  so  that  they  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue  to  bid,  but  they  had  to  bid  on  a  cost  basis. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  ­­ but  I  have  to  say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  also  looked  at  a  long­term  contract  ­­ FERC 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did,  and  PJM  ­­ in  the  PJM  Interconnection  order,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined  that  a  seven­year  lock­in  period  for  a  new 

   

   

 

 

 

 

generator  was  unfair,  unjust  and  unreasonable.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

something  it  can  do. 

 

 

 

            

Why  didn't  that  end  what  you're  doing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're  arguing  that  you're  not  affecting  price.  FERC 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagrees,  because  you  have  no  incentive  to  bid  anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  than  zero.  I  don't  understand  why  this  case  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  ended  by  FERC's  determination  that  locked­in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts  are  unjust  and  unreasonable.

MR.  STRAUSS:  FERC  determined  that  under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

auction  it  would  not  allow  a  guarantee  of  more  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  years.  But  FERC  did  not  at  that  time  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long­term  contracts  outside  the  auction  were  prohibited. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Long­term  contracts  are  a  staple  of  this  industry,  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  knows,  and  FERC  was  not  trying  to  prohibit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  What  FERC  was  doing  there  was,  the  three­year 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lock­in,  which  I  think  is  what  you're  alluding  to, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  is  it  different  than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your  contract? 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  It's  different  in  that  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  20­year  agreement. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  know  the  years  are 

   

 

 

 

 

different,  but  I'm  talking  about  the  mechanics. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  The  mechanics  of  it  are  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  operates  outside  the  auction,  but  bids  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction.  The  ­­ the  new  entry  price  adjustment  to  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  refer  functions  within  the  auction  and  for  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  purpose.  It's  designed  to  address  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

situation  in  which  you  have  a  relatively  small 

   

 

 

 

 

 

geographic  zone  and  a  relatively  large  plant  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

built.  The  concern  is  that  when  you  build  that  resource 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  put  it  in  the  market,  it  creates  a  glut,  and  prices 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  crater.  And  the  concern  was  because  of  that,  no

one  will  ever  build  such  a  resource.  So  the  auction 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows  you  to  lock  those  prices  in  for  three  years,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  simply  in  that  particular  circumstance. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  FERC  said  when  asked  to  make  it  longer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  that's  not  the  purpose  of  the  auction.  The  auction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  intended  to  ensure  revenue  certainty.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended  to  provide  information,  information  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market  can  use  in  making  contracting  decisions.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  exactly  what  happened  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Maryland  looked  at  the  ­­ at  the  auction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results,  came  up  with  a  program  to  have  a  resource  built 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  the  auction,  which  would  then  bid  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction,  but  it  had  to  do  it  in  accordance  with  FERC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules.  FERC  is  the  gatekeeper  of  the  auction.  Maryland 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  insert  itself  into  the  auction  in  a  way  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  didn't  allow,  even  if  it  wanted  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Strauss  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  didn't  ­­ I  ­­ I 

    

   

 

 

 

didn't  ­­ I  have  to  admit  for  myself,  in  this  kind  of

a  hard  time  thinking  in  terms  of  simply  abstract  words. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  as  far  as  I  understand  it,  my  law  clerk  says  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  cost­based  system  of  FERC  is  that  the  minimum­offer

MR.  STRAUSS:  I  believe  that  is,  Your  Honor. 

    

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  If  that's  correct,  then  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  have  a  generator  up  somewhere  in  the  hills  of  ­­ of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surrounding  their  hills  in  Maryland,  and  it's  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expensive  to  get  coal  up  into  those  hills  or  oil  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

natural  gas,  and  so  I  have  a  generator  that  I  can  ­­

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that's  500  megawatts,  and  it  allows  me,  based  on  cost, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  charge,  if  I  were  to  charge  the  full  cost,  and  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depends  on  the  banks  and  loans  and  so  forth,  it  allows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  to  charge  $220  a  megawatt­day.  Okay? 

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Does  that?  I  can  go  to 

    

  

 

 

 

 

FERC,  and  I  can  say  70  percent  of  that  is  what  I  am 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  put  into  the  pool,  'cause  I  know  that  Maryland 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  give  me  the  rest.  And  this  is  not  one  of  those  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds.  And  70  percent  of  220  is  around  ­­ I  don't  know, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  math  isn't  too  good  ­­ 180. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  they  get  awarded  the  contract  'cause  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

180,  but  there's  some  other  firms  that  are  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expensive  over  here,  and  those  other  firms  don't  get

Now,  is  that  right?  That's  either  right  or

JUSTICE  BREYER:  If  it's  right,  it  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  end  of  the  matter.  If  it's  wrong,  then  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  to  me  why. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  Here's  what's  going  on,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  If  the  cost  of  the  generator  is  below  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

default  price,  that  90  or  70  percent  price  that  you

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  I'm  assuming  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cost  is  higher  than  the  70  percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  That  ­­ that  might  ­­ that

this  case,  the  ­­ the  resource  bid  on  the  basis  of  its

price.  So  there  was  no  issue  of  a  ­­ of  what  you've 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described  as  a  resource  with  a  cost  above  the  default 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

price  that  gets  to  bid  the  default. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  you're  asking  only  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  where  it's  below.  You're  not  interested  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  where  it's  above.  And  this  whole  case  has  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argued  only  in  the  case  where  it's  below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  Well,  that  is  actually  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happens,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  not  saying  what 

  

 

 

 

 

happens.  I'm  saying  we  have  to  decide  a  legal  issue. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is  my  legal  issue  to  include  my  example  or  is  it  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  I  think  it  does  not  include 

    

 

 

 

 

 

your  example,  Your  Honor.  That  is  a  different  kind  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distortion.  The  Solicitor  General  mentions  it  in  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  And  if  FERC  ­­ FERC,  in  2011,  when  they  revised 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  minimum­offer  rule,  did  not  find  reason  to  adjust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  offer  level  higher,  which  might  have  limited  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  problem.  If  FERC  now  believes  that  that  distortion 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists  ­­

 

            

your  time. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  don't  want  to  use  up  all 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  STRAUSS:  I'd  like  to  reserve  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

balance  for  rebuttal.  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

Mr.  Elgarten. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CLIFTON  S.  ELGARTEN 

 

 

 

 

 

         

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  NO.  14­623  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELGARTEN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Let  me  respond  first  to  Justice  Kagan's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comment.  The  way  the  Federal  Power  Act  works  is  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  power  and  the  authority,  recognized  by  FERC,  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  purchasing  end  of  any  contract  to  direct  their  local 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utilities  to  enter  into  any  contract  they  want. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When  they  direct  a  purchaser  to  do  so,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  rise  to  a  contract  that  is  certainly  within  FERC's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  to  review.  They  review  the  rates  charged 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  other  side  of  the  contract,  the  seller  side  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  contract,  and  they  review  the  ultimate  contract 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself.  But  the  notion  that  you  are  setting  the  rate  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaging  in  a  contract  with  a  seller  is  completely 

   

   

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  with  what  has  always  been  ­­ and  I  can  only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  always  been  the  rule  ­­ and  that's  how  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Power  Act  is  written  as  set  forth  in  our  reply  brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Federal  Power  Act  supplies  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  seller  side  of  those  rates. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  I  understand  what  you 

   

  

 

 

 

just  said,  you're  not  relying  on  Mr.  Strauss's  argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Strauss  said  that  this  wasn't  a  ­­ setting  a

wholesale  rate  because  Maryland  did  it  by  auction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  you're  saying  that's  irrelevant;  that 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  could  have  just  picked  a  price,  and  ­­ and  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  have  been  fine  so  long  as  at  some  point  FERC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  the  power  to  review  and  veto  it.  Is  that  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  saying? 

 

            

MR.  ELGARTEN:  No.  It's  ­­ it's  a  fair 

   

  

  

 

 

 

point,  but  no,  Maryland  could  not  have  picked  a  price. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  could  not  impose  that  price  on  the  seller. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  ELGARTEN:  The  ­­ the  long­standing  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  FERC  has  been  if  it's  competitively  set  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seller,  leaving  the  seller  free  to  respond  to  the  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  bid  of  the  purchaser,  then  it  is  subject  to  FERC, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  review  process  is  there.  And  it  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  with  Mr.  Strauss's  position. 

 

 

 

 

            

In  the  specific  circumstance  of  an  auction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  had  here  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  I  ­­

    

   

 

MR.  ELGARTEN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ I  don't  understand  that. 

   

  

 

 

 

I  mean,  just  take  a  hypothetical  case  where  ­­ where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  said  to  all  its  utilities,  this  is  the  price 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  is  the  only  price  that  you  will  pay  for

MR.  ELGARTEN:  Crosses  the  line. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Are  you  ­­ are  you  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  ELGARTEN:  I  belive  that  would  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ Maryland  could  do  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  ELGARTEN:  I  believe  ­­ there's  a  case 

    

   

 

 

 

            

            

that  ­­

 

            

            

            

from  ­­ from  the  Commission,  says  that  would  cross  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line.  I  am  imposing  a  price  that  all  my  utilities  would 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sell.  That  crosses  the  line. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  Then  you  are  saying 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  everything's  dependent  on  the  difference  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picking  a  price  and  letting  an  auction  pick  a  price. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

But  I  guess  I  ­­ I'll  repeat  the  question  that  I  made 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  Mr.  Strauss. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  we  know  that  one  of  the  ways  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  pick  a  price  is  by  letting  an  auction  determine  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price.  That's  exactly  what  FERC  does. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELGARTEN:  We  ­­ we  had  a  competitive 

   

  

 

 

 

 

bid  to  bid  ­­ build  a  power  plant.  That's  what  was  set 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  here.  We  were  talking  ­­ in  answering  your  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  I  was  answering  the  conceptual  question  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  is  FERC  regulates.  FERC  regulates  the  seller 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  of  ­­ of  every  transaction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  the  auction  context,  things  get  a  little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

more  complicated,  as  you  just  discussed  in  the  ­­ in  the

EPSA  case.  This  case,  however,  was  a  procurement  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

build  a  power  plant. 

   

 

            

 

 

CPV  bid  to  build  this  power  plant.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

looked  at  the  costs  it  would  take  to  build  a  power  plant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  locale,  how  much  turbines  cost,  how  much  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  cost  to  run  the  plant  and  to  bid  into  the  market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  make  it  available  to  the  market.  Of  course,  it  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divided  the  price  over  the  20  years.  You  have  240 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monthly  payments.  That's  exactly  what  we  bid. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  understood  that  for  Maryland  to  pay  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us  to  build  a  power  plant  and  to  keep  all  the  profits 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  our  sales  in  ­­ in  the  markets,  both  the  energy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales  and  capacity  sales,  both  were  involved  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  unfair.  They  didn't  want  the  ratepayers  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  finance  our  power  plant  construction,  which  is  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  was  after,  and  keep  all  the  revenues. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  contract  reads  ­­ and  this  is  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  17  of  the  reply  brief  ­­ the  contract  reads:  "We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turn  over  all  the  revenues  for  20  years,  and  we  build 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  power  plant."  They  pay  us  to  build  the  power  plant. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  turn  over  the  revenues.  It  is  correct  enough  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  net  of  that  is  the  difference  between  the  revenues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  price.  But  the  purchase  here  was  to  build  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  plant. 

 

            

Now,  how  did  it  impact  the  auction?  How

does  it  impact  the  auction?  The  auction  was  always  set 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  by  FERC  on  the  understanding  that  States  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherent  power,  and  I  mean  the  reserve  power  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Power  Act  itself  to  direct  these  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long­term  contracts,  to  direct  capacity  purchases 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  because  they  control  the  purchasing  decisions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  local  utilities  every  single  day.  They  review 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  and  they  control  them.  And  they  understood  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  would  be  using  long­term  contracts  to  support  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generation. 

            

So  FERC  didn't,  just  as  an  act  of  grace, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow  constant  sales  of  capacity  outside  the  auction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  constructed  the  auction  against  the  existing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  of  the  States  to  do  exactly  what  was  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Would  it  be  correct  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

incorrect  to  say  that  under  Maryland  law,  you  entered  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  entered  the  auction,  and  as  a  result,  you  altered 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  consequences  of  that  auction  in  a  way  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  with  FERC's  policy.  Is  that  a  fair  or  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfair  statement? 

 

            

MR.  ELGARTEN:  No,  it  is  not  fair,  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC's  policy,  it  was  expressed.  They  said  when  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  exactly  what  was  done  here,  before  they  even  set  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  auction  ­­ and  then  in  ­­ in  fact  they  said,  if

States  do  what  we  do  here,  we  have  a  mechanism  in  our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction  not  to  correct  it,  to  adjust  the  auction  so  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction  still  functions.  And  that  was  the  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Strauss  was  making. 

 

 

 

            

The  minimum­offer  price  rule,  which  has  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formats,  is  acceptable  to  FERC  because  FERC  says  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply  with  that  rule,  it  does  not  artificially  suppress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prices.  That  was  FERC's  judgment,  whether  it  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70  percent  or  80  percent  situation  of  how  you  bid. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

FERC  has  determined  that  is  competitive, 

 

 

 

 

 

economic  ­­ these  are  quotes  ­­ does  not  ­­ does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

artificially  suppress  prices  because  FERC  wants  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bids  in.  You're  a  competitive  resource. 

   

  

 

 

            

In  our  case,  however,  we  didn't  even  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  default  price.  We  used  a  pure  cost­based  price. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

So  the  concern  the  government  expresses  that  there's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility  of  an  exception  which  they  say  they  haven't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corrected  ­­ I  think  FERC  did  it  on  purpose  and  said  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  suppress  prices  ­­ the  possibility  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  is  eliminated.  We  were  ­­ we,  in  our  case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  bid  a  pure  cost­based  bid. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  when  you  bid  a  pure  cost­based  bid,  does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  affect  the  market?  Of  course.  The  addition  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

supply  affects  the  market.  FERC  doesn't  think  that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad  thing.  FERC  thinks  that's  a  wonderful  thing.

problem  I  have  here.  I  ­­ don't  spend  more  than  a

it  through  the  SG.  I  thought  there  was  a  doctrine

really  ­­ their  views  is  really  relevant  on  that,  you

FERC's  decisions  that  we've  cited,  the  135  and  137

read  that  and  you  read  the  quotes  that  are  included  in

suppresses.  These  kinds  of  issues  of  energy  policy  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  the  auctions  should  work  should  be  decided  by  FERC. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under  this  Court's  case,  Northwest  Central, 

 

 

 

 

 

it  says  if  the  issue  between  the  State's  authority  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  authority  can  be  reconciled  ­­ and  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconciled  with  these  specific  contracts  in  front  of  us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  modified  the  rules  to  allow  exactly  this  bid  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined  that  it  did  not  artificially  suppress  prices. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Does  it  affect  prices?  Of  course.  New 

  

  

 

 

 

 

supply  affects  prices.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  How  would 

  

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELGARTEN:  Does  it  artificially  do  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  would  this  work 

  

 

 

 

 

normally?  Meaning  forget  that  a  lawsuit  was  started. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

You  enter  into  this  contract.  Do  you  have  to  submit  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  to  FERC? 

 

 

            

MR.  ELGARTEN:  No.  Because  we  have  what's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

called  market­based  rate  authority.  It's  been  discussed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  your  cases.  So  we  notify  them.

They  said  this  is  adversely  affecting  the  auction.  FERC 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved  their  objection. 

 

 

            

FERC  had  in  front  of  it  the  very  complaints 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  here.  The  complaints  about  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RFPs  and  the  solicitations  from  New  Jersey  and  Maryland, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  they  presented  this  to  FERC. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

FERC  said,  ah,  we  take  care  of  this  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction  ­­ we've  always  known  how  ­­ with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimum­offer  price  rule.  They  said  the  minimum­offer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

price  rule,  when  it  is  applied,  will  result  in  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

artificially  suppressing  prices. 

 

 

            

That  is  how  this  was  presented  to  FERC. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

With  these  specific  contracts,  they  are  in  ­­ they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Volume  III  of  the  Fourth  ­­ Fourth  Circuit  appendix. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These  specific  contracts. 

 

 

            

Now,  if  they  want  to  protest  it  again  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  these  have  rates,  or  the  rates  that  affect  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction,  they  are  free  to  protest  it  yet  again. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  am  ­­ I  believe  FERC  would  come  up  with  the  same 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  again  and  say  this  is  perfectly  appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  bid  into  the  auction  in  this  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  somebody  wants  to  petition,  let's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close  this  what  they  are  calling  the  "loophole,"  the  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Justice  Breyer  suggested,  because  it  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  a  bid  at  exactly  a  cost­based  price.  They  can

go  to  FERC  and  close  that  loophole.  It  wouldn't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected  our  case  at  all  because  we  bid  a  cost­based, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  they  can  go  to  FERC  on  every  one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

All  of  the  conflict  preemption  issues  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  addressed  to  FERC.  They  are  not  really  for  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court,  which  is  obviously  having  some  trouble 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceptualizing  how  this  all  works,  to  resolve.  Those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conflict  preemption  on  the  Northwest  Central  issues  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  FERC. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  wouldn't  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELGARTEN:  They  should  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ get  to  conflict 

  

 

 

 

 

preemption  if  field  preemption  applies. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELGARTEN:  That's  absolutely  correct. 

  

 

 

 

And  so  on  the  issue  of  field  preemption,  have  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercised  an  authority  that  belongs  to  FERC?  No.  By 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

setting  ­­ by  directing  a  contract  or  competitively 

   

 

 

 

 

 

soliciting,  we  are  not  setting  the  rate.  If  we  did,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  from  Justice  Alito,  we  ­­ if  we  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody  in  the  State  must  pay  that  rate,  FERC  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealt  with  that  issue.  That  crosses  the  line. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Competitive  solicitations  do  not.

evidence  and  appeal,  as  reflected  in  the  New  Jersey 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal,  the  NJBPU,  appeal  of  that  order,  they  were  on

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  PAUL  D.  CLEMENT

MR.  CLEMENT:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it

Maryland's  targeting  of  the  Federal  market 

 

 

 

 

 

was  direct  in  this  case.  CPV  gets  nothing  unless  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bids  and  clears  the  PJM  auction.  Once  it  does,  it  must 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sell  all  of  its  output,  all  of  its  energy  and  capacity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  PJM.

If  those  things  happen,  then  CPV  receives, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thanks  to  the  State  of  Maryland  and  its  State  action, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment  streams  in  conjunction  ­­ in  connection  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  sales  to  PJM  that  are  different  from  and  far  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stable  than  the  prevailing  price  on  the  PJM  auction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why?  The  ­­ the  way  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

they've  described  it  to  me  ­­ I'll  try  this  once  more. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  truer  words  were  never  spoke,  than  I  am  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  on  top  of  how  this  thing  works. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  way  he  described  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  are  they  bidding  into  the  PJM  is  their  real  cost. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  when  they  are  bidding  their  real  cost,  Maryland 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  going  to  pay  them  a  dime.  If  they  are  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inframarginal  unit,  which  I  assume  they  would  be,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cost  for  PJM  is  going  to  be  higher,  not  lower.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  will  be  extra  money.  So  what  they  are  going  to  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  they  are  going  to  be  paying  Maryland. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  what  they  said  is,  we're  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paying  you. 

 

            

Oh,  he's  shaking  his  head.  So  I  haven't  got 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  right,  either. 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No?  No,  I  have  got  it 

   

  

  

 

 

 

right?  I  don't  know.  I'm  guessing  at  getting  it  right.

problem,  which  is,  I  think,  first,  there's  a  factual 

   

   

 

 

 

 

premise  there  ­­

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  ­­ which  is  ­­ I  think  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  much  conceded  that,  at  least  in  the  first  couple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  years  of  this,  the  expectation  is  that  CPV  is  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  receiving  an  additional  payment,  a  forced  payment, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  LSC,  the  loading  serving  entity,  to  PJM.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  just  a  factual  premise  for  you. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  are  they  bidding  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

true  cost  into  PJM? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  they  sure  didn't  start 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  way. 

 

            

And  let  me  start  here.  I  mean,  they  had,  as 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  Justice  Alito  alluded  to,  a  completely  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive  in  bidding  their  costs  into  PJM  than  would  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  generator  with  new  capacity.

for  them  is  just  an  obstacle  to  get  to  the  pot  of  gold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  end  of  the  rainbow,  which  is  all  these  guaranteed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments  for  20  years.  So  they  have  every  incentive  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understate  their  cost. 

 

 

            

That  incentive  was  realized  here.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

talked  about  bidding  in  their  costs.  When  they  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bid  in  their  costs,  they  bid  in  their  costs  at  less  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$14  a  megawatt­day.  Okay? 

   

  

            

Now,  when  PJM  took  a  look  at  that,  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ended  up  upping  the  figure  sevenfold  to  about  $96.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  great  measure  of  their  incentive  to  distort 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  costs  for  FERC. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  what  they  will  say  is,  ah,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Clement,  the  $96  bid  cleared,  and  that's  all  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matters. 

            

Well,  with  all  due  respect,  that's  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  says  it's  wrong.  A  bid  like  this  can  still  have  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price  effect  ­­ suppressive  effect.  And  you  can  see 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  a  couple  of  ways. 

   

 

 

 

              

I  want  to  say  one  thing,  though,  is  FERC  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  on  our  side  in  part  because  they  are  on  its  record

as  saying  this  MOPR  ­­ the  minimum­offer  price  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  MOPR  is  not  some  sort  of  cure­all  that  is  designed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ward  off  any  price­suppressive  bid.  It  is  a  default 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  It  is  a  coarse  screen  to  deal  with  the  most 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

egregious  cost­reducing  bids.  It  also  depends  on  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

estimate  of  cost.  And  here's  why  it  doesn't  really  work 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  bid  like  this. 

   

 

 

            

One  of  the  most  important  costs  is  your  cost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  capital.  Well,  what  was  CPV's  cost  of  capital 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  this  program?  They  told  you.  They  told 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland,  without  the  20­year  guarantee,  we  can't  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  financing  for  this  project.  We  can't  do  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

At  the  bench  trial,  they  told  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court,  our  ability  to  bid  this  project  depends  entirely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  that's  another  way  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  the  bid  that  ­­ that  ­­ that  FERC  says  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  have  to  make  is  not  their  actual  costs  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  What  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ because  if  in  fact  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  a  cost  of  capital  that  is  lower  than  what  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cost  of  capital  really  is,  that  is  a  misstatement  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  cost  or  a  ­­ an  ­­ a  lower­than­actual  cost,  just 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  much  as  if  the  steel  were  in  fact  less  expensive  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  actually  have  to  pay.

MR.  CLEMENT:  Absolutely.  And  of  course, 

  

  

 

 

 

another  component  of  cost  is  going  to  be  future  fuel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costs.  And  anybody  who's  been  to  the  pump  lately  knows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  can  all  have  a  lot  of  variance  as  to  what  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  are  going  to  be  future  fuel  costs,  but  if  I  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

return  to  the  capital  cost  and  just  finish  this  point, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  even  worse  that  it's  misstated,  because  ultimately, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  are  getting  a  20­year  guarantee  and  no  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else  is,  everybody  else  is  calculating  their  cost  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  generation  financing  based  on  the  three­year  price 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signal  that  the  ­­ that  the  ­­ that  the  capacity  market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  settling,  it  destroys  the  ability  to  do  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apples­to­apples  comparison.  And  then  the  one  thing  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  for  certain  here  is  that  this  project  ended  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

displacing  a  project  that  actually  could  be  built  based 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  three­year  forward  price  and  without  a  20­year 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  you'd  have  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'd  have  no  objection  if  Maryland  just  decided  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidize  the  construction  of  the  plant,  would  you? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  We  would,  Your  Honor.  I  think 

    

  

 

 

 

 

it  might  be  a  harder  case,  but  particularly  if  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidy  was  conditioned  on  a  bid­and­clear  requirement, 

   

 

 

 

 

I  would  be  here  making  a  preemption  argument.  You  might 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  think  it's  as  good  of  a  preemption  argument,  and  I

think  that  the  only  difference  is  because  the  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text  of  the  Federal  Power  Act,  it  seems  to  me  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  position  clearly  correct,  is  the  provision  that  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  FERC  has  the  authority  to  dictate  what  a  seller 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receives  in  connection  with  a  wholesale  sale. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  How  do  you  define  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

field  that's  preempted? 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  think  the  field  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  preempted  is  the  ability  of  a  government  actor  to  set 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  rates  for  wholesale  sales.  And  so  if  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  action  that  sets  rates  for  wholesale  sales  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"rates"  in  this  context  is  defined  by  the  statute  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including  what  a  seller  receives  for  wholesale  sales  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  that's  preempted. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Are  they  ­­ are  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

setting  rates  by  having  ended  the  auction? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  We  certainly  think  so,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

more  importantly,  I  think,  for  purposes  of  this  case,  so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  the  district  court.  I  mean,  it's  kind  of  odd  for  me 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  hear  my  friends  on  the  other  side,  as  I  heard  them  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  colloquy  with  Justice  Kagan,  they  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceded  they  lose  if  Maryland  sets  the  rates,  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  an  odd  concession  in  any  case,  but  particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  at  footnote  48  at  the  district  court's  opinion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court  finds  ­­ as  a  matter  of  fact,  I'll

concede  it's  a  mixed  question  of  fact  and  law  and  all, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  still  there  it  is.  The  district  court  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  In  a  sense,  I  guess  all  of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

the  bidders  in  the  conventional  auction  in  effect  set 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  rates  by  their  bid. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Sure.  And  I  think  what 

   

  

  

 

 

Justice  Kagan  alluded  to  is  if  Maryland  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  why  is  this  ­­ why  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  different? 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  it's  ­­ it's  not, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  I  ­­ I  think  the  point  is,  if  Maryland  is  not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

setting  the  rates  here,  than  FERC's  not  setting  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  rates,  and  that's  not  right.  And  so  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  use  an  auction  mechanism  to  set  the  rate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  doesn't  mean  that  it's  not  the  State  setting  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rate.  And  if  you  look  at  footnote  48,  it's  ­­ it  goes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  that  because,  based  on  particular  findings,  based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  testimony  of  the  chairman  of  the  Maryland  PSC, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court  said  that  actually  because  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  and  forth  between  Maryland  and  CPV,  this  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  setting  the  rate. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  is  Maryland 

  

 

 

 

 

setting  the  rates  when  it  subsidizes  the  construction  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  power  plant? 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  if  ­­ Mr.  Chief  Justice,

suppose  they  decided  to  ­­ I  mean,  potentially  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

could.  Not  all  subsidies  are  created  equal.  If  they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  a  subsidy  that  was  measured,  a  dollar­for­dollar 

   

   

 

 

 

subsidy  based  on  sales  to  PJM,  I  would  think  that  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  be  setting  the  rate.  Again,  you  might  disagree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  me,  but  I  would  say  that  in  that  case,  you  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  very  similar  situation.  I  think  this  case  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  much  clearer  because  these  payments  from  the  LSC  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  conditioned  on  selling  to  PJM. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Clement,  can  you 

  

 

 

 

 

tell  me  how  I  write  this  opinion?  And  I'll  ask  you  why. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  As  I  look  at  the 

   

  

 

 

 

relevant  statutory  provisions,  what  it  says  is  that  FERC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  the  power  to  ensure  that  rates  that  are  set  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair,  are  just  and  reasonable.  So  it  doesn't  say  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets  to  set  the  rates.  It  says  it  can  do  rules  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  that  control  how  the  rates  are  set  so  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  not  sure  how  this  is  field  preemption.  At  best,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  might  be  conflict  preemption.  And  so  if  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  conflict  preemption,  that  something  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland's  plan  conflicts  with  the  system  that  FERC  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  in  place,  how  do  I  articulate  the  rule  in  this  case? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  is  it  that  conflicts  with  FERC's  rules  and

it,  and  I  don't  think  you  ­­ you've  told  me  any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently,  that  the  people  who  are  auctioning  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market  can  and  do  enter  into  contracts  with  States  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regular  basis. 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Oh,  not  with  contracts  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  States.  That's  not  what  my  friends  on  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  were  saying.  They  enter  into  voluntary  bilateral 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts  off  of  the  market. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 

  

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  And  that  is  not  what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happened  here. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.  Voluntary 

  

  

 

 

contracts  outside  the  market. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  is  this  involuntary? 

  

 

 

 

 

Because  of  the  State  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Because  the  State  told  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

load­serving  entities  that  they  had  to  make  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments  to  CPV.

what  conflicts?  I'm  ­­ I'm  trying  to  articulate  the

bit  like  Justice  Breyer  on  this.  I'm  not  quite  sure  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  is  working,  but  I  don't  think  it  can  be  field 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption,  because  you  have  to  explain  what  field  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  and  what  rule  we're  setting  in  the  future.

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  think  it's  both,  Your  Honor. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  part  of  the  reason  this  is  difficult  is  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  like  an  overdetermined  equation.  There  is  both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

field  preemption  here,  but  there's  also  conflict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption,  and  there  are  multiple  evidences  of  conflict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption,  because  nobody's  tried  to  do  anything  like

MR.  CLEMENT:  This  conflicts  with  FERC's 

  

 

 

 

 

determination  that  the  PJM  rates  for  the  PJM  auctions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  just  and  reasonable.  As  you  said,  the  starting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise  here  is  the  statute  gives  FERC  the  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine  whether  wholesale  rates  are  just  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable.  FERC  has  done  that  effectively  ex  ante  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  PJM  markets  by  its  regulations  of  PJM. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  has  said  that  the  auction  clearing  rate  for  sales

to  PJM  is  just  and  reasonable. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  authority  of  FERC  extends  not  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  what  the  nominal  rate  is  in  the  auction  but  to  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  supplier  receives  in  connection  with  that  sale.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  a  State,  through  State  action,  says,  it's  all  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well  CPV  that  you've  sold  that  to  PJM  and  PJM  has  given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  a  hundred,  this  is  your  lucky  day,  we're  going  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  you  another  50,  that  is  clearly  preempted  because  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  is  having  the  supplier  receive  something  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection  with  a  wholesale  sale  to  PJM  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  the  rate  that  FERC  has  determined  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Let  me  try  that  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

example.  Five  thousand  new  megawatts  of  capacity  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed.  Existing  suppliers  can't  supply  more  than  four. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  FERC  is  trying  to  get  an  extra  thousand.  The  people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whom  it  will  choose  to  give  it  and  will  allow  to  bid  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  who  are  the  new  people  who  have  the  lowest  cost. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All  of  those  people  in  a  rising  market  will  have  higher 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costs  than  the  existing  people. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  in  fact  FERC  looks  to  the  existing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  and  says,  which  can  bid?  And  says,  you  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  your  real  costs.  And  if  they  really  implement  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  you  just  said  is  going  to  have  no  effect  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market,  because  they  will  be  in  the  market  whether  they

are  given  a  subsidy  or  whether  they  are  not  given  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidy. 

            

And  indeed,  it  won't  affect  the  price 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  price  is  affected  only  by  the  marginal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

units,  who,  by  definition,  have  higher  costs  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  that  FERC  will  look  to  to  see  what  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people's  costs  are.  Therefore,  it  is  without  impact, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  they  add  to  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

We  would  like  to  make  this  argument  to  FERC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  they  have  to  focus  on  it  and  not  just  say  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  to  the  SG,  this  is  how  we  think,  because  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  we're  finished,  we'll  be  able  to  modify  present 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  so  that  they  will  see  that  they  are  not  hurt  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  in  the  actual  world  by  our  costs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  did  get  something  like  that  out  of  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  said.  Maybe  I'm  wrong  in  what  they  think.  Maybe 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they'll  just  agree  because  they  think  I'm  agreeing  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  at  the  moment,  but  I  would  like  to  know  some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response  to  that. 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Here's  your  response,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Breyer,  and  it  comes  in  two  parts,  because  there's  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  two  parts  to  that  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  I  take  issue  with  the  premise  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it  may  be  that  some  new  generation  will  come  in,  in  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical,  but  it  won't  necessarily  be  this  one.  And

in  fact  here  we  know,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  that  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  be  this  one,  except  for  the  20­year  guarantee, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  they  displaced  somebody.

MR.  CLEMENT:  That  is  a  huge  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  not  shrugging  my 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  That  is  a  huge  difference, 

   

  

 

 

 

because  this  ­­ the  message  this  all  sends  to  my  clients 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  don't  take  FERC's  direction  that  you  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competing  based  on  market  forces  and  efficiency.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  stop  competing  efficiently  on  the  PJM  and  try  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  the  best  bid  together  based  on  the  three­year 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advanced  auction.  We  should  start  competing  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

subsidies,  and  we  should  start  competing  for  guarantees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  part  of  your  question,  what  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  primary  jurisdiction.  This  is  all  a  bit  rich 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

coming  from  my  friends  on  the  other  side  because,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito  alluded  to,  when  this  all  started,  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  was  this  has  nothing  to  do  with  FERC  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  is  a  financial  arrangement  that  FERC  can't  even

look  at. 

 

            

Then  my  friend  talks  about  how,  well,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eventually  got  market­based  rate  authority  from  FERC  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  submission.  Well,  I  ­­ I'd  ask  you  to  take  a  look  at 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  said  on  Joint  Appendix  page  142  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submission.  What  they  said  about  the  contract  is  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  quote,  "CPV  Maryland  also  notes  that  it  included 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  CFD  in  this  application  solely  for  informational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  and  is  not  requesting  that  the  Commission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  or  discuss  Commission  jurisdiction  over  the  CFD 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  its  decision  on  CPV's  Maryland's  request  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market­based  rate." 

 

            

Don't  look  what's  behind  that  curtain, 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  FERC.  We  don't  want  you  to  do  anything  with  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  just  here  to  try  to  get  market­based  rate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority. 

            

For  them  now  to  come  in,  not  having  raised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  objection  to  the  Supremacy  Clause  cause  of  action  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  by  the  way,  there  was  a  Commerce  Clause  cause  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  there  as  well,  which  is  maybe  why  the  parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overlooked  it,  and  I  do  think  that's  not  jurisdictional, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  I  think  we're  past  that. 

   

 

 

 

            

So  for  them  to  come  in  now  and  say,  oh,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  go  to  FERC,  I'm  sorry;  it's  a  bit  rich.  And  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  why  they  were  making  the  MOPR  argument  at  the

early  stages  of  this  litigation  before  FERC  filed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  But  I  am  a  little  mystified  why,  at  this  late 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

stage  of  the  game,  after  FERC  has  filed  three  briefs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  the  MOPR  is  not  sufficient  to  eliminate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price­suppressive  bids,  that  they're  still  saying  we  win 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  FERC's  on  our  side. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  that  is  a  bit  mystifying.  And  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  FERC  is  absolutely  right  on  this  for  the  reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we've  already  talked  about.  I  mean,  you  can't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  even  apply  the  MOPR  in  an  apples­to­apples  way  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  this  kind  of  20­year  guarantee,  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cost  of  capitals  are  completely  out  of  whack.  And  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  they  do  have  the  problem  that  their  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  is  they  wouldn't  be  on  the  market  at  all  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  didn't  have  this  20­year  guarantee. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  the  first  capacity  auction  that  we  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  deal  with,  the  price  was  suppressed.  In  every  energy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction  since  then,  the  price  was  suppressed.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why  I  think  FERC  ­­ you  know,  they  never  tried  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design  the  MOPR  as  this  perfect  thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  talked  about  the  90  percent  and  the  70 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent?  Way  back  in  one  of  those  proceedings,  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client  said,  FERC,  why  isn't  it  a  hundred  percent?  If 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  think  about  the  economics  of  this,  it  should  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundred  percent.  And  FERC's  response  was,  eh,  close

counts,  this  isn't  perfect,  we  don't  pretend  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfect  so  we  think  90  perfect  is  a  rough  compromise. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fair  enough.  Probably  not  arbitrary  and  capricious,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  doesn't  mean  that  this  is  something  that  the  MOPR  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  perfect  solution. 

 

 

              

I  also  don't  think  there's  anything  terribly 

 

 

 

 

 

anomalous  about  the  procedural  posture  of  this  case.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  exact  procedural  posture  you  had  in  front  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  in  the  Schneidewind  case.  That  was  a  district  court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

action,  declaratory  judgment  for  preemption. 

 

 

 

 

            

What  I  think  makes  this  a  preemption  case, 

   

   

 

 

 

and  what  completely  distinguishes  voluntary  bilateral 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts,  is  State  action.  It's  the  State  action 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

forcing  the  LSCs  to  make  these  payments,  and  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditioning  CPV's  participation  on  the  PJM  market  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  bid­and­clear  requirement.  That's  State  action 

  

 

 

 

 

that's  preempted. 

 

            

In  the  typical  voluntary  bilateral  contract, 

 

 

 

 

 

you  don't  have  State  action.  The  parties  make  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement.  They  eventually  submit  it  to  FERC,  or  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  market­based  rate,  somebody  can  object.  And  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

only  time  you  really  get  State  action  at  that  point  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  very  end  of  the  process  when  the  State's  doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  rate  regulation,  and  that's  the  point  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mississippi  Power  &  Light  and  Nantahala  come  in  and  say

if  at  that  late  stage  when  there's  finally  State  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  State  has  to  take  FERC's  wholesale  rate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determinations  as  a  given;  they  can't  second  guess  them 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  late  stage.  But  here  you  got  the  State  action  right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  front,  and  the  State  action  is  preempted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Clement,  it  ­­ it  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem  to  me  important  what  the  kind  of  State  action  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  this  goes  back  to  the  question  that  the  Chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  raised  with  you. 

 

 

 

            

If  the  State  had  just  said  we  need  another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  plant  and  had  delivered  a  load  of  money  to  CPV  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  go  build  a  power  plant,  you're  not  saying  that  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  preempted,  are  you?  If  it's  not  at  all,  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ you  know,  that's  going  to  have  an  effect  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  bids  that  CPV  is  going  to  make.  But  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  itself  changing  the  outcomes  of  the  auction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process.  You  wouldn't  say  that's  preempted,  would  you? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  It  would  depend.  I  mean,  the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

way  you  just  described  it,  I  would  say  ­­ especially 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  I  think  it's  a  helpful  answer  ­­ of  course  not, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  preempted. 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  But  if  they  conditioned  all  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  money  on  a  bid­and­clear  requirement,  I  would  be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

saying  that  that  was  preempted.  I  think  it's  a  harder

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ANN  O'CONNELL 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

In  the  government's  view,  the  Maryland 

 

 

 

 

 

Generation  Order  is  preempted  because  by  requiring  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State­selected  generator  to  bid  into  and  clear  the  PJM 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity  auction  in  order  to  receive  the  guaranteed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments  provided  in  the  contract,  the  Maryland  program 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  intrudes  on  the  Federal  auction,  and  it  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interferes  with  the  free  market  mechanism  that  FERC  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approved  for  setting  capacity  prices  in  that  auction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Do  you  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

position  on  the  question  that  Mr.  Clement  avoided,  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  if  the  State  ­­ what  if  the  State  subsidized  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  plant?  Is  that  good  or  bad? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  I  ­­ I  agree  with 

    

   

 

 

Mr.  Clement's  answer.  If  the  State  just  ­­

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Clement's  answer? 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  If  the  State  ­­ if  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  paid  to  build  a  power  plant,  that's  not  directly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

targeting  what's  happening  in  the  PJM  auction.  Sure, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  adding  supply  to  the  market.  But  as  long  as  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  is  staying  within  its  sphere  under  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Power  Act,  that's  fine. 

 

 

 

            

But  I  also  agree  with  the  second  part  of  his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer,  which  is  that  if  there  was  some  kind  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bid­and­clear  requirement  in  the  auction  attached  to  it; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  example,  if  the  State  paid  to  build  the  power  plant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  turned  it  over  to  CPV,  but  then  they  said,  okay,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  get  some  money  back  for  this  power  plant  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

built,  so  you're  going  to  bid  the  capacity  of  this  plant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  auction.  And  unless  you  clear,  we're  taking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plant  away  from  you,  or  something  like  that.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes  the  incentives  of  the  participants  in  FERC's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction. 

            

            

            

            

And  that's  what  ­­ what  is  the  key  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  that's  the  conflict? 

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Yes.  Yes. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

because  ­­ you're  articulating  it  as  ­­ and  correct  me

changing  the  incentives  of  the  people  in  the  market  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  that  conflicts  with  the  market  mechanism  that  FERC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  set  up.  We  think  that  shows  both  field  and  conflict 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  O'Connell,  you  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  both  arguments  field  and  conflict.  If  ­­ if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  to  win  this  case,  would  you  rather  win  it  on  field 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  conflict? 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  why? 

  

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  I  mean,  I  think  that  field 

    

   

 

 

 

preemption  is  probably  a  better  way  to  decide  the  case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  would  ­­ it  would  be  a  broader  ruling.  In  such 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ in  such  a  ruling,  I  think  the  ­­ the  Court  would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  when  the  State  does  something  that  alters  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentives  of  the  people  that  are  participating  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC's  market,  that  is  intruding  on  the  Federal  field. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  for  ­­ that  ­­ that

incentives.  The  generator's  cost  by  definition  change 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  it's  receiving  subsidies  for  free. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  If  ­­ if  the  State  is  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acting  completely  outside  of  the  auction  with  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  to  bid  into  and  clear  in  the  auction,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  not  something  that  changes  the  incentives  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

folks  that  are  participating  in  the  auction,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  happened  here. 

 

 

            

The  ­­ the  cost  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  why  do  you  even  need 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sort  of  change­in­incentives  language?  Why  isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  field  preemption  argument  more  that  this  ­­ this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  scheme  essentially  takes  the  rate  that  the  auction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

produces  and  changes  that  rate  for  CPV  and  for  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utilities  in  Maryland? 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  I  think  ­­ Justice  Kagan, 

    

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  reason  why  we  don't  agree  with  that  broader 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  is  because  we  ­­ FERC  does  not  think  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  receiving  extra  money  in  ­­ in  connection  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity  that's  being  sold  into  the  auction  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  preempted,  and  let  me  explain  why. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's  something  that  happens  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

industry,  a  widespread  practice  called  contracts  for 

   

 

 

 

 

differences.  The  contracts  in  this  case  are  sometimes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred  to  as  contracts  for  differences,  but  because  of

the  bid­and­clear  requirement  they  don't  operate  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  way. 

 

            

Parties  can  enter  into  a  hedge  agreement. 

   

 

 

 

 

For  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  but  that's  ­­ but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  ­­ when  Mr.  Clement  said  that  there's  a  real 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  here  between  voluntary  agreements  ­­ you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  if  there's  a  contract  for  differences,  fine,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  Maryland  coming  in  and  effectively  forcing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  LSCs  to  enter  into  such  a  contract,  and  by  doing  so, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changing  the  wholesale  rate. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Well,  I  think  the  ­­ the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

problem  that  ­­ that  FERC  sees  with  this  is  the  effect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  has  on  the  auction.  If  this  was  just  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bilateral  contract  occurring  outside  of  the  auction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  Maryland  was  accepting  the  results  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competitive  procurement  and  then  submitting  that 

 

 

 

 

 

bilateral  contract  to  FERC  for  review,  that's  where  FERC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  review  that  contract. 

 

 

 

            

The  field  that  we're  talking  about  here  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  auction.  And  what  FERC  is  concerned  about  here  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  effects  on  the  auction  of  a  State  program  like  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  here  that  ties  a  subsidy  or  ­­ or  extra  payments 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  contract  to  a  requirement  that  the  ­­ the

the  auction. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  See,  when  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  How  far  does  your  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  far  do  you  think  your  authority  reaches  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  indirect  effects  on  the  auction? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  guess  that  was  the  point  of  my  question  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  subsidies.  I  mean,  a  lot  of  things  are  going  to 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  an  effect  on  the  auction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  it  only  because  of  the  legal  mandate  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case? 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Yes.  It's  ­­ it's  because 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  ­­ the  program  in  this  case,  by  requiring  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity  to  be  bid  into  the  auction  and  clear,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  targets  the  auction.  It  has  a  direct  effect  on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  auction. 

 

            

We  ­­ we  recognize  that,  in  the  context  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  Power  Act,  the  State  has  its  sphere  too. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  State  regulates  retail  rates.  The  State  has  control 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  generation.  And  it  can  do  things  within  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sphere  that  have  indirect  effects  on  ­­ on  FERC's  field. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  in  this  case  the  problem  is  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  the  bidding­and­clearing  requirement,  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  altering  the  incentives  of  the  people  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market.

MOPR  correct  the  problem? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  The  MOPR  corrects  it  to  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent  because  the  MOPR  is  choosing  what  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  FERC 

 

 

thinks  is  a  fair  price  for  a  new  generator 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

to  bid  in  at. 

 

 

 

The  MOPR  isn't  a  complete  solution  because, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

as  we've 

 

described  in  our  brief,  if  somebody  bids  in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the 

 

minimum­offer  price  rule  but  its  costs  are 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually 

higher,  it  is  necessarily  going  to  knock  somebody  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  auction  that  would  have  cleared  otherwise,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price  of  the  auction  will  go  down. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  ­­ and  I  ­­ I  think,  as  Mr.  Clement 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

correctly  pointed  out,  the  MOPR  is  not  a  ­­ a  perfect 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

solution  to  this.  In  ­­ in  this  particular  case,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  incentives  of  what  ­­ what  were  ­­ was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happening  under  the  State  program  is  demonstrated  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  CPV  tried  to  bid  in  so  low  even  when  it  tried 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  cost­justify  their  bids.  And  the  market  monitor  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PJM,  when  trying  to  actually  reconstruct  CPV's  costs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came  to  different  numbers  on  what  those  costs  would  be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  it's  not  a  perfect  way  to  try  to  screen 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  offers  that  are  not  actually  based  on  cost  or  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  not  be  coming  in. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and,  additionally,  just  the  fact  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  had  to  expand  the  MOPR  to  cover  this  program  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  shows  that  there's  been  an  intrusion  onto  FERC's

field.  FERC  has  tried  to  correct  what's  happening  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  programs  through  extending  the  minimum­price  offer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  to  these  bids,  but  I  think  that  ­­ that  just  shows 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what's  happening  here  is  that  the  State  programs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  changing  the  incentives  of  the  ­­ the  people  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

field. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  but  I  don't  see  how 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  could  be  true.  If  FERC  could,  in  fact,  get  rid  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  problem,  then  it  leaves  you  with  no  conflict. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  I  don't  think  that's  right. 

    

 

 

 

 

I  think  the  conflict  is  still  with  the  ­­ the  market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism  that  FERC  has  set  up  in  order  to  determine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  capacity  rates  in  the  auction.  When  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  program  that  has  this  bid­and­clear  requirement,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alters  those  incentives.  Even  if  there's  not  an  actual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price­suppressive  effect,  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  possibility

way  that  these  contracts  are  constructed,  CPV  is  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  the  contract  price  regardless  of  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearing  price  is  lower  or  higher. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  can  see  it.  But  what  are 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  words  of  the  field  preemption  thing  that  puts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  the  preemption  the  thing  that's  worrying  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice? 

 

            

See,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  mean,  you  ­­ you  want  to 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

say  the  field  is  so  defined  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ as,  and  ­­ and  now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look,  billions  of  actions  of  States  affect  the  cost  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  generator  and  thereby  affect  the  bid  price  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PJM  auction. 

 

            

Now,  99.99999  percent  we  want  the  State  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do.  They're  perfectly  free  to  do.  But  you  want  this 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1  percent  no.  And  ­­ and  ­­ and  I  want  the  words  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  going  to  define  that  field. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  what  Justice  Sotomayor  was  asking  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before.  It's  something  to  do  with  the  rule  here  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  that  forces  them  not  just  to  have  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

artificial  costs  but  to  put  it  on  the  ­­ the  auction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  are  the  words?

the  auction  to  take  some  words  from  ONEOK  would  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine  way  to  do  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  see  targeting. 

    

 

 

MS.  O'CONNELL:  The  ­­ the  ­­ the  field  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  talking  about  is  the  PJM  auction.  And  any  ­­ a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  program  that  directly  targets  the  auction  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentives  of  the  participants  in  that  auction  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bid­and­clear  requirement  is  ­­ would  be  preempted  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  field­preemption  theory.  We  think  also  under  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conflict­preemption  theory. 

 

              

I  ­­ I  could  distinguish  just  a  ­­ just  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

little  bit  the  contracts  for  differences  that  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tied  to  a  bid­and­clear  requirement  in  the  auction. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

States  ­­ or  the  parties  in  this  context 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  sometimes  enter  into  a  hedge  agreement  where  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree  on  a  price.  Like  a  hundred  dollars,  if  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

auction  clearing  price  is  below  that,  say  it's  80,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  that  the  generator  has  contracted  with,  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Merrill  Lynch  or  something,  owes  the  generator  $20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regardless  of  what  ­­ what  else  happens.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction  will  always  take  place. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  generator  then  has  to  make  a  separate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

decision  of  whether  it  wants  to  bid  into  the  auction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  it's  ­­ if  the  auction  price  is  80  and  its  costs  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

90,  it's  not  going  to.  If  its  costs  are  70,  it  will  bid

That  sort  of  a  contract  for  differences  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

not  preempted  here.  It's  just  when  there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bidding­and­clearing  requirement  that  the  subsidy  is 

 

 

 

 

 

tied  to. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

 

Mr.  Strauss,  you  have  three  minutes 

 

 

 

 

remaining. 

          

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  SCOTT  H.  STRAUSS 

 

 

 

 

 

         

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  NO.  14­614  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRAUSS:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

We  did  not  ­­ Maryland  did  not  require  CPV 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  bid  into  the  auction.  CPV  agreed  to  do  so  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response  to  a  competitive  procurement. 

   

 

 

            

FERC  has  no  issue  with  competitive 

 

 

 

 

 

procurements,  and  that  can  be  found  in  the  Joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix.  At  page  909,  there  is  a  regulation  in  which 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  essentially  says  so. 

 

 

 

            

That's  all  that  happened  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  question  of  whether  we  targeted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction:  We  did  not  regulate  the  auction.  We  could  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulate  the  auction.  We  could  not  regulate  CPV, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

either.  They're  a  wholesale  generator.  They  make  their 

   

  

  

 

 

 

own  choices,  and  they  made  their  own  agreement  here  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enter  into  this  contract.

We  couldn't  regulate  the  outcome  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction  because  FERC  regulates  the  outcome  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auction.  They  control  every  aspect  of  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  this  case,  what  FERC  found  was  a  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  was  needed  to  address  this  very  contract.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  was  made.  The  resource  bid  in  accordance  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rule  change  and  cleared. 

 

 

 

 

            

FERC  said  its  rule  change  would  reconcile 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  tensions  between  State  policy  and  auction  integrity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  said  that  this  resource  was  economic,  needed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competitive,  and  did  not  suppress  prices. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  was  no  undue  price  suppression  or  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

artificial  price  suppression  from  this  resource.  FERC 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  and  ­­ and  said  it  more  than  once.  Even  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  subsidy. 

 

 

            

And  the  reason  is  very  clear:  Because  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bid  was  a  cost­based  bid  without  regard  to  the  contract 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revenue. 

            

And  keep  in  mind,  there's  been  a  lot  of  talk 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  a  subsidy  here.  Maryland  concluded  that,  over  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

life  of  this  contract,  this  was  going  to  be  a  better 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal  for  ratepayers  than  for  the  generator.  And  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  generation  order. 

 

 

 

            

The  only  other  point  I  would  make, 

   

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  is  that  the  rule  that  should  be  articulated

here  is  one  that  allows  each  of  the  parties  to  fulfill 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  responsibilities  under  the  statute.  Sellers  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  set  rates  as  an  initial  matter.  FERC  gets  to  review 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  rates,  and  States  get  to  direct  the  procurement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions  of  their  retail  utilities. 

 

 

 

 

            

Been  a  lot  of  talk  here  about  what  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  utilities  were  forced  to  do.  The  subject  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  regulation.  State  courts  have  affirmed  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  did  here  with  respect  to  its  retail  utilities. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  should  be  no  question  about  that.  States  can  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions  where  necessary  to  develop  new  power  plants. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  as  we  move  forward  into  an  era  of  a  new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generation  portfolio  in  this  country,  the  last  thing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  should  be  considering  is  trying  to  limit  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

options.  It's  very  important  to  keep  them  open, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially  in  a  case  here,  where  FERC  has  reviewed  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precise  contract. 

 

            

If  you  look  on  page  6  of  our  reply  brief, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  quote  from  the  FERC  rehearing  order  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

November  of  2011  in  which  FERC  describes  an  acceptable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangement  and  describes  this  arrangement:  one  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  local  utilities  contract  with  a  generator  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

generator  bids  the  unit  into  the  market. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  is  exactly  what  happened  under  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract.  FERC  speaks  approvingly  of  it.
