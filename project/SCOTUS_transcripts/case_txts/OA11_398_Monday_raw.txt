13  tax assessment and collection.  The Act applies to 
14  essentially every tax penalty in the Internal Revenue 
15
16  special exception for the penalty imposed by section 
17  5000A.  On the contrary, there are three reasons to 
18  conclude that the Anti-Injunction Act applies here. 
 First, Congress directed that the section 
19
5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the 
20
21  same manner as taxes.  Second, Congress provided that 
22  penalties are included in taxes for assessment purposes.

Code.  There is no reason to think that Congress made a 

 Congress directed that the section 5000A

of any tax may be maintained in any court by any 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that depends, as --

1  penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same 
2  manner as taxes.  That directive triggers the 
3  Anti-Injunction Act, which provides that "no suit for 
4  the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection 
5
6  person." 
7
8  as the Government points out, on whether that directive 
9  is a directive to the Secretary of the Treasury as to 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  answer to that, Justice Scalia.  First, the text does 
20
21  taxes in the same manner; it just says that it shall be 
22  assessed in the same manner as a tax, without addressing 
23  any party particularly. 
24
25

how he goes about getting this penalty, or rather a 
directive to him and to the courts.  All of the other 
directives there seem to me to be addressed to the 
Secretary.  Why should this one be directed to the 
courts?  When you say "in the same manner," he goes 
about doing it in the same manner, but the courts simply 
accept that -- that manner of proceeding but nonetheless 
adjudicate the cases. 

not say that the Secretary shall assess and collect 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, he's assessing and 

collecting it in the same manner as a tax. 

 MR. LONG:  Well, I think I have a three-part 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. LONG:  Well, the assessment -- the other 

1
2  two parts of the answer are, as a practical matter, I 
3  don't think there's any dispute in this case that if the 
4  Anti-Injunction Act does not apply, this penalty, the 
section 5000A penalty, will as a practical matter be 
5
6  assessed and collected in a very different manner from 
7  other taxes and other tax penalties. 
 There are three main differences.  First, 
8
9  when the Anti-Injunction Act applies, you have to pay 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22 
 Now, if -- if the Anti-Injunction Act does 
23
24  not apply here, none of those rules apply.  And that's 
not just for this case; it will be for every challenge 
25

the tax or the penalty first and then litigate later to 
get it back with interest.  Second, you have to exhaust 
administrative remedies.  Even after you pay the tax, 
you can't immediately go to court.  You have to go to 
the Secretary and give the Secretary at least 6 months 
to see if the matter can be resolved administratively. 
And, third, even in the very carefully defined 
situations in which Congress has permitted a challenge 
to a tax or a penalty before it's paid, the Secretary 
has to make the first move.  The taxpayer is never 
allowed to rush into court before the tax -- before the 
Secretary sends a notice of deficiency to start the 
process.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why will the
 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but courts apply the 

 MR. LONG:  Well, because if the
 

Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply, there's no 

1  to a section 5000A penalty going forward.  The taxpayer 
2  will be able to go to court at any time without 
3  exhausting administrative remedies; there will be none 
4  of the limitations that apply in terms of you have to 
5
6
7  administrative remedies rule not be applicable,
 
8  exhaustion rule not be applicable?
 
9
10
11  prohibition on courts restraining the assessment or 
12  collection of this penalty, and you can simply --
13
14  exhaustion rule.  I mean, I know you've studied this. 
15
16  well, you haven't exhausted your remedies; no 
17  injunction? 
 MR. LONG:  Well, in -- you could do that, I 
18
19  think, as a matter of -- of common law or a judicially 
20
21  all -- I mean, the Anti-Injunction Act is an absolutely 
22  central statute to litigation --
23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  Yes. 
 MR. LONG:  -- about taxes.  And the code 
says -- first it says you must pay the tax first and 

I'm just not following it.  Why couldn't the court say, 

imposed doctrine, but in the code itself, which is 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

of these provisions are extremely specific, with very 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But they would apply 

1  then litigate.  So, that's the baseline.  And then, in 
2  addition, it says you must -- I mean, it's not common 
3  law; it's in the code -- you must apply for a refund, 
4  you must wait at least 6 months.  I mean, that's -- many 
5
6  specific time limits. 
7
8  even if the rule is not jurisdictional.  The only 
9  difference would be that the court could enforce it or 
not enforce it in particular cases, which brings me to 
10
11 
the Davis case, which I think is your biggest hurdle. 
It's a case quite similar to this in which the 
12 
13 
constitutionality of the Social Security Act was at 
issue, and the government waived its right to insist 
14 
upon the application of this Act. 
15
16
17  waive it.  So, are you asking us to overrule the Davis 
18  case? 
19
20
21  Anti-Injunction Act as simply codifying the 
22  pre-statutory equitable principles that usually, but not 
23  always, prohibited a court from enjoining the assessment 
24  or collection of taxes.  So, that understanding, which 
25

decided during a period when this Court interpreted the 

is what was the basis for the Helvering v. Davis 

 Of course, if it's jurisdictional, you can't 

 MR. LONG:  Well, Helvering v. Davis was

1  decision, was rejected by the Court in Williams Packing 
2  and a series of subsequent cases -- Bob Jones.  And so, 
3  I would say, effectively, the Davis case has been 
4  overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court.
5
6  simply follow the statutory language?  I know that 
7  you've argued that the Davis case has been overtaken by 
8  later cases, but the language of the Anti-Injunction Act 
9  is "no suit shall be maintained."  It's remarkably 
10

15
16 
17 
18 
19

22 
23

25

similar to the language in -- that was at issue in Reed 
Elsevier:  "No civil action for infringement ... shall 
be instituted."  And that formulation, "no suit may be 
maintained," contrasts with the Tax Injunction Act.  It 
says the district court shall not enjoin.  That Tax 
Injunction Act is the same pattern as 2283, which says 
"courts of the United States may not stay a proceeding 
in State court."  So, both of those formulas, the TIA 
and the no injunction against proceedings at State 
court, are directed to "court."  The Anti-Injunction 
Act, like the statute at issue in Reed Elsevier, says 
"no suit shall be maintained."  And it has been argued 
that that is suitor-directed in contrast to 
court-directed. 

 MR. LONG:  Right.  Well, I mean, this Court 
has said several times that the Tax Injunction Act was

litigants.  I mean, after all, a case cannot go from

turn on that? 

1  based on the Anti-Injunction Act.  You're quite right, 
2  the language is different; but we submit that the 
3  Anti-Injunction Act itself, by saying that "no suit 
4  shall be maintained," is addressed to courts as well as 
5
6  beginning to end without the active cooperation of the 
7  court. 
8
9  from "no civil action for infringement shall be

11

13  party could initiate an action without the active 
14  cooperation of the court, but to maintain it from 
15
16  cooperation. 
17
 And even if -- I mean, if the Court were 
18  inclined to say as an initial matter, if this statute 
19  were coming before us for the first time today, given 
all of your recent decisions on jurisdiction, that you 
20
21  might be inclined to say this is not a jurisdictional 
22  statute, a lot of water has gone over the dam here.  The 
23  Court has said multiple times that this is a 
24  jurisdictional statute.  Congress has not disturbed 
25

 MR. LONG:  Well, it's -- I mean -- perhaps a 

beginning to end, again, requires the court's 

those decisions.  To the contrary --

 MR. LONG:  There's certainly a number of

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the Court said that 
3  many times, but is there any case in which the result 
4  would have been different if the Anti-Injunction Act 
5
6  viewed as a mandatory claims-processing --
7
8
9
10
11  jurisdictional. 
12
13  them would necessarily have come out differently, 
14  because I don't think we had a case where the argument 
15
16  you know, even -- if it's not jurisdictional, it --
17
18  clearest way of distinguishing between the 
19  jurisdictional provision and a mandatory 
20
21  whether the court feels that it has an obligation to 
22  raise the issue sua sponte. 
 Now, if there are a lot of cases that call 
23
24  it jurisdictional, but none of them would have come out 
25

claims-processing rule is whether it can be waived and 

was, well, you know, the government has waived this, so, 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the clearest -- the 

differently if the Anti-Injunction Act were simply a

 The Court said that there could be a suit if 

 And on the other side, you have Davis, where 

there's no way the government could win and the 

1  mandatory claims-processing rule -- you have that on one 
2  side. 
3
4  the Court accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General; 
the Sunshine Anthracite coal case, where there also was 
5
6  a waiver; and there's the Williams Packing case, which 
7  is somewhat hard to understand as viewing the 
8  Anti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision. 
9
10
11  plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm.  Now, doesn't 
12  that sound like an equitable exception to the 
13  Anti-Injunction Act? 
14
best interpretation of the Court's cases is that it was 
15
16  interpreting a jurisdictional statute.  And, indeed, in 
17  Williams Packing, the Court said it was a jurisdictional 
18  statute. 
19
simply the cases, there's more than that because 
20
21  Congress has not only not disturbed this Court's 
22  decisions stating that the statute is jurisdictional; 
23  they've passed numerous amendments to this 
24  Anti-Injunction Act.

back and forth on whether this is a jurisdictional
 

1  you can't separate those two points.  The idea that

3  you if what we have said is fairly consistent.  And you, 
4  yourself, point out in the brief that we've kind of gone

25

50 years, since the Williams Packing case.  The period 
of inconsistency was after -- the first 50 years, since 
the statute was enacted in 1867, and there was a period, 
as I said, when the Court was allowing extraordinary 
circumstances exceptions and equitable exceptions, but 
then, very quickly, it cut back on that.  And since --
and since Williams Packing, you've been utterly 
consistent --

 MR. LONG:  Well, again, I mean, I think the 

best understanding of South Carolina v. Regan is not 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, even since 

And that case can also be understood as a kind of

Alderson Reporting Company

exception --

the power of the court to hear a case. 

 From all the questions here, I count at 

1  that it's an equitable exception, but it's the Court 
2  interpreting a jurisdictional statute as it would 
3  interpret any statute in light of its purpose, and 
4  deciding in that very special case, it's a very narrow 
5
6
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Long, in Bowles, the 
7  Court looked to the long history of appellate issues as 
8  being jurisdictional in its traditional sense, not as a 
9  claim-processing rule, but as a pure jurisdiction rule, 
10
11
12  least four cases in the Court's history where the Court 
13  has accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General and 
14  reached a tax issue.  I have at least three cases, one 
15
16  exceptions to that rule were read in. 
17
18  define jurisdictional statutes versus claim-processing 
19  statutes in recent times, isn't the fairer statement 
that Congress has accepted that in the extraordinary 
20
21  case, we will hear the case? 
22
23  because in many of these amendments which have come in 
24  the '70s and the '90s and the 2000s, the Congress has 
25

of them just mentioned by Justice Kagan, where 

actually framed the limited exceptions to the 

 Given that history, regardless of how we

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you go back to the

prove that it knows that the court will impose a 

1  Anti-Injunction Act in jurisdictional terms.  And it has 
2  written many of the express exceptions by saying 
3  notwithstanding section 7421 --
4

7  those in which it specifically doesn't want the court

12  of taxes in very limited --
13
14  question that Justice Alito asked?  Assuming we find 
that this is not jurisdictional, what's the parade of 
15
16  horribles that you see occurring if we call this a 
17  mandatory claim-processing rule?  What kinds of cases do 
18  you imagine that courts will reach? 
 MR. LONG:  Right.  Well, first of all, I 
19
think you'd be saying that for the refund statute as 
20
21  well as for the Anti-Injunction Act, which has very 
22  similar wording.  So, if the Anti-Injunction Act is not 
23  jurisdictional, I think that's also going to apply to 
24  the refund statute, the statute that says you have to 
25

first ask for a refund and file, you know, within

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My question was, if we

2  those statutes.  And, you know, we are dealing with 
3  taxes here.  If people can litigate --
4
5
6
7  deem this a mandatory claim-processing rule --
8
9
imagine courts will reach on what grounds?  Assuming the 
10
11  government does its job and comes in and raises the AIA 
12  as an immediate defense --
13
14
15
16
17  class of cases that occurs to me, where, if the 
18  government does not raise it in a timely way, it could 
19  be waived.  I would think plaintiffs would see if there 
20
21  wouldn't immediately be apparent that it --
22
23  competency of the government, which I don't, but what 
24  other types of cases?
25

 MR. LONG:  Well, that --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- what -- where can a 

court then reach the question, despite --

 MR. LONG:  That would certainly be the first 

was some clever way they could get a suit going that

1  you're going to come up with any, but I think your 
2  response is you could say that about any jurisdictional 
3  rule.  If it's not jurisdictional, what's going to 
4  happen is you're going to have an intelligent Federal 
5
6  exception, and there will be no parade of horribles 
7  because all Federal courts are intelligent. 
 (Laughter.) 
8
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, it seems to me it's a 
9
question you can't answer.  It's a question which asks 
10
11  why should there be any jurisdictional rules?  And you 
12  think there should be. 
13
14  honestly, I can't predict what would happen, but I would 
say that not all people who litigate about Federal taxes 
15
16  are necessarily rational.  And I think there would be a 
17  great --

18
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I just don't want to lose 
19
the second half of your argument.  And we've spent all 
20
21  the time so far on jurisdiction.  And I accept pretty 
22  much -- I'm probably leaning in your favor on 
23  jurisdiction, but where I see the problem is in the 
24  second part, because the second part says "restraining 
25

 MR. LONG:  And, Justice Scalia, I mean, 

the assessment or collection of any tax." 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 Now, here, Congress has nowhere used the 

 MR. LONG:  Right. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So, why does it fall within 

 MR. LONG:  Right. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and this is not attached 
to a tax.  It is attached to a health care requirement. 

1
2  word "tax."  What it says is "penalty."  Moreover, this 
3  is not in the Internal Revenue Code but for purposes of 
4  collection.
 And so, why is this a tax?  And I know you 
5
6  point to certain sentences that talk about taxes within 
7  the code --
8
9
10
11
12
13  that word? 
14
 MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, the first point 
is our -- our initial submission is you don't have to 
15
16  determine that this is a tax in order to find that the 
17  Anti-Injunction Act applies, because Congress very 
18  specifically said that it shall be assessed and 
19  collected in the same manner as a tax, even if it's a 
tax penalty and not a tax.  So, that's one argument --
20
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But that doesn't mean the 
22  AIA applies.  I mean -- and then they provide some 
23  exceptions, but it doesn't mean the AIA applies. 
24
25

 It says "in the same manner as."  It is then 
attached to chapter 68, when that -- it references that 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

revenue sources.  And here, an advance attack on this 

1  as being "the manner of."  Well, that it's being applied 
2  or if it's being collected in the same manner as a tax 
3  doesn't automatically make it a tax, particularly since 
4  the reasons for the AIA are to prevent interference with 
5
6  does not interfere with the collection of revenues. 
7
 I mean, that's -- you've read the arguments, 
8  as have I.  But I'd like to know what you say succinctly 
9  in response to those arguments.
 MR. LONG:  So, specifically on the argument 
10
11  that it is actually a tax, even setting aside the point 
12  that it should be assessed and collected in the same 
13  manner as a tax, the Anti-Injunction Act uses the term 
14  "tax"; it doesn't define it.  Somewhat to my surprise, 
"tax" is not defined anywhere in the Internal Revenue 
15
16  Code.  In about the time that Congress passed the 
17  Anti-Injunction Act, "tax" had a very broad definition. 
18  It's broad enough to include this exaction, which is 
19  codified in the Internal Revenue Code.  It's part of the 
taxpayer's annual income tax return.  The amount of the 
20
21  liability and whether you owe the liability is based in 
22  part on your income.  It's assessed and collected by the 
23  IRS.

And --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Long, you said 

clear.  Whatever else it is, it's easy to think that 

1  said, and I thought that we had a -- a principle that 
2  ousters of jurisdiction are narrowly construed; that, 
3  unless it's clear, courts are not deprived of 
4  jurisdiction.  And I find it hard to think that this is 
5
6  it's not clear. 
7
8  Act applies not only to every tax in the code but, as 
9  far as I can tell, to every tax penalty in the code. 
10
11
12  before -- and I think you were quite right -- that the 
13  Tax Injunction Act is modeled on the Anti-Injunction 
14  Act.  And, under the Tax Injunction Act, what -- what 
can't be enjoined is an assessment for the purpose of 
15
16  raising revenue.  The Tax Injunction Act does not apply 
17  to penalties that are designed to induce compliance with 
18  the law, rather than to raise revenue.  And this is not 
19  a revenue-raising measure because, if it's successful, 
they -- nobody will pay the penalty, and there will be 
20
21  no revenue to raise. 
22
23  said that they had gotten out of the business of trying 
24  to determine whether an exaction is primarily 
25

revenue-raising or primarily regulatory.  And this one 

 MR. LONG:  Well, in Bob Jones, the Court

 MR. LONG:  That's -- that's absolutely

2  substantial amounts of revenues, at least $4 billion a 
3  year by the --

 MR. LONG:  That's -- yes. 
7
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Here we have one where 
8  the Congress is not denominating it a -- as a tax; it's 
9  denominating it as a penalty.
10
11  right, and that's obviously why -- if it were called a 
12  tax, there would be absolutely no question that the 
13  Anti-Injunction Act applies. 
14
15
16  the one following 7421, the AIA, it does very clearly 
17  make a difference -- 7422 -- make a difference between 
18  tax and penalties.  It's very explicit.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The best collection I've 
22
23  found in your favor, I think, is in Mortimer Caplin's 
24  brief on page 16, 17.  He has a whole list.  All right? 
So -- I let my law clerk to look all those up.  And it 
25

 MR. LONG:  Yes, that's -- it does; that is 
correct.  And there are many other places in the code 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Absolutely.  But even 

the section of the code that you referred to previously, 

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

in some instances, they were deemed by the code to be 

addition, the underlying AIA reason, which is to say to 
the Solicitor General:  We don't care what you think; 
we, in Congress, don't want you in court where the 
revenue of a State -- Tax Injunction Act -- or the 
revenue of the Federal Government is at stake, and, 
therefore, you can't waive it. 

1  seems to me that they all fall into the categories of 
2  either, one, these are penalties that were penalties 
3  assessed for not paying taxes; or, two, they involve 
4  matters that were called by the court taxes; or, three, 
5
6  taxes. 
7
 Now, what we have here is something that's 
8  in a different statute that doesn't use the word "tax" 
9  once, except for a collection device and, in fact, in 
10
11 
12 
13 
14

17  and here there are all the differences I just mentioned. 
18  So, I ask that because I want to hear your response. 
19
20
21  say are related in any -- in any close way to some other 
22  tax provision.  There's a penalty -- it's discussed in 
23  the briefs -- for selling diesel fuel that doesn't 
24  comply with EPA's regulations, you know.  So, there are 
all kinds of penalties in the code, and I think it's --
25

 Now, I got that.  Here it's not at stake, 

 MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, there are penalties 

in the Internal Revenue Code that you really couldn't

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Long, aren't there 

1  that it's reliable. 
2
3  places in this Act -- fees and penalties -- that were 
4  specifically put under the Anti-Injunction Act?  There's 
one on health care plans, there's one on pharmaceutical 
5
6  manufacturers, where Congress specifically said the 
7  Anti-Injunction Act is triggered for those.  It does not 
8  say that here.  Wouldn't that suggest that Congress 
9  meant for a different result to obtain?
10
11  the language the Anti-Injunction Act "shall apply" --
12
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but it -- in section 
13  9008 and in section 9010, it specifically referred --
14
15
16  where the Anti-Injunction Act is. 
17
18  lots of administration and procedure provisions, but 
19  those are fees, and they're not -- Congress did not 
provide, you know, in the sections themselves that they 
20
21  should be paid as part of a tax return.  So, they were 
22  free-standing fees.  And by using that subtitle F 
23  language, Congress plugged in a whole set of rules for 
24  how to collect and administer the fees, and it went not 
25

 MR. LONG:  Right.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- to the part of the code 

just to assessment and collection -- and the IRS has

 And, yes, I grant you, you could look at 

 So, I think it would be a mistake to look at 

want the Anti-Injunction Act to apply.  They're actually 

1  recognized this -- but to examination, privacy, a whole 
2  series of additional things. 
3
4  that language and say, oh, here's Congress saying they 
5
6  doing more than that. 
7
8  section 5000A, the individual coverage requirement, and 
9  say, well, they could have been clearer about saying the 
Anti-Injunction Act applied.  And that's certainly true, 
10
11 
but, again, they were trying to accomplish a lot.  And 
12 
it's --
13
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's easier to talk about 
14  this case if we just forget the words "for the purpose 
of restraining assessment or collection."  In a sense, 
15
16  that brings the jurisdictional question and 
17  Justice Breyer's question together. 
 It seems to me -- maybe you could just 
18
19  comment on that language.  Is that sort of language 
usually contained in a jurisdictional provision?  I 
20
21  mean, you often don't know the purpose of a suit until 
22  after the thing is under way.  I can see it with 
23  malicious prosecution and some civil rights cases.  Does 
24  it strike you as somewhat unusual to have this provision 
25

in a jurisdictional sense? 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Long, there's another 

challenging the must-buy provision, and the argument is 

essentially unchanged since 1867, and it -- you know, I 

 MR. LONG:  It does strike me, honestly --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  Excuse me. 
 MR. LONG:  -- as a bit unusual, but this is 

1
2
3
4  an old statute.  I mean, this -- the core language is 
5
6  think that's part of the explanation for it.  And, 
7  again, it's, you know, become the center of a series of 
8  provisions that very carefully control the circumstances 
9  in which litigation about Federal taxes can take place.
10
11  argument that has been made that I would like you to 
12  address, and that is all this talk about tax penalty --
13  it's all beside the point because this suit is not 
14  challenging the penalty.  This is a suit that is 
15
16  made that, if, indeed, "must-buy" is constitutional, 
17  then these complainants will not resist the penalty. 
 So, what they're seeking is a determination 
18
19  that the "must-buy" requirement, stated separately from 
the penalty, that the "must-buy" is unconstitutional. 
20
21  And, if that's so, that's the end of the case; if it's 
22  not so, they're not resisting the penalty. 
23
24  doesn't work for two reasons.  I mean, first, if you 
look at the plaintiffs' own complaint, they clearly 
25

 MR. LONG:  Well, I think that argument 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. LONG:  Well -- and -- yes, I mean, it's 

1  challenge both the minimum coverage requirement and the 
2  penalty.  At page 122 of the Joint Appendix, they 
3  challenge the requirement that the individuals obtain 
4  health care coverage or pay a penalty.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why is that? 
5
6
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If that's -- if that's 
7  the problem, it's easy to amend a complaint.  They can 
8  just take that out of the complaint.  So, it can't turn 
9  on that.
10
11  -- or another complaint would be filed, but, still, I 
12  think that's a serious problem.  But even if they had 
13  filed a different complaint, I don't think you -- in 
14  this case, I don't think you can separate the minimum 
coverage requirement from the penalty, because the 
15
16  penalty is the sole means of enforcing the minimum 
17  coverage requirement. 
18
19  would not be satisfied if the Court were to render a 
judgment saying the minimum coverage requirement is 
20
21  invalidated; the penalty, however, remains standing. 
22  Anybody who doesn't have insurance has to pay the 
23  penalty.  Then they'd have to pay a penalty equal to the 
24  cost of insurance and they wouldn't even have insurance. 
25

 So, first, I mean, I think these plaintiffs 

So, I don't think that would be --

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. LONG:  Right. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- and they say that your 

don't see a statement that they will, you know, never 
incur a penalty under any circumstances.  But -- but 
even if that were so, what this Court has said in 
Americans United is the Anti-Injunction Act bars any 
suit, not just to enjoin the collection of your own 
taxes, but to enjoin the collection of anyone's taxes. 

1
2  obey the law --
3

argument puts them in the position of having to disobey 
5
6  the law in order to obtain review of their claim.  And 
7  what is your answer to that? 
8
9  can't find that in the record, in their declarations.  I 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  these plaintiffs were not interested in the penalty and 
18  would never pay the penalty, if they were to succeed in 
19  this case in striking down the minimum coverage 
20
21  penalty would fall as well, because the government 
22  couldn't collect a penalty for failing to follow an 
23  unconstitutional requirement.  And so, it would still be 
24  barred because it would be a suit that would prevent the 
25

requirement, the inevitable result would be that the

 MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, this Court in the 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me take us back to 

1
2  Justice Kennedy's question about the "for the purpose 
3  of" language.  I take it you interpret the statute to 
4  mean the following:  "For the purpose of" means having 
5
6
7  Bob Jones case, where a similar kind of argument was 
8  being made by the plaintiff in that case, said, you 
9  know, look, you know, where the -- where it's inevitable 
that this is what the suit is about, they're sort of two 
10
11 
sides of the same coin, that clearly is a primary 
purpose of the suit.  And it's -- and you can't by 
12 
13 
clever pleading get away from that.  That's just the 
nature of the situation.
14 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Long, aren't you 
15
16  trying to rewrite the statute, in a way?  The statute 
17  has two sections.  One is the "you have to have 
18  insurance" section and the other is the sanction.  The 
19  statute has two different sets of exceptions 
20
21  trying to suggest that the statute says, well, it's your 
22  choice, either buy insurance or pay a -- or pay a fee. 
 But that's not the way the statute reads. 
23
24  And Congress, it must be supposed, you know, made a 
decision that that shouldn't be the way the statute 
25

corresponding to those two different sections.  You're 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. LONG:  Well, I would not argue that this 

 And the reason I say that, if you look at 

1  reads, that it should instead be a regulatory command 
2  and a penalty attached to that command. 
3
4  statute is a perfect model of clarity, but I do think 
the most reasonable way to read the entire statute is 
5
6  that it does impose a single obligation to pay a penalty 
7  if you are an applicable individual and you're not 
8  subject to an exemption. 
9
the exemptions from the penalty, I mean, the very first 
10
11  one is you're exempt from the penalty because you can't 
12  afford to purchase insurance.  And it just doesn't seem 
13  reasonable to me to interpret the statute as Congress 
14  having said, well, you know, this person is exempt from 
15
16  buy insurance; however, they still have a legal 
17  obligation to buy insurance.  That just doesn't seem 
18  reasonable. 
19
20
21  understand the statute as a whole. 
 But, again, I would say, you know, that's 
22
23  not essential to the question we're discussing now, of 
24  whether the Anti-Injunction Act applies.  Again, you 
25

wouldn't argue it's clear, that that's the best way to 

paying a penalty because we find they can't afford to 

 So, I do think, although it's -- I certainly 

know, I think --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That it is a 

 MR. LONG:  Right.  Well, I mean, I think the 

 MR. LONG:  Well, in going back to -- so if, 
so if the result were to say simply, this is not -- oh, 

1
2  you think the Solicitor General's reading creates a 
3  problem?  He --
4
5
6  I'm sorry.  The Solicitor General's reading.  So, now 
7  it's not --
8
9  jurisdictional bar, but there's an exemption for those 
items that Congress has designated solely as penalties 
10
11 
that are not like taxes. 
12
13  Solicitor General's reading would probably create the 
14  fewest problems, as I understand it.  I mean, my -- my 
main objection to the Solicitor General's reading is I 
15
16  don't think it makes a whole lot of sense.  I mean, 
17  basically, the Solicitor General says every penalty in 
18  the Internal Revenue Code, every other penalty in the 
19  Affordable Care Act is --
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

carrying it too far, because he says if a penalty is 
designated as a tax by Congress, then it's subject to 
the AIA, and that's most of the code, the tax code.  And 
he says for those portions of the Affordable Care Act 
that designate things as taxes, the AIA applies.  So, 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh that's not -- that's 

29

the AIA. 

 MR. LONG:  Right.  Right. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And not indicated that 

 MR. LONG:  Right. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They don't fall within 

1  it's only -- and I haven't found another statute.  I'm 
2  going to ask him if there's another one.  It's only for 
3  those statutes in which Congress has designated 
4  something solely as a penalty.
5
6
7  it is a tax. 
8
9
10
11
 MR. LONG:  I think my -- my take on it is if 
12  you adopted the Solicitor General's approach, there are 
13  probably three penalties for alcohol- and 
14  tobacco-related offenses at 5114(c), 5684, and 5761 that 
I think would be very difficult to distinguish from this 
15
16  one, and possibly the 527(j) penalty for failure to

4  the Anti-Injunction Act is a jurisdictional limit that 
5
6  an exceedingly strong interest in protecting the

14  Revenue Code.  But for purposes of the Anti-Injunction 
15
16  determinative.  And there is no language in the

23  Tomorrow you're going to be back and you'll be arguing

well as its commerce power. 

 Congress has authority under the taxing 

Act, the precise language Congress used is 

instruction that --

something can be a constitutional exercise of the taxing 

1  is a tax for purposes of the taxing power under the 
2  Constitution is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act? 
3
4  the Court has held in the license tax cases that 
5
6  power whether or not it is called a tax.  And that's 
7  because the nature of the inquiry that we will conduct 
8  tomorrow is different from the nature of the inquiry 
9  that we will conduct today.
 Tomorrow, the question is whether Congress 
10
11  has the authority under the taxing power to enact it, 
12  and the form of words doesn't have a dispositive effect 
13  on that analysis.  Today, we're construing statutory 
14  text where the precise choice of words does have a

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, General, you also 
17  have the Bailey child labor tax cases, 'cause there the 
18  Court said that the tax, which was a prohibitory tax

was beyond the Court's taxing power in a separate case,

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  But on the same day --

1  think their argument on the constitutionality under the 
2  taxing power is essentially that the Affordable Care Act 
3  provision is the same thing as the provision that was 
4  held unconstitutional in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a different 
5
6  issue.  The question Justice --
7
8  right, but on the same day as Bailey v. Drexel 
9  Furniture, the Court issued Bailey v. George, which held 
that the Anti-Injunction Act did bar a challenge to that 
10
11 
provision, even though the Court had concluded that it 
12 
was invalid under the tax power. 
13
14  been -- is clear now after Williams Packing and Bob 
15
16  Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply to something that 
17  otherwise would be a tax that triggers it, you have to 
18  conclude essentially that there's no substantial 
19  argument that can be made in defense of it as a tax.  We 
20

22  it, as the amicus suggest it should be read, on that 
23  theory, but --

question about your argument:  If you're right about the 

don't have that here.  So, I don't think you can get

Jones, in that, in order to find that the 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Verrilli, a basic 

33

does involve a tax, is jurisdictional? 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  I apologize if I'm 

applying here.  From the perspective of the United 
States -- and if I could, I'd like to take a minute on 
this -- the idea that the Anti-Injunction Act would be 
construed as not being a jurisdictional provision is 
very troubling, and we don't think it's correct.

1  second part, that is, for purposes of the statute, the 
2  Anti-Injunction statute, this penalty does not 
3  constitute a tax, then does the Court need to decide 
4  whether the Anti-Injunction Act in other cases, where it

16  question, Justice Ginsburg, that you asked Mr. Long in 
17  terms of the language of the Anti-Injunction Act, 
18  7421(a), which can be found at page 16a of the appendix 
19  to our brief.
20
21  language of the very next provision in the code, which 
22  is on the next page of our statutory appendix, 17a,

24  little bit so far this morning, 7422(a).

Official 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right.  But I --

 The language in 7422(a) is virtually 

identical to the language in 7421(a) --

1  was jurisdictional, and the Court in both Dolan and 
2  Brockamp held that the statute of limitations that 
3  applies to the refund statute cases is jurisdictional. 
4
5
6
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That is correct, although 
7  in the refund context, you have the sovereign immunity 
8  problem, in which we presume that that has not been 
9  waived.
10

18  were the same statutory provision.

19
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  They were only separated 
20
21  out later.  So, I do think that's the strongest textual 
22  indication, Justice Ginsburg, that -- that 7421(a) is 
23  jurisdictional.

 I'd like you to comment on that.  It's not 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think there are two 

problems.  One is the problem that Justice Scalia 

would seem to me that there might be some instances in 

1  But -- and you began your argument by saying it would be 
2  very troubling to say that it's not jurisdictional. 
3
4  for us to tell a party what's in its best interests.  It 
5
6  which the government would want to litigate the validity 
7  of a tax right away and would want to waive.  But you 
8  say it's -- that's not true; that it's very troubling. 
9
10
11  identified, that if it's not jurisdictional, then courts 
12  have authority to craft equitable exceptions.  And it 
13  may seem from where we stand now that that authority is 
14  or could be very, very tightly cabined.  But if -- if 
15
16  jurisdictional, that does empower courts to find other 
17  circumstances in which they might find it equitable to 
18  allow cases to go forward in the absence of -- despite 
19  the existence of the Anti-Injunction Act.
20
21  going to stand up here and disparage the attorneys for 
22  the United States in the slightest, the reality is that 
23  if this isn't jurisdictional, then it's -- the argument 
24  -- it's open to the argument that it's subject to

1  in an answer.  And that -- and that's a troubling
 
2  prospect.
 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, can I ask --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How likely is it --
4
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Ginsburg.
 
5
6
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How likely is it -- I
 
7  mean, the government is going to be defending these
 
8  suits.  How likely is it that the government will
 
9  overlook the Anti-Injunction Act?  So, it seems to me
 
10
11 
12
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's -- that is not our 
13  assessment of the institutional interests of the United 
14  States, Justice Ginsburg.  And we do think that the --
the right way to go in this case is to read the statute 
15
16  as not applying to the minimum coverage provision of --
17  of the Affordable Care Act. 
18

24  done if it were jurisdictional.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It was -- it was the 

your predecessor made in the Davis case. 

 There, the Solicitor General exercised

1  Mr. Chief Justice.  Several points about that, though. 
2
 We do agree with Mr. Long's analysis that 
3  Davis occurred in -- during a time in -- in which under 
4  the Standard Nut case, the Court had interpreted the 
5
6  traditional equitable principles which allowed courts 
7  discretion to conclude that in certain circumstances, a 
8  case could go forward. 
 Williams Packing repudiated that analysis, 
9
and Bob Jones v. Simon again repudiated that analysis 
10
11  and said, no, we're no longer abiding by that.  It is 
12  true that the Davis case has not formally been 
13  overruled, but we do think it's fundamentally 
14  inconsistent with the Court's understanding now of --

24  don't pay it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't want to let that

3
4  Justice Breyer, the United States did intervene in the 
-- in the Davis case and was a party, and so -- not as 
5
6  far as I'd like, I guess, is the answer. 
7
8  I think that goes too far.  I don't think that's 
9  restraining the collection of the tax.  It's restraining

13  bone go, right? 
14
 (Laughter.)
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Our view here is that it 
15
16  is jurisdictional.  Because it's jurisdictional as this 
17  Court understands jurisdiction now, it's not waivable. 
18  And, therefore, we don't think that -- that that part of 
19  the Davis decision is good law.
20
21  Reed Elsevier?  Justice Ginsburg suggested that the 
22  language was very similar in Reed Elsevier as it is 
23  here, but there are even further similarities.  Reed 
24  Elsevier pointed out that the provision in question 
25

wasn't in Title 28.  Here, too, it's not in Title 28. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, can I ask you about 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 In Reed Elsevier, the question was 

 So, Reed Elsevier seems in multiple respects 

1  In Reed Elsevier, it was pointed out that the provision 
2  there had numerous exceptions to it.  Here, too, there 
3  are numerous exceptions that we find that have been 
4  created by the courts over the years.
5
6  essentially one about timing.  Come to court after you 
7  file your registration.  Here, too, the question is one 
8  about timing.  Come to court after you make -- after you 
9  pay your taxes.
10
11  on all fours with this case. 
12
 Why is that wrong? 
13
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't think so, Justice 
14  Kagan.  First, we think -- I guess I'm repeating myself 
and I apologize.  But we think the closest analogue is 
15
16  the very next provision in the United States Code, 
17  7422(a), which this Court has held is jurisdictional, 
18  and is phrased in exactly the same way as 7421(a).  In 
19  fact, as I said, they were the same provision back in 
20
21
22  a statute that says do something first.  But this 
23  statute is just a flat-out command that no suit shall be 
24  maintained to restrain --
25

the earlier days.  That's the closest analogue. 

 This isn't -- and it's actually 7422 that's 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I take the point --

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- the assessment or 

do you think it's different, at all? 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, because the -- I 

that 7422 and 7421 function together to protect an 
exceedingly strong interest that the Court has held with 
respect to 7422, sufficiently strong that it explains 
the jurisdictional nature of that.  The same interest 
applies here.

1
2  collection. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- but if you would comment 
3
4  on the similarities of Reed Elsevier to this case.  How 
5
6
7  think the best answer to that is that there are no magic 
8  words, and that history and context matter, as the Court 
9  said in Henderson.  And the history and context here is

12 
13 
14

16  you can -- and then you can come to court.  It's just a 
17  fundamentally different set of interests at stake. 
 So, we do think that that makes a big 
18
19  difference.  And --
20
21  Elsevier -- if you're dividing jurisdiction from claims 
22  processing -- it says you have to register before you 
23  can sue.  There are a lot of things you have to do 
24  before you can sue.  So, why isn't Reed Elsevier like

 And one way I think it's helpful to get at 

as a jurisdictional provision. 

 Again, if the Court agrees with our 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  It is -- we do think it's 

1  complaint? 
2
3  very much in that nature and different from this case, 
4  Your Honor.
5
6  this is to look at the history.  We've cited a string of 
7  court of appeals cases in a footnote in our opening 
8  brief, and over time, it's been very consistent that the 
9  courts of appeals have treated the Anti-Injunction Act 
10
11
12  statutory construction, we don't need to reach this 
13  issue.  But they have -- in fact, one of those cases, 
14  the Hansen case, the district court in that case had 
dismissed the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil 
15
16  Procedure 12(b)(6).  The court of appeals vacated and 
17  sent it back with instructions to dismiss under 
18  12(b)(1), which is the subject-matter jurisdiction 
19  provision.
20
21  issue is before the Court, it is jurisdictional, but it 
22  doesn't need to be before the Court because of the 
23  statutory construction argument that we had offered.

 So, I do think that, to the extent this

 The ones that we've identified -- I may be

5
6  that fall outside of subchapter B of chapter 68 and,
 
7  therefore, wouldn't be governed by the instruction in
 
8  section 6671(a), which answers the question about the
 
9  applicability of the Act for most penalties.

10
11  overlapping a little bit with Mr. Long here -- one is 26

14 
15
16 
17
18  of minutes about the argument that was discussed as to 
19  whether this can be conceived of as a suit just 
challenging the requirement, which is entirely 
20
21  stand-alone based on inferences drawn from the 
22  exemptions, I really don't think that's right.  And if I 
23  could spend a minute on it, I think it's important. 
24
 The exemptions in section 5000A -- it is 
25

only consequence that ensues is the tax penalty.  And 
the -- we have made a representation, and it was a 
carefully made representation, in our brief that it is 
the interpretation of the agencies charged with 
interpreting this statute, the Treasury Department and 
the Department of Health and Human Services, that there 
is no other consequence apart from the tax penalty. 

 And I do think, if I could talk for a couple 

true that there are two categories of exemptions.  There 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

they are -- they both function as exceptions to the 

11a of the appendix to our brief.  It provides that a 
person can go to the Secretary of HHS and obtain a 
hardship exemption for -- which would, as a formal 
matter here, excuse compliance with the penalty. 

1  are exemptions to the penalty and exemptions to the 
2  subsection (a) requirement.  But the -- but I think, not 
3  only as a practical matter, but I think there's a 
4  textual indication and even as a legal matter, 
5
6  requirement. 
7
 First, as a practical matter, one of those 
8  exemptions is a hardship exemption.  And if the Court 
9  will just bear with me for one minute here, it's at page

12

15
16  United States and obtained an exemption would, 
17  nonetheless, be in the position of being a law breaker. 
 We think another way in which you can get to 
18
19  the same conclusion slightly differently is by 
20
21  is 5000A -- 5000A(e)(3), members of Indian tribes. 
22  Members of Indian tribes are exempt only from the 
23  penalty as a formal matter under the structure of the 
24  statute here, but the reason for that is because members 
25

considering the provision on the prior page, 10a, which 

 It seems to me to make very little sense to 

say that someone who has gone to an official of the 

of Indian tribes obtain their health care through the 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 They were taken out of this statute because 
they get their health care through a different system. 

1  Indian Health Service, which is a clinic-based system 
2  that doesn't involve insurance at all, and it's an 
3  entirely different system. 
4
5
6  And it doesn't make any sense to think that persons 
7  getting their health care through the Indian Health 
8  Service are violating the law because -- because exempt 
9  only from the penalty but still under a legal obligation 
to have insurance, when the whole point of this is that 
10
11  they're supposed to be in a clinic-based system. 
12
13  this was inartful drafting by Congress, that, to the 
14  extent that there is an exemption under the penalty, 
15
16
17  about it, Your Honor, is that the way in which this 
18  statute is drafted doesn't permit the inference that my 
19  friends from the NFIB are trying to draw from it.
20
21  indication of that, which one can find at page 13 of our 
22  reply brief.  This is a provision that is 42 U.S.C.A. 
23  section 18022(e).  This is a provision that provides for 
24  a certification that certain individuals can get.  And 
25

this is the paragraph starting with the words "Other 

 And there is an additional textual 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is your whole point that 

it's an exemption from the legal obligation? 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I guess what I would say

 And it says, "an individual with a 

1  provisions" contains the quote. 
2
3  'certification' ... that the individual is exempt from 
4  the requirement under Section 5000A ... by reason of 
section 5000A(e)(1) of such Code," is entitled to a 
5
6  certificate that allows for enrollment in a particular 
7  program for this category of people. 
 But you can see here, Congress is saying an 
8
9  exemption under 5000A(e)(1), which is the exemption from 
the penalty, and not the underlying requirement, is, as 
10
11 
Congress says, an exemption from the requirement of 
12 
section 5000A. 
13
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  General --
14
 JUSTICE ALITO:  5000A says, directly, "an 
applicable individual shall ensure that the individual 
15
16  has the minimum essential coverage."  And you're saying 
17  it doesn't really mean that, that if you're not subject 
18  to the penalty, you're not under an obligation to 
19  maintain the minimum essential coverage.
20
21  think that's what Congress is saying, both in the 
22  provision I just pointed to, Your Honor, and by virtue 
23  of the fact -- by virtue of the way the exemptions work. 
24  I just think that's the -- reading this in context, that

 So, while you're right, the texts in Bowles

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, prevent the

7  penalty or tax just doesn't seem to make much sense.

12
13
14  nothing behind the command -- it's sort of, well, what 
happens if you don't follow the mandate, and the answer

18
19  nothing, but even assuming it were nothing, it seems to 
me there is a difference between what the law requires

21  and what enforcement consequences happen to you.  This

 Congress then separated out mandate 

general exhortation, and it's backed up by a penalty. 

Congress is saying you need not follow this law.  It 
then defined a separate category of people not subject 
to the penalty, but subject to the mandate.  I don't 
know what that could mean other than --

1  than 20 times, 3 times in the operative text and 17 
2  times in the findings.  It's imposed through use of a 
3  mandatory verb "shall."  The requirement is very well 
4  defined in the statute, so it can't be sloughed off as a 
5
6
7  exceptions from penalty exceptions.  It defined one 
8  category of people not subject to the mandate.  One 
9  would think those are the category of people as to whom

12

14
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why would you 
have a requirement that is completely toothless?  Pay --
15
16  you know, buy insurance or else.  Or else what?  Or else 
17  nothing. 
 MR. KATSAS:  Because Congress reasonably 
18
19  could think that at least some people will follow the 
law precisely because it is the law.  And let me give 
20
21  you an example of one category of person that might be: 
22  The very poor, who are exempt from the penalty but 
23  subject to the mandate. 
24
25

 Mr. Long says this must be a mandate 

exemption because it would be wholly harsh and 

67
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 That gets things exactly backwards.  The 

very poor are the people Congress would be most 

1  unreasonable for Congress to expect people who are very 
2  poor to comply with a requirement to obtain health 
3  insurance when they have no means of doing so.

6  concerned about with respect to the mandate to the 
7  extent one of the justifications for the mandate is to 
8  prevent emergency room cost shifting when people receive 
9  uncompensated care.  So, they would have had very good 
reason to make the very poor subject to the mandate, and 
10
11  then they didn't do it in a draconian way; they gave the 
12  very poor a means of complying with the insurance 
13  mandate, and that is through the Medicaid system. 
14
15
16  the penalty would have standing? 
17

1  of an unwanted good.  It's a classic pocketbook injury. 
2
 But even if I'm wrong about that question, 
3  Justice Kagan, the question of who has standing to bring 
4  the challenge that we seek to bring seems to me very 
5
6  different from the actual plaintiffs.  We have 
7  individuals who are planning for compliance in order to 
8  avoid a penalty, which is what their affidavits say. 
9  And we have the States, who will be subject no doubt to 
10
11 
12 
13
14  consequences in the case.
 And then, we have the separate distinction 
15
16  between the question of who has Article III standing in 
17  order to maintain a suit and the question of who is 
18  subject to a legal obligation.  And you've said in your 
19  cases that even if there may be no one who has standing 
to challenge a legal obligation like the incompatibility 
20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why would somebody not 
choose to obtain it?  Why -- that's one puzzle to me. 
There's this category of people who are Medicaid 
eligible; Medicaid doesn't cost them anything.  Why 
would they resist enrolling?

1  who could show up tomorrow with or without this law 
2  will show up in greater numbers.  I mean, presumably the 
3  State wants to cover people whom it is declared eligible 
4  for this benefit.
5
6  What the State wants to do is make Medicaid available to 
7  all who are eligible and choose to obtain it.

 MR. KATSAS:  I -- I don't know, Justice 
15
16  Ginsburg.  All I know is that the difference between 
17  current enrollees and people who could enroll but have 
18  not is, as I said, on the -- is a $600 million delta. 
19  And --
20
21 
22 
 MR. KATSAS:  It's possible, but all we're 
23
24  talking about right now is the standing of the States. 
And the only arguments made against the standing of the 
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it may be just that 

they haven't been given sufficient information to 
understand that this is a benefit for them.

 The second argument made against the States' 

standing is that the States somehow forfeit their 

the third-party actions are not unfettered in the sense 

1  States -- I mean, there is a classic pocketbook injury 
2  here.  The only arguments made about -- against the 
3  standing of the States are, number one, this results 
4  from third-party actions.  That doesn't work, because 
5
6  of Lujan; they are coerced in the sense of 
7  Bennett v. Spear.  Those people are enrolling because 
8  they're under a legal obligation to do so. 
9
10
11  ability to challenge the constitutionality of a 
12  provision of Federal law because they voluntarily choose 
13  to participate --
14
15
16  there's a challenge to the individual mandate. 
 MR. KATSAS:  Yes. 
17
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  What does 
18
19  the fact that the State is challenging Medicaid -- how 
20
21  obligation that is not imposed on the State in any way? 
22
 MR. KATSAS:  The principal theory for State 
23  standing is that States are challenging the mandate 
24  because the mandate injures them when people are forced 
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm -- I'm a little bit 
confused, and this is what I'm confused about:  There --

does it give the State standing to challenge an 

to enroll in Medicaid.

 Now, it is true they are not directly 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.  That's what I'm --

 MR. KATSAS:  In South Carolina v. Regan, the

11  State was not subject to the tax at issue.  The State 
12  was harmed as the issuer of the bonds, and the bond 
13  holders were the ones subject to the tax.  So, the State 
14  is injured not because it is the direct object of the 
15

 AS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE

 And I would simply ask, if you look at 

1  same manner as taxes.  And the parties' principal 
2  argument why that does not make the Anti-Injunction Act 
3  applicable is that, well, that simply goes to the 
4  Secretary's activities.
5
6  chapters 63 and 64 of the Internal Revenue Code, which 
7  are the chapters on assessment and collection, they are 
8  not just addressed to the Secretary.  There are many 
9  provisions in there that are addressed to courts and 
indeed talk about this interaction, the very limited 
10
11 
situations in which courts are permitted to restrain the 
12 
assessment and collection of taxes. 
13
14  aren't -- and many of the exceptions to the 
15
16  provisions -- there was a statement made that none of 
17  these directly confer jurisdiction to restrain the 
18  assessment and collection of taxes.  That's not true. 
19  In footnote 11 of our opening brief, we cite several.
20
21  example.  That says -- I quote:  "Notwithstanding the 
22  provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such 
23  assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy 
24  during the time such prohibition is in force may be 
25

Anti-Injunction Act are in the assessment and collection 

 There was a statement made that there 

 I'll simply mention section 6213 as an 

enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including 

74

then only in respect of the deficiency that is the 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All that's going to really 

and it's certainly an argument in your favor. 

 The over-arching thing in my mind is it's up 

1  the Tax Court.  The Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction 
2  to enjoin any action or proceeding or order any refund 
3  under this subsection unless a timely petition for 
4  redetermination of the deficiency has been filed and 
5
6  subject of such petition." 
7
8  what I'd think Congress's intent was meant to be in 
9  sticking the collection thing into chapter 68, and --
10
11
12  to Congress, within leeway.  And they did not use that 
13  word "tax," and they did have a couple of exceptions. 
14  And it is true that all this language that you quote --
15
16  about the use of "tax" in the IRC.  It talks about the 
17  penalties and liabilities provided by this subchapter. 
18  And we look over here, and it's a penalty and liability 
19  provided by a different law, which says collect it 
20
21  the IRC.  See? 
22
23  can see pretty clearly what they're trying to do.  They 
24  couldn't really care very much about interfering with 
25

you know, the first two sentences and so forth, it talks 

collecting this one.  That's all the statutory argument. 

through the subchapter.  And it has nothing to do with 

 So, we've got it in a separate place.  We

making. 

 MR. LONG:  I mean, I think I'm following 

assessed and collected in the same manner --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, it is. 
 MR. LONG:  -- as a penalty in that 

 Are you following me? 
 MR. LONG:  Well, I --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  You see?  I'm trying to get 

1
2
3
4  you to focus on that kind of argument that I'm just 
5
6
7  you, but the fact that it's not in the particular 
8  subchapter for assessable penalties in my view makes no 
9  difference, because they said it's still clearly -- it's 
10
11
12
13  subchapter, and those penalties are collected in the 
14  same manner as taxes.
15
16
17  rather detailed, but I think it's a rather clear 
18  indication that the Anti-Injunction Act applies. 
 The -- the refund statute that does 
19
specifically refer to penalties -- that has nothing to 
20
21  do with this argument that it's assessed and collected 
22  in the same manner as a tax.  That would simply go to 
23  the point that, well, you can't just call it a tax, 
24  because they've referred to it as a penalty.
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes. 
 MR. LONG:  And so, that's -- I think it's 

 And, finally, on jurisdiction, you know, I 

76
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  think the key point is we have a long line of this 
2  Court's decisions that's really been ratified by 
3  Congress, with all these exceptions in jurisdictional 
4  terms.
 As I read Bowles and John R. Sand & Gravel, 
5
6  the gist of those decisions was not any sort of special 
7  rule about appeals, It's that when we have that 
8  situation, which I would submit applies as much to the 
9  collection of Federal taxes as it does to appeals from 
Federal district courts when we have this degree of --
10
11 
of precedent, including precedent from Congress in the 
form of amendments to this Anti-Injunction Act, that 
12 
13 
should be -- the presumption should be that this is 
jurisdictional.

18  Anti-Injunction Act barred this litigation.  You have
