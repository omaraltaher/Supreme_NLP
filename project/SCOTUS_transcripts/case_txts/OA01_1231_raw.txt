CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 10-1 -- 1231, the Connecticut Department of


Public Safety versus John Doe.


General Blumenthal.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BLUMENTHAL


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,


and may it please the Court:


This case, like Alaska's, is about fully


accurate, concededly true public record information about


convicted sex offenders that citizens of Connecticut and


the 50 other States need and deserve -- indeed, they


demand be made available and accessible -- so they can 

make choices about how to protect themselves, their


families, and their children.


And each of the convicted sex offenders on this


registry has received a hearing, a full and fair hearing,


many of them a trial, all of them the full panoply of due


process rights and have been found guilty beyond a


reasonable doubt. 


QUESTION:  In this case, General Blumenthal,


we're not talking about ex post facto.  We're just talking


about due process of some sort because the Second Circuit

said this couldn't be applied whether it was done


afterwards or before. 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  We are, indeed, Mr. Chief


Justice, talking only about the due process issue and only


about whether, first, the listing on this registry is


defamatory and, second, whether the defamation, if, in


fact, it exists -- and we say it doesn't -- is a violation


of the Due Process Clause in the way that it is imposed


here, that is, under Paul v. Davis, whether there is a


loss or alteration of right or status as a result of that


defamation --


QUESTION:  It's a procedural due process claim,


not substantive due process. 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  The -- the claim has been a


procedural due process claim, although the United States 

as amicus has raised -- and we welcome that it has


raised -- the substantive due process issue.  But --


QUESTION:  We don't normally address issues


raised by amici, do we? 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  I don't know whether the Court


is more hospitable to claims that may be raised by amici


from the United States Government, but it certainly is a


relevant issue to be addressed here because many of the


claims raised under the guise of due process really


involve line drawing and categories.  For example, the

question of which offenses should be listed on the


registry really is a legislative determination. 


QUESTION:  Well, the Second Circuit's position


puts us -- decision puts us in a somewhat difficult


position.  It's a procedural due process opinion, and we


have to say, procedural due process to protect what right? 


So we have to go back and find out what the basic right


they're talking about is, and I suppose the narrow way to


do it is to look just to whether or not there's -- there's


a Paul versus Virginia type of claim with this -- with


this -- with a stigma --


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Certainly that is the way


the -- the case comes to the Court, raising that issue,


and it's one that we believe merits reversal of the Second


Circuit. 


We agree -- and I must say very emphatically we 

agree so far as the issue of stigma is concerned -- that


the implication as reached by the Second Circuit is


correct, that is, that every person on this list is more


likely than the average person to be currently dangerous. 


We think that implication is true.  Every bit of


information on this registry, in fact, is concededly true.


And there is differentiation among the different


registrants.  The differentiation occurs by the offense;


that is, the information that is listed as to when the


offense occurred, the nature of the offense, the number of

25

offenses enables the public, having this information


accessible and available, to make judgments about whether


that individual in fact may be dangerous.  And of


course --


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question about your


system?  Last year we had a case that came, I think, from


Kansas, McKune, involving whether a person had to -- could


be, in effect, compelled to go into a sex offender


program.  Does your -- and that -- presumably the -- those


treatment programs do some good in preventing recidivism. 


Does -- does your reporting system give the convicted


offender a chance to differentiate between whether he went


through such a program and one who did not? 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  There is --


QUESTION: 


Does it draw any distinction between 

those two? 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Justice Stevens, there is no


category of information on the registration, as it's made


available to the public, about whether there has been


treatment.  The information provided is very simply


address, identifying factors --


QUESTION:  So they treat one who had treatment


and one who had no treatment exactly the same. 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  That is correct, so far as the


information provided to the public is concerned.  And the

23

24

25

reason, if I may presume to say it, may be that the


effectiveness of treatment may be problematic, and the


same is true with hearings on dangerousness.  The


unreliability of these hearings has been a very, very


substantial problem, and the kind of information that may


come to the public from such hearings or from information


about treatment may be as misleading as it is accurate in


many instances. 


QUESTION:  Would you -- would you agree that


there is at least some subclass of cases here in which the


non-dangerousness could be shown in a way that probably


was highly accurate and did not involve the -- the


difficulties that you raise? 


What I've got in mind is this.  The -- the


categories of individuals who are listed under the 

Connecticut statute include young men who as teenagers had


intercourse with younger teenage girls.  No one, by normal


standards of English usage, would say at the age of 25


that -- that a -- a young man like that is dangerous in


any sense that we would associate dangerousness with --


violent sex acts and things of that sort.  So there seems


to be a -- a category, not merely a set of individuals who


may prove they're not dangerous, but a category that is


presumptively not dangerous in the sense that the others


are.  And yet, there is no way for them, in effect, to --

to get themselves declared ineligible for the -- for the


stigmatization that -- that goes on. 


Why isn't there a due process problem that is


legitimately raised as at least to a category like that?


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  There -- there is, in fact,


Justice Souter, a category of the registrants who are


excepted for the -- a -- a category of convicted offenders


who are excepted from the registry if, for example, they


are 18 or younger and they commit statutory rape, if the


victim is 13 to 16 years old.  There are exceptions for


making accessible to the public information --


QUESTION:  What do -- what do they have to do to


get the exception? 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  At the time of sentencing, that


finding is made by the sentencing court, or later, that 

that kind of registration is not required by public


safety. 


QUESTION:  What about the ones who have already


been sentenced?  In other words, the -- the -- sort of the


carryover class that you pick up the minute the statute


goes into effect?  I mean, these -- these are the ones who


are the -- raising in -- in the prior case, the ones who


are raising the ex post facto kind of claim.  What do you


do about them? 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  The -- the legislature has made

a determination that certain -- under certain


circumstances, the crime is not registrable, that is,


there is no requirement for registration.  In certain


instances unquestionably, Justice Souter --


QUESTION:  Well, but take -- take -- simply take


the case as an example.  The 19-year-old boy the --


whatever it is -- 14-year-old girl have intercourse. 


Is -- is that person, if convicted prior to the date of


the statute, subject to exception from the listing, and --


and how --


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  They -- they could go back to


the sentencing court.  There is a provision --


QUESTION:  I see. 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  -- that someone who would fit


the exceptions can go back to the sentencing court. 

QUESTION:  Does this -- does this category fit? 


Let's take -- those ages will do fine, 19 and 14.  Does


that fit within an excepted category?


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. 


I'm -- I'm not sure that I followed the -- the specific


class that Justice Souter was referencing. 


QUESTION:  You said that there are certain


categories of people who can be exempted from that, and I


asked if the hypothetical that Justice Souter raised --


that particular hypothetical -- fits within that exempted

or excepted class. 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  I believe that it could. 


QUESTION:  It doesn't on my list here.  What it


says here -- I mean, maybe I'm wrong in the statute which


my law clerk looked up.  She's usually right.  And it's


that you -- you get into the exception to go back to the


sentencing court if you committed the sexual intercourse


when you were under the age of 19 with a victim between 13


to 16 and you were 2 years older.


So I think that -- that Justice Souter's


hypothetical was purposely created --


QUESTION:  Nineteen.


QUESTION:  -- so they didn't fit within that


exception.  And -- and I -- I suspect that we can find a


large number of people who would be convicted of statutory 

rape who don't fit within this exception and who are,


therefore, thrown in.  And I think the point of his


question -- it would -- certainly would be mine -- is what


about those people. 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  And -- and that question really


is the more fundamental issue about legislative line


drawing and unquestionably --


QUESTION:  Well, before we get to line drawing,


I misunderstood your response to me I guess.  What is the


answer?  Are those people in my hypothetical exempted or

do they have a process by which they can be exempted or


not?


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Maybe I should --


QUESTION:  Justice Breyer understands that they


would not be exempted from listing.  And I -- I guess --


Is he right or isn't he? 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  I -- I believe that probably


they would not be exempted, although they could go back to


the sentencing court, and determine whether the


circumstances of that hypothetical and -- and -- I'm


not --


QUESTION:  But what is the category? 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  But I had in mind all --


QUESTION:  What is the category, General


Blumenthal, in which such a person might go back?  There


seem to be rather precise categories that are excepted


with an age range, and if you fall outside that age range,


there doesn't seem to be built into this scheme any


discretionary exercises.


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  That is correct, Justice


Ginsburg.  And someone who was not within the exemption --


and -- the hypothetical may put that person outside it --


could not go back.  The -- the legislature has drawn that


line, and it's done so because it has to draw lines


somewhere and has imposed that classification because it's

judged it to be in the public interest to do so.


QUESTION:  Let's assume -- you know, we accept


the fact that line drawing has to be done and so do the


people on the other side of the case.  Their claim is that


the fact is we've got at least some category which we can


identify on a categorical basis which is being stigmatized


as dangerous for a period of -- I guess, a minimum of 10


years.  And all they're asking for is a way out.  They're


not even claiming that you affirmatively have got to make


a proof of dangerousness in the first instance with


respect to those.  They are saying, as a matter of


procedural due process, there ought to be a way out and


there is none.  That's not to contest line drawing.  That


is to contest the fact that the State could let them have


the burden of getting out, and the State still won't do 

it. 


What is the justification? 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  The justification is that the


information that is put on the registry is accurate.  The


stigma, if there is any stigma, results from the


conviction of that offense, and --


QUESTION:  No.  That is not -- I don't think


that's their argument.  Their argument is not that they


are -- are being subject to a stigma for 10 years because


they were convicted.  They are being subject to a stigma


12

for 10 years because the State of Connecticut is saying


through the Internet in -- in effect, that they are


currently dangerous.  That's the stigma, not the


conviction, the current state of dangerousness which is


stigmatizing.


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  With all due respect, Justice


Souter, the court of appeals did not find that the fact of


being on the registry means that every individual is


subject to that stigma.


QUESTION:  No.  What it means is what you have


just -- to begin with, what you just stipulated, that in


fact there is a higher probability, a -- a greater risk


of -- of dangerousness.  But if, in fact, there is no


means of differentiation for any one person on the


register, then that probability judgment is going to be 

applied in the public mind, naturally, to every person on


that unless there is a way to establish an exemption. 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  There is differentiation


insofar as the crime itself is listed. 


QUESTION:  There is, and yet the very fact that


the State chooses to list that crime is a clear indication


that the State thinks that people in that category of


crime deserve to be listed with others who are potentially


dangerous.  So the State's very categorical treatment, in


effect, has said to the public, you can't draw any clear

25

distinctions based on the particular crimes that we'll


also inform you of.  You've already made the categorical


judgment. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Blumenthal, may I ask you whether


this statute has helped in any way in reducing sex crimes


in Connecticut? 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  We -- we can't really say,


Justice O'Connor, at this point because the Internet


availability has been suspended by order of the court. 


All of this information --


QUESTION:  How long was it in effect? 


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  It was in effect for a couple


of years, and even then it was too early to make a


judgment as to whether or not it was having any


discernible effect statistically, and there's nothing in 

the record on that point. 


I -- I should report that there are now about


3,000 registrants and some 500 approximately have been


convicted again of a registrable offense. 


The point here is, though, that all of this


information is public record information.  The requirement


and the obligation for registration existed before 1998. 


In fact, it began in 1994.  So no status or right was


altered.  And the registration requirement really is


separate from how the information is made available to the

public, and that goes to the Paul v. Davis issue. 


And with your permission, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd


like to reserve the balance of my time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, General Blumenthal.


Mr. -- General Olson, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


General Blumenthal conveyed three very important


aspects of this case in his opening sentence.  In essence,


he said the people of Connecticut seek access to


concededly truthful, public record and otherwise public


available information concerning convicted sex offenders. 

These individuals have no constitutional right to conceal


these public truths from interested public citizens. 


The Second Circuit examined the registry and


said not only is the information about every individual


concededly true, but the registry -- and this is set out


verbatim in page 6 of Connecticut's -- the blue brief. 


The Department of Public Safety has not considered or


assessed the specific risk of re-offense of any individual


prior to his or her inclusion within this registry and has


made no determination that any individual included in the

registry is currently dangerous.


QUESTION:  That's what it says on the registry


or on the Internet? 


MR. OLSON:  Exactly. 


QUESTION:  But you could skip that entirely. 


You get -- this is on the -- it's not listed -- I can go


to the Internet and go directly to the person.  This


information -- this disclaimer -- is not associated with


the individual offender listing.  It's -- it's stuck in


the middle of a bunch of stuff before. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, that's true, Justice Ginsburg. 


It is not repeated for every name in the registry, but


it's clearly set forth in the registry itself.  It's put


in italics.


And the -- and the State goes on to say, 

individuals included within the registry are included


solely by virtue of their conviction record and State law. 


The main purpose of providing the -- this data on the


Internet is to make the information more easily accessible


and available, not to warn about any specific


individual --


QUESTION:  Well, except for the fact that --


that the -- the State has made a judgment and it doesn't


deny it, that individuals who have been convicted of


crimes in the categories subject to the law, are as a

categorical matter more likely to commit them in the


future.  They are more likely to be dangerous than the


general population.  And so it's true.  The State does


not, in its register, say, and by the way, this John Doe


is especially dangerous.  But the State can't deny that


it's saying this John Doe is part of the category that we


think dangerous enough to list through the Internet.


MR. OLSON:  Well, what they do say is that the


public is entitled to and should make specific judgments


about specific individuals. 


QUESTION:  But it can't.  I mean, it cannot do


that on the -- on the basis of what the State puts out


because all it knows, from what the State puts out, is the


category the person falls into.


MR. OLSON:  Precisely. 


And the point that you 

were making earlier, Justice Souter, is that there are


different types of crimes that may be of interest to


different individuals.  If you have small --


QUESTION:  All -- all of which, however, are


regarded as being within some -- above some threshold of


dangerousness or they wouldn't be listed on the Internet.


MR. OLSON:  Because they are -- they are


responding to the people's request in 50 States -- and the


people of the United States through the Congress -- to


make information available to us about people who have

been convicted of sex crimes. 


QUESTION:  I'll grant you that, but have the


people of the 50 States also said, and we don't want there


to be any way out for someone who can prove that he is


either non-dangerous or -- or in a category which is


highly -- which is much less likely to be dangerous? 


MR. OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  I mean, if the people said there's no


escape? 


MR. OLSON:  If -- if -- there -- that's -- the


Federal statute allows the State to exercise judgment with


respect to the use of its resources with respect to this


public record, truthful information. 


Now, the State of Connecticut -- the question


that you're raising, it seems to me, falls squarely within 

the concept of a substantive due process challenge, not


a --


QUESTION:  Well, but isn't it -- it's also


squarely within procedural due process.  The -- the State


is saying you're putting a label on me, and that's okay if


you give me a way to get out of it. 


MR. OLSON:  But the State --


QUESTION:  That's a procedural due process


challenge. 


MR. OLSON:  The label that the State is putting

on is that you have been convicted of a sex crime and that


the -- and you must draw -- we have not decided that you


are dangerous. 


QUESTION:  No, but that's where -- I mean, I


think that's where the -- the -- we're not sort of meeting


each other in the argument.  The State does say that much. 


No question about it.  But by this categorized treatment,


the State is saying something further.  The State is


saying people in these categories are likely to be more


dangerous.  It's a -- it's the second statement that is


the gravamen of the problem that we've got here, not the


truthful first statement. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, the -- the Court has said


repeatedly that the -- this Court will examine challenges


with respect to the -- the -- in that category on a 

substantive due process basis if the classification is


reasonable --


QUESTION:  Well, that's -- that's right there,


but that is not the challenge that's being made.  There's


no challenge being made here that the State cannot have a


register -- or a register that is -- is structured by


category.  The challenge that's being made here is that if


you do that, there should be a due -- there should be a


procedural mechanism for somebody who can show that he's


not dangerous to get out.  That isn't substantive due

process. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, and -- and our submission is


that the determination -- and this Court has stated it as


recently -- recently as a year ago that sex offenders are


more likely to be recidivists than other categories of


individuals, but that that does not mean, Connecticut goes


on to say, that any individual is necessarily dangerous. 


That classification is rational.


Now, it is also rational for Connecticut to have


determined, as it did, that we'll accord opportunities for


people to address in -- in certain circumstances the


nature of their conviction.  But it's also rational for --


QUESTION:  General Olson, can I ask you a


broader question?  Do you think it would be permissible


for Connecticut to require every person in the category to 

wear a badge that recited the information that goes on the


Internet? 


MR. OLSON:  We think that that would be a very


difficult situation, Justice Stevens, in that -- the --


and -- and I would be concerned about that.  But --


QUESTION:  Why?  What's wrong with that? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, because that requires the


individual to carry that notification himself to convey


the government's message.


QUESTION:  Yes.

 MR. OLSON:  It also requires that message to be


brought into every situation that the individual is


involved in.  The Internet is a reasonable and relative --


minimally intrusive way of responding to a question that a


citizen may ask of a State and to which the citizen is


entitled to an answer.  The citizen here has to ask the


question.  It isn't carried around with the individual


everywhere the individual goes. 


And this is public record information.  As one


of the questions in the earlier argument implied, if a


private citizen -- Cox Broadcasting, for example --


decided to make this information available to the public,


it would be -- have an absolute constitutional right to do


so.  It seems anomalous to suggest that the State of


Connecticut cannot impart to its citizens the same 

information that Cox Broadcasting would have an absolute


constitutional right to do so.  It seems to us --


QUESTION:  But nobody is -- nobody is saying it


can't.  Nobody is saying Connecticut can't do this.  All


they're saying is if Connecticut does it, they've got to


give us an -- an escape hatch.


MR. OLSON:  Well, it seems to me, Justice


Souter, that that conflicts directly with what the Court


said in Paul versus Davis, that in the first place, there


is not defamation here because it's a truthful imparting

of information. 


QUESTION:  If -- if there is no potential for a


defamatory or stigmatizing statement, then there is no


case.  I agree with you.  But simply to say there's no


defamation here is -- is, with respect, it seems to me, to


try to avoid the question. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, I don't think it is, but --


but even if it were defamation, it is not -- there is no


stigma plus, as this Court required in Paul versus Davis.


There's no confinement of liberty.  There's no denial of


any individual on this list of a right to a job --


QUESTION:  Is there stigma plus in Justice


Stevens' hypothetical, wearing the badge? 


MR. OLSON:  There may well be. 


QUESTION: 


Why isn't there stigma plus then in 

creating a -- in effect, a subclass of citizens who have


got to go through quarterly registration possibly for the


rest of their lives? 


MR. OLSON:  It -- it -- we submit that that is a


minimal, reasonable way for the State to keep track of


people who have committed crimes and then --


QUESTION:  But, General Olson, suppose you look


at it as a stigma minus.  What about the hypothetical I


asked earlier about somebody who took -- a convicted felon


who took the -- the treatment program and survived it and

one who did not?  They're treated alike in this system. 


MR. OLSON:  Yes, they are because the State has


made a determination, as have 49 other States and


Congress, that the people are entitled to certain public


record information.  That does not apply --


QUESTION:  But it's -- it's incomplete


information as to some. 


MR. OLSON:  It's -- well, it is -- it is


incomplete information as to everyone, we submit.  But it


does -- it is complete information with respect to whether


individuals have been convicted of a sex crime.  That is


public information.  That is information to which the


citizens are entitled. 


Thank you. 


QUESTION: 


Thank you, General Olson. 

Ms. Sadin, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHELLEY R. SADIN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MS. SADIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the


Court:


In the eyes of a concerned public, every person


posted on Connecticut's Megan's Law list poses a serious


threat to the public, particularly to children.  The


public knows that Megan's Law is named for --

Ms. Sadin.  What is the -- what is the record support for


that statement? 


MS. SADIN:  Petitioners themselves have


stated --


QUESTION:  I'm asking you -- Ms. Sadin, I'm


asking you what is the record support for the statement


you just made? 


MS. SADIN:  That -- that the public knows this


is a Megan's Law list? 


QUESTION:  That -- that the public knows that --


what -- that they're -- that they're dangerous.


MS. SADIN:  The -- the message of dangerousness


comes from a number of sources, Your Honor.  The first is


that the purpose of this law, the declared purpose of this


law, repeated by petitioners and repeated by the lawmakers 

who passed it, is to protect the public from recidivist


sex offenders, and particularly to protect the children


from such offenders. 


The law is administered and the registry is both


put together and published by the State police.  The State


police on the website state that it is their mission to


prevent crime and protect the public.


QUESTION:  But they also say that it -- it --


they're not saying that anyone is dangerous on that same


website, don't they?

 MS. SADIN:  They don't actually.  The disclaimer


does not say that everybody is not dangerous.  What the


disclaimer says is that no dangerousness assessment is


made with respect to any individual.


QUESTION:  Well, why isn't that good enough?


MS. SADIN:  It isn't good enough because all it


says is what we already know, which is that nobody has


been assessed for dangerous or not.  And it's contradicted


by the repeatedly emphasized message to the public, which


petitioners themselves stressed so urgently below, that


the purpose of this law is to publish current, monitored


information taken from offenders so that it can be posted


on the Internet so the public will know what they look


like and where they live at all times.  That sends a very


compelling message.


QUESTION:  But that's not -- that's not -- I


think what I took the Chief Justice is asking -- I took --


and I'd have a similar question, that -- that their


response I think to the point that I was trying to make


with Justice Souter, that maybe this is overly broad


because let's imagine the 19-year-old who simply had


intercourse once with a much younger woman and obviously


is no danger.  Their response is, first, it says to the


public, consider every case on the merits.  We're not


saying whether it's dangerous or not.

 Second, when the people in the neighborhood to


which the individual has moved look him up on the Net,


they'll see what he did, and people aren't idiots. 


They'll understand that this is there because he fell


within the law. 


And besides that, they say, it's too difficult


for us to draw finer lines.  At least the legislature


reasonably so could conclude. 


So the question I had is, is there any objective


evidence that people do cause mistake -- the significance


of this 19- or 20-year-old boy having his name there?  Are


we just doing that because we all know -- in quotes -- or


is there evidence of it? 


MS. SADIN:  There were -- the -- the court --


the district court's decision and the court of appeals 

decision that affirmed it were based on rule 9(c)


statements, undisputed facts on summary judgment, and they


included the fact that this is commonly known as a Megan's


Law.  There's no disputing that.  Everybody in this


country knows that Megan's Law was passed in response to


the rape and murder of a child victim.  That is the


genesis of these laws, and it's undisputed that that's how


the public understands them. 


Also not in dispute is that it is the


department --

 QUESTION:  Well, the public also understands


that official records have to be interpreted in different


ways.  We've said that in -- in prior decisions of this


Court.  When there's a notice on the police bulletin board


and the press publishes it, it says what it says.


MS. SADIN:  Except that these --


QUESTION:  This -- if -- if you have sort of a


First Amendment argument you're concerned with here, it --


it seems to me that you're arguing at cross purposes to


our precedents. 


MS. SADIN:  As I understand your question, if --


the problem is that it is not just truthful, already


public information.  The list does not just include


someone's conviction.  It also includes a current


photograph and a current address --


QUESTION:  Is that not truthful? 


MS. SADIN:  The current photograph and the


current -- it is not because the message that it conveys


is that this is a person who is being watched and


monitored, who must, at risk of felony conviction --


QUESTION:  Well, what is the constitutional


basis for your argument?  Could we move to that?  I mean,


you're here on a constitutional claim, and I'm not sure


what it is, to tell you the truth. 


MS. SADIN:  It is that there is an established

liberty interest in -- in a government impose -- in


avoiding a government-imposed stigma, which is not just


government name-calling.


QUESTION:  Well, how does some liberty interest


and reputation survive the Paul versus Davis case?


MS. SADIN:  But it is more than a liberty


interest and reputation.  This is a government-imposed


stigma which is -- it's part and parcel of the regulations


that are imposed on people.  The information posted on the


registry is extracted from registrants.  On pain of felony


conviction, they must --


QUESTION:  Can -- can a truthful statement be


stigmatizing? 


MS. SADIN:  This is not a truthful statement. 


QUESTION: 


Well, then do you agree that a 

truthful statement cannot be stigmatizing? 


MS. SADIN:  No.  A truthful statement can also


be stigmatizing, but -- but it's not --


QUESTION:  Is that consistent with Paul versus


Davis?


MS. SADIN:  I think Paul versus Davis requires


that there be a -- as there is in this case, a false


stigma.


And I think we have to go back to the


understanding and the basis of this law.  This is a law

which was designed to -- and the public knows it was


designed to -- protect the public from dangerous,


recidivist offenders, and that is not true with respect to


many of the people, perhaps most of the people -- we don't


know -- who are on this list.  Not only --


QUESTION:  A danger -- potentially dangerous. 


I mean, the government doesn't have to make a -- a rock-


solid assessment that these people are dangerous.  Why


isn't it enough for the government to say this is a


category of people who may be dangerous?


MS. SADIN:  The government says --


QUESTION:  And is that true?  It is perfectly


true.  Can the public act on it?  If it wants to, it can;


if it doesn't want to, it doesn't have to.  It may make


further assessment of whether, indeed, the may is -- is 

close enough or -- or -- but -- I don't know why you


insist on saying that the -- that the State has said these


people are dangerous.  It seems to me, even without the


disclaimer, the most the State has said is that these


people may be dangerous. 


MS. SADIN:  The State says -- with respect, the


State says more, but even if it said that these -- that


these people may be more dangerous than other people, that


too reduces people in the eyes -- in the eyes of the


public.  It causes people to, as any injury to reputation

would, not want to hire them, not -- want to avoid them,


not want to live in the same neighborhoods with them.


And this Court, with respect to whether or not


there are statistics which show that this -- that some


subgroup of sex offenders are more likely to recidivate,


this Court has never relied just on statistical


information to make dangerousness assessments about


individuals, even in the context --


QUESTION:  Suppose this -- this same information


was on the -- on the Internet through some private service


and I got into the Internet, and I said I don't want to


live next to -- to this person.  That is my judgment that


I can make --


MS. SADIN:  Well, there are two points --


QUESTION: 


-- based on a public record. 

MS. SADIN:  There are two points with respect to


that, Your Honor.  First of all, a private citizen would


not have the power, as the government does, to obtain


current -- to require people to register current


photographs and current addresses for posting, and there


is not the same government-imposed imprimatur.  These are


people who are being watched.  We are requiring them to


provide this information to us on a regular basis.  We


advertise on the website that we keep this information as


updated as possible in -- in furtherance of the Department

of Public Safety's declared mission of protecting the


public and preventing crime.  All -- the entire context of


this registry and the purpose of the law sends the


ineluctable message that the people who are posted pose a


present threat to the public. 


QUESTION:  Let -- let me give you that.  What's


bothering me -- and it may be I'm just missing something,


but if I am, I've missed it for a long, long time. 


What has this to do with the procedural due


process claim?  I'll -- I'll say that my reason for


doubting that it does is first there is -- there are some


laws that are so basic that they're not written anywhere,


not even in our cases.  What I used to say was one of them


is you don't ever have to have a hearing if there's


nothing to have a hearing about. 


And here there's nothing 

to have a hearing about as far as the statute is


concerned.  These people concede they were convicted of


sexually violent offenses. 


To make the same point differently, give your


clients all the procedures they want, every procedure in


the world, and let's suppose they prove they're absolutely


not dangerous.  Still, they were convicted of a sexually


violent offense.  So it wasn't the lack of procedure that


caused the problem.  It was the fact that in your view the


Constitution of the United States does not permit the

State of Connecticut to turn these consequences upon being


a sexually violent offender.  That's a different argument,


and the only kind of clause I've ever seen that would make


that constitutionally impermissible is the Due Process


Clause in its substantive sense. 


And my point is not simply a technical point,


for if you had focused on the argument, there would be a


record that would answer questions like the Chief


Justice's.  You would have been forced to create a record


that would have gone into all the State's reasons and what


empirical data there was, whether this was justified or


not. 


That's a long question.  But I'd -- it's at the


root of what's bothering me. 


MS. SADIN: 


I understand, Your Honor, and I 

think -- let me see if I can respond to it sufficiently.


We are not asking -- first of all, let me begin


by saying the reason we don't consider it to be a


substantive due process analysis is that we're not trying


to expand the scope of the due process law to -- to


recognize some liberty that is not already recognized. 


There is an interest in reputation if it is coupled with


the kinds of restrictions that are imposed by this law. 


People cannot -- literally cannot -- remain at liberty if


they do not report what they look like and where they live

to the State.  They will be prosecuted for a felony.  They


cannot move without advising the State that they are doing


so.  They cannot even leave the State for temporary


periods, if they're of -- of a substantial period of time,


without telling the State.  They literally cannot remain


at liberty without performing these functions which are


not required of any other citizen. 


QUESTION:  -- in finding a liberty interest


here.  After all, he has to give DNA.  He has to give his


fingerprints.  That isn't my problem.  I'll give you all


the liberty interest you want. 


My -- I don't want to repeat what I said.  You


took it in all right.  Right? 


MS. SADIN:  I think so. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MS. SADIN:  And let -- let me try to address it


now if I haven't done it yet. 


Even if there were -- now, as I understand, Your


Honor, you're saying that -- that even if there were


narrower categories, if we were to limit this to people


who were more dangerous and isn't overbroad, there weren't


that -- that kind of issue, there still is the problem


because it is a procedural due process issue whether a


particular person poses a present threat.  That isn't


something --

 QUESTION:  I don't think that's the issue. 


I think the issue is the State says here's a list of


people who were convicted of sex offenses.  Period. 


You're telling us that this particular person is no longer


dangerous.  We say that's not relevant to our scheme. 


There's only one thing that's relevant:  was he or she


convicted?  If he or she was convicted, you have nothing


under our scheme to be heard about because the only due


process conviction -- the only due process hearing that


counts is the one that led up to the conviction. 


That's -- that's the point, that you're saying my person


is no longer dangerous.  The State's answer is, under our


scheme that's totally irrelevant.  The only question is,


was this person convicted of a sex offense?


MS. SADIN: 


But the problem with -- the problem 

with that, Your Honor, is that the list does not just say


that the person was convicted of a sex offense.


QUESTION:  So now suppose -- that's -- what I'm


trying to find out what is your real argument.  Suppose


the list said, not sex offender register, but register of


persons convicted -- convicted sex offender list.  It said


that.  And then it put the disclaimer that we are making


no judgment about this person's dangerousness right on


that web page with the picture, right on the page with the


individual's picture, and then it gave the offense of

conviction, the date, the time served, and that's what was


presented -- with that legend in bold face -- every time a


user goes to get a picture sees that warning of what the


State's purpose is -- would you still have a procedural


due process claim? 


MS. SADIN:  I would if -- I would if the current


appearances and whereabouts of those people were also


monitored for the purpose of posting them on a list whose


stated purpose is to protect the public.  I would not have


a problem if it is simply an Internet version of


conviction records.  There is a fundamental difference


between public records of conviction and the


information --


QUESTION:  But then I don't get the link with


the hearing that you're asking for. 


That your address 

has -- anytime somebody's address is -- his current


address or place of employment -- is it a government


record?  They have a right to get that out?  I'm not --


I'm not sure I'm following what is the hearing that you're


entitled to because the government supplies your current


address. 


MS. SADIN:  The hearing that we're entitled


to -- and it isn't -- it really is more than just current


address, although that is one aspect of it.  Monitoring


address and photographs and posting it for the purpose of

protecting the public does send a message that they're


dangerous. 


But even if there -- if there were to be a -- a


list that simply reflected past conviction records, that


would not pose a problem.  It isn't just the current


address.  It is the combination of all of these things. 


It is the context.  This is a Megan's Law designed to


protect the public from recidivist child molesters.  It


is -- it posts people whose current appearances and


whereabouts are monitored, and the State tells the public


that they are monitored on the website itself.  It says


that we provide this information and we keep it as current


as -- as possible.  It is the Department of Public Safety,


the State police, who post the information beneath their


prominently displayed mission statement that it is their 

job in life to protect the public from -- from crime.


QUESTION:  Well, Ms. Sadin, I don't know if the


FBI does it anymore.  I think they used to put out a 10


Most Wanted list of the most dangerous offenders.  Now,


could one of the people on that list have demanded a


hearing to say he didn't belong on it? 


(Laughter.) 


MS. SADIN:  There's a fundamental distinction


between them because -- think about it, Your Honor. 


The -- the 10 Most Wanted list is the result of an

investigation that focuses on a particular individual and


there are exigent circumstances.  It's not just a roundup


of -- of the usual suspects.  It does focus on a


particular person.  And that person does not have, by the


way, the 10-year to life continued reporting requirements


based on past conduct.  It will be processed --


QUESTION:  Well, no, but he -- he's going to


have to be on the watch for police. 


MS. SADIN:  Well, he may be but -- but consider


when that person, even if he committed a violent crime,


is -- is arrested and when a bond hearing is heard, the


recidivism statistics for this kind of crime, this


person's past conviction record even, will not be the sole


determinants and determine what -- what allows him to be


released.  It will be --


QUESTION:  Well, he hasn't -- he hasn't even


been convicted of a crime.  Somebody who's on that list. 


I mean, it seems to me he's in a much better position


than -- than your clients.  As far as anybody knows, he's


totally innocent, and the FBI puts him up there as the


most wanted without a hearing.  Your clients have had a


hearing.  They've been found to -- to be guilty. 


They're -- it seems to me they're in much worse shape than


somebody on the FBI list. 


MS. SADIN:  The person on the FBI list has yet

to have a hearing on whether or not he was the person who


committed the crime, and presumably, Your Honor, if he


were not and if there were false information that -- that


led to his arrest, he would have a claim for -- for false


arrest. 


QUESTION:  Exactly.  But just putting him --


putting his face out there tells the public, does it not,


this is a dangerous person you ought to be on the lookout


for.  He hasn't had any hearing on that. 


MS. SADIN:  Yes, but he will.  And there is at


least some individual assessment, an individual


investigation.  That hasn't happened with respect to the


people on my list. 


QUESTION:  Why do you have to have an


individual -- I would -- if you were arguing the 

substantive due process argument, which it's clear by now


is what I think the right category is --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  -- you'd have the person who was in


Justice Souter's example and he would come in and say, it


violates the Constitution to apply this statute to me.  At


least give me a hearing. 


But that's not who you're representing.  You're


representing a class of people, including the -- the 19


most dangerous sexual offenders in all of Connecticut.

And you're saying as to them the Constitution requires a


hearing and the State responds, what are you talking


about?  First, they're very dangerous.  Second, they've


all been convicted of crimes.  Third, a hearing will be a


waste of time as to them and simply delay the


implementation of the statute and a lot of other arguments


besides.  And anyway -- all right.  I'm just making up all


their arguments, but what is your response as to them? 


MS. SADIN:  Yes.  Yes.  Your Honor has asked an


even longer question, so let me try again. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MS. SADIN:  It -- even -- first of all, this is


a very broad statute.  It does not cover just the most


dangerous offenders.  Obviously it covers people who have


been convicted of nonviolent crimes, been sentenced to 

probation, been sentenced to unconditional release.  It


covers the teenagers about which there has been some


discussion.  And by the way, some of those teenagers can


get off and some of them --


QUESTION:  I'm not being clear.  I know that. 


I'm saying that if they were arguing substance, those


people could make the argument on their own.  Don't we


have to consider you in terms of the 19 worst? 


MS. SADIN:  Even with respect to -- even with


respect to the 19 worst, it still remains an individual

determination whether a person poses a threat.  That


person could have a --


QUESTION:  No, but excuse me.  Are you claiming


that there's got to be a determination in advance before


the person can be put on the register, or are you claiming


that a person who is on the register who claims to be non-


dangerous should be allowed a hearing to get off it?


MS. SADIN:  I'm saying -- well, this is a -- the


registry is systematic.  It's not as though it's any


surprise --


QUESTION:  Never mind -- what is your position?


MS. SADIN:  It is a --


QUESTION:  Has there got to be a hearing in


advance before the name goes on?


MS. SADIN: 


There has to be a hearing in advance 

not before the person registers, but before the person is


publicly -- yes, before the person is publicly posted. 


And that is true even with respect --


QUESTION:  With the burden on the government


to -- I want to get the full dimensions of your position. 


The registry is all right, I gather.  There was no


injunction against the registry.  The registry remains in


place.  So you're attacking only the notification.


MS. SADIN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And your position on the notification

is not simply that a person should have an opportunity to


show that he or she should escape from this list, but that


the government has the burden before it puts -- posts


anybody to show that that person is currently dangerous. 


Is that your position? 


MS. SADIN:  No.  I am saying that there has to


be notice that you will be posted and an opportunity to be


heard on whether or not you belong to the very small class


of people who deserve to be posted.  And again, we're


not -- the reason --


QUESTION:  Well, let's take the category of


violent sex offenders.  They're on the registry.  You


don't dispute that.  They're there.  Everyone is on the


registry.  Can that person, the most violent,


automatically be posted? 


MS. SADIN:  No.  And even under the Federal


Megan's Law -- let me point out that even under the


Federal Megan's Law -- that small category of people,


sexually violent predators, are not allowed to -- must --


must have process before the government is allowed to


monitor them every 90 days, as everyone on Connecticut's


registry is done.  There has to be a court finding that,


in fact, those sexually violent predators fit within that


category.  And even with respect --

on --


QUESTION:  So what is the finding?  That they


have to be likely to -- to offend again? 


MS. SADIN:  The -- the finding is that they fit


the definition of -- there -- there are a number of


criteria and there are expert -- expert testimony is


required, and so there are criteria. 


QUESTION:  Those people could be confined under


Hendricks, and then the law serves no -- no purpose at


all.


MS. SADIN:  But those -- there is not that kind


of confinement law in Connecticut, but there certainly


is -- there would have to be procedure in connection with


that.  There was procedure in connection with Hendricks. 


There has to be procedure in connection with the sexually 

violent predators who are -- who are regulated in that way


under the -- under the Federal Megan's Law. 


And the point is this:  Even with respect to


those people who have committed violent crimes, there are


treatment mechanisms.  This Court recognized in McKune


against Lile that -- that recidivism rates are


dramatically reduced by people who receive treatment. 


It is not difficult to provide these hearings. 


There are dangerousness hearings done in every court in


every State.  In Connecticut as well, there are

dangerousness assessments conducted even within the


context of this Megan's Law, Connecticut's Megan's Law, in


connection with exceptions and exemptions to registration.


QUESTION:  Maybe the people of Connecticut don't


trust those dangerousness hearings.  Maybe the people of


Connecticut say, I don't want to have to rely upon -- upon


the guesses of some psychiatrist.  I do not want to live


next to somebody who has been convicted of a sexual --


sexually predatory offense, and I don't care what the


psychiatrists say.  Now, can -- can the State of


Connecticut accede to the wishes of the public who feel


that way about it? 


MS. SADIN:  The State of Connecticut can accede


to the wishes of the public to have conviction


information. 


The neighbor Your Honor talks about has a 

name.  He can be looked up.  The neighbor can see whether


or not he has a prior conviction and can move if it


wishes. 


But the State of Connecticut does not have the


right, without providing some individual process, some


notice and an opportunity to be heard, to tell the


neighbor this is a person who is dangerous.  We have the


State police monitoring this person.  He must report to us


every 90 days.  If he does not return his address


notification, he will be arrested.  This is somebody we

are watching.  This is somebody with respect to whom we


are giving you this information. 


QUESTION:  Well, what if -- what if it were a


conviction, Ms. Sadin, he had been convicted, and instead


of this program, it specified that he would be on parole


for 15 years with much the same restrictions?  Would that


make it any different? 


MS. SADIN:  It presents a different question. 


I mean, I don't know whether or not the --


QUESTION:  But I -- I know it's a different


question or I wouldn't have asked you.  But what --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  But what I -- what I want to know is,


would you treat it differently or would it be the same? 


MS. SADIN: 


If there has been process in 

connection with the parole determination, the answer is


no.  That's the fundamental point.  Even with respect


to -- this Court, again, has never used statistics even


that -- even that apply to some subset to determine that


an individual poses a present threat, the kind of serious


threat that the State of Connecticut repeatedly has said


that is posed by the people on this list.  At -- at oral


argument below, General Blumenthal argued that this was


crucial information which was necessary to protect the


public from -- from the kinds of dangers that -- that

occurred in the Megan Kanka case. 


This is not just a -- this is not a system of


government name-calling.  It is a system of government-


imposed stigma with requirements which preclude someone


from remaining at liberty if they do not comply and if the


information that -- and the information that they then


give up to the State, otherwise private, personal


information, is posted on the Internet for the repeatedly-


declared purpose of protecting the public from the people


who are posted. 


And again, the Federal Wetterling Act requires


only that relevant information be released that is


necessary to protect the public from a particular person. 


That is why this is an individual --


QUESTION: 


How does the statute work with 

somebody who changes his name? 


MS. SADIN:  Excuse me? 


QUESTION:  How does the statute work with


someone who changes his name? 


MS. SADIN:  If you change your address, if you


change your name, you must -- you must report to the


State.


QUESTION:  If you change your address.


MS. SADIN:  If you change your address. 


QUESTION:  But what if you change your name?

 MS. SADIN:  You -- you -- I think you would have


to report that too.  I don't remember whether there's a


particular provision, but there -- there are provisions


that you must -- you must update your current address and


information, and I -- I presume name is -- is the same.


QUESTION:  And I -- but if you change your


appearance by shaving off your beard or something like


that, do they require reporting of that? 


MS. SADIN:  It does actually, and you are


required to submit to photographs whenever and wherever


the State tells you to and at least every 5 years.  The


answer is yes.  You cannot even leave the State for --


for, you know, any -- any substantial period of time


without reporting -- without reporting that.  And all of


this is on pain of felony conviction. 


That's true even if 

the underlying conviction which requires you to report


were a misdemeanor. 


And one more -- one final point.  The hearings


that are -- about which the Attorney General says there is


no reliability, not only are they conducted under the


Federal Wetterling Act and in connection with the


exemptions and exceptions under Connecticut's act, but


there are a number of States with already streamlined,


well-positioned systems who conduct these kinds of


hearings and who provide process.  There has been no

complaint that those are unworkable systems.  They are


performed -- the -- the -- less than half the States in


this country have categorical notification systems like


Connecticut's.


QUESTION:  Citizens may not trust them. 


Citizens have seen too many of these hearings that result


in the release of people who turn out to be dangerous. 


Why -- why do you insist that the State must tell


citizens, we're not going to give you this information


because we have determined that the person is -- is not


dangerous and therefore you don't have to worry about it?


MS. SADIN:  But it isn't a question of just


giving the public truthful information.  The issue is


telling the public that these are people who need to be


monitored. 


They are dangerous, not you may think they're 

dangerous and they -- and you may not, but they are.  That


is why we are doing this to them.  That's why we need to


know what they look like and where they live at all times,


and you need to know what they look like and where they


live at all times.  That sends -- that sends a very


different message from they may be or they may not be. 


That says that they are. 


QUESTION:  May I ask you to turn a little


attention to what is the plus?  Because it's hard for me


to understand when you take the registry, you say is the

plus, and yet, you don't challenge the registry and the


district court doesn't require any change whatever in the


registry.  So how can something that you say you're not


seeking to disturb or at least you're not challenging the


district court for not disturbing it is the plus? 


MS. SADIN:  Because they are integrally related. 


Remember, my understanding of the stigma plus test is that


it was meant to distinguish just plain defamation cases


from those which really were Fourteenth Amendment claims


based on something the government was doing to you.  The


plus here is that the government requires you, on pain of


felony conviction, to provide the personal information


that then is published.  It is an integral system.  It


creates a new class of citizen, a second class of citizen,


which has different obligations from other citizens and 

from which information, personal and otherwise private


information, is extracted and then posted.  Private


citizens do not have to tell the State where they live at


all times.  They don't have to tell the State when they


are leaving.  They don't have to provide photographs


repeatedly.


QUESTION:  Suppose we didn't have the posting,


we just had the register, and you had to tell those things


that you ordinarily wouldn't have to tell the State.


MS. SADIN:  It would be a different argument.

QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Sadin. 


General Blumenthal, you have 4 minutes


remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BLUMENTHAL


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


Following Justice Ginsburg's question, there


really is no plus here.  The point is the registry has not


been challenged.  The registry existed before the posting,


the publication, making this information available.  It


exists now.  If the order were not in effect, even without


the requirement in the law that there be Internet


publication, an ordinary citizen could do what The


Hartford Courant did and file an information -- Freedom of 

Information request.  The Internet requirement is like a


Freedom of Information form of law, and it is unrelated in


the way that Paul v. Davis says it must be related to the


supposed stigma. 


Even if this Court were to find there's a


defamation -- and by the way, Connecticut law has never


recognized defamation by implication.  But even if there


were, Paul v. Davis says that as a result of the action


complained of, a right or status recognized previously


under State law must be distinctly altered or

extinguished.


In this instance, there was no pre-existing


right not to register.  In fact, individuals -- sex


offenders were required to register, and that obligation


continues to exist afterward.  And so what this Court


would do by accepting the Second Circuit's decision is, in


effect, to constitutionalize tort law in the way that it


has declined to do in Paul v. Davis, Siegert v. Gilley,


where again it insisted on some causal link between the


defamation and the supposed loss of right and status.  And


that is utterly lacking here. 


The supposed harms -- there's nothing in the


record about housing, employment, any other harm that


results from this supposed stigma, and the stigma itself,


to go to the Chief Justice's question, has to be false in 

order to constitute defamation.  This Court said so in


Codd v. Velger, and that is plainly not true here because


all of this information, particularly as to the convicted


offense, is absolutely truthful and leaves to


Connecticut's citizens to make the judgment about whether


or not it indicates dangerousness. 


The disclaimer -- to clear one other point --


very specifically says not only that no assessment has


been made, but also that the publication or inclusion of


this individual on the website and on the registry is not


50

24

25

to be deemed a judgment or a conclusion that this person


is dangerous.  There's a specific disclaimer as to


dangerousness. 


But even without it, we would contend there's no


stigma because all of this information is very simply


public record information, and under Siegert v. Gilley


particularly, there is no sufficient link between the


supposed stigma and any loss of right or status.  There


simply is no plus here as this Court has interpreted it to


exist and must exist under the standard that this Court


has set forth. 


We would respectfully submit that at the very


least, the plus, or the loss of right or change of status


must arise out of the same action or flow from it in some


way. 


And here plainly the information that's conveyed 

accurately and truthfully on the registry does not in any


way cause the registration.  It does not result from the


registration.  The registration continues to exist now and


would continue to exist even after the Internet is taken


off -- is -- come down because of the court order.


So we respectfully submit that the court should


be reversed.  Thank you. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, General


Blumenthal. 


The case is submitted.
