CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this morning in Case 14-1538, Life Technologies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corporation v. Promega Corporation. 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Phillips. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

              

I think because this is largely an 

 

 

 

 

 

international trade case, it's probably useful to put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case in context and to compare it to the facts that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave rise to the passage of Section 271(f) that's at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue in this case.  You'll recall that in the Deepsouth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, that was a case involving a shrimp deveiner in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

which all of the activities took place within the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States, except for the final act that took less than an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hour to assemble in a foreign country.  In that case, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court held even that was not within the meaning of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- of the patent statute as it existed then, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress then acted to fill that particular loophole. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The facts of this case seem to me to be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

polar opposite of that.  With -- Life Tech has -- Life 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Technologies operates an -- an enormous plant in

England, in the United Kingdom.  It spends tens of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

million dollars on that plant.  Four out of the five 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components that go into the creation of the kits that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are at issue in this case are sourced outside of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

United States; one inside.  I'll come back to that in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minute.  And as relevant to this litigation, all of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kit -- kits are sold outside of the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the only contact that any of this has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the United States is the fact that a single, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commodity product is shipped to England as part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process for the fabrication of these particular kits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, that commodity product is called a Taq 

   

 

 

 

 

 

polymerase, which I will readily concede that when I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think about what you buy off-the-shelf, I don't go to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Costco to buy Taq polymerase, but I'm told, and I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's absolutely undisputed in the record, that this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commodity.  This is at the essence of what the Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted in (f)(2), which is a staple article or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

commodity of commerce suitable for many non-infringing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uses.  And, indeed, if you get online and put in "Taq 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

polymerase," you can find literally dozens and dozens of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways to purchase it online at this time.  And that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true as much in 2006.  It may have been a significant 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product in 1989, but clearly by 2006, it was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commodity.

And so the question is, is whether or not, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply by using a single, staple article, Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

5 

intended through 271 to -- to declare that this is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell us --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- a violation. 

   

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- is this product 

  

 

 

 

 

available outside the U.S.? 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Taq polymerase? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes. 

  

 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Absolutely.  Yes.  It's --

  

  

  

 

 

it's readily available throughout the world through --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are a variety of manufacturers who wish to make --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's no patent on 

  

 

 

 

 

that particular component? 

 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  No, none that -- none that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists any longer, no.  As I said, it's a commodity 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

product.  The --

  

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we know why that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

particular component was exported from the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States?  You -- you said all the others --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- were made in England. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yeah, and the key to this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want -- you want to get the best quality product 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at -- presumably, at the lowest possible price.  And --

and most of these were purchased -- most of the Taq was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

purchased from the Roche company, and I -- and I suspect 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they just had a better supply arrangement. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, that's -- that's the key to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case in a lot of ways, is what you're looking for is, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what are the best supply arrangements that you can make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on a global basis?  Can you get them in the United 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States?  Can you get them outside the United States? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And what it seems to me clear that Congress could never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have intended was to in some way disadvantage U.S. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacturers who are providing a particular staple. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Indeed, I would read 271(f)(2) as saying 

   

 

 

 

 

categorically that the one thing Congress did not want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do is to interfere with the ability to -- of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacturer to provide a staple article as part of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- as part of an activity outside of the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If all of this had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happened in the United States, would there have been a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent infringement suit that would be -- have merit? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, if everything had 

  

 

 

 

 

take -- taken place inside the United States, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have been. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under the U.K. laws, are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

patents generally enforced for items that are patentable

in the U.K.? 

 

 

7 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  Yes, absolutely. 

  

  

 

 

And -- and -- and, indeed, in this case, Promega had --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think Promega -- at least somebody had a patent in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.K., but that patent had expired, which is, candidly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not surprisingly, why the activity was taken. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that -- and that is ultimately, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy, the answer to these issues.  If a patentholder 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in the United States is upset by the use of a particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invention outside the United States, the solution is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go outside of the United States and seek packet -- pack 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- patent protection in that particular country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I assume, though, that 

    

 

 

 

there might be other countries that are not so vigorous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in their enforcements as the U.K. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I suspect that there 

   

  

 

 

 

may be, although there -- you know, this isn't broadly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulated by -- by treaties.  And the -- and to me, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

key is, you know, right -- you know, the United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has agreed that each country should regulate its own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent rights.  I mean, we're bought into that deal 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in the Paris Convention in the 19th century, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and consistently have accepted that.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's -- and the whole theory of this, is to ensure the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

free flow of commerce across borders on a regular basis,

at least when we're talking about staple articles of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce. 

            

You know, if -- if -- you know, where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit clearly got this wrong is in saying that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you could interpret (f)(1), which talks about a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial portion of the commodities, and say that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single commodity can be a substantial portion, when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

(f)(2) says that in order for a single commodity to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitute a -- to give rise to a potential claim of a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation, what it has to be is especially made or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially adapted for use in the particular invention. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Does "substantial portion" 

  

 

 

 

mean a majority? 

   

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, I think it means 

   

  

 

 

 

substantially more than a majority.  I -- I would -- I 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

would say that it has to be approximating or very close 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or tantamount to all. 

 

 

 

            

components? 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So here, there were five 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And -- and they would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be -- all -- all five would have to be made in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States?  Or --

  

 

 

            

minimum --

MR. PHILLIPS:  I would have thought at least 

    

 

 

 

 

 

four would have to be.  But I -- I -- you know, in many 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances, my guess is the right answer may well be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Where -- where do you get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that from?  What's the principle there? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Because all Congress wanted 

  

 

 

 

 

to do was to close a loophole where you're essentially 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing nothing but violating U.S. patent law and avoiding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it by simply offloading it at the last second.  In a lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of instances, I don't think that's true when you're only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about a majority of -- of the -- the items. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, how do we know that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's all Congress wanted to do?  I mean, that might 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been the -- the -- the scenario in Deepsouth, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress used language that could refer to much more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than that, that could refer to a majority, that even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could refer to a substantial minority. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I think 

    

   

   

  

 

there is no way to -- to -- first of all, the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule against extra -- the rule -- the presumption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against extraterritoriality would drive you in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite direction.  Even if you could reasonably read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the language either way, you would -- you would drive it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

toward recognizing that the company that the substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portion keeps is the word "all," and it's talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components. 

            

And so those are, to my mind, very much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quantitative and driven in the direction of all.  I --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so you agree that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"substantial portion" is an ambiguous term? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  I --

    

  

 

 

 

I agree.  It could be interpreted in either of two ways, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is why I think the principle against 

   

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritoriality drives you in the direction of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying Congress meant only to allow U.S. patents to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operate outside the United States in very narrow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances.  And if Congress chooses to -- to create 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the kinds of international problems that will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undoubtedly arise by an overbroad interpretation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

271(f), which is what the Federal Circuit has adopted, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave it to Congress to go back and fix that, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those are -- those are issues of international relations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, it seems to me, Congress is in a much better 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position than the courts --

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But those are --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- to sort out. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- just two -- two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

components, the polymerase and then a -- a patent --

the -- a second part of a patent that we'll envision. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Clearly in that 

  

  

 

 

 

situation, there's -- there's no liability, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

it -- you know, because only one of those components --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, either one of two things happen.  Either both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of them are being put together or -- or only one of them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, and 271(f)(1) --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems -- it seems to me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that even if we -- we agree with you that quantitative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is the proper measure, you still have qualitative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coming in to balance your judgment, as in the case of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one out of two --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I -- not in one out of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

two.  One out of two, seems to me, is dictated by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

271(f)(2) that says that if it's only one, and then it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to be either especially --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no, no --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- adapted or especially --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm just talking 

  

 

 

 

 

about (f)(1). 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you 

    

  

 

 

 

 

were talking about one out of two components.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apologize. 

            

No, when you get to one -- you know, there's

but not all, that you're going to have to make some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

kinds of judgments, but it seems to me it's absolutely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical that the Court maintain a very significant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

numerical component to it.  Otherwise, what you do is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow the -- the extraterritorial principle not to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the full sway that it should be entitled to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not sure I agree 

   

  

 

 

 

 

with your understanding of the extraterritorial 

 

 

 

 

 

principle.  I don't -- I mean, do you really take that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

down into the minutiae of every little clause?  It seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me it's once the law applies, then you apply normal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles of statutory interpretation.  I think we have 

    

 

 

 

 

 

cases about that in other -- in other areas, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of what is the reach, I think, may be the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption against infringements in sovereign immunity, 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- a case I can't recall right away that said, well, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once you get over it, you know, it's over, and then you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply normal principles. 

 

 

            

And it -- I'm not sure at every turn --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay, and we know that this is a statute that obviously 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies overseas. 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yeah, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

that -- that's exactly the opposite of what the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said in Microsoft.  In Microsoft, the Court said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the issue is not simply, is this extraterritorial,

because there's no question that 271(f) operates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

extraterritorially.  The question is the sweep of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

271(f).  And -- and this Court said that it was going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret the word "component" very narrowly in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, candidly, in the same way that the -- that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court also interpreted it in the Deepsouth case, meaning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

--

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well --

  

 

 

 

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- very narrowly.  And we're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

asking you to do the same thing, which is to say, adopt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a narrow construction of the "substantial component" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language so that it drives much closer to the word "all" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and recognizes that this is meant as a --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Your real argument is just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that -- isn't it -- that you interpret it differently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than you do, and we cause a lot of problems in other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

countries. 

              

I mean, they -- they can't tell whether, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when they get one component, their lawyer is going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to know not only British law, it's going to have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know American law. 

 

 

            

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  That's exactly --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and that's a very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

practical argument. 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company

need -- well, you, it's up to you what you want to use. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I don't -- you -- the problem is, if that's the

point, why do you need this sort of grand thing about --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about a -- a presumption against extraterritoriality? 

   

   

 

 

            

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yeah --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's up to you what you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to use, but --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yeah, yeah, yeah -- well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

look, I'm -- I'm perfectly comfortable with, really, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any -- any policy argument you feel comfortable with. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That one --

 

 

            

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and it seems to me that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot be possibly what Congress intended. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think it's clear that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- that the -- the qualitative interpretation has a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greater extraterritorial effect than the quantitative 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation? 

            

What if you have a situation where -- let's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say there are ten components, and nine of them are --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are made overseas, but those are very routine things; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those are like the product that was made in the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States here.  You can buy them off the shelf. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But there's one that's very unique.  Now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's not made specifically for this device, but it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very -- it's -- it's very unique, and that's -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's made in the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yeah.  Well, you know -- from 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

my -- it -- the only device coming from the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States is a single device --

   

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. 

  

 

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and it's not -- and it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't satisfy "especially made or especially adapted." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It seems to me that (f)(2) tells you specifically, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's not within the meaning of the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I'm not sure if that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

--

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  And if Congress wants to fix 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

it, it can fix that. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not sure if that's true, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Phillips.  I mean, you're reading (f)(2) as having a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negative implication, that this is the only time when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one component can create liability, is when it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially made or especially adapted.  But these might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be just independent clauses. 

 

 

 

            

In other words, (f)(2) talks about a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

component that's especially made, whether or not it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial portion of the product.  And then (f)(1) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes in and says -- independently creates a rule for a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

component or components that are a substantial portion 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of the product. 

 

 

            

So I'm not sure why we have to read (f)(2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as creating this negative implication as to any product, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any single product, as opposed to just saying (f)(2) is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about specially made stuff, and it has nothing to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with (f)(1), which is not about specially made stuff, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and provides a different test about substantial --

   

 

 

 

 

 

substantiality. 

            

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  I mean,  in -- in the 

    

  

  

 

 

 

 

first instance, I don't -- I mean, I don't think that's 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

the more natural way to read the two together.  But then

I would go back, and -- and without trying to offend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer, go to the principle against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

extraterritoriality, and say -- say to you that if there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were two different ways that are equally plausible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret this language, you should interpret the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language to be more narrowly applicable, and therefore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less likely to interfere with extra -- with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritorial -- extraterritorial application of 

 

 

 

 

patent law. 

 

            

And so that's the reason.  It -- I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that you would have, in the abstract, been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelled to a particular conclusion, but in a situation 

   

   

 

 

 

 

where Congress has used the language talking about all

about components of the invention, not of the invention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself, the Federal Circuit twice in its opinion just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dropped out "of the components of the invention," where

it's really easy.

Honors, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Tripp. 

 

            

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACHARY D. TRIPP 

 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

here today. 

 

            

We are asking the Court to do two things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First, we are asking the Court to hold that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the supply of a single commodity component is never 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

enough.  We think that's clearly right when you look at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

(f)(1) and (f)(2) together, especially in light of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritoriality concerns. 

 

            

Second, we are asking the Court to hold that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f)(1) reaches the supply of all or a large portion of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the components of the invention, not any important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portion of the invention.  And the way we had put it is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it reaches the supply of all or something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tantamount to all of the components. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And our principal practical concerns here 

 

 

 

 

 

stem from the breadth of the Federal Circuit's ruling, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it's broad because they are asking a loaded question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's looking only at part of the picture. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If you look only at the supplied portion of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the components and you ask whether they are important or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essential to the operation or novelty of the invention, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the answer is always going to be yes.  In most 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inventions, if you take away any component, it isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to work and it's not going to be patentable.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we think you just can't come at it that way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then the second piece is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit isn't looking at all the components that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were not supplied, and so they are not asking the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comparative question of whether the person has done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything similar to supplying all of the components.

And we think that's just a critical piece here.  This is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

an anti-circumvention provision.  It was enacted to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

shore up the basic territorial restriction against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually making a patented invention in the United 

   

 

 

 

 

 

States and then shipping it abroad, and we think it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs to be interpreted with that purpose in mind. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You keep saying 

  

 

 

 

"substantially all."  Mr. Phillips argued that 

  

 

 

 

 

"substantially all" has to mean just that:  Almost all. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You, instead, in your brief, want us to keep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that vaguer, but I'm assuming that there is a minimum 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that wouldn't constitute an infringement. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. TRIPP:  Well, I think --

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  20 percent?  30 percent? 

  

  

 

 

 

40?  How -- how --

  

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  Well, so I think the -- the --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the one bright line that we -- that we are drawing here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- on the face of the statute is that one is never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough.  We think that's clear when you look at (f)(1) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and (f)(2) together the way this Court read them in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Microsoft the first time. 

 

 

 

            

Beyond that, the numbers are very important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under our test, but they are not the whole ball game. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're -- we say this on page 26 of our brief.  You could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also -- you would look not only at the numbers of the

components that were supplied and not supplied, but you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

would also look at the relative time, money, and effort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you would need to obtain the remaining components. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So if I could give --

   

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Time -- time, money, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and effort, but not significance of the component? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. TRIPP:  I think --

    

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the significance of the component would be the most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important consideration.  If --

  

 

 

            

            

MR. TRIPP:  I think -- and so the --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If it's the -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's whatever you think is not quite enough, 70 percent, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but 70 percent of the components -- I mean, that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really the core of what makes it work.  I don't know why 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you wouldn't look at that differently than if it's 70 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent, but the 70 percent are, you know, fairly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insignificant. 

            

MR. TRIPP:  Well, I -- I -- our principal 

   

   

  

 

 

 

concern or -- as I was saying, is that if you just ask 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question of whether it's significant in the sense of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is it essential or important to the novelty of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invention, I think that's just a black hole that's not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

going to get you anywhere.  And we think our approach 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

works better.

And if I could just give you two examples of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

how this would work using this particular invention? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So, if some -- if -- if the record here showed that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacturing the first component, the primer mix was, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, an incredibly difficult, time-consuming, hard, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenging process, the bulk of the work here, but that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you could get the -- the reaction buffer very quickly in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a heartbeat, you know, it's like a dime a dozen, you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

drop it into the kits and it works. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In that circumstance, if somebody supplied 

 

 

 

 

 

all the components except the reaction buffer, we think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they would clearly be liable because they would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done something that is really tantamount to supplying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of the components.  You could get that last one so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easily, but if supply -- if somebody supplied all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  To the expert testimony 

  

 

 

 

 

here that out of the five, three were significant, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's assume they supplied the three significant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components and not the two less insignificant.  What --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what would your answer be then? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  I think that would be a much 

    

   

 

 

 

 

closer case to supplying something that is tantamount to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supplying all of them under our test.  I think the --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the record here isn't -- isn't fully set out in terms of

what it is that -- that -- that makes them main or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

major. 

            

What we are trying to get at -- and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the key point to us, whether exactly how you articulate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this test I think doesn't matter all that much to us, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but what we really do care about is the idea that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs to be a comparative inquiry looking at how much 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work there is left to be done to obtain the rest of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components so that --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think once you --

    

 

 

 

 

 

once you're into your fairly complicated test, I mean, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's -- you're off to the races.  I mean, what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors do you look at, all of that, when it -- it seems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me the -- the clear argument is whether you want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call it the plain text or not, but it's just focusing on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a numerical.  It's -- it's -- it's a substantial portion 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the components, and now you're saying, well, it kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of depends on what components we are talking about.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, how much time it takes to make them.  Effort, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't quite understand what effort means in that area. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In -- in other words, you're -- you're --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're compromising the principle in a way that really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermines the force of the principle. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  No, I -- I -- I think that what 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

we are saying is that the -- the statute carries the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

24 

quantitative meeting in the sense that it needs to be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

large portion, but this is an anti-circumvention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision and then trying to figure out what it needs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for it to be a large portion, the numbers are a whole 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of the picture. 

 

 

 

              

I -- I don't want to -- I don't want to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

diminish that, but as we said on page 26, we think they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not the entire ball game, and a court look at --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could look at some qualitative factors, but that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not look at the question of whether what's left on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the table is essential or in -- or to the novelty, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the answer to that is always going to be yes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know enough 

    

 

 

 

patent law to have the answer to this.  When a -- a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim is made, what -- how is the determination made of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the elements are?  Do the elements' determinations 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort out the common from the uncommon in a patent claim? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  Not as I understand it, no.  It 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

would just be -- it would just be sorting out what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements are, and -- and the way we approach the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components of the invention, this is on page 27 of our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, is we think, as in Microsoft, that they --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they -- they are -- they need to be capable of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combination, and they are derived from the elements of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the claim.

So we think in -- in most cases it actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

won't be that difficult.  And also, as it -- you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as I was saying, I -- I think under our approach, it 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

also, frankly, wouldn't matter that way. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But why do we have to go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the details here?  I mean, it did strike me as an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance where maybe the less said by us the better.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, would you be happy if we say it means what it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says? 

            

"All or substantially all" means a whole 

   

 

 

 

 

lot.  Or what you said, tantamount to all.  So if you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get into that circumstance or you get into the "to" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance, which is there is a special ingredient 

   

 

 

 

 

 

here that has the special qualities, Mr. Manufacturer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't get close to that. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  I -- I think --

    

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All these lawyers that will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be there telling them, don't get close to that, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing will work over time.  If we set a detailed test 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down, then all those lawyers will be trying to figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out how, in fact, they actually do the thing without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite infringing the detail test. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. TRIPP:  Yeah, I -- I -- I think that --

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what worries me. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. TRIPP:  I -- I think if you said that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

one was never enough and it needs to be a whole lot, we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be quite happy.  All that we're --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  End of the case.  It says 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

one means a lot, we need a whole lot, tantamount to the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

whole lot, and good-bye. 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  Yeah, we -- we -- we would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfectly happy with that. 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. TRIPP:  All -- all that I'm trying to do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is try and give you our sort of best gloss on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why did you -- why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did you add the qualification to put in qualitative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations in addition to quantitative? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  Well, as I was trying to get at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the -- the illustrations using this particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invention, like you could get to a different answer even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you have the same number of components.  So if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody supplied everything but the reaction buffer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this one you would get cheaper and easily, we think you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be liable. 

 

 

            

But if they did everything except the primer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mix, and that's really just an enormous amount of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of what needs to happen here, then we think they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't have done something that's tantamount to

supplying all the components.  And they wouldn't be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

liable because there would be so much left to be done. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But I think, frankly --

   

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think that's your 

    

 

 

 

 

answer in this invention, but every other invention is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to have a different mix of the time, the effort, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the, you know, qualitative aspect, and it -- again, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does seem to be that once you get beyond looking at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purely quantitatively in terms of the components, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think you've made much progress in clearing up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the litigation costs and the confusion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I'm also not sure how it fits in with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the presumption against extraterritoriality, or at least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the clear application of that. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  Well, I -- I -- I think the main 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

thing that we are getting at is that -- and -- and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and again, as I was saying, I -- I don't think we have a 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong -- strong position on how exactly you -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

articulate the test.  Our concern is that it needs to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pinned to an anti-circumvention provision, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is, are you doing something that is pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close to supplying all the components?  How exactly are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because there's a reason why 

   

  

 

 

 

it's that almost all. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

28 

              

I mean, if I said to you, Mr. Tripp, a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial portion of my former clerks have gone into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government work, how many would I mean? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  Well, I -- I think with any of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

these things, the interpretation of substantial depends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely on its context and its purpose, and -- and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so this term is used in just, like, a countless 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

array of ways in the law. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you're not pinning this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on the -- on the language here, the substantial portion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means almost all? 

 

 

            

            

MR. TRIPP:  Well, no --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You are finding it from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

someplace else?  And where are you finding it from? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  So we're trying to give a gloss 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

on substantiality in light of the context and purpose of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this statue as -- as we understand all of 271(f) is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed to shore up the basic restrictioning and is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually making a patented invention in the United 

   

 

 

 

 

 

States and then shipping it abroad.  Both of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions get at that.  We think (f)(1) is situations 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that resemble the Deepsouth paradigm you're --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But then you take Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alito's hypothetical, which is a product where there's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

single product that is accounting for 90 percent of the

time and effort, and whatever the third thing you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned was. 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  I think in -- in -- in the one 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

is never enough, (f)(2) was just a complete answer to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And if Congress was going to draft a special rule 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the supply of an individual super important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

component, you would have expected to see it in (f)(2), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it's just not there.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

              

I think it's extremely important to 

 

 

 

 

understand how fundamentally the Petitioners and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government misapprehend the nature of the harm that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress addressed in 271 as enacted.  When the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Deepsouth solution was proposed by Senator Mathias, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precluded the supply with no active inducement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement, the supply of the material components of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combination that if combined in the United States would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringe. 

            

In the 1984 hearing that's discussed at page 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 of our brief, the United States -- the commissioner

of patents came in and testified that the United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objected to that interpretation.  They objected to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

topdown -- you know, not -- not totally all, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposed instead that Senator Mathias amend his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation to preclude what in essence is prohibited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestically in 271(c); that is, contributory 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement.  That is the supply of a single, specially 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

designed part where there are no substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non-infringing uses. 

 

            

That in and of itself shows you how far --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that is, in fact, 271(f)(2).  And that shows you how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

far from this "all or substantially all" paradigm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress was aiming. 

 

 

            

Now, Senator Mathias's response right 

 

 

 

 

there -- and again, we discuss it at page 29 -- was, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay, I understand that.  But what about, he said, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation of the, quote, exporter who sends specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions on how to manufacture a product which would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringe a U.S. patent notwithstanding the use of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

staple product or products? 

 

 

 

            

And Commissioner Mossinghoff's response was, 

 

 

 

 

gee, I hadn't thought of that.  That would be the analog 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to 271(b).  That is the induced infringement requirement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which makes one liable as an infringer if you actively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

induce infringement by another and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're -- but 

  

 

 

 

 

you're -- you're beginning with a dialogue at a Senate 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

hearing on the bill that's pretty weak even in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative history hierarchy, but I don't think you've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned the actual language of the statute yet. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, that -- thank you, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice.  And I'm not relying on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative history alone.  This is just one example 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, how does it help you? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because I -- it's very hard for me to believe that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Senator Mathias really wanted to interpret American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent law so that it runs the world when we've entered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into a treaty which says British patent law runs 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Britain, French France, and so forth.  I mean, is there 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something in this history which says no, no, Senator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mathias had a different view; he -- he wanted whenever 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you send any component abroad that's in a patent, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

suddenly American law governs it? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So, Justice Breyer, before I go 

   

  

 

 

 

 

back to the history, I'll take the Chief Justice's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admonition and -- and -- and focus on the language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mentioned the history, Mr. Chief Justice, 

 

 

 

 

 

only because it's rare that an exchange in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative history translates so directly to the

language of the statute as a result of that exchange 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

which we're not relying on as interpretive authority. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Senator Mathias did exactly what the United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested.  He -- he scrapped the original -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material components and came back with what is now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

271(f)(1) and (f)(2). 

 

 

            

(f)(1), modeled on 271(b), precludes active 

 

 

 

 

 

inducement in the United States, and 271(f)(2) precludes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following on 271(c). 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I know.  But I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

mean, you know, you know the objection.  I don't -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know how many of the people voting on the bill 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went back and read the Senate hearing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I understand the argument when you're 

 

 

 

 

talking about something in the Senate Report or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

House Report at a fairly high level of connection to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  But when you're wading into the particular --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the dialogues at a particular hearing in one House --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one committee of one House of the Congress, that's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real stretch. 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  Let me -- let me -- let 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me put aside that exchange.  The -- the -- in fact, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

report does acknowledge what is obvious from the face of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute and which I believe -- and this Court

provisions were modeled after induced infringement under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

271(b) and contributory infringement under 271(c).  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

-- and --

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What about the -- what about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the text of the -- of the statute?  It doesn't say "a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial portion of the patented invention."  It says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"a substantial portion of the components" of -- of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patented invention. 

 

            

So if I were to -- you know, if I were to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask, what is a substantial portion of the pages of your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, I think someone would think that's a quantitative 

   

   

 

 

 

 

determination and -- and would not think that, well, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, I think pages 12 to 16 of your brief are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly important, so that would be a substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

portion of the -- of the pages of your brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So I -- let me go first to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- to the question about the use of the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"components" rather than "invention" and then address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your -- your question on the substantial number of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages. 

            

As this Court explained in Microsoft 

 

 

 

 

 

v. AT&T, the use of the word "components" is the -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's indication that the combinations that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precluded are tangible or physical combinations, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

method patents or unembodied software.  That's how you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

know what the scope of the combination is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

            

And if Congress had said, you know, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

export one or more rather than a substantial portion, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you would still use the plural because the plural is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary to accommodate the instance in which it will, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in fact, commonly be more than one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, in your hypothetical, if you're talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about a substantial portion of units that are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

indistinguishable from each other, like pages of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, then I concede that the more natural reading is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quantitative one.  But if you look at how "substantial" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is used in the relevant provisions, the provisions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patent code that my friend on the other side is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

averting to, that is (f)(2), where substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non-infringing uses is plainly at least partly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualitative, or, as they say, the Warner-Jenkinson, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine of equivalence case where equivalency turns on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantiality of functions and methods and uses, it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also qualitative, our argument is that, again, we agree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the United States whether the extent to which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial is qualitative or quantitative depends on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the context. 

 

            

And so my only point, Mr. Chief Justice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just so that I'm not misunderstood here, is Congress --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when Congress, rather than what it started to do, which

was to count down -- enact something that counted down 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from all the components, it instead scrapped it at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States' suggestion and started from the ground up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

from contributory infringement, which is just one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

component specially designed, and active inducement, 

 

 

 

 

 

which doesn't require the supply of any components. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, in this instance, and this goes, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, to Justice Breyer's question about 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritoriality, Congress was very careful -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, as this Court recognized in Microsoft, there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritorial implications because it concerns 

 

 

 

 

exporting things for something to be done in commerce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overseas.  But Congress was very, very careful to make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conduct that the provision looks at domestic only. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is -- you have to actively induce from the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States an active inducement, this Court explained in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grokster case means active steps to encourage like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advertising or providing instructions.  You have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

support --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you do -- what do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you do with the word "all"?  I take it your argument 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be easier if that word were not in the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I don't -- I don't -- I'm 

    

   

 

 

 

 

not -- I don't -- I don't agree that our argument would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be easier.  All, you know, has the same implications one

way or the other, whether you call substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

quantitative or qualitative.  Clearly Congress was 

  

 

 

 

 

aiming at less than all. 

 

 

 

 

            

But it's a commonplace for -- for 

   

 

 

 

 

legislatures for completeness' sake to say all or fewer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than all, or all or some.  And, Justice Breyer, I do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to correct one thing.  You -- you inadvertently 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kept saying this is all or substantially all.  It's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all or substantially all.  It's all or a substantial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

portion.  And as we point out in, I believe, page 35 of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our brief, there are -- it is a commonplace locution in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State statutes and probably Federal statutes to use all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or substantially all, which is more clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quantitative.  And the State statutes, these are often 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate law statutes that talk about the sale or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alienation of all or substantially all of the assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In that instance, the stake -- the cases we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited and many others give "substantially all" a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quantitative as well as a qualitative interpretation. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it against the law? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Which I don't know.  Is it against the law for a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentholder on patent X, which has 19 ingredients, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send one commonplace ingredient over to England and say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, I -- I don't mind.  Here -- here is what my 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent's on here, but there is no British patent.  And I

would love you to make this and sell it in Britain.  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

that against American law? 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  It is not for two reasons. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

One, what -- what you have to show under 271(f) is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act of active inducement that is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What -- what he does is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just as I said.  You know, I have a great invention in 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

America.  It's patented. 

  

 

            

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  I got it. 

    

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  In England, it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

patented.  And what I really -- I see no reason why you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot make my thing over there and sell it over there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And here, by the way -- it's not mine, you know.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Smith's, my competitor's.  And -- and here, by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way, is the patent.  You see what it is, and go ahead. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sell it in England.  It's not patented there.  Can you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not do that?  Is that illegal? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So there you would ask the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question whether the component or two components --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If we leave the component 

  

 

 

 

 

 

out of it.  There are no components.  What he does is he 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sends him a list. 

   

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  That is --

  

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that illegal? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  -- not illegal, because in

addition to active inducement, you also have to supply a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

substantial portion of the component. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Exactly. 

  

 

MR. WAXMAN:  Now, after that --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So then the question 

  

 

 

 

 

becomes one of what limits Congress wanted to put in an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area where it isn't illegal.  Now, go ahead with your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument, because what they're saying --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So if the --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

  

  

 

MR. WAXMAN:  Sorry. 

  

 

If the component is -- let me use two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples:  One, I'll adopt Justice Alito's hypothetical. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Let's assume that you have a patented pharmaceutical, a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

tablet that, you know, remediates a disease.  It has --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as is commonplace in these combinations, it has one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

active ingredient, and it has five inert ingredients 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are as easy to pick up as you can imagine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The thing that is exported -- the -- the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the factory overseas, which by the way is never liable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the statute because the statute only applies to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct in the United States, they -- they're happy to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go down to their local warehouse and get the -- the five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inert ingredients. 

 

            

But the -- the -- the molecule that does all

the work, they import from the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, my friends on the other side would say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

and I believe Mr. Tripp actually did say, if that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

molecule has no non-infringing uses, it's illegal.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it's such a great molecule that it actually has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another non-infringing use, say it also powers the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injectable form of the pharmaceutical, which is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patented, that what Congress intended to do was leave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this giant doughnut hole in the rule between the active 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inducement of a commodity, that is, non-bespoke 

   

 

 

 

 

component. 

            

You have to -- you know, there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability at all.  You have to supply all or nearly all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of those inert components, or you have to show that, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, there, in fact, is a patent on the injectable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form. 

            

Or take also the example that was at issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this Court's decision in Quanta Computer.  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thomas explained for the Court that that was a case that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved the patent exhaustion doctrine where Intel was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supplying a very sophisticated microchip, microprocessor 

   

 

 

 

that was used by Quanta Computer in a computer that had, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, gazillion other components. 

 

 

 

 

            

And the question was whether Intel's sale of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the microprocessor to LGE, which then sold it to Quanta,

exhausted the patent.  And what this Court said is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

well, it didn't exhaust the patent on the combination, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because, obviously, it's only one or two components. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But because that microchip -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

microprocessor embodied the -- what it said was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inventive aspect of the computer as a whole, we are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to take account of that and hold that patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion applies.  And that would apply not only to my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pharmaceutical example or Justice Alito's, you know, one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

super important component, it would apply to a more --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, the Quanta example where there may be -- say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are 20 components, but three of them constitute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the inventive aspect. 

 

 

            

This -- the language is capacious enough and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be read in a commonsense way to make clear that that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is what Congress intended to address in (f)(1) by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacting -- provided there is active encouragement for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the combination, by enacting the analog, the -- the (f) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analog to what is active inducement under (b). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So how do you decide --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here there are five. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And only one is

there are five, and let's assume that each one is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary to the operation of the patented device, how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do you decide if one is substantial, one out of five? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I -- I'm going to answer your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, but first of all, let me simply correct a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of statements by my friend, I think in response 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to your earlier question, Justice Ginsburg. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The evidence in this case was that as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

300-plus million of the 700 million in sales, two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components were supplied.  There was a -- there was a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

concession at trial that both primers and the Taq 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

polymerase were supplied for almost half of the kits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second of all, Taq polymerase, 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding my friend's reference to what he found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the Internet, the testimony at trial is that the Taq 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

polymerase that is necessary to make these STR kits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently reliable to be commercially salable was --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there was testimony about this at trial -- was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form of very particular Taq polymerase made by Roche 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called AmpliGold Plus, which is a particular form, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

was required, and the testimony at trial was, was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufactured by Roche, Promega, and Life only in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States.  This is not your Amazon.com Taq that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now available. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

Now, as to your question, Justice Ginsburg, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

the question of whether in this case, whether it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stipulated -- it was conceded there were five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components, although I must say I'm not sure that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

right, that of the five components, one or two were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exported. 

            

And as -- and the question is how do you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know whether that one or two is sufficient?  That was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed as a factual question by the jury, and --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what were the 

  

 

 

 

 

instructions? 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Excuse me? 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How -- how in the world 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would a jury go about deciding that? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, it's interesting in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case because for other reasons, Life Technologies at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other points of the trial wanted to emphasize just how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important and unique this form of Taq was.  It didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually argue to the jury that it wasn't a substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portion.  Our lawyers argued in their -- in their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initial closing and on rebuttal, look, these kits all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had Taq polymerase.  That is a substantial component. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

There was no request that the jury be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed as to how you determine what is or isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial, and the way the Federal Circuit -- the

question for the Federal Circuit was, you know, is one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient or is two sufficient? 

 

 

 

 

43 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume the --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  If I could just finish my 

   

  

 

 

 

 

sentence, and then I'll --

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sure. 

  

 

MR. WAXMAN:  The Federal Circuit dealt with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this as a substantial evidence question.  They weren't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

holding that one is sufficient in this case.  They asked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they concluded that the answer was yes, because all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the testimony -- and there were days of testimony 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about how polymerase works and the polymerase chain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaction.  All of the testimony from our witnesses and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their witnesses emphasized just how important Taq 

 

 

 

 

 

 

polymerase was.  So I think it's substantial --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think you've 

    

 

 

 

finished -- I think you've finished your sentence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

So --

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you very much. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Justice Sotomayor? 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It seems to me that what

your adversary's position.

testimony from the briefing -- and I could be wrong, and

that, I don't know how to give meaning to "all or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantially all" the components. 

 

 

 

            

And -- and I do find the government's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

argument that it's hard to say that "substantial" means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just something that's critical to the invention.  Every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

step is critical to an invention.  You take out the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

step, the invention doesn't work. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So it's not part of our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument, and we don't think it's a fair reading of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit's decision, that says, look, if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing won't work without a component, it's a substantial 

   

   

 

 

 

 

portion of the component.  That is a caricature of what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court decided. 

 

 

            

The Court, as I said, was engaging in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

substantial -- deferential substantial evidence review. 

 

 

 

 

 

It recounted the fact that both their witnesses and our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses underscored how important Taq was.  It didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

catalogue the pages and pages of testimony explaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why that's the case.

If you're asking me the hypothetical 

 

 

 

 

 

question, if all the jury heard was -- and heard -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury heard nothing more than, there are five components 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and three are important, would that be sufficient for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury to include -- to conclude that one was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial component?  I wouldn't say so. 

    

 

 

 

            

But that's a caricature of what actually 

   

 

 

 

 

happened in an eight-day trial that was very much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused on Taq polymerase and the particular form of Taq 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was supplied here, and so this Court could, if this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court agrees with us that there may be circumstances --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe it's the Quanta example, or maybe it's Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alito's example -- in which one component constitutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- could constitute a substantial portion, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

therefore liability would apply if there were conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that amounted to active inducement, this Court could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then say, okay, we are going to roll up our sleeves and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are going to read the trial transcript and we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to look at what the evidence was in order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine whether, on the case as it was tried here, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable juror could find that Taq polymerase was that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in order to do that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would be necessary to know what "a substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portion of the components" means. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

So what would you tell a jury that means? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  So I would tell a jury, you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

know, following the dictionary definitions, that 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

"substantial" means considerable in importance and/or 

 

 

 

 

 

amount.  And then, you know, the jury will -- and you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may consider, you know, whatever factors are introduced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the case, just as when -- as this Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained, when juries have to decide things like, just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adverting to your opinion announced today, what is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality? 

            

In Basic v. Levinson, this Court rejected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the advocacy that you've got to tell the jury a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primary conduct depends on what materiality means, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what this Court said is, the contours of that will be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicated based on the facts of the case and case law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as it develops.  And in the patent context, this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been -- I wouldn't say single-minded, but very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

active in making -- in rejecting formulations that, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, help the jury determine what is obvious in light 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of prior art.  That was KSR.  What is equivalent --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial equivalent under the doctrine of equivalence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Warner-Jenkinson? 

 

            

These are all instances in which this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said the jury is given the standard, and it then applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the facts and circumstances to determine it's met, just

Here, the -- the -- this parade of horribles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, gee, anybody who supplies a component from the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States could be liable if they are in the supply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chain is -- is manifestly incorrect. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

They have to -- they have to, number one, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know that there is a patent.  They have to know that the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product is going to be combined with others.  They have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to know that the combination, if practiced in the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States, would infringe. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do they have to figure --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  They have to go beyond that and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actively encourage, send instructions or blueprints or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something, in order to do it, and a jury, properly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed, based on the evidence, has to ascertain, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gee, this really is a substantial portion.

supply chains work.  They say it's very complex.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ship out hundreds of different things.  And that seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me to give some help to the Petitioner, because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

shows that a quantitative test is simply a good baseline 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

to begin with, and the more egregious cases, it seems to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me, are under (f)(2) anyway. 

 

 

 

 

            

If we have -- if we can think of horror 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stories, they are mostly covered by (f)(2), aren't they? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I -- I don't think so, Justice 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Kennedy.  I -- I -- I guess I'd make two points with 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

respect to the supply chain. 

 

 

 

 

            

The liability in this -- this is -- this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a provision modeled on 271(b).  It also includes the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement of the domestic supply of a portion of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components.  But the sauce here, where the rubber meets 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the road, is that the -- the -- the tortious conduct is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the active -- active inducement, and somebody who was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply responding to an order for supplies is in no way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at risk in this case. 

 

 

 

 

            

The reason that (f)(2) doesn't really solve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the problem is, again, I think pointed out by Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alito's question.  You can have a molecule that has --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that does all the therapeutic work in the world, and you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get -- and it is protected against circumvention only if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it has no substantial non-infringing uses. 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

Many of the most important, innovative, 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

inventive components actually are terrific because they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have two uses.  In my hypothetical, it has a use for an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injectable form of the drug which is not patented.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not reasonable to assume that the Congress that -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was going to make a reference to the exchange in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative history, but the Congress --

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  -- that responded to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

government's suggestion like, let's just have (f)(2), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and said, well, we need -- we need (f)(1), too.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, we -- we need the analog not just to contributory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement, but to induced infringement, that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have seen these two components as so far apart 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that their gears never mesh, when, as this Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, it is a commonplace that there is overlap between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

270 -- between contributory and induced infringement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's not a complete --

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If you need -- you need 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f)(1) to -- to -- to overturn Deepsouth. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

all. 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Oh, no, no, not at all.  Not at 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What Deepsouth said is, the patent is on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combination.  If the combination occurs overseas, there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is no infringement.  There's no 271(a) liability abroad.

50 

            

What it said was, okay, 271(a) is direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement; 271(b) and (c) are what we call secondary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement.  It makes somebody liable even if they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't infringing, and because the combination overseas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't infringe the U.S. patent, we are going to enact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these two provisions that address only U.S. conduct.

you read the brief of the German companies, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said it's a fairly common thing.  We've been making

wood.  You know, just some wood, and -- and -- and we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't do it, because we'll be had up under this, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wood is an important -- some kind of -- is -- 30 percent

51 

wood or saline solution or something like that, and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

importantly, has to take the additional steps of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actively inducing. 

 

            

And in Grokster, this Court, when it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underscoring what "active inducement" means, said, 

 

 

 

 

 

quote, "Showing that the infringement was encouraged

defendant merely sells a commercial product suitable for

And that is -- that's the point.  The point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here is that we're talking about conduct that occurs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only in the United States that must require -- that must

Alderson Reporting Company

271.  And I understand that, and that's certainly a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

significant protection. 

 

            

But Congress did not take 271(b) and (c) and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53 

simply apply them in the (f)(1) context or the (f)(2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context.  What it said is, there has to be a substantial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portion, all or a substantial portion.  And that's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

fundamentally significant independent requirement that 

 

 

 

 

cannot be satisfied in a situation where you're talking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about a single component. 

   

 

            

Justice Sotomayor, I just wanted to respond 

   

 

 

 

 

to your -- you know, the three that are major, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important to recognize that two of those are clearly not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coming from the United States.  So I go back to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point you made later, which is, if there are three major 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components, how can one of them be the substantial one? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think the answer is, it cannot be under those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances. 

            

Justice Kennedy, you asked the question 

 

 

 

 

 

about, you know, what are we supposed to do in these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances as -- you know, with supply chains?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the answer is -- you know, the answer that my colleague 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave you was one that basically says, this is a recipe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the trolls of the world to go and chase down every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supply opportunity.  And do what?  Send them notice that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you're sending is a staple article that's a major

component of a piece that's in the patent, and that if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

you send -- keep sending that, you're going to violate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that patent and we're going to come after you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And what's that going to do?  That's going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to disrupt the supply chain in the United States, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ultimate effect is going to be twofold:  Either 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchasers outside the U.S. will stop purchasing from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inside the U.S., or U.S. manufacturers will go offshore. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the one thing we know that 271(f) was never intended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do was to accomplish that kind of an -- that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an impact -- negative impact on the U.S. economy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I urge the Court to reinstate the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment as a matter of law that the District Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered. 

            

            

Thank you, Your Honors. 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

(Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case in the
