CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 11-551, Salazar, Secretary of the 

Interior v. Ramah Navajo Chapter. 

(10:11 a.m.) 

Mr. Freeman. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. FREEMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. FREEMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The funding dispute in the -- in this case 

is the result of two distinctive features of the ISDA's 

statutory scheme.  On the one hand, Congress has 

required the Secretary of the Interior to accept every 

self-determination contract proposed by an Indian tribe, 

provided that the contract meets the requirements of the 

Act, without regard to the total number of contracts 

into which the Secretary must enter. 

On the other hand, in every fiscal year 

since 1994, Congress has enacted an explicit statutory 

cap on the amount of money that the Secretary may use to 

pay contract support costs under the ISDA and under 

those contracts. 

Now, we think under the circumstances, 

Congress intended the Secretary to resolve these -- the

relationship between these provisions in exactly the way 

that the Secretary has. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me, but could the 

Secretary have done anything else? 

MR. FREEMAN:  I'm sorry.  I couldn't hear 

Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could the Secretary have 

done anything else?  There's an allegation that the 

Secretary in fact pays some contractors more than their 

pro rata share, that it pays some nothing --

MR. FREEMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- so that it's in 

effect acting -- I don't want to use the word 

"arbitrarily" -- but acting in whatever its best 

interest is.  So what protects the contracting party 

from that -- from that conduct, assuming it were to be 

correct? 

MR. FREEMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  Well, the 

Secretary has promulgated a formal nationwide policy. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It says it has a policy. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Yes, and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the allegation is, 

is that it's not following it, that it's choosing to pay 

people some more than others. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Right.  And let me address

that.  The allegation is, I think, at page 9 to 10 of 

Respondents' brief.  Those allegations are, as a factual 

matter, false.  For example, they've given a couple of 

examples where 0 percent contract support costs were 

paid.  One of those examples is a contract where it had 

been entered into in that particular year.  New 

contracts are paid under a different appropriation. 

Another example is they give a case of a tribe that was 

paid 352 percent of its contract support costs. 

And let me explain, I think it's 

important to understand how --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before you do that --

MR. FREEMAN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It was my understanding 

that that system that has been described as arbitrary 

was not the one that was applicable to the years in 

question. 

MR. FREEMAN:  That's right.  At -- at the 

time of the district court's ruling in this case, from 

1994 to about 2006, the Secretary followed a uniform pro 

rata distribution methodology according to the needs of 

each of the individual tribes.  Now, that's what we 

thought the tribes wanted.  We thought that was the 

fairest way to do it. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All within the -- all

within the dollar amount that was specified by the 

Congress in the "not to exceed" language. 

MR. FREEMAN:  That's exactly right, Your 

Honor.  Yes.  So each tribe has an amount of need.  This 

is the amount that is estimated.  It's a negotiated 

figure between the Secretary and each tribe.  And it is 

undisputed that the amounts that Congress has been --

has appropriated have never been enough to pay 100 

percent of each of those figures for each member of the 

Respondent class. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Didn't we have similar 

language in Cherokee Nation?  Didn't we say that that 

language in Cherokee Nation, which was in the general 

appropriations statute, although not  in each contract, 

didn't mean that the Secretary could refuse to pay? 

MR. FREEMAN:  No, Your Honor.  We did not 

have similar language in Cherokee, if you mean the 

Appropriations Act.  It was under the same --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I don't mean the 

Appropriations Act.  I mean -- I mean the general 

statute that governed this program. 

MR. FREEMAN:  No, that's right.  And maybe 

it would be helpful if I could --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So why does it mean one 

thing there and mean something else when -- in the

Appropriations Act? 

Official 

MR. FREEMAN:  Well -- I may not be 

understanding Your Honor's question, but I -- I think it 

might be helpful if I explain what was at issue in 

Cherokee.  In Cherokee, the government was not in this 

Court making Appropriations Clause arguments.  We were 

here making a very different argument.  It was 

undisputed in Cherokee that Congress had appropriated 

enough money for the unobligated available funds, 

lawfully available funds, for the Secretary to pay all 

of the contracts that were at issue. 

Our argument -- and to be sure, we thought 

we were right -- our argument was that Congress had in 

other provisions of the Act allowed us to set aside a 

certain amount of money that, albeit lawfully available 

to pay the contracts, we thought we could use to fund 

the agency's inherent Federal operations.  And the Court 

said:  No, no, no.  These are contracts.  The money was 

lawfully available for you to pay, and there was no 

statutory restriction against you paying it, so you had 

to pay it. 

that --

And this case involves the circumstance 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, how -- what was 

our reference in acceptance of the Ferris doctrine?  And

the Ferris doctrine was almost identical to this 

situation, where Congress allotted a certain amount to 

the building of a particular dam, and the same -- we 

applied the Ferris principle and said even though they 

gave it to one type of contract, the dam, they were 

paying 1 percent less than others. 

MR. FREEMAN:  No -- no, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where they had an 

allotment adequate enough to cover that individual. 

MR. FREEMAN:  No.  I think that's not quite 

an accurate characterization of Ferris.  And it's 

important to understand what Ferris --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know what the Federal 

Circuit said.  I don't think the Federal Circuit's 

right.  If you read Ferris, that there was an 

appropriation for the dam. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Ferris was an appropriation 

for -- I think it was 40-some thousand dollars for 

improvements to the Delaware River.  And the government, 

the Army Corps of Engineers, let out a contract for 

$37,000 to dredge the river.  Then after the contract 

had been let out -- and this is critical.  If you stop 

the movie at the time the contract was issued, there was 

sufficient funds to pay that contract.  They were 

lawfully available.  We obligated them to the -- to the

contractor. 

Official 

And then what happened in Ferris was, after 

that lawful binding agreement was entered, agency 

officials decided in their discretion that they'd prefer 

not to spend the money on that, and they instead built a 

wharf or something. 

And what the Court said in Ferris -- and 

this is -- we're not -- we have no quarrel with this 

principle -- is that when the funds are lawfully 

available and you obligate them to a contractor without 

some contingency, then you can't just decide to spend it 

on something else.  That's a breach.  And it's not a 

defense to the breach that at the end of the -- that at 

the end, once you've breached the contract, there isn't 

enough money left in the appropriation to go back and 

pay them what you should have. 

That's different from this case, that there 

is not enough lawfully available money to pay every 

Respondent. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but -- but there wasn't 

in Ferris either.  I mean, that was the problem.  If the 

appropriations had been enough to cover that plus the 

later expenditures, there would have been no problem. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Your Honor, I think Ferris is 

correctly understood -- particularly given this Court's

subsequent decisions in Sutton, in Bradley, Leiter, and 

other cases, -- Ferris is correctly understood as 

saying -- and this is the proposition, incidentally, for 

which the Court cited Ferris in Cherokee.  Ferris is 

understood as saying if you've got a binding obligation 

in which you promised to pay money that is lawfully 

available, Congress gave it to you, then if you, agency 

officials, do something in your executive discretion --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Lawfully available subject 

to appropriations.  I mean, it was subject to 

appropriations. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Well, in Ferris, there were --

in fact, the contract was not made subject to 

appropriations.  And one of the things the Federal 

Circuit pointed out was that the "subject to the 

availability of appropriations" language that is now 

ubiquitous in government contracts was developed in part 

to make sure that the Ferris situation didn't later 

arise. 

But I want to underscore, if we know one 

thing in this case, we know that Congress intended for 

the Secretary not to pay any more than the amounts in 

the statutory caps. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Freeman, could I try a 

hypothetical on you?  And it's -- it really is going to

this question of what Ferris means.  So suppose that 

there's a government program, and it's to purchase 

airplanes.  And it's -- the authorization language says 

this is subject to appropriations, in the same way that 

this language does.  And the government, under this 

program, enters into 10 contracts of a million dollars 

each to buy 10 airplanes.  But then it turns out that 

Congress appropriates only $9 million, not $10 million. 

So my question is:  Now there are 10 

contractors and -- but there's a shortfall of a million 

dollars --

MR. FREEMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- do those contractors have 

contractual rights under Ferris? 

MR. FREEMAN:  I -- Your Honor, it's going to 

depend on a couple of things.  And let me -- let me 

explain.  I think, because by hypothesis in your 

hypothetical we're entering into the contracts in 

advance of appropriations, there is no right to be paid 

until the appropriations are made. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  So the appropriation 

has been made.  It's a $9 million appropriation. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Right.  And in that 

circumstance, the agency cannot pay more than 

$9 million, and there is no binding obligation,

contractual obligation, on the government to pay more. 

Let me add something, though, in response --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So -- so either one of these 

airplane manufacturers is going to not have what he 

contracted for, or all of them are not going to have 

what they contracted for, because everybody is going 

to -- their contract is going to be sliced. 

MR. FREEMAN:  And, Your Honor, the reason 

why this is not a problem in real life is that there are 

other provisions in your ordinary procurement contracts, 

under the ordinary kind of contracts that this case is 

not, that take care of that. 

And the principal one is --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  My understanding, 

Mr. Freeman, is that that is what Ferris said, was that 

Ferris said in that situation where it turns out that 

there's a shortfall but where there are contractual 

commitments, that -- that the government is bound to 

live up to those contractual commitments.  And if 

there's a shortfall, then it comes out of the Judgment 

Fund. 

MR. FREEMAN:  No.  Your Honor, it -- there 

are a couple of things there.  But let me first explain 

why as a practical matter that doesn't happen in 

circumstances that are -- are not like this scheme where

we're required to enter into every contract.  In your 

ordinary government procurement scheme, there are 

termination for convenience provisions. 

And, in fact, what happens in the 

circumstances in which Your Honor posits is the 

government terminates for convenience enough of the 

contracts to make sure that we have the money to pay. 

And if we didn't do that, it would be a violation of the 

Antideficiency Act.  And this Court has said many 

times --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So do the tribes have 

the right to stop providing the services --

MR. FREEMAN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that they've 

contracted to? 

MR. FREEMAN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do they know that 

until they know what they're getting? 

MR. FREEMAN:  Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Meaning they don't know 

what they're getting. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Well, they do know. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They signed a contract 

that says you're going to pay them for their services to 

their members and for their administrative costs.  They

incur that cost, and then at the end of the year, the 

government now says to them you've honored your part, 

but we're not going to honor ours. 

MR. FREEMAN:  No -- no, Your Honor. 

That's -- that's not correct, and let me explain why. 

First, every contract that the -- every 

member of the Respondent class signed in this case says 

that the contractor's obligation to perform the services 

that are at issue is subject to the availability of 

appropriated funds.  That's Section (1)(c)(iii) of the 

model agreement that is read into every ISDA contract. 

They further have the availability under 

Section (1)(b)(v) of that model agreement to stop at any 

point if they're worried that there's not going to be 

enough money, and seek assurances from the Secretary 

that there will be. 

Now, as to whether they know and when they 

know how much money they're going to get, that was the 

point of the 2006 distribution policy that the Secretary 

adopted.  Under the pro rata system that we used for the 

first many years, the tribes said, look, we don't know 

how pro rata is going to work out.  So, in consultation 

with the tribes, and, indeed, with the aid of several of 

the counsel for the Respondent class, we drafted a 

policy that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What does the system do 

to the 50-odd contracts that Arctic Slope, in its amici 

brief, points to that are similar to these?  Does this 

now mean that moving forward, that every government 

contractor who has a "subject to appropriations" 

language takes the risk that at some point in the middle 

of the contract, the government's going to dishonor its 

obligation and pay it less than it said it would? 

MR. FREEMAN:  No.  No, Your Honor.  And this 

is my --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do -- how do we 

differentiate those 50 other contracts? 

MR. FREEMAN:  Well, I think they were citing 

a number of different statutes in which the statutes 

provide that funding is subject to the availability of 

appropriations. 

Now, it's important to underscore, that's 

why I started with this point.  I don't believe in any 

of those statutory schemes is the government obligated 

to enter into every contract that comes in the door. 

And --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but that's partly why 

I asked you my hypothetical, Mr. Freeman, because I sort 

of wanted to see whether you would distinguish the 

hypothetical on that basis -­

MR. FREEMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- but you didn't.  You said 

no, it really doesn't matter.  Even if the government is 

not obligated to enter into contracts, if the government 

has entered into too many, too bad; we can't make those 

additional appropriations. 

MR. FREEMAN:  And, Your Honor, it is -- the 

unique features of this statutory scheme are absolutely 

important, but I want to -- I took Your Honor's question 

to be under the general appropriations principles that 

we are describing, what would the result be?  And I 

think I'm right, but I should also add, as I said 

before, there are very strict fiscal controls in 31 

U.S.C. 1501, et sequitur, that make clear and prevent 

the circumstance that Your Honor describes --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm sorry, I'm not clear on 

what this hypothetical is.  I thought her 

hypothetical -- Justice Kagan's -- was a situation where 

the statute says, Mr. Secretary, you can spend no money 

beyond what is appropriated. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But the contract doesn't 

mention it.  That's Ferris. 

I thought that the -- the real world is, in 

contracting, you typically have both a statute that says

don't pay more than is appropriated --

MR. FREEMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and in the contract, it 

says, "subject to appropriation," putting the 

contracting party on notice. 

MR. FREEMAN:  That's right.  And -- and --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So which were you 

answering? 

MR. FREEMAN:  I -- with respect to 

Justice Kagan, I believe we had a colloquy in which I 

said that because in her hypothetical we were entering 

into the contracts in advance of appropriations, they 

would have to be made express -- the contracts 

themselves would have to be subject to the availability 

of appropriations in the contracts. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The words in the contract 

are "subject to appropriations." 

MR. FREEMAN:  Yes.  And without that, it 

would be a violation of the Antideficiency Act --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

MR. FREEMAN:  -- yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So in that world --

now we get to the question -- in that world, what 

happens when 15 people each enter into such a contract 

for $100,000 each, and the appropriation turns out to be 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

too small to pay all of them, but big enough to pay 

some? 

MR. FREEMAN:  Because, Your Honor, what I was 

trying to answer is that, in your ordinary contractual 

scheme, the government solves that problem in a very 

straightforward way.  We terminate for convenience the 

contracts -- enough of those contracts to ensure that we 

have no obligations beyond the available appropriations. 

Now, we can't do that here, which is why 

this is ultimately a question of congressional intent. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why don't we let 

Congress fix it?  There are so many ways that 

Congress could fix this problem directly.  By doing a 

line item allocation, it could take away the obligation 

to enter into these contracts and fully fund.  It could 

be much more direct --

MR. FREEMAN:  Your --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- than it's being, 

given the interpretation that you're advancing. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Your Honor, I think it's 

important to understand what -- and maybe it would help 

if I took a minute to explain this -- what Congress was 

trying to do in this statutory scheme. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It was trying -- it was 

trying to tell the tribes, we're honoring our obligation

by paying you the costs, but we're really not going to 

do it because we're going to let the government give you 

less? 

MR. FREEMAN:  No.  Look, Congress could --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have to assume 

Congress intends what it says.  It intends to obligate 

you to enter into contracts that -- that give -- make 

you commit to paying their costs, correct? 

MR. FREEMAN:  Not with -- yes.  But 

450j-1(b) says, "notwithstanding any provision of this 

Act, all funding under this Act is subject to the 

availability of appropriations." 

And let me explain why Congress would 

have wanted to enact this statute that has some unusual 

features.  Congress, of course, could have said, we want 

to give every tribe the opportunity to enter -- to 

provide services in its own name to its own people, but 

we're going to do this on a regular contract basis, 

meaning we'll just give us -- some to the Secretary. 

The Secretary signs contracts as they come in until he 

doesn't have any money left.  And then any tribe after 

that who asks for a -- for a contract, the Secretary 

says no, we don't have the money to do it. 

But Congress chose a -- a different 

approach.  Congress wanted, as a matter of

self-determination, to require the Secretary to give 

every tribe who wants the ability to do this the 

opportunity to do it.  But if it didn't then say all 

funding is subject to the availability of 

appropriations, the result would be that the government 

would be exposed to a liability that Congress could not 

estimate, because the ability of these tribes to pay for 

overhead costs and whatever varies tremendously from 

tribe --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  To what extent do you --

do you rely on -- you haven't mentioned it up until now, 

but Congress, in these appropriations, said "not in 

excess of." 

MR. FREEMAN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It wasn't just a general 

"subject to appropriations."  It was a specific amount, 

the Secretary shall not pay in excess of a certain 

dollar amount for these costs. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I had exactly the same 

question.  The "not to exceed" language, which I think 

is the word, "not to exceed," hasn't been mentioned by 

you yet because -- maybe you haven't had time. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Right. 

(Laughter.)

difference between this and even the Cherokee case. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so my question is --

is the same as Justice Ginsburg's.  Isn't a principal 

part of your argument that this contract said not to 

exceed, and then the sums differ from year to year, but 

let's say $95 million? 

MR. FREEMAN:  That -- that's exactly right, 

Your Honor. 

I mean -- and what I -- what I tried to 

answer to a question earlier, it is absolutely clear 

what Congress was trying to do here.  Congress said not 

to exceed a specific sum from year to year --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When the Congressional 

Budget Office, or whatever agency it is that figures out 

whether there's a deficit and, if so, of how much, do 

they look at "not to exceed," and do they take that 

amount seriously?  Or --

MR. FREEMAN:  Oh, oh, absolutely, 

Your Honor.  And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the -- but the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the consequence 

9  on the ground is that, if I'm a tribe and I want this

money, and I figure out that this is going to cost me 

11  $80,000 --

12

13

 MR. FREEMAN:  Yes. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- I sign a contract 

14  and say, this is going to cost me $100,000, because I 

15

know there isn't going to be $100,000.  There's only 

16  going to be $80,000, and that's what I need, right? 

17

 MR. FREEMAN:  Well, in fact, it can't work 

18  that way, Your Honor, because the amounts are limited by 

19  statute to the reasonable and allowable costs that are 

20

not duplicative of the principal program funds, the 

21  funds to run the program --

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but it's --

23  well, if 80,000 is reasonable, the only way to get that 

24  is to ask for 100?

that we haven't put in to the -- we haven't offered them 

enough money for their contract support costs, they are 

allowed to decline the offer that we make.  And they 

can -- unusually, for government contractors, they can 

file a separate lawsuit before entering into the 

contract to litigate whether the terms are sufficient. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Freeman, where did 

these caps come from?  Did the agency initiate them? 

Or, there's a chart -- perhaps I don't understand it 

correctly.  It's on page 210 of the joint appendix.  It 

does -- it does seem to indicate that it was the BIA 

that proposed the cutback. 

MR. FREEMAN:  The caps come from Congress, 

Your Honor.  Respondents have make -- have made an 

argument at the end of their brief that the government 

should be liable here notwithstanding the caps because 

the BIA hasn't requested sufficient funding from 

Congress -- or, rather, the President hasn't requested 

sufficient funding from Congress. 

That argument, we think, is baseless for a 

number of reasons.  And just as a factual matter, the 

GAO has done some studies of this.  There are reports in 

the joint appendix explaining why BIA has not in every 

year asked for what turned out to be enough money. 

And that's because these -- this funding is

we're required to take into -- we are required to accept 

every contract that comes in the door, BIA may estimate 

and make its best available estimate, and OMB and the 

President may accept that if he chooses, but it still 

may turn out not to be enough. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not really relevant 

here anyway, is it? 

MR. FREEMAN:  No, it is not.  It is not 

relevant, Your Honor.  No.  That's right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What I don't understand is 

why the language "not to exceed" is any different from 

Congress appropriating $900,000.  You mean the world 

changes if -- if Congress, instead of just appropriating 

$900,000, authorizes the Secretary to expend not to 

exceed $900,000?  Why --

MR. FREEMAN:  I don't think in that 

circumstance there would be any difference.  Here, the 

reason why it's different is that this is ultimately a 

question of what Congress was trying to do.  There's no 

constitutional argument that Congress can't enact these 

kind of caps, and we know from the "not to exceed" 

language that Congress was being as emphatic as it 

could.

$900,000 is pretty emphatic, if that's all you 

appropriate. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Right.  And just -- it's just 

this is the way, as an ordinary matter, that in 

appropriations Congress expresses an internal cap.  It 

said --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that runs you right into 

Ferris.  Then you're saying that there's no difference 

between the standard Ferris-type appropriation, which is 

just an amount of money, and this kind of appropriation, 

which is up to or not to exceed that amount of money. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Your Honor, Ferris we think is 

inapplicable just to this type of statutory scheme where 

we're required to enter into the contracts, and there's 

a limited sum available.  That's Judge Dyk's reasoning 

in the Federal Circuit.  But let me put that aside for 

the moment and address Ferris directly. 

As I said before, Ferris is about the 

circumstance in which there are enough available funds 

in the first instance to pay the contractual 

obligations. 

Now, Ferris does not and cannot stand for 

the proposition that an executive officer, looking at 

the amount Congress made available in the first 

instance, can bind the Treasury to pay more than

Congress has expressly stated he may bind it to.  This 

Court has said many, many times --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I take it the Respondents' 

position is that the contracting officer says, now, this 

is going to go over the not to exceed amount, but not to 

worry, just sue us under the Judgment -- just sue us 

under the Judgment Act. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Right.  And there is no reason 

to think that Congress contemplated such a scheme, which 

would amount to essentially giving full contract support 

cost funding, but only for the tribes who have the 

resources and sophistication to sue, minus litigation 

costs.  That makes no sense at all.  When Congress says 

"not to exceed," a certain amount of money may come out 

of the Treasury --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It makes sense if 

you're looking at the reality of the budgeting process 

because in one case, that line item appears on the 

Department of Interior budget; and in the other case, it 

appears somewhere else in the Judgment Fund budget.  And 

they can say it's not our fault.  The Judgment Fund --

the Court made us do it --

MR. FREEMAN:  Well, I don't think so, 

Your Honor.  The Judgment Fund is not a new thing.  The 

Judgment Fund is available only to pay judgments validly

Now, we don't dispute that it's available to 

pay breach of contract damages.  But of course, a breach 

of contract requires a violation of -- a violation, a 

failure to perform a binding contractual promise. 

Now, we think we've performed our promise 

here because our -- our promise was to pay the sums that 

Congress made lawfully available.  And we think that, to 

the extent Respondents think we promised to pay more 

than Congress explicitly said could be available, the 

Secretary had no authority to enter into that promise. 

Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's true of every 

contract.  That's where I'm getting stuck on what your 

theory is.  The Antideficiency Act says you can't spend 

more than you're given. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So every single 

contractor, under your logic, should know that when they 

sign a contract, the government can break it because if 

it doesn't have enough funds, it can't pay. 

MR. FREEMAN:  And, Your Honor, that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- so there's no 

real logic to your argument, other than to say we 

can't -- we're -- if the contract says "subject to

appropriations," let's do away with Ferris, let's do 

away with Cherokee Nation, and --

MR. FREEMAN:  No, no --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- it just means that we 

pay you what we can. 

MR. FREEMAN:  No.  That -- that is 

emphatically not true.  As -- as an initial matter, as 

I've tried to explain before, there are very strict 

requirements in the government's contracting processes, 

such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that limit 

the ability of the government to make promises it 

can't keep, particularly with regard to funding. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But what you're saying 

is you make two promises on the ISDA.  We're going to 

pay you your support costs, your administrative costs, 

in full, and we're going to retain the right to break 

that promise.  That's really what you're saying the ISDA 

says. 

MR. FREEMAN:  No.  That's not right, 

Your Honor.  And I -- I'll answer this, and then I'd 

like to reserve the balance of my time. 

The ISDA says our promise is to pay you what 

Congress lets us pay you.  It's not breaking our promise 

to limit it to appropriation.  It is keeping our 

promise.

MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

I guess I'd like to start on the Ferris 

doctrine, because it seems to me that is the fundamental 

issue in this case. 

And the principle of Ferris -- and it's 

interesting to me that counsel for the government never 

once makes any reference to the Comptroller General's 

interpretation of the Ferris doctrine, which in the 

Redbook says, as plain as day, that in circumstances 

like this one, where the government has more contractors 

than it had -- than one, and those contractors are

subject to an appropriation, and it cannot exceed that 

appropriation -- I think all of that language, frankly, 

is implied anyway -- the contract --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you think now -- you 

say you don't want us to mention "not to exceed" in our 

opinion --

MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, no.  This --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- other than to say that 

it's irrelevant? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  "Not to exceed" has a 

very significant role to play, Justice Kennedy, 

because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does the Redbook talk 

about "not to exceed" as being any different from 

general appropriations? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  The place where "not to 

exceed," I think, carries particular significance is 

that in the ordinary situation, we would be entitled to 

seek injunctive relief to take money from other sources 

within -- within the budget and get an injunction.  And 

that's very unique to the -- to this context. 

Ordinarily, government contractors cannot seek 

injunctive relief.  This "not to exceed" language --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does the Redbook --

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- deprives us of that.

and it says they will not be paid, it shall not exceed 

$4 million, and then you discover that the amount of the 

contracts of the same kind in this category are more 

than $4 million, I want to know where in the Redbook it 

says that they get paid more than $4 million. 

That's all.  That's fairly simple. 

And if that's -- if that's normal practice, 

it must be there's a lot of authority for it.  So I -- I 

just want to know what to read. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, here, 6-45 says, "if a 

contract is but one activity under a larger 

appropriation, it is not reasonable to expect the 

contractor to know how much of that 

appropriation remains available." 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But they aren't talking 

about there where it says specifically in the contract 

"subject to appropriations."  At least I think they're 

not. 

Now, I would like you right now to tell me, 

no, you're wrong; it does say that. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it says, if Congress 

appropriates a specific dollar amount for a particular 

contract --

Brandeis, which comes out the opposite way, did have a 

line appropriation.  And I thought that just refers to 

the fact that because there's a line appropriation, the 

contractor's on notice. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Exactly. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Exactly. 

And when you do business with the government 

over a period of years, and it says "subject to 

appropriation," not necessarily you but your lawyer,

appropriation is or whether it was made.  And that's

isn't the practice.  That's all I'm asking. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I guess I don't 

understand exactly how to answer that question, Justice 

Breyer, because --

JUSTICE BREYER:  By showing me where in the 

law it says -- and I don't want to repeat the question 

for the third time, but it says --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wish you would.  I've 

lost the question. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, here sometimes not 

everyone pays sufficient attention to these very clear 

questions. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm doing my best, 

Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where -- look, 

hypothetical.  Four people, four identical contracts, 

the words appear, "subject to appropriation." 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Each is for a million 

dollars. 

Then you read the appropriation that was 

later made, and in that statute, it says, we hereby 

appropriate $3 million, and -- it is, the payments are 

36

 Okay?  Something like that. 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All I want is the authority 

that says each of those four people can come in and get 

6  the $1 million, totaling $4 million.  I want the 

7  authority that says that. 

8

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I mean, I would read Ferris 

9  as if --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Ferris -- it did not say 

11  anything about it in the contract. 

12

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, Ferris has a 

13  limitation.  The -- the government has already told us 

14  that "subject to appropriation" is implicit in every --

15

in every agreement anyway, so there's nothing special 

16  about putting in the words "subject to appropriation." 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, there certainly is. 

18  Putting in the words gives the lawyer notice. 

19

20

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, again, the only notice 

it gives is that there has to be enough money when you 

21  look at the appropriation to cover your contract. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ferris did not say, as I 

23  recall, that you can't expect the contractor to have 

24  notice that appropriations have been limited.  It said 

25

you can't expect them to have notice as to how much of

the expenditures under that appropriated act have been 

spent.  Isn't that the only thing it required notice of? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would think, if you sign 

a contract, you better be sure that there are 

appropriations for it. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Clearly.  And that -- I mean, 

and, Justice Breyer, the Court's opinion in Cherokee 

said that the primary purpose of the subject to 

availability clause is to deal with the situation where 

you enter into the agreement ahead of the fiscal year, 

and so everybody knows that if Congress, for whatever 

reason, decides not to appropriate any money, there's no 

deal, and nothing happens. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, in your view, if the 

tribe comes to the government, and they say, look, we've 

been looking at what you've done with the other tribes, 

you've appropriated $95 million, and the appropriation 

says "not to exceed $95 million," but go ahead and make 

this contract with us anyway, no one cares.  And you 

say, go ahead and make it.  Right? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, it seems to me 

it's the government's problem to sort out. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's your -- that's your 

position, isn't it? 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But, again, put it in 

2  the context, Justice Kennedy, of the individual tribe.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You can't get it from 

4  Cherokee.  I mean, yes, there's Ferris, and then 

5

6

7

Cherokee --

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- is relying on Ferris. 

8  But Cherokee was very careful to point out that there 

9  were funds to cover the cost --

10

MR. PHILLIPS:  No question about it, Justice 

11  Ginsburg.  I don't think this case is controlled by 

12  Cherokee. 

13

 I do think Cherokee answers the question of 

14  how far can you carry the "subject to availability" 

15

language.  I don't think it gets the government anywhere 

16  near home. 

17

 And then the question is, what do you do 

18  with the "not to exceed" language.  And what I would suggest 

19  there is that, that's no different, frankly, from Ferris 

20

or any other situation, because what the -- Congress 

21  operates against the backdrop of Ferris, which is a 

22  120-plus-year-old doctrine that has been allowed to stay 

23  in place by Congress for that entire time.  And as the 

24  Chamber of Commerce tells us, this is a rule that every 

25

contractor takes as an article of faith in dealing with

the United States Government. 

Official 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, am I correct that 

what the government is arguing is that the fact that 

this limitation was included in the particular contract 

makes it different from Ferris? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it's hard to make that 

argument because the -- the "not to exceed" language, at 

least, that comes out of the -- that's in the 

appropriations provision.  That's not in the contract 

itself.  The contract itself simply says "subject to 

appropriations." 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which Ferris did not.  Did 

the Ferris contract say that? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  It's -- Ferris doesn't have 

the "subject to appropriation," but the Ferris contract 

says the appropriation limit is X. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It does?  Where do you 

get -- I couldn't find the contract.  The language in 

Ferris is, "a contractor who is one of several persons 

to be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable 

with knowledge of its administration."  True. 

Now, Dyk says, in his opinion, that one 

difference from Ferris is they wrote the idea into the 

contract, saying you're subject to appropriation to 

get to make that lawyer chargeable with knowledge.

And the second thing in Ferris is that it 

was an individual who went off on his own in the 

administration and paid money that he shouldn't have 

paid.  It should have been over here for the contract. 

In this case, it is an instance where 

Congress itself required the money to be paid, as it was 

paid, and didn't provide enough.  Okay. 

So that's where I am with Ferris, which is a 

big question mark.  And I guess you could talk about 

that, but all I wanted to know is what is well 

established in this field. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want to write 

something that suddenly upsets what is well established. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Okay.  Well, I take this, 

then, straight from the Redbook again.  "It is settled 

that contractors paid from a general appropriation are 

not barred from recovering for breach of contract, even 

though the appropriation is exhausted." 

And so even though -- and there's 

nothing in -- there's no limitation --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that is that as it 

says in the contract, you are barred, you are barred 

from recovering if we don't appropriate enough money. 

Should it say that wouldn't matter?  Is that right?

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it would say that if 

you don't appropriate enough money for the specific 

contract, yes.  I think that's clearly what Sutton 

holds.  Is that if -- if Justice Scalia and I have an 

agreement, and the -- the appropriation goes to $100 for 

our agreement, and the contract says $500, I'm out of 

luck for the extra $400. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Phillips, this is an 

unusual situation with the tribes, because in the normal 

not to exceed appropriation by Congress, the government 

rightly says we have the power to not contract.  And in 

military contracts and others, we have a for convenience 

cancellation.  We have all sorts of things that protect 

us from the deficiency. 

But this is a unique situation because the 

government, on the one hand, despite their protestations 

to the contrary, are forced to accept these contracts. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And on the other hand, 

Congress is saying, don't pay more on them.  We're 

telling you to accept more payment than we're going to 

give you. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Should we create a 

special rule for this -- why shouldn't we create a

special rule for this unique situation? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Because essentially what 

you're doing is putting the backs of this problem --

putting the burden of this problem on the backs of -- of 

innocent contractors who --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, is it --

MR. PHILLIPS:  Who entered into in good 

faith these agreements. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, is it just a 

question of our creating a new rule, or rather, is the 

proposition whether the tribes, when they entered into 

this, should have realized that because of the 

peculiarity of these contracts that they had to be 

entered into, that the rule which otherwise would apply 

does not apply?  It ought to be a question of 

expectation of the tribe, should it not? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I would -- I would 

suggest a couple things about that.  I mean, I think in 

general it's reasonable to look for the -- obviously, 

the intent of the parties and the expectations of the 

parties. 

This case went off on summary judgment that 

we lost.  I mean, even on a -- so we didn't have an 

opportunity for any analysis of this.  So the reality 

is, is that from the tribe's perspective, they

recognize, because of Ferris, and because of the way the 

Comptroller General has interpreted Ferris, that they 

are under a duty to make sure that there is an 

appropriation that covers this contract, that the 

amount, purpose, time requirements are all satisfied 

with enough money to accomplish that. 

And then, of course, we have the obligation 

to perform, which, of course, that's the other half of 

the equation here. 

And, Justice Sotomayor, that's why I 

wouldn't say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you don't -- you 

don't have the obligation to perform.  I mean -- right? 

In a term of the contract, that their lack of 

sufficient appropriations, performance by either party 

is excused. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, that -- yes, 

Justice Ginsburg.  But the problem is, we don't know the 

answer to that until after the year of performance is 

done, or at least months into the performance.  And 

sometimes, literally after we've already performed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose you did know. 

Suppose the tribe knew that the 95 million -- let's 

assume that that's the not to exceed amount -- had 

already been obligated.  Could the tribe then go ahead

and make the government -- a contract with the 

government, and would the government have to make that 

contract, in your view? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  I mean, that -- that is the 

Southern Ute case.  And I -- and certainly, you can make 

an argument to that.  The government has an argument on 

the other side. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it your argument that 

the answer to that is yes? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  The argument is, it appears 

that Congress intended to require them to enter into 

that agreement.  You know, the idea of Congress 

requiring the -- an official to enter into an agreement 

that violates a criminal statute is at least a -- a 

difficult concept to sort of wrap your mind around. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Isn't this more specific 

language than the general language?  Doesn't this 

specific language, "not to exceed," supersede the 

general obligation to make the contract?  Otherwise, 

it's meaningless.  The "not to exceed language" is 

meaningless. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  No, but --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You say it's meaningless. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  No, Justice Kennedy.  I told 

you what the meaning of the "not to exceed" language is. 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1

 The "not to exceed" language ensures that we 

2  cannot turn to the BIA or anyone else at the Interior 

3  and say, give us money from another source in order to 

4  pay for our contract.  And we can't use the injunctive 

5

relief that's otherwise available to us for that 

6  purpose. 

7

 So that language has very significant 

8  importance in limiting what our options are --

9

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Phillips --

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- in a circumstance where we 

11  are not being paid enough under the -- the agreement. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- do I understand your 

13  position to be that, yes, the cap has meaning, because 

14  in order to exceed the cap, the tribe has to sue?  So, 

15

any tribe that sues, for any tribe that sues, the cap is 

16  meaningless?  It's only for the ones who are not 

17  sophisticated enough to sue.  They're just stuck with 

18  what Congress said. 

19

20

 So it seems to me that would be a very 

bizarre scheme to set up that, that you have a cap, but the 

21  cap is meaningless if you bring a lawsuit. 

22

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  I -- I mean, I -- it 

23  seems to me that we can't -- I mean, aside from bringing 

24  a lawsuit, I mean, we -- we could go to the Secretary 

25

and say, we don't have enough money to satisfy our

contract, would you take money from some other source in 

order to accomplish that. 

Because, in the ordinary course, that's not 

uncommon to re -- re-jigger the -- the appropriation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think it protects 

these -- these unsophisticated tribes who don't know 

enough to sue by not allowing anybody to sue? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, that -- yes, there 

is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does that make their 

situation better somehow? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  To be sure, that would not 

make our situation any better, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  My question is whether 

the cap was meaningless.  And I think your answer is, 

yes, for anyone who sues, the cap is meaningless. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  No.  It -- I don't -- I 

don't think it does that.  It -- it places inherent 

limitations -- I mean, it says specifically that the 

Secretary is not authorized to shift money around in 

order to take care of this particular problem in this 

particular year that otherwise would be available to us. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You just go to the

that the burden of it will not fall on the tribes.  It 

is -- it does mean that. 

But -- and let's be clear about this.  The 

Judgment Fund -- this is not simply going to the 

Judgment Fund and asking for our contract support costs 

to be paid.  Our argument here is that there has been a 

breach of contract, and we're entitled to the damages 

for the breach of contract, whether those are reliance 

damages or restitutionary damages, whether we -- whether 

we're supposed to get what we expected out of the deal, 

or put back in the position we would have been in --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Phillips, if you look at 

this situation, it seems pretty clear that Congress did 

want to do something, which was to limit the amount of 

money that was going to the tribes under these 

contracts. 

Do you think that there's a way that 

Congress can do that --

MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, sure.

How could Congress do that?  You know, if --

if -- if they can't do it this way, how could they? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the easy way would be 

to impose specific limitations in -- in every one of the 

contracts, which -- which, frankly, if you read 

appropriations bills, which I hate to say I have 

occasionally done --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  When you say "specific 

limitations," what would that look like? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  It would look like -- for the 

agreement between the United States and Ramah Navajo 

for -- for contract support costs in this 

particular -- for taking over the police department, the 

contract support costs shall not exceed $150,000, 

period.  That's the total appropriation. 

And if we look at our contract -- and 

there's a specific number in the contract -- and that 

contract number says $174,000, then we know that we're 

out of luck for the $24,000.  We've been put on specific 

notice --

JUSTICE ALITO:  For any particular year, are 

they all entered into it at about the same time?

JUSTICE ALITO:  For any particular fiscal 

year, are all of these contracts entered into by a 

particular date? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  Nothing is all that 

easy, obviously.  Some of them enter into it on a fiscal 

year basis.  Some of them enter into it on a -- on 

a -- on a calendar year basis. 

And, frankly, the -- part of the problem is 

when does the government get around to signing these 

agreements. 

And, also, there are 12 regions.  I mean, 

part of the reason -- I would like to spend a second 

talking about the comment that, you know, we have this 

fair and equitable scheme in place in which we're 

allocating moneys out, when the reality is, is that 

there is substantial evidence in the record, even though 

we have not had an opportunity to make a full record, 

that the -- that the -- that the Bureau makes mistakes 

in 40 percent of these contractual arrangements. 

And I know my -- my colleague's going to 

dispute that, but the truth is we've known that for 

years.  They just make mistakes, and people get 

impaired -- their contract rights are impaired on that 

basis. 

This is not some kind of an equitable scheme

that's operating here.  There are 12 different regions 

operating in 12 different ways.  Some people get money, 

some people get 300 percent of theirs, some people get 

0 percent of theirs. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Phillips, how does 

Congress do this without upsetting the entire 

scheme?  Knowing that these contracts are not all signed 

on one day, that there are 12 regions, that the 

negotiations go over time, how could Congress achieve 

the scheme that the government wants now?  How would it 

write this contract? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the easy way 

would be to take away the requirement that the 

government has to enter into all of these contracts at 

the request of the tribe.  And -- and -- and that's 

clearly available.  If they want to go down that path, 

they can do that in a heartbeat.  And then they have all 

of the discretion they want -- they want to apply under 

these circumstances. 

So, I mean, there's -- obviously, there is a 

bit of, as we said in the brief, schizophrenia.  And I 

have -- I have some misgivings about describing Congress 

that way, but there is some schizophrenia in how they 

approach this problem.

provision in the -- in the law which -- which says that, 

where appropriated funds are inadequate to cover the 

totality of -- of costs under this statute, it will be 

apportioned as follows? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  Congress could --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or the Secretary will 

apportion it?  That's all it would take.  You wouldn't 

even have to do it contract by contract.  Right?

that's the message, I thought, from Justice Sotomayor, 

is why don't we let Congress fix the problem and allow

to resolve the contract dispute that's properly, 

obviously, before the Court at this point. 

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think -- I think 

this may have been asked, and I'm not sure of the -- I 

understood the answer. 

This is -- is this on an ongoing, 

forward-looking basis?  In other words, you enter into 

the contracts, and then you wait and see whether there 

are appropriations? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  Typically what happens 

is you enter into the agreement sometime just before the

close, because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, so doesn't it 

make -- I mean, doesn't the system that the government 

is operating under make a lot of sense?  Because let's 

say the tribe says, look, we need a million dollars. 

The Secretary agrees to it.  And then I assume the two 

of them get together and say, well, we'll try to get the 

appropriation for it.  You know, you understand we may 

not get it, but this is how much you need, we'll go back 

and get it.  If you get it, that's great.  If you don't, 

well, then that's --

Justice, if they did that on a -- on a tribe-by-tribe, 

contract-by-contract basis, I -- I wouldn't have any 

problem with that, because then you're on notice. 

But when they say to you, okay, fine, 

here's -- you know, this is -- here is your contract 

support cost provision, there's a specific number in 

there, 1.3.78 dollars and 63 cents, that's what you 

ought to get, and we get an appropriation that comes 

back in that says the government will -- that, you know, 

we have appropriated $100 million for contract support 

costs. 

There are 330 other tribes out there 

potentially with contracts that are involved here.  It 

is -- and -- and just to put it in context, we are 

talking about -- you know, many of these tribes are in 

incredibly remote situations.  They don't have access to 

all the other information about what's going on.  And 

the real question is, should you impose --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you 

suggesting that --

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- that on the tribes? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you suggesting 

that Congress has to go through each of those contracts 

and say, this is how much we're going to appropriate, 

this is how much -­

MR. PHILLIPS:  I think that's -- I actually 

think that would be the fairer way to do it.  And I 

don't think it would be as burdensome as -- as your 

question implies, because, again, what else does staff 

have better to do than to sit down and put all those 

appropriations together? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the question 

is whether it's the staff in Congress that's going to do 

it or the staff at the Department of the Interior? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I suppose 

Congress can reasonably determine that the people at 

Interior know better about how to do it than we do. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But then -- then they 

could do it by -- by -- expressly by reference. 

I mean, if, in fact, Interior has set it out 

that way and has it all done, then they can just 

incorporate it into the statute anyway. 

I mean, there are simple ways to do it. 

There are broader ways to do it.  And as I said to 

Justice Sotomayor, clearly Congress could simply, you 

know, absolve the government of its responsibility to 

enter into any contract that a -- that a -- when an 

Indian tribe shows up at their doorstep. 

All of those seem to me preferable than

saying to the tribes, after they have fully performed 

their side of the deal, okay, I'm sorry, we're not going 

to pay you. 

this --

The -- the other thing that's odd about 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You keep 

saying that, but I thought in your earlier answer, you 

said that the contracts are generally signed by the time 

of the appropriation. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where is that in the 

cycle of performance?  Is that at the beginning of 

performance? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  That's at the beginning of 

performance.  But -- but what we find out about the 

notices that we are -- that we have later receive is at 

some point, we're sending you 75 percent in some 

situations, or we're going to send you exactly the same 

amount of money you got last year, even though that 

won't cover it. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the tribes -- even 

when the appropriation comes out, they don't know how 

much the Department has contracted with other tribes. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  We haven't --

until they get that notice later on. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Exactly.  And, candidly, 

assume that -- either one of two things will happen. 

Either we will ultimately be paid in full, which has 

happened -- I mean, the last year, they were in fact 

paid in full.  Or alternatively, that they will have 

access to the Judgment Fund in order to -- to get the 

recovery they are otherwise entitled to. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Phillips, do you 

think -- and the long question here is what did Congress 

want.  And what -- one answer might be Congress wanted 

exactly what the government says it wanted.  But another 

answer might be something different, that actually, 

Congress wanted there to be unlimited funds for these 

tribes, but that it wanted to shift the costs of some of 

those funds to the Judgment Fund outside of the Interior 

budget. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you -- I mean, do you 

contest the government's view of what Congress wanted 

here?  And if so, how? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think the question is 

it's unclear what Congress really wanted in this case, 

and therefore, you ought to construe the -- the scheme 

in a way that is most favorable to the tribes.  And if

that means that the scheme operates so as to protect the 

integrity of the appropriations process and the spending 

process for a particular year, and prevents us from 

being able to seek relief outside of this contract 

support cost appropriation limitation, that makes 

perfect sense to me, leaving open obviously the 

availability of the Judgment Fund at the end of the day 

so that the tribes do not in fact have to bear the full 

burden of -- of this arrangement as opposed to -- as 

opposed to anyone else. 

I mean, that's -- again, we do 

provide -- we've performed the services.  We don't know. 

We do it in good faith.  Under those circumstances, it 

seems to me that's the classic situation in which we 

should receive full compensation. 

If there are no further questions, Your 

Honor, thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. FREEMAN

much they're getting until some point further into the 

performance cycle? 

MR. FREEMAN:  In part, Your Honor.  Let me 

explain.  As I mentioned earlier, for the first many 

years in this scheme, we did a uniform pro rata 

distribution methodology.  The tribes came to us and 

said, look, that's a problem for us because we don't 

have any budget transparency; we can't see how much 

we're going to get.  So we adopted this policy in 2006. 

And one of the principal elements of that policy is that 

it guarantees that, if -- as long as Congress 

appropriates as much money as it did in the previous 

fiscal year, which it generally has, the tribe will get 

immediately, like within 2 weeks, the exact amount of 

money that it received in the previous year.  And that 

money comes immediately.  They can use it however they 

want.  It's not subject to apportionment.  Unlike most 

Federal agencies, we don't dole it out.  They get it 

right away. 

Now, the question then becomes what to do 

with any additional money that Congress has 

appropriated, and the policy provides for distribution 

of that money on what we call a bottoms-up basis.  We 

give it to the tribes that are the farthest away from 

100 percent of funding.  That resolution was negotiated

with the tribes and, indeed, with some counsel for 

Respondents.  It's, we think -- and I might be wrong 

about this -- but we think that that's the solution that 

the tribes want, if the caps have any effect.  There 

are --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess what I don't 

understand about the government's argument, Mr. Freeman, 

is exactly what the contractual rights of the tribes 

become.  I mean, as I -- this is supposed to be a 

contract, and we've held that it's a contract, and 

usually contracting parties have rights to something. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So what do they have a right 

to, in your view? 

MR. FREEMAN:  Well, first of all, let's make 

clear -- let's make sure that we're not --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That was -- that was a 

straightforward question. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FREEMAN:  Well, they have a right, Your 

Honor, in the first instance to the principal promise 

that's under any ISDA contract, which is we give the 

amount of money that the Secretary would have provided 

for the program funds, for operational --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but what do they have a

right to with respect to these additional overhead 

costs? 

MR. FREEMAN:  Contract support costs.  They 

have a right as a class to the distribution of every 

dollar that Congress appropriates, and for every 

contractor --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What does each individual 

tribe have a right to? 

MR. FREEMAN:  A proportionate share based on 

the Secretary's policy for the distribution of these in 

light of the caps.  Let me --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you think they do have a 

right to a pro rata share? 

MR. FREEMAN:  We think that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  In other words, the 

Secretary could not say, oh, you know, these tribes have 

been doing a better job, so we'll give it to them; or 

these tribes need it more, so we'll give it to them. 

You think that there's a contractual right to a pro rata 

share. 

MR. FREEMAN:  We think there's a contractual 

right to -- and, in fact, the contracts often reference 

these policies directly.  For example, page 123 of the 

joint appendix, one of the contracts in this case says 

you'll be paid according to the distribution policy as

bound ourselves --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I didn't 

think that was responsive.  Does the Secretary --

Justice Kagan can defend her own question -- but does 

the Secretary have the discretion to adopt something 

other than a pro rata distribution when there are not 

sufficient appropriations? 

MR. FREEMAN:  We think within a range of 

reasonable solutions after consultation with the tribes, 

yes.  We don't --

very -- this is a very strange kind of contractual 

right.  The -- the contracting tribe has a right to have 

the Secretary use discretion to decide how much the 

contracting tribe gets. 

What kind of contract is that? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FREEMAN:  Respectfully -- respectfully, 

Your Honor, that is an exaggeration.  Congress has 

appropriated since 1994 more than $2.3 billion in 

contract support cost funds.  We've distributed all of 

that money to the tribes.  All of the tribes here have 

gotten substantial sums. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I'm not contesting -- I 

mean, clearly you think and the Secretary thinks that 

there's an obligation to distribute all that money. 

MR. FREEMAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and I don't think 

anybody disagrees with that.  The question is what each 

individual tribe has a contractual right to. 

MR. FREEMAN:  May I answer the question, 

Your Honor? 

Your Honor, once it is clear that the caps 

control the total amount of money that the Secretary may 

spend, every further question is a question of 

allocation.  We think we have the policy that's right -­
