CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  15­339,  Ross  v.  Blake. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

Ms.  Bernhardt. 

 

       

 

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JULIA  DOYLE  BERNHARDT 

 

 

 

 

            

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

In  this  case,  the  Fourth  Circuit  adopted  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nontextual  exception  to  the  requirement  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Prison  Litigation  Reform  Act  that  a  prisoner  exhaust 

   

 

 

 

 

 

available  administrative  remedies.  That  exception, 

  

 

 

 

if  accepted,  would  eviscerate  Congress's  intent  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopting  the  Prison  Litigation  Reform  Act  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring  exhaustion  of  administrative  remedies. 

 

 

 

 

         

In  the  Fourth  Circuit  States  where  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  now  applies,  district  courts  are  now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged  with  examining  prison  procedures  to  see  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

murky  they  are.  They  are  dispensing  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  of  exhaustion  at  all  if  there's  been  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

internal  investigation  ­­

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  Bernhardt,  could  I  just 

   

  

 

 

 

ask  you  to  talk  about  the  procedures?  Could  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  to  me  what  they  are?

MS.  BERNHARDT:  Certainly,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

And  I'd  like  to  begin  with  the  Inmate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

         

Grievance  Commission  ­­ or,  I'm  sorry  ­­ Office, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formerly  the  Commission  ­­ which  is  the  primary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  remedy  for  an  inmate  with 

 

 

 

 

 

use­of­force  or  other  condition  of  confinement. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Could  I  start  you  off  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  reverse  around?  Because  the  ARP  seems  to  be  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

low­level  one,  and  in  the  initial  understandings  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  everybody  was  being  told  the  ARP  is  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  file.  And  you  file  there  irrespective  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  there's  an  IIU  investigation. 

 

 

 

 

         

Do  you  continue  to  take  that  view,  or  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  think  that  that  is  no  longer  true? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  Well,  Your  Honor,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

view's  been  consistent  throughout,  and  that  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Inmate  Grievance  Office  is  the  primary  remedy.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Inmate  Grievance  Office  can  itself  require  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  really  did  ask  you  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

start  with  the  ARP. 

 

 

 

         

Honor. 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  I'm  trying  to,  yes,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Are  you  supposed  to  file 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  ARP  even  when  there's  an  IIU  in  ­­

are. 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  why  do  all  of  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  suggest  that,  when  that  happens,  the  ARP 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throws  out  the  case  on  the  view  that  there's  an  IIU 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation? 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  When  this  case  arose  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2007,  the  warden  was  not  required  to  dismiss  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  in  some  cases  ­­ in  some  of  the  cases  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  before  the  Court,  that  is,  indeed,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred.  There's  cases  with  three  wardens  where  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  collection  of  cases  where  there  was  a  dismissal, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  ­­

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Do  you  have  any  example 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anywhere  of  the  AR  ­­ ARP  responding  and  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigating  and  looking  at  the  issue  and  making  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recommendation  or  ruling? 

 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  The  ­­ we  don't  have  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

paperwork.  The  cases  in  Petitioner's  lodging  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cases  involving  an  IIU  investigation  where  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeded  through  the  ARP  process.  In  other  words, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  complaint  ­­

   

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  In  your  reply  brief,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

looked  for  one  ARP  case  where  the  prisoner  filed  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ARP  itself  made  a  determination.  Is  there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

anything  in  the  record?

MS.  BERNHARDT:  There's  nothing  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

record  like  that,  Your  Honor.  And  if  I  might 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

explain  that  this  was  not  an  issue  in  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  And  so  there  was  no  evidence  presented  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  side  on  that  point. 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  you've  lodged  now 

  

 

 

 

 

quite  a  number  of  materials,  and  we  can  talk  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  materials  that  you've  lodged,  but  now,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  parties  have  lodged  materials,  and  nobody  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  up  with  a  case  in  which  the  ARP  has  adjudicated 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  complaint  when  there  was  an  IIU  complaint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation  going  on;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  That's  right,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

And  there's  a  four­year  retention  policy  for  these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

records,  and  this  case  arose  in  2007.  And  so  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  was  not  brought  up  until  the  Respondent's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing  in  this  Court  ­­

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  at  least  it  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  there  are  papers  staying  ­­ saying  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  as  it  could  possibly  say,  "You  involved  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARP;  there  is  an  IIU  investigation;  ARP  dismissed." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Couldn't  be  clearer. 

 

 

         

So  you  say,  well,  other  cases  went  beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way.  Then  it  sounds  like  the  State  is  making 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  rulings,  nobody  knows  what  the  law  of

Maryland  really  is. 

 

 

         

So  those  letters  say,  unmistakably,  "Your 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  is  dismissed  because  there  is  an  IIU 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation."  They  can't  just  erase  that.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

what  they  say. 

 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  The  forms 

  

  

 

 

 

 

also  say  right  on  the  front  that  your  appeal  rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  on  the  back.  And  the  directives  and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

handbook  all  advise  the  ­­ that's  only  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage  of  the  process. 

 

 

 

         

And  in  Maryland,  proper  exhaustion  is 

 

 

 

 

 

always  an  appeal  to  the  commissioner  and  then  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file  complaint  with  the  Inmate  Grievance  Office, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  holds  a  quasi  adjudicatory  hearing  in  every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  these  cases. 

 

 

 

         

 

 

 

And  all  one  need  do  is  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions  in  Petitioner's  lodging.  You'll  see  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were  all  IIU  investigation  cases,  and  all  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inmates  had  a  full  adjudicatory  hearing  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

merits,  and  some  of  them  got  substantial  amounts  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money. 

         

So  there  is  an  available  remedy  in  Maryland 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  prisoners  who  are  assaulted  by  guards  and  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  an  internal  investigation.  And  that  ­­

the  procedure  for  the  employee  ­­ I  mean,  for  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner. 

         

There  is  an  IAU  investigation.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

prisoner  then  files  an  ARP.  Under  Maryland's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

regime,  what  is  to  happen  to  that  ARP  complaint? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  At  the  time  of  this  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  today,  the  warden  had  discretion  to  reach  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits  of  it  or  to  administratively  dismiss  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Both  of  those  are  appealable  orders. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  Bernhardt,  can  I  just 

   

  

 

 

 

ask,  because  in  the  materials  you  lodged  yesterday, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  three  different  places  you  appeared  ­­ the  office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears  actually  to  have  a  rubber  stamp.  I  mean, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

it's  the  same  stamp  on  all  these  things.  And  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  "Dismissed  for  procedural  reasons.  This  issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  being  investigated  by  IIU.  Since  this  case  shall 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  investigated  by  IIU,  no  further  action  shall  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken  under  the  ARP." 

 

 

 

         

         

That's  on  a  rubber  stamp. 

   

 

 

MS.  BERNHARDT:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  And  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

procedure  there  is  the  same  in  any  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use­of­force  case,  and  that  is  the  first­level 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision;  that  is  appealable  to  the  commissioner. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  then  once  those  two  stages  within  the  prison  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhausted,  the  internal  remedy  has  been  exhausted,

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  Bernhardt,  we  took  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case  on  the  view,  which  was  the  view  that  the  office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represented  to  us  at  the  time,  that  the  ARP  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  place  to  go  to  receive  a  remedy,  not  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  place  to  go  to  receive  a  rubber  stamp  saying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"You've  come  to  the  wrong  place,"  but  the  proper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  to  go  to  receive  a  remedy  even  when  there  was

Honor.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Notwithstanding  this  rubber 

  

 

 

 

stamp  that  says  it's  not  true.

to  confuse  prisoners,  if  you're  not  intending  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  this  process  totally  opaque,  why  do  you  do  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  way? 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  Because  there's  one  process 

  

 

 

 

 

for  all  use­of­force  complaints,  Your  Honor,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  confusing  to  inmates  if  you  told  inmates, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Well,  if  you've  requested  an  IIU  investigation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  you  should  use  a  different  process." 

   

 

 

 

 

         

And  it's  the  one  ­­ every  use  of  force,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inmate  files  the  ARP  with  the  warden,  he  appeals  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  commissioner,  and  then  they  go  to  the  Inmate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grievance  Office.  That's  right  in  the  handbook  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages  79  to  80.  It's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.  It's  more 

  

  

 

 

 

confusing  to  say,  "If  you  filed  a  IIU,  go  to  IGO."

MS.  BERNHARDT:  They  do,  because  they

These  are  not  in  the  record  before  the  Court,  are

what  I  think  is  a  serious  ­­ a  serious  question. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

What's  your  proposal  for  dealing  with  the  fact  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  far  as  we  have  seen  so  far,  the  cases  ­­ the  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  well  turn  on  these  lodgings  if  people  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  look  at  them? 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  Well,  your  Honor,  we  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

welcome  a  remand  from  this  Court,  decide  the  issue 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  front  of  it.  This  issue  is  very  important  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  and  to  the  Fourth  Circuit  States  especially. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  we  would  gladly  shoulder  the  burden  on  remand  to

granted.  You  just  ­­ we  just  simply  didn't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  materials  in  front  of  us,  and  it  completely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes  the  nature  of  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  Well,  Your  Honor,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

district  court  rightly  found  that  the  remedy  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primary.  There  was  no  ­­ the  Respondent,  he  never

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  suppose 

   

  

 

 

dismissing  it  would  be  based  on  a  judgment  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  these  extra  record  materials  show.  And  if  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  show  what  your  adversary  suggests,  I  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

know  why  that  would  be  an  appropriate  course  to  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  your  position.  On  the  other  hand, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  do,  maybe  it  would  be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

           

I  don't  ­­ again,  it's  ­­ it's,  I  think,

you;  I'm  criticizing  both  of  you  ­­ that  ­­ that  we

I  mean,  was  ­­ was  the  individual

MS.  BERNHARDT:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  And  these 

  

  

 

 

 

 

materials  that  were  submitted  present  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

misleading  picture  of  the  remedies  available  to

But,  as  I  look  through,  the  reason  that  it  wasn't

that  I've  read,  which  are  very  good  briefs,  people

enormous  amount  of  work  has  produced  all  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  that  wasn't  there  before.

you  were  me.  That  is  to  say,  we  took  this  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  thought  that  it  raises  a  question  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  circuit  can  create  an  exception  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion  requirement  that,  to  my  knowledge  so  far, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  a  traditional  exception.  And  that's  why  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

thought  we  took  it. 

 

 

 

         

Now  we  discover,  having  taken  it,  this  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  that  wasn't  there.  We  thought  the  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was,  can  you  create  an  exception  to  the  requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  have  to  take  into  account  of  available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  remedies?  The  issue  now  is  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  an  administrative  remedy  available  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  of  what  I've  read. 

 

 

 

 

         

It's  so  complicated  that  I  don't  know  how  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

genius  would  know  how  ­­ that  he's  supposed  to  go  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ to  the  whatever  that  AR  thing  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

(Laughter.) 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ you  know,  while  an  IIU 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation  is  going  on.  You  certainly  could  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  illiterate.  I  mean,  you'd  have  to  ­­ there  are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  many  initials  in  this  that  ­­ that  ­­ that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay. 

         

So  we  could  either  go  into  this  other  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  we  could  send  it  back  to  prolong  this  or  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  could  grant  a  ­­ dismiss  it  as  improvidently

if  we  are  to  answer  the  question,  is  there  a  special 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  exception  to  the  rule  that  you  have  to  take

MS.  BERNHARDT:  Well,  Your  Honor,  we've 

  

 

 

 

 

produced  13  inmates  who  used  it.  So  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available.  Inmates  have  used  it  successful,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they've  gotten  large  amounts  of  money.  In  the  ­­

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Let's  talk  about,  then, 

  

 

 

 

 

the  current  regulation.  There's  a  question  whether 

   

  

 

 

 

that  was  always  the  practice  in  Maryland.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current  regulation  does  say,  does  it  not,  if  an  IIU 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation  is  launched,  then  you  don't  use  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARP  procedure.  Isn't  that  what  the  current 

  

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  ­­

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  That's  not  a  regulation, 

   

  

 

 

Your  Honor.  That's  a  directive.  That's  one  of  the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

ARP  directives.  It  does  say  that  it  should  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administratively  dismissed  and  that  that  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appealable  decision  on  the  merits  that  goes  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Inmate  Grievance  Office. 

 

 

         

And  if  I  might  go  back  to  what's  happening 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  district  court  where  this  case  began,  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  had  a  procedure  that  was  ­­ that  was  available  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  face,  and  there  was  never  any  challenge  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

availability.  The  argument  was  that  "Well,  I  went 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  the  internal  affairs,  and  that  serves  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose.  I  don't  have  to  exhaust." 

    

 

 

 

         

And  that  doesn't  serve  the  same  purpose. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All  one  need  do  is  compare  the  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation  report  at  JA  185  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  law  decisions  that  resolve  the  civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims.

An  IIU  investigation  doesn't  produce  an 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  decision  on  a  civil  claim.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

doesn't  give  an  opportunity  to  settle  civil  claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  serves  a  completely  different  purpose. 

   

 

 

 

         

 

 

And  yet  in  the  Fourth  Circuit  States,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  investigation  is  now  an  administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

civil  remedy.  And  that  has  ­­ having  a  very  bad 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  on  Maryland  and  the  Fourth  Circuit  states. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

And  one  need  only  look  at  experience  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second  Circuit  to  see  the  effect  that's  been  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  totally  contrary  to  the  purpose  of  the  Prison 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Litigation  Reform  Act. 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  have  to  say  that  when 

    

 

 

 

 

 

I  read  the  Fourth  Circuit  decision,  there  are  lines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Fourth  Circuit  decision  that  seemed  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding  this  on  the  burden  of  proof.  They're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  "Ross"  ­­ meaning  you  ­­ "have  offered  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  would  contradict  Blake's  belief  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  IIU's  investigation  removed  his  complaint  from

And  the  Fourth  Circuit,  that's  at  787  F.3d 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  goes  on  to  say,  moreover,  that  "the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

handbook  regulations  and  directives  do  not 

 

 

 

 

 

contradict  Blake's  belief  that  he  had  exhausted  his

administrative  remedies  by  removing  the  incident  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

senior  corrections  officers,  thereby  initiating  an 

 

 

 

 

 

IIU  investigation." 

 

         

 

 

 

That's  ­­ that's  at  the  same  page. 

 

 

 

         

So  I'm  not  sure  what  the  Fourth  Circuit  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  with  availability.  And  so  if  I'm  not  sure, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  do  I  do  with  respect  to  Justice  Breyer's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  and  Justice  Kennedy's  question,  which  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  this  a  availability  determination? 

   

 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  The  Fourth  Circuit  assumed 

  

 

 

 

 

it  was  available.  If  you  look  at  Petition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix  8,  the  district  court  found  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available.  The  Fourth  Circuit  assumed  that.  So  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  certainly  be  appropriate,  it  seems  to  me,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand  it  to  the  Fourth  Circuit  so  the  Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  could  sort  out  any  availability  issues  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  newly  raised.  But  there's  a  question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

presented  to  be  decided  because  of  the  effect  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  has  on  the  administration  of  the  Prison 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Litigation  Reform  Act  in  the  Fourth  Circuit  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  a  ­­ it's  a  profound  impact. 

   

   

 

 

         

It's  ­­ it's  ­­ it's  a  special 

   

 

 

 

 

circumstance. 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  There's  a  new

case?  And  it  makes  official  that  the  ARP  process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  not  handle  an  IIU  proceeding? 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  It's  not  a  regulation,  Your 

   

  

 

 

 

Honor;  it's  a  ­­ it's  a  prison  directive. 

   

   

 

 

 

         

This  ­­

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Prison  directive. 

  

 

 

MS.  BERNHARDT:  This  was  the  first  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

stages  of  the  process,  but  not  the  third  stage,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Inmate  Grievance  Office  stage.  That  stage  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fully  open  and  available  to  inmates  who  have  IIU 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigations. 

         

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  the  IGO,  or  whatever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  is,  that  is  described  in  this  hierarchy  as  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate  remedy. 

 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  No,  Your  Honor.  It's  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

contested  case  hearing  under  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

Administrative  Procedure  Act.  It's  doesn't  ­­

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  setup  is,  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

these  levels  that  you  go  to.  And  first  you  go  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ARP,  then  you  go  to  the  commission,  then  you  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  IGO.  So  it's  usually  ­­ it  comes  in  at  the  third 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance. 

         

MS.  BERNHARDT:  But  it's  not  an  appeal, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor;  it's  a  de  novo  contested  case  qua  an

There  is  additional  information  available 

 

 

 

 

to  show  that  this  is  an  available  remedy,  again,  not

by  Mr.  Blake  in  the  district  court.  So  we  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strongly  urge  the  Court  that,  if  it  has  issues  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

availability,  that  it  would  be  most  appropriate  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand  it  and  let  this  be  sorted  out  on  remand, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because,  obviously,  you  know,  not  having  known  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  issue  was  going  to  come  up,  we  didn't  present 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  evidence. 

 

         

The  burden  is  on  Mr.  Blake  to  show  he  meets

more  case­specific  arguments  that  have  come  up  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  briefing. 

 

         

So,  first,  we're  asking  you  to  answer  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  presented.  The  PLRA  means  what  it  says. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  does  not  have  any  unwritten  exceptions.  Blake 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  even  dispute  the  point. 

 

 

 

 

         

Second,  we're  asking  this  Court  to  reject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  part  of  Blake's  argument  in  Part  2  of  his  brief, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  we  think  is  fairly  encompassed  within  the  QP, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  prison's  procedure  has  become  unavailable  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  prisoner  can  jump  to  federal  court  as  soon  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  could  reasonably  but  mistakenly  think  that  he  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  with  the  grievance  process. 

 

 

 

 

           

A  reasonable  mistake  standard  is  just 

 

 

 

 

another  way  of  saying  that  you  only  need  to  exhaust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plain  procedures.  That  used  to  be  the  rule. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  deliberately  eliminated  it  when  it  enacted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  PLRA.  The  rule  now  is  that  you  need  to  exhaust 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  available  remedies.  And  that's  critical  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

making  the  prisons,  not  the  Federal  courts,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primary  place  for  resolving  disputes  about  prison 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life. 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  do  say  in  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

brief  that  if  regulations  are  so  confusing  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  ­­ we're  ­­ we're  arguing  about  whether  ­­ to

every  inmate  or  every  reasonable  inmate  or  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  inmate.  I  don't  actually  see  that  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

say  "every  reasonable  inmate."  That  ­­ that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  ­­ that's  not  a  standard  I  understand  in  any 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

context. 

         

MR.  TRIPP:  So  we  definitely  agree,  as  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  in  our  brief,  that  ­­ that  rules  could  be  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing  that  ­­ that  they're  no  longer  available. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As  this  Court  said  in  Booth,  "available"  just  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  ordinary  dictionary  meaning  of  capable  of  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  for  a  purpose.  And  so  we  think  if  they're  so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing  that  they  can't  be  used,  if  no  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner  can  use  them,  then  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  you  keep  saying  "no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reason."  That  a  reasonable  ­­ I  would  say, 

   

   

  

 

 

consistent  with  how  we  always  talk  about  this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

         

MR.  TRIPP:  Well  ­­ and  I  don't  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ no  reasonable  ­­ a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  prisoner  would  not  understand  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  TRIPP:  Well,  I  think  there's  a  big 

   

   

  

 

 

difference  between  a  reasonable  mistake  standard, 

   

 

 

 

which  is  what  the  court  of  appeals  held.  It  held 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  made  a  reasonable  mistake,  and  Blake  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  repackage  that  as  a  gloss  ­­

that's  different. 

 

         

MR.  TRIPP:  Right.  And  that's  the  thing 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  we  have  trouble  with.  And  ­­ and  ­­ and  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  two  big  differences  between  the  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistake  standard  and  an  availability  standard,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  correct  statutory  standard.  The  first  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  the  degree  of  uncertainty. 

 

 

 

 

         

If  you  have  a  body  of  regulations,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  take  that  much  to  say  that  reasonable  minds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  disagree  about  some  aspect  of  the  procedure. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  is  quite  another  thing  to  say  that  they  are  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing  that  they  can't  even  be  used. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  words  should  we  use? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The  statute  uses  the  word  "exhausted."  The  word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"exhausted"  in  administrative  law,  where  it's  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frequently  found,  has  a  huge  meaning,  with 

   

 

 

 

 

exceptions,  built  up  over  the  years.  One  such 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  is  for  a  procedural  rule  that  is,  quote­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  comes  from  habeas  corpus  law  ­­ "not  firmly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established  and  regularly  followed." 

 

 

 

         

MR.  TRIPP:  You  know,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  is  that  the  way  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  the  exception?  To  decide  that,  one,  does  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word  "exhausted"  pick  up  its  administrative  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning?  That's  a  big  question.

MR.  TRIPP:  So  I'm  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  not  sure. 

  

 

 

 

Two,  if  it  does,  is  there  such  an  exception 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

         

         

that  I  just  said  in  administrative  law? 

   

 

 

 

 

         

         

And,  three,  how  do  you  put  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All  right.  Now,  you  say  what  you  wanted  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  because  you  wanted  to  say  something. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

(Laughter.) 

         

MR.  TRIPP:  So  I  think  the  ­­ the  point 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  you're  getting  at  about  not  regular  followed  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  better  handled  in  a  situation  so  ­­ at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Woodford  and  this  Court's  case  law  says  that  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  has  exhausted  but  has  made  some  kind  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  misstep,  and  the  question  is  whether  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  suffer  a  procedural  default,  that  ­­ that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  there  is,  as  this  Court  said  in  Woodford, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  a  critical  procedural  requirement.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

we  think  that  the  natural  analogue  is  what  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  from  habeas  corpus  law,  that  you  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  asking  whether  it's  an  adequate  and  independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  ground  similar  to  that. 

 

 

 

 

         

The  inquiry  here  is  different.  The  inquiry 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here,  he's  just  ­­ he's  saying  that  it's  just  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing  that  it's  not  available.  And  so  we  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  correct  standard  is  the  one  that's  said  in

Booth,  not  capable  of  use  for  a  purpose.  The  way  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

articulate  it  in  our  brief  we  think  is  correct.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  want  to  give  some  guidance,  it's  that  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  prisoner  can  use  it.  But  you  don't  need 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  ­­ to  get  that  far  down  in  the  weeds  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reject  his  argument  that  a  reasonable  mistake  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

enough. 

         

         

         

So  as  I  ­­

   

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Please. 

  

 

MR.  TRIPP:  There's  two  big  differences 

  

 

 

 

 

between  a  reasonable  mistake  standard  and  ours.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

first  I  was  saying  is  just  the  degree  of  ambiguity. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  second  is  that  it's  myopic.  It  ­­ it  overlooks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  things  a  prison  system  can  do  to  make  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  capable  of  being  used  even  when  it's  a  little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing. 

         

So  if  I  could  just  give  an  example  of  how 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  works  in  the  Federal  system,  when  somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrives  in  the  prison,  they're  given  a  ­­ there's  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orientation.  They're  given  a  handbook.  If  they 

   

  

  

 

 

have  questions,  there's  somebody  in  each  prison  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  available  to  answer  questions,  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance.  And  then,  if  you  just  file  something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  make  some  kind  of  procedural  mistake,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  do  one  of  two  things.

The  prison  can  either  just  ­­ just  accept 

 

 

 

 

 

it  and  overlook  the  mistake,  or  what  it  can  do  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  him  what  he  did  wrong  and  give  him  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  ­­ a  reasonable  time  to  correct  it.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

those  are  all  things  that  a  prison  can  do  to  make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  system  just  perfectly  capable  of  being  used, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  there  might  be  some  reasonable  ambiguity

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ­­

   

  

 

MR.  TRIPP:  ­­ in  the  record.  And  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ask,  it  seems  to  me 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  are  three  kinds  of  unavailability.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  wondering  if  you  agree  with  each  of  the  three. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

One  is  where  the  prison  says,  you  can  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  remedy  over  here.  And  then  it  turns  out  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  get  your  remedy  over  here.  So  if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison  here  said,  you  can  get  your  remedy  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARP,  but  you  couldn't  get  your  remedy  at  the  ARP, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  kind  of  factual  unavailability. 

   

 

 

 

         

         

         

sense  ­­

 

         

         

You  agree  with  that? 

 

 

 

MR.  TRIPP:  Yes,  I  think  so. 

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  In  the  hypothetical 

  

 

 

 

MR.  TRIPP:  Yes.

about  this  case? 

 

 

         

 

Now,  the  second  is  what  you're  saying. 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  like,  if  it's  just  so  confusing  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  person  can't  use  it.  And  that's  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard;  right? 

 

         

MR.  TRIPP:  Right. 

  

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  the  third  is  some  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  cases  arise  in  the  context  where  the  State  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliberately  trying  to  interfere  with  or  trick  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inmate  or  something  like  that.  And  you  would  count 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  as  available  too? 

 

 

 

         

MR.  TRIPP:  Yeah,  in,  like,  a  ­­ sort  of  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

threat  hypothetical,  that  kind  of  thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  A  threat  or  just  deception 

    

 

 

 

 

or  something  like  that. 

 

 

 

         

MR.  TRIPP:  Yeah,  we  think  that's  ­­ as  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  our  brief,  we  think  that's  fairly  usually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealt  with  under  availability.  You  could  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  where  maybe  estoppel  principles  come  in.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in,  I  think,  all  or  virtually  all  cases, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

availability  is  the  appropriate  focus.  And  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  take  over.  That's  the  way  this  has  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working  in  the  lower  courts. 

 

 

 

 

           

I  mean,  because  availability  is  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  exception,  there  is  a  mountain  of  lower

court  case  law  on  this.  And  ­­ and  ­­ and  so  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  proper  way  for  this  Court  to  ­­ to  delve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  these  issues  is  in  some  case  where  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly  presented  on  cert. 

 

 

 

         

The  question  here,  it  is  squarely 

 

 

 

 

 

presented.  The  district  court  here  held  squarely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  could  have  filed  a  grievance.  The  court  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals  appeared  to  assume  that  that  was  right  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  said  that  it  didn't  matter  because  there  was  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unwritten  exception  to  the  PLRA,  where  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Tripp,  are  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  TRIPP:  ­­ it  asked  this  Court  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reverse  that  in  his  effort  to  repackage  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Are  you  taking  ­­ are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ I  assume  that  you're  taking  no  position  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  remedy  is  available  to  this  ­­ to  Blake. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

         

         

MR.  TRIPP:  The  Maryland­specific  question? 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  TRIPP:  Yeah,  we  ­­ we  just  frankly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  an  interest  in  the  outcome  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  and  ­­ and  don't  think  this  Court  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  ever  granted  cert  on  it.  And  we  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  ­­ that's  proper  ­­ the  proper  approach  here

that  we  think  is  fairly  encompassed  within  it,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  it's  up  to  the  court  of  appeals  to  figure  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  to  do  with  all  the  late­breaking  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

         

If  there  are  no  further  questions? 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

         

Mr.  Hughes. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  PAUL  W.  HUGHES 

 

 

 

 

 

            

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

         

We  submit  that  the  proper  outcome  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  would  be  to  dismiss  it  as  improvidently  granted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or,  alternatively,  to  affirm. 

 

 

 

         

If  the  Court  were  to  consider  affirming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  context,  we  think  the  first  place  for  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  begin  is  what  the  term  "available"  means  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  context.  We  submit  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  before  you  get  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that,  the  Fourth  Circuit  seemed  to  assume  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  procedure  that  was  available.  And  it  held 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  ­­ this  ­­ it  was  excused  here  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  it  was  available. 

 

 

 

         

Now,  do  you  defend  that  argument? 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I  would 

   

   

  

 

 

disagree.  I  don't  think  the  court  of  appeals

thought  that  there  was  something  that  was  available, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  certainly  did  not  think  the  State  had  met  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  of  showing  so. 

 

 

 

         

As  was  pointed  out  earlier,  at  Petition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix  page  13,  the  court  of  appeals  said  "Ross 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  proffered  no  evidence  that  would  contradict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Blake's  belief  that  the  IIU's  investigation  removed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  complaint  from  the  typical  ARP  process." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

And  at  the  next  page,  Petition  Appendix  14 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  15,  the  court  of  appeals  added,  "Ross  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided  no  practical  examples  of  an  inmate  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  to  file  an  ARP  or  IGO  grievance  during  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  an  IIU  investigation." 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  what  was  the  legal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rule  that  ­­ that  the  Fourth  Circuit  adopted? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Well,  Your  Honor,  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth  Circuit  did  adopt  a  legal  rule,  as  has  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussed,  as  that  there  could  be  implicit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions  to  the  exhaustion  requirement. 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yeah.  And  that  was  my 

  

  

 

 

 

 

question.  Is  that  correct?  Do  you  defend  that? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  We  think  that's  a  correct 

   

  

 

 

 

statement,  yes,  Your  Honor.  We  do  think  that  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  correct  understanding  of  implicit  exceptions 

   

 

 

 

 

that  exist  to  exhaustion  requirements.

That  said,  we  think  the  starting  place  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  the  meaning  of  ­­ of  the  plain  term 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"available"  that  exists  in  the  statute.  And  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  correct  about  what  the  term  "available"  means, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't  think  the  Court  necessarily  needs  to  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach  the  ­­ the  rule  that  was  adopted  by  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  appeals.  We  think  it  was  correct  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Do  we  think  that  the  Fourth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  was  wrong  with  respect  to  that?  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  problem  leaving  it  on  the  books,  isn't  it? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Court  could,  though,  still,  even  if  it  thinks  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  ­­ the  court  of  appeals  was  wrong  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  still  recognize  that  the  additional  argument, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  term  "available"  means  in  this  context  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  correct  about,  and  that,  for  multiple  reasons, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  system  that  Maryland  has  in  place  doesn't  meet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  conceivable  understanding  of  what  available 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be. 

 

         

So  I  think  the  Court  could  certainly  do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that.  We  ­­ we  would  disagree  with  the  submission 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ the  court  of  appeals  was  wrong,  but  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  think  the  starting  place  here  is  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"available"  means.  And  ­­ and  that,  as  applied  to

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  was  just  going  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

say  "what  we  now  know."  Do  you  have  any  help  for  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  my  concern  that  none  of  this  is  in  the  record

What  should  I  do  about  that? 

   

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  I  have  two 

    

  

 

 

 

 

principal  responses  to  that. 

 

 

 

         

First,  is  the  material  that  I  just  read

We  made  that  argument  to  the  court  of

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I'm  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  not  so  much  talking  about  waiver;  I'm  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  evidentiary  record.  You  may  have  made  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  but  you  did  not  submit  any  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material  as  a  record.  If  it  had  been  presented  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court,  they'd  go  through  a  normal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

process.  Your  Honor,  you  know,  move  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

admission  of  this  as  Exhibit  A.  You  authenticate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  Somebody  comes  in  and  says  ­­ and  you'd  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery  on  ­­ on  that. 

 

 

 

 

           

I  mean,  I  don't  know  that  there  aren't  180 

   

 

 

 

 

 

other  cases  out  there  that  make  the  exact  opposite

to  present  a  real  serious  problem  of  how  we  should

MR.  HUGHES:  Well,  first,  Your  Honor,  I

this  Court,  Maryland  has  consistently  said  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IIU  and  the  ARP  process  were  entirely  distinct.  At 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  5  of  the  reply  brief  in  support  of  certiorari, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  example,  they  explained  the  argument  saying  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  2008  directive  codified  then­existing  practice. 

 

 

 

 

 

They  said  that  that  was  plainly  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  They  said  that  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court  and  court  of  appeals;  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  But  what  we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

did  in  the  lodging  was  we  identified  in  part  briefs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Maryland  attorney  general's  office,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office  responsible  for  litigating  these  cases  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  Federal  court,  briefs  that  they  filed  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  ­­ made  materially  different  representations  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  critical  questions.  That's  at  our  lodgings  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  is  there  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reason  that  couldn't  have  been  done  before  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  and  before  the  court  of  appeals  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included  in  the  record  before  this  Court? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

these  materials,  because  they  are  briefs  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  ­­ that  the  State  of  Maryland  submitted  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  cases  are  things  that  are  properly  submitted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  this  Court  as  legal  documents.  I  think  the  Court

Maryland  district  court. 

 

 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  you're  also 

  

 

 

 

 

submitting  documents  that  were  filed,  I  guess,  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

prisoners  in  particular  cases? 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Your  Honor,  most  of  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

documents  were  submitted  by  the  State  of  Maryland  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attachments  to  their  briefs  that  they  filed  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  court.  All  these  documents  that  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  ­­ the  vast  majority  were  submitted  as  ­­ by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  as  attachments  to  their  briefs.  A  few  were 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

submitted  by  prisoners  as  attachments  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint,  for  example.  But  ­­

  

 

 

 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  not  part  of  the

MR.  HUGHES:  They  ­­ they  were  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

introduced  in  ­­ in  ­­ in  the  court  of  appeals,

its  burden  of  demonstrating  that  the  ARP  is,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  available  in  these  circumstances.  We  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  they've  never  shown  their  burden  to

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  should  this  issue  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

availability  be  decided  by  this  Court  as  opposed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court  or  court  of  appeals  on  remand? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Your  Honor,  I  certainly  think 

   

  

 

 

 

that  could  be  one  possible  outcome  if  the  Court  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  say  that  "available"  as  a  legal  matter  means  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  it  means,  but  that  there  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidiary  questions  that  would  be  left  for  remand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  would  not  quarrel  with  that  outcome. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  What's  your 

  

  

 

 

 

definition  of  "availability"? 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  We  think 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  for  a  remedy  to  properly  qualify  as  available 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  meaning  of  the  PLRA,  the  prison  system 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must  sufficiently  inform  an  inmate  as  to  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  remedy  he  or  she  needs  to  use  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  press  a  particular  kind  of  claim  and  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

additionally  needs  to  explain  so  a  reasonable  inmate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

would  know  the  steps  that  he  or  she  needs  to  take  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  properly  exhausted  that  remedy.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  is  the  difference 

  

 

 

 

 

between  that  and  what  the  statute  used  to  say  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  amended  where  it  required  exhaustion  of  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plain  ­­ plain,  speedy,  and  effective  administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedies  as  are  available? 

 

 

 

         

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  think  it's  saying  it  has 

    

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  plain. 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  No,  Your  Honor.  I  think  there 

    

  

 

 

 

 

is  a  substantial  amount  of  daylight  between 

   

 

 

 

 

requiring  administrative  remedy  on  one  hand  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plain,  on  the  other  hand  to  have  sufficient  clarity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  reasonable  prisoner  would  understand  how  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

works. 

         

And  perhaps  an  example,  a  prison  remedy 

   

 

 

 

 

could  ­­ a  prison  system  could  create  administrative 

   

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  that  is,  in  fact,  quite  complex,  that  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several  steps,  perhaps  some  of  the  steps  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditional  based  on  the  kind  of  claim  an  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  raising  or  based  on  the  adjudication  at  the  lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

steps. 

         

That  might  be  very  complicated,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  perfectly  fine  so  long  as  the  prison 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accompanies  that  with  sufficiently  clear  guidance

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Do  you  think  that  there  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  substantial  daylight  between  your  standard  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  solicitor  general's  standard?  In  other  words, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  I  took  the  solicitor  general  to  be  saying  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  this  clarity  question  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  is  if  the  procedures  are  so  confusing  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  reasonable  person  could  not  use  them.  That's  his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard. 

         

Do  you  think  that  there  is  a  difference 

   

 

 

 

 

 

between  yours  and  his? 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Honestly,  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

there's  a  substantial  difference,  Your  Honor.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

think  we  certainly  agree  with  the  solicitor  general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  reasonableness  is  incorporated  into  this. 

   

 

 

 

 

         

 

We  disagree  with  the  test  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

articulated  in  their  brief  at  page  21  where  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggest  that  the  standard  must  be  so  high  that,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  conceivable  reasonable  inmate  could  satisfy  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test,  that  that  would  be  sufficient. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

We  think  that  is  certainly  too  high  a  test 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  if  one  of  a  hundred  or  one  of  a  thousand 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

inmates  happens  to  get  it  right,  that  might  not  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  reasonable  system;  it  just  might  mean  if  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inmate  is  reduced  to  guesswork,  sometimes  the

inmate's  going  to  guess  correctly. 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  This  is  quite  important  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

me,  and  the  solicitor  general,  I  think,  has  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  ­­ has  made  very  clear  why  this  is  such  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  question,  not  just  your  client,  but  I  mean 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  general  in  the  system. 

 

 

 

 

         

The  Fourth  Circuit  copied  a  full  page  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  said  was  the  Second  Circuit's  special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions  test,  and  then  it  listed  it.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest  of  the  opinion  that  you  cite  really  is  meant  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  an  application  of  that  test.  What  you  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  is  simply  the  procedure  leg  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test. 

         

So  whatever  words  I  or  anyone  else  write 

   

 

 

 

 

 

here  are  going  to  take  on  a  lot  of  importance  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison  system.  So  I'm  nervous,  as  always,  when  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  thing  happens.  I'm  not  an  expert  in  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

Now,  there  are  several  ways  we  could  go.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  it  sounds  to  me,  even  though  I  did  write,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  correctly,  that  there  are  exceptions,  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  for  constitutional  issues,  for  example, 

 

 

 

 

 

traditionally  there  is  no  exception  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  mistake.  I'm  not  aware  of  any.  And  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sounds  as  if  reasonable  mistake  is  put  best  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rubric  of  availability.

Now,  that's  just  tentative.  But  if  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right  in  thinking  that  what  we  have  here  is  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ an  aspect  of  the  availability  question,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  the  thing  to  do  is  send  it  back  and  argue  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  availability,  including  this,  in  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below  rather  than  us  trying  to  write  a  standard. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

Or  a  second,  maybe  we  adopt  the  SG 

   

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  Or  maybe  we  adopt  your  standard.  I  don't 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

know  what  rubric  we'd  put  it  under.  Under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rubric  of  exception?  Under  the  rubric  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

availability? 

         

Now,  that's  a  general  musing­type  question, 

   

 

 

 

designed  to  provoke  on  your  part  a  general  response. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Well,  we  certainly  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  outcome  here  was  correct.  So  that's  certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  starting  point.  We  think  the  best  way  to  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there,  the  proper  rubric  that  would  apply  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  and  all  other  cases,  is  an  understanding  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  "available"  properly  means. 

 

 

 

         

So  I  ­­ I  would  suggest,  I  think,  the 

   

   

   

 

 

statutory  text  and  what  "available"  fairly  ­­ has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  held  to  mean  by  this  Court  in  Booth  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elsewhere  does  the  work,  certainly  in  this  case,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  in  the  vast  majority  of  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

As  the  Court  said  in  Booth,  "available"

here  means  "accessible  or  capable  of  use."  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  anyone  would  fairly  describe  a  prison 

   

 

 

 

 

administrative  remedy  as  one  that's  accessible  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capable  of  use. 

 

 

           

 

A  reasonable  prisoner  wouldn't  know  which 

 

 

 

remedy  it  is  he  or  she  is  supposed  to  use  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  or  wouldn't  know  the  proper  steps  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  or  she  needs  to  take  in  order  to  avoid  procedural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

default  under  Woodford  standard. 

 

 

 

         

The  system  has  to  have  that  ­­ that  minimal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

degree  of  clarity  for  one  to  actually  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described  as  available.  Certainly  Congress  retained 

  

 

 

 

 

the  word  "available"  after  it  amended  the  PLRA  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prior  CRIPA,  and  "available"  must  have  meaning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  certainly  didn't  say  any  standard  ­­ or  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  or  all  remedies. 

 

 

 

         

And,  again,  I  don't  think  Maryland  even 

   

 

 

 

 

disagrees  with  us  on  this  point  because  they  say  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reply  brief  at  page  5,  they  agree  that  if  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  administrative  remedy,  in  their  words,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undecipherable,  that  would  not  be  one  that  qualifies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  available. 

 

         

So  I  think  there's  broad  agreement  that 

   

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  prison  system  can't  take  the  rule  book, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lock  it  in  a  box,  not  let  any  inmate  understand  how

it  works,  and  still  call  that  system  one  that  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  fairly  available.  So  ­­

  

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  I  could  understand  you, 

   

  

 

 

 

though,  I  mean,  one  argument  that  you  would  have, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  here  or  below  or  ­­ is  this  notion  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison  system  didn't  meet  this  level  of  clarity, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  it  is. 

 

 

         

But  there's  another  argument,  don't  you 

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­ or  do  you  think  ­­ that  you  have,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just,  they  said  to  go  to  the  ARP,  and  the  ARB  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARP  was  not  in  the  business  of  giving  this  remedy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  we  did  exactly  what  we  were  told  to  do,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turns  out  the  remedy  is  unavailable  because  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  not  available. 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  I  think  that's  precisely 

    

 

 

 

correct.  I  absolutely  agree  with  that  view,  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

here,  in  all  of  the  cases  that  anyone  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  ­­ and,  again,  with  both  our  lodging,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  in  every  case  in  Petitioner's  lodging  ­­ and  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  point  the  Courts  to  their  lodging  at  page  25, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32,  37,  46,  93,  231,  and  there  are  others.  Every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  that  anyone  has  identified,  the  ARP  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  said,  "You've  come  to  the  wrong  place. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  of  the  IIU  is  underway,  there  can  be  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief  had  here."  I  think  that's  plainly  an

unavailable  system. 

 

         

As  the  Court  in  Booth  said  for  ­­ in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system,  administrative  remedy  to  qualify  as 

 

 

 

 

 

available,  the  administrative  officers  must  have 

 

 

 

 

 

some  authority  to  provide  relief  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances. 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  don't  ­­ I  don't 

    

   

 

 

 

mean  to  beat  a  dead  horse,  but  the  ­­ the  citations 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  cited,  it  is  true  that  that's  to  the  lodgings. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  I  don't  have  any  confidence  that  these  lodgings 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

represent  the  complete  universe  to  allow  me  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  judgment  about  the  procedures  under  Maryland  law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  this  wasn't  litigated  or  ­­ or  subject  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery  in  the  district  court  or  court  of  appeals. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  So,  your  Honor,  two  things. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

First,  again,  we  would  not  disagree  if  ­­ if  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand  could  be  appropriate  for  some  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues;  but,  second,  I  think  there  is  enough  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undisputed  in  the  ­­ the  record  currently  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  doesn't  even  require  a  look  in  ­­ in  the  hole 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  lodgings  to  find  that  this  was  not  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  system. 

 

         

To  begin  with,  the  IIU  exclusivity 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  that  we  discussed  at  page  17  of  the  red 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  made  quite  clear  at  the  time  of  this  incident

that  the  IIU  had  exclusive  authority  whenever  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  referral  that  was  made  to  the  IIU  at  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  and  that  no  other  agency  could  proceed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

That,  again,  has  nothing  to  do  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lodging  material  and,  I  think,  makes  quite  clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ARP  was  not  the  proper  place  to  go. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

We  have  the  additional  briefs,  which  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  are  on  somewhat  different  footing  than  some  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  other  agency  materials,  and  we  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2008  directive  that  did  happen  after  the  case  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  quite  clear  that  the  ARP  is  simply  the  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  correct  place  for  these  cases  to  go. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

So  I  think  all  of  these  things,  even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

independent  from  the  lodgings,  demonstrate  that 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  an  enormous  amount  of  confusion  as  to  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  system  works  and  is  not  one  that  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described  in  any  sense  as  available  without  even  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  would  argue  that  even

that  issue  were  remanded,  and  the  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explored  it  thoroughly  and  concluded  that,  although 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  lot  of  ­­ there  are  these  materials  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  suggest  otherwise,  as  a  formal  matter,  it  is

is  going  forward.  All  right? 

  

 

 

 

           

I  don't  know  whether  that  would  happen. 

 

 

 

 

 

Maybe  it  wouldn't.  Assume  that  that's  the  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  would  still  argue  that  the  procedure  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unavailable  because,  although  it  was  available  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

former  matter  ­­ a  formal  matter,  it  is  simply  too 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing;  right?  And  no  reasonable  inmate  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

take  advantage  of  it. 

 

 

 

         

         

MR.  HUGHES:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  That's  a  separate 

   

  

 

agreement? 

         

MR.  HUGHES:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  Yes.  So  ­­

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

and  ­­and  that  is  why  I  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  ALITO:  As  to  that  argument, 

  

 

 

 

 

your  ­­ your  client  did  not  try  to  use  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure;  isn't  that  correct? 

 

 

 

         

         

         

MR.  HUGHES:  No,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  How  was  he  confused? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  HUGHES:  So  on  the  day  of  the  event  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  at  the  Joint  Appendix,  page  229  to  230,  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed  a  very  detailed  report  of  the  incident.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

he  said,  at  the  bottom  of  ­­ of  page  229  ­­ this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  and  four  lines  from  the  bottom  ­­ "I'm  asking

exact  statement  under  oath  at  any  time  you  need. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Please  investigate  this  incident." 

 

 

 

         

 

 

He  filed  this  very  clear  report  that 

 

 

 

 

described  the  entire  incident.  And  he  asked  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison  to  respond.  The  prison  did  in  fact  respond 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  next  day.  It  instituted  the  IIU  investigation. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

So  I  think  the  question  is,  after  he  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken  this  clear  affirmative  step,  would  someone  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  circumstances,  a  reasonable  prisoner,  known 

   

 

 

 

that  he  had  to  do  something  else?  And  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  that  ­­ that  we  know  shows  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  prisoner  wouldn't  have  understood  he  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  anything  else  beyond  the  IIU  investigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So,  again,  I  think  very  clear  affirmative  steps  he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

took.  And  the  only  question  is,  would  he  have  known 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  had  to  go  to  the  ARP  process?  He  wouldn't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

known  because  of  the  IIU  exclusivity  regulation.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  have  known  because  of  the  practice  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  prisons. 

 

         

And  even  if  he  had  shown  up  there,  we  now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  that  in  all  cases,  it  was  dismissed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  was  a  rubber­stamp  that  was  used  to  dismiss 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  these  claims.  So  for  both  of  those  reasons, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  wouldn't  have  known  to  have  gone  there;  and  if  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  gotten  there,  he  would  have  shown  up  to  a  place

JUSTICE  ALITO:  He  received  ­­ he  received 

  

 

 

 

 

 

materials  from  the  prison  saying  that  that  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARP  procedure  is  available  in  cases  of  ­­ of

of  that  material  said  anything  whatsoever  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IIU.  The  IIU  exclusivity  regulation,  however,  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

specific,  and  generally  the  specific  is  going  to,

relinquish  authority.  So  I  think  that  very  tailored 

   

  

 

 

 

 

guidance  would  certainly  trump  the  broad  policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statements  that  exist  in  the  other  regulations  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Maryland  handbook  that  say  nothing  whatsoever  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  an  inmate  as  to  what  he  should  do  when  the  IIU 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigates. 

           

I  should  also  add  that  one  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interesting  things  about  this  case  is  the  IIU 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigations  are  the  investigations  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Maryland  prison  itself,  it  initiates  them,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  thinks  those  are  the  most  serious  incidents  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prison.  That's  where  Maryland  thinks  that  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  prison  officials  may  have  engaged  in  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrongdoing,  and  therefore  they  need  to  undertake 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  process.  What  Maryland  has  done  is  ­­ is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created  very  substantial  trips  and  traps  for  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  cases  that  are  most  likely  to  correspond  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  worst  conduct  in  Maryland  prisons. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

So  I  think  that's  a  particularly  pernicious

aspect  of  creating  the  system  where  you're  confused, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told  to  go  to  the  ARP,  but  then  the  ARP,  in  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  is  going  to  dismiss  your  claim,  telling  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you've  come  to  absolutely  the  wrong  place. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

And,  again,  I  think  all  of  the  material  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  point  is  ­­ is  totally  consistent  on  the  view 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  how  the  ARP  would  have  worked.  It  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

codified  by  the  2008  directive  that  we  discussed  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  red  brief  at  page  18,  and  I  think  there  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  question  at  this  point  that  there  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

codification  of  existing  practice  that  happened  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2008,  because  all  of  the  examples  anyone  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  is  consistent  with  the  view  that  the  2008 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directive  served  to  codify  what  was  ­­

And  this  is  part  of  the  directives. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  ­­ it's  a  long  directive  that  provides  several 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  pieces  of  guidance  as  to  how  the  ARP 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  works.  And  at  ­­ towards  the  bottom  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Joint  Appendix  page  367,  it  explains:  "The  warden

or  institutional  coordinator  shall  issue  a  final 

   

 

 

 

 

dismissal  of  a  request  for  procedural  reasons  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it  has  been  determined  that  the  basis  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  is  the  same  basis  of  an  investigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  authority  of  the  IIU."  It  provides  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  details,  and  it  says  ­­ it  provides  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text  that  now  appears  on  the  rubber­stamp,  which  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Your  request  is  dismissed  for  procedural  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Final.  The  issue  is  being  investigated  by  IIU. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Case  Number,"  blank.  "Since  this  case  shall  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigated  by  IIU,  no  further  action  shall  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken  within  the  ARP  process." 

 

 

 

 

         

So  this  is,  I  think,  a  quite  clear 

   

   

 

 

 

regulation  as  to  how  the  system  now  works. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

           

I  will  note  that  Maryland's  view  at  ­­ at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote  9  of  their  reply  brief  is  that  even  today, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding  this  new  directive,  their  view  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  the  system  works  is  a  prisoner  still  has  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  to  the  ARP  to  properly  exhaust  their  claims  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  circumstances,  despite  the  fact  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation,  I  think,  is  crystal  clear  that,  if  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  so,  your  claim  is  going  to  be  denied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

And  you're  not  told,  contrary  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion  that  you  would  be  ­­ you  would  know  to

dismissal  anywhere.  There  is  not  a  shred  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

guidance  that  says,  when  you  have  your  ARP  dismissed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you've  told  ­­ been  told  you  have  come  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  wrong  place,  the  proper  thing  is  just  to  keep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appealing  it.  You're  told  that  you're  ­­ it's  being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed  because  of  the  IIU  investigation.  So  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  a  reasonable  prisoner  would  be  quite  clearly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

led  to  believe  that  the  IIU  is,  in  fact,  the  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  that  needs  to  happen  in  his  particular  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  would  clearly  be  misled  into  not  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appealing. 

         

So  I  think  it's  ­­ it's  much  more  likely 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  the  unreasonable  prisoners  who  disregard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  clear  guidance  that  they're  getting  who  continue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  appeal  in  these  circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

         

Now,  one  additional  point:  The  ­­ Maryland 

  

 

 

 

 

 

referenced  the  McCullough  case,  saying  that  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  authority  that  ­­ that  indicates  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Inmate  Grievance  Office  is  the  exclusive  avenue  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  kinds  of  cases,  and  it  rests  on  the  McCullough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  here.  I  think  that  argument  is  misplaced. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

         

The  McCullough  case  that  they  cite  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  in  1989.  The  internal  investigative  unit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  at  issue  here  was  not  established  until  1999, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  full  decade  later.  So  I  think  the  ­­ the  use  in

53 

the  reply  brief  of  the  McCullough  case  to  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  IGO  is  this  broad­based  mechanism  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsive  in  any  event  to  what  happens  now  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IIU  investigation,  because  the  IIU  simply  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist  at  the  time  that  ­­ that  the  McCullough  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  decided. 

 

         

So  I  think  that  our  view  is  quite  clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  Maryland's  system  in  this  case  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

endorsed,  that  would  become  a  very  clear  model  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  other  prisons  could  enact,  this  sort  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upside­down  system,  where  you're  told  you  have  to  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  ARP  process  to  properly  exhaust,  but  once  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  there,  you're  told  that  you've  absolutely  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  wrong  place  and,  despite  any  guidance,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  somehow  know  that  you  need  to  appeal, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary  to  the  instructions  that  you're  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given,  in  order  to  properly  exhaust  your  claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

 

As  the  Court  said  in  Woodford,  to  properly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaust  and  to  avoid  procedural  default,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner  needs  to  use  the  steps  that  the  prison 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly  holds  out.  Here,  the  State  is  doing  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  opposite  of  holding  out  these  steps  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  to  the  prisoners.  The  State  is  saying, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  come  to  the  wrong  place;  you're  using  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong  steps.  That  can't  be  what  I  think  the  Court
