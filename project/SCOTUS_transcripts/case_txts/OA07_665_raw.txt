 (10:13 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
first this morning in Case 07-665, Pleasant Grove City 
v. Summum.

 Mr. Sekulow.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SEKULOW:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Tenth Circuit erred when it held that 
the First Amendment Free Speech Clause forces Pleasant 
Grove City to accept and erect on its property a private 
party's donated, unattended, permanent monument.

 The decision suffers from two constitutional 

defects:  First, the court's conclusion that a donated 
Ten Commandments monument constitutes private speech 
rather than Government speech is wrong.  Here each of 
the monuments on display in Pioneer Park have been 
selected by the Government, are owned by the Government, 
controlled by the Government, and are displayed on 
Government property.  When the Government is speaking, 
it is free from the traditional free speech constraints 
of the First Amendment.

 Second, the court compounded its error by

further concluding that Pioneer Park is a traditional 
public forum for the erection of permanent, unattended 
monuments by private parties.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Sekulow, you're 

really just picking your poison, aren't you?  I mean, 
the more you say that the monument is Government speech 
to get out of the first, free speech -- the Free Speech 
Clause, the more it seems to me you're walking into a 
trap under the Establishment Clause.  If it's Government 
speech, it may not present a free speech problem, but 
what is the Government doing speaking -- supporting the 
Ten Commandments?

 MR. SEKULOW:  Well, the Ten Commandments 

here was displayed in Pioneer Park, as the mayor said, 
Mayor Cook, in 1971, to show the pioneer heritage of the 
community.  This was a community of pioneers on a quest 
for religious liberty.  That's why this town was 
established.  There is no Establishment Clause claim, 
Mr. Chief Justice, here.  It would be inconsistent with 
the relief that the Respondents are really seeking.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well --
MR. SEKULOW:  And I think that -- yes, 

Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I don't want to 

interrupt your answer to the Chief Justice because I

think it's critical, critical to your argument.  As a 
procedural matter, I thought that the Establishment 
Clause issue was raised in the initial complaint.  Are 
you taking the position it's now waived or something?
 MR. SEKULOW:  Well, there was no Federal 
Establishment Clause complaint at all.  There was a 
State --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It was under the State?
 MR. SEKULOW:  It was under the State of 
Utah's Establishment Clause.  It was raised in the 
complaint.  It was not the basis upon which the 
injunction was sought, and the Tenth Circuit noted that 
it was waived.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you prevail, the action 

should be dismissed, as far as you're concerned?

 MR. SEKULOW:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.
 MR. SEKULOW:  Just let me --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then getting back to the 
Chief Justice's point, it does seem to me that if you 
say it's Government speech that in later cases, 
including the case of the existing monument, you're 
going to say it's Government speech and you have an 
Establishment Clause problem.  I don't know if -- I'm 
not saying it would necessarily be resolved one way or

the other, but it certainly raises --

MR. SEKULOW:  Well, I think from an --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- an Establishment Clause 

problem.

 MR. SEKULOW:  If there was an Establishment 

Clause claim, Justice Kennedy, which is not here, Van 
Orden forecloses it.  This monument is very similar to 
what was at play in Van Orden.  And here the city stated 
the reason that they accepted and erected this monument, 
accepted the donation from the Fraternal Order of 
Eagles, was to show something and to represent their 
pioneer heritage, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose it depends on 

what the Government speech consists of, what it is the 
Government is saying about the Ten Commandments.  If the 
Government is saying the Ten Commandments are the word 
of God that's one thing, and if the Government is saying 
the Ten Commandments are an important part of our 
national heritage, that's something else.

 MR. SEKULOW:  That's -- and precisely, 

Justice Scalia, that's exactly what Mayor Cook in fact, 
at the unveiling ceremony, stated that this will serve 
to remind citizens of their pioneer heritage and the 
founding of --

MR. SEKULOW:  -- their community --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did the NEA -- Finley v. 
NEA, the Court didn't treat that as Government speech.

 MR. SEKULOW:  Right.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or am I -- is that the --
MR. SEKULOW:  No.  You're correct.  Those 

were speech selection cases.  It think it clearly --
that the actions here of the Government, of the City 
Council, falls neatly within Forbes, Finley, and the 
plurality in American Library Association.  The 
Government --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before we get -- before 

we get away from the Government, the Establishment 
Clause, you said, well, Van Orden answered that, but did 
it?  Because you don't have here a 40-year history of 
this monument being there, and nobody seems to be 
troubled by it.

 MR. SEKULOW:  There is a 36-year history 

here.  This monument has been on display since 1971.  So 
this monument has been there a long time, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think 38 is the cut-off 

point.

 MR. SEKULOW:  Is that the cut-off?

be 38.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Sekulow --
MR. SEKULOW:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- when you come 

upon this, if somebody comes upon this monument in the 
park, how are they supposed to tell whether it's 
Government speech or private speech?

 MR. SEKULOW:  Well, of course the face of 

it, Mr. Chief Justice, states on the face of the 
monument that it's presented to Pleasant Grove City in 
Utah County by the Fraternal Order of Eagles.  As far as 
a Government speech as far as ownership and control goes 
under a Johanns analysis, different from Finley and 
Forbes and that context, here the Government exercised 
control.  After all, they allowed it, accepted it, and 
allowed it to be erected on their property.  Under Utah 
law, all right, title, and interest to that property 
transferred.

 But I would say with regard to the 

endorsement, if you will, or the Establishment Clause 
issue, really the context here, as this Court has 
consistently stated within the Establishment Clause 
cases matter -- this Court has a depiction of Moses 
holding the Ten Commandment in the frieze of the 
courtroom with the words written in Hebrew.  That's not

an endorsement of the religion or of the commandments. 
It's representative of the history.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the context of all 

other lawgivers.  This is a stand-alone Ten Commandments 
and you don't see, I don't think, anywhere "I am the 
Lord thy God."  That's not shown.

 MR. SEKULOW:  No, the words on the Court's 

frieze are "steal," "murder," "adultery" in Hebrew.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.
 MR. SEKULOW:  Very different in that 

context.  But as far as the actual language of what's 
going on within the park itself, Justice Ginsburg, this 
is not a monument standing alone.  There are 15 other 
displays in this Pioneer Park.  It's called --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is this a challenge to the 

Ten Commandments monument?

 MR. SEKULOW:  It's not.  This is not an 

Establishment Clause case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought this case did not 

involve an Establishment Clause challenge.  Why are we 
--

MR. SEKULOW:  There is no Establishment 

Clause.  It's not a basis upon which the injunction was 
sought, and the Tenth Circuit specifically held it was 
waived.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Sekulow, can I just 
ask:  At what point in the litigation did you first 
raise the Government speech argument?

 MR. SEKULOW:  At the Tenth Circuit.  The 

Tenth Circuit, the existing law in the Tenth Circuit in 
the Summum line of cases mandated a private speech 
determination, even if the speech was controlled or 
known by the Government, if it originated with a third 
party.  As soon as we were before -- and under Tenth 
Circuit rules that's binding, of course, on the district 
court and on the panel.

 But even in the panel brief, we raise the 
issue of Government speech and the Court addressed it 
both as to -- and, Justice Kennedy, going back to your 
point -- both as to Government speech and to the speech 
selection cases of Forbes, Finley, and American Library 
Association.  And I think that those cases as well point 
to what's at issue here.  Governments in the business of 
governing and determining the parks and the landscape of 
the parks make these kind of decisions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't the tough -- isn't 

the tough issue here not so much whether there is 
Government speech.  I will assume and I do indeed assume 
that there is.  Isn't the tough issue here the claim 
that there is -- is in fact a mixture, that it is both

Government and private.  And the argument for its 
continuing to be private speech I take it is simply the 
Eagles identification with the presentation and their 
espousal of what the monument says.  How -- how do you 
think we ought to deal with the mixture issue.

 MR. SEKULOW:  Well, I think the fact that it 

originated, that the monument originated by the Eagles 
as a third party, doesn't in any way take away from the 
fact that in this particular case, and in most cases 
involving donated monuments, which, as the United States 
would point to, most of the monuments in parks are 
donated by or originated with third parties --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  They probably are, but most 
of them -- and you correct me if I'm wrong here.  But I 
don't suppose that most of them -- most of them contain 
as part of -- in a prominent place in the monument 
itself contain the statement that, you know, this is the 
gift of or the position of or what-not of X, Y or Z, 
whereas this monument does.

 MR. SEKULOW:  Most of them, Justice Souter, 
do actually have statements.  In fact, a perfect example 
would be at Gettysburg National Military Park a number 
of those monuments, most of them, are donated by or 
originated by third parties.  They'll often say "Donated 
by," for instance, "the Father Corby --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  We may have more cases 

coming.

 MR. SEKULOW:  I hope not.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But tell me, what is the 

criterion that we should use to decide what the 
significance of the private identification is?

 MR. SEKULOW:  I think the key should be, as 
this Court alluded to in Johanns, the issue of control, 
who controls the message ultimately here.  And the fact 
is the Statue of Liberty originated by the 
Franco-American Union -- was originated by a third 
party.  The United States by resolution accepted it.  At 
that point title transfer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If that -- if we accept 

that there is Government speech, I think Justice 
Souter's question is isn't this really the Government 
endorsement of the Eagles' message?  I mean, the Eagles 
are all over this monument, their symbol of the eagle, 
and the Eagles want it to be known that this is their 
monument.  Indeed, I think in Van Orden wasn't the -- in 
the district court there, wasn't the statement, well, 
this -- Texas did this in recognition of the good work 
that the Eagles do in preventing -- - help try to 
prevent juvenile delinquency.

 MR. SEKULOW:  Right.  And I think that

actually points to why that once it's controlled and 
owned by the Government the fact that it originated in 
the third party, Justice Ginsburg, changes the equation 
for ownership and control to the Government.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, if it does, it 

changes it, as I understand your answer, by eliminating 
the private aspect of the speech.  So that your real 
answer to me is it's not a mixture.
 MR. SEKULOW:  It's not.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And there ceases to be a 

mixture the moment the Government accepts it.

 MR. SEKULOW:  Once -- right, title, and 

interest vest under Utah law in the Pleasant Grove City 
upon acceptance and at that point it is owned and 
controlled by the city.  And the fact that it was 
originally created -- and Justice Ginsburg, you're 
correct, the district court and also the court of 
appeals in Van Orden stated that it was originated as a 
moral guidance for youth.  That was the reason that the 
Fraternal Order of Eagles developed.  The State of Texas 
said:  We're going to honor the Eagles.  That was their 
reason, as well as showing the role of the Ten 
Commandments and the rule of law.  And then the Third --
excuse me, Justice Stevens.

that's kind of in the background of the case?

 MR. SEKULOW:  Sure.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Assume you didn't have the 
policy that you do have, but it was perfectly clear that 
the city decided not to put up this monument because it 
disagreed with the message of the monument.  Whether you 
call it Government speech or private speech, would that 
be permissible?

 MR. SEKULOW:  It wouldn't be a First 
Amendment free speech claim.  It might raise an 
establishment clause, an equal protection kind of clause 
analysis case, but not under the basis upon which 
Respondents have sought here.  I think that's important 
to point out.  The basis upon which they sought access, 
in you will, is a species of an equal access claim.  But 
of course our position is the Government hasn't 
established anything by accepting the monument.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, Justice Stevens's 

question is important, maybe not for your case but for 
other cases.  We are deciding this for other cases to 
arise, and why isn't he correct that if you don't like 
the message then that raises a content-based claim?

 MR. SEKULOW:  Because if the Government is 
speaking, if it's the Government's message, they're of 
course allowed to engage in content-based statements.

The Statute of Liberty was a statement of liberty 
enlightening the world.  I could give a list of 
monuments that do that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand that.
 MR. SEKULOW:  That's what they did.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it doesn't seem to me 
that you have to make the Government speech argument for 
you to make the argument that you just made.

 MR. SEKULOW:  No, not necessarily, because 
even under the speech selection cases -- I mean, that's 
correct -- Governments make determinations of what they 
are going to put in their parks to communicate a 
message.  That's very different from a situation I think 
where the Tenth Circuit panel was incorrect and 
Respondents are incorrect:  They confuse the issue of 
the Government actually creating a forum or a venue for 
speech -- and a perfect example of that would be here, 
with ownership and control vesting in the city.  Very 
different in that situation than the typical equal 
access case, where the Government merely opens up its 
facilities for a variety of viewpoints, Justice Stevens, 
and then cannot engage in content-based or 
viewpoint-based --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  So the city, in effect, if 

the city says, we are going to have a designated

ten-acre field in which anybody can put up a monument, 
but you can't because we don't like your message, 
there's a First Amendment problem.  But if the city 
hides the ball in effect and says in effect, we'll --
we'll let monuments be placed on -- we will accept 
monuments from people who want to place them on our 
property if the monuments have some kind of an arguable 
historical connection or a connection with people with 
long association with the community, as long as they 
have that sort of criterion in mind then they can select 
any way they want to?

 MR. SEKULOW:  Justice Souter, there is a 

fundamental difference between opening up a forum, 
taking acres of a park and saying everybody gets to go 
in, and another situation where the Government is 
clearly controlling it not for a subversive reason.  And 
I think the evidence in these cases, in these series of 
cases, pointing to Justice Kennedy's concern about what 
does it mean for future cases, here it is 
uncontroverted:  The basis upon which the preliminary 
injunction ultimately was issued by the Tenth Circuit 
disregarded or at least cast doubt on the declaration of 
the park administrator, who had been involved in city 
government since 1972, who stated -- and it can be found 
on pages 102 through 104 of the joint appendix -- that

it's been the practice of Pleasant Grove City for three 
decades to accept displays only in their particular case 
related to the history of the community, its pioneer 
history. -

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It goes to the same thing, 
doesn't it?  I mean, whether it's the Government stating 
the message or whether it's the Government creating a 
limited public forum for the presentation of only those 
messages that it thinks are important, it comes to the 
same thing, doesn't it?

 MR. SEKULOW:  Well, it depends on -- if it's 
a limited public forum, certainly limited public forums 
can be based on subject matter and speaker identity. 
This Court said that, said that consistently, Cornelius 
and Perry.  So in that context, and now that limited 
public forum appears to be more of a non-public forum 
type of analysis, certainly.  Even in the designated 
public forum, it could be limited in that regard.

 I think that points to the confusion of what 
took place here.  The Court in our view conflated those 
two issues, the issue of forum and Government speech. 
And while they're both separate basis upon which we 
believe the Tenth Circuit opinion could be reversed and 
vacate the issuance of the injunction, the reality is 
that in this particular case once title passed and

control vested in Pleasant Grove City they were the 
owner and effectively controlled.  And, Mr. Chief 
Justice, that does not mean that they violate the 
Establishment Clause simply because they own and control 
a monument.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me ask you a question 
to make sure I understand your position.  It would have 
been permissible for the city to say, our park it filled 
with monuments and we are only going to let those in who 
convey messages that we agree with?

 MR. SEKULOW:  If the policy is --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  If that's a policy.
 MR. SEKULOW:  If the policy is that we're 
only going -- that the Government's controlling those 
messages, it's not individual private expression, of 
course.  If it's individual private -- if the 
Government, on the other hand, were to say --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But really, in this case 

sort of the debate as to whether the policy 
justifications for the monument are a sham are not are 
really irrelevant?

 MR. SEKULOW:  From a legal standpoint on 
Government speech, it's irrelevant.  On the factual --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Even if it's a Government 
forum for private speech, I think it's the same thing.

You're defining -- you define the forum to include only 
those -- the forum is putting up monuments.  You just 
put up those monuments that agree with the message.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And the same question 
Justice Stevens had, just to tack onto his question 
here, your answer was:  Oh, well, the Government owns 
it.  Suppose the Government says:  We will accept 
ownership only if we agree with the message.  That just 
puts his question.  I think the ownership argument is --
is not an answer to the Justice's question.

 MR. SEKULOW:  It's not ownership, Justice 

Kennedy, in and of itself.  Ownership is an indicator, a 
factor for control, but it is control of the message. 
When the Government implanted that monument donated by 
the Fraternal Order of Eagles, they were sending a 
message.  It was not a message of "I am the lord thy 
God" --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Nothing could be a more 

obvious control of the message than the criterion that 
says we will decide in -- in determining to accept it or 
not, we will decide on the basis of whether we agree 
with the message.  That is control with a vengeance.
 MR. SEKULOW:  The difference is -- the 

difference between each of those cases and the case here 
is the Fraternal Order of Eagles surrendered control of

their message and their speech.  In the typical equal 
access case, Justice Stevens, they do not.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, they -- they do in 

the example Justice Kennedy just raised and the example 
that I just raised.  The Eagles come along say:  Here's 
the monument; take it; it's all yours.

 MR. SEKULOW:  Which happened here.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And the -- the Government 
says:  Okay, we'll take the Eagles monument.  We will 
not on identical terms take the Summum monument because 
we disagree with the message.  At the point they make 
the decision they don't own anything.  What they are 
doing is controlling, in your words, and they are 
controlling on the basis of agreement with the message. 
Why isn't that a First Amendment violation?

 MR. SEKULOW:  It's not a First Amendment 
violation because the Government takes ownership and 
control at the time it's displayed, and there is no 
dispute at the time it's displayed that the Government 
is conveying a message.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But we've got -- we've got 
to shut our eyes to the period prior to the moment title 
passes.

 MR. SEKULOW:  Absolutely not, because 

discovery in this case proves the fact that this has

been a policy in existence for three decades.  And the 
fact of the matter is under that analysis --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Does that mean if we engage 

in viewpoint discrimination for three decades, we are 
home free?

 MR. SEKULOW:  If the Government is the 

speaker, they are certainly entitled to do that.  If 
they are not, that would be a very different scenario.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  It wouldn't be a speaker on 

your view until it takes control of the monument.

 MR. SEKULOW:  But the Government -- the 

speech selection itself is an independent basis under 
Forbes, Finley, and American Library Association to 
bring these kind of --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But those are cases in 

which, to begin with, the Government is engaging in -- a 
process of, in effect, sponsoring speech.  And here we 
-- we have not, I think, reached the point in which the 
public park is to be analogized either with a 
publication or a magazine or -- or grants to -- to the 
arts.

 MR. SEKULOW:  I think, when it comes to the 

issue of selecting monuments for its park, it's very 
similar to a museum curator or the arts.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Of course the Government can select the 

content and viewpoint of monuments on the National Mall 
and in other public parks across the country.  The 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial did not open us up to a Viet 
Cong memorial.  When the Martin Luther King Memorial is 
completed on the mall, it will not have to be offset by 
a monument to the man who shot Dr. King.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can't there be a situation 
where the Government does create a monument that is a --
a limited public forum?  Let's take the example that you 
just gave, the Vietnam War Memorial.  I presume the 
Government could not refuse to have the names of certain 
deceased soldiers on that monument because it disagreed 
with certain ideas that they had espoused at one point 
or another.

MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, if -- when it is 

Government speech -- for example, we can have a -- a 
Washington Monument and a Jefferson Memorial without an 
Adams one.  I mean, we do get to decide who we want to 
memorialize on the mall because it's Government speech.
 But there are also -- there are two legal 
theories here.  The first is that this is Government 
speech.  The second is that this -- even if it was 
private speech, this would be one of those unusual 
contexts like public broadcasting, museums, libraries, 
where normal forum principles do not apply because the 
Government is acting as a curator and value judgments 
are, therefore, both inevitable and appropriate.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  What's the answer to 

Justice Alito's question?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  I mean, if we wanted --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, supposing the 

Government in the Vietnam Memorial decided not to put up 
the names of any homosexual soldiers.  Would that be 
permissible?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes.  When the -- when the 

Government is speaking, it can choose who to memorialize 
and who not --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That seems to be the 

problem here.  And what I have in this is the -- the

problem I have is that we seem to be applying these 
subcategories in a very absolute way.  Why can't we call 
this what it is -- it's a mixture of private speech with 
Government decisionmaking -- and ask the question, as we 
do in election cases, is the restriction proportionate 
to a legitimate objective?  I know how you're going to 
answer that question.  You're going to say:  Of course, 
it is.

 But what's interesting me is, are we bound 

in these cases to apply what I think of as an artificial 
kind of conceptual framework or are we free to ask what 
seems to me to be at the heart of the matter?  The 
answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetically is:  Of 
course the Government can't do that because it's 
disproportionate.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I didn't get the answer. 

Did you --

MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes, the Government can 

choose to memorialize who it wants on the mall.  When 
the Government is -- now, to be clear, that's under the 
Free Speech Clause.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So what is the answer to 

the -- what is the answer to Justice Stevens's 
hypothetical?  What is the answer to the homosexual 
hypothetical?  What is the answer?

MR. JOSEFFER:  The only question --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because that tests the 

theory.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, as a matter of the Free 

Speech Clause, there are no limits on the Government's 
ability to speak freely.  Under the Equal Protection 
Clause, the Establishment Clause, perhaps the Due 
Process Clause, there might be thought to be independent 
checks on the Government's speech.  But the Free Speech 
Clause, whatever else it does, does not prevent the 
Government from speaking freely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me the 

Government could disfavor homosexuality just as it could 
disfavor abortion, just as it can disfavor a number of 
other things that in -- in many States people are free 
to do.  The Government can disfavor all of it, can't it?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  The Government would be 

powerless to do anything if it cannot first formulate 
and then express its own viewpoints.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is that the answer to 

the -- the question?  Why isn't the answer to the 
question that monuments generally are not -- the 
erection of monuments generally are not a forum?  There 
is a fundamental difference between the speaker's corner 
in the park where anybody can speak and a permanent

monument that takes up space, presumably limited public 
space.

 And if you have the unusual situation where 

you are have a monument that is really analogous to a 
forum, then the forum analysis would be applicable.  But 
to apply it to something like the Washington Monument or 
the Jefferson Memorial is ridiculous.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  When the -- when the 

Government -- and this is a point I started on earlier. 
When the Government is acting as a curator as in the 
museum context, normal forum principles do not apply.

 In Forbes, for example, this Court held that 

when the Government acts as a public broadcaster it 
normally can engage in viewpoint discrimination outside 
of an exception for candidate debates.  And the -- and 
the same point applies here to monuments, I think, for a 
combination of three reasons.

 First, the Government has an overwhelming 
interest as a property owner in not being saddled with 
structures it does not want; second, the limits on the 
availability of public space you refer to; and, third, 
the Government's sovereign interest in using monuments 
on its own property to tell its own story, as the 
Federal Government has done here on the Mall.

 It's similar to, for example, a sculpture

garden or -- and -- a sculpture garden where the 
Government can choose what sculptures to put in the 
sculpture garden without necessarily having some 
overriding theme or overriding reason.

 If I could give two examples of that, in 

Meridian Hill Park here in Northwest D.C., between 15th 
and 16th streets, the Government chose to accept and 
place a variety of privately donated structures that 
have no evident connection to one another.  They cover 
people as diverse as Joan of Arc, President Buchanan --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But suppose they only 

accept Democrats who are sculptors, and they reject all 
the Republicans?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Right.  As a matter of policy 

--

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what in the First 

Amendment -- are you saying the First Amendment would 
not stop that?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  The Free Speech Clause on its 
own force does not prevent the Government from speaking 
freely.  But as a matter of rational basis review under 
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, It is hard to see 
how the Government would have a legitimate governmental 
interest in pure partisan activity.

 But the Free Speech Clause, what it does is

that it -- it limits the extent to which the Government 
can regulate other people's speech.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, under the Equal 

Protection Clause would -- if you wrote an Equal 
Protection Clause opinion, you would end up saying it's 
content-based.  That's the First Amendment.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  If it's Government speech, 

though --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I don't think that 

can you avoid the hard part by saying, oh, other 
amendments of the Constitution might apply.  The heart 
of the question is whether the Government may 
discriminate based on content, and that's a First 
Amendment question.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  But when the Government is 
speaking or when the Government is acting as a curator 
as with a museum or a sculpture garden or a library or 
here, the Government is absolutely entitled to make both 
content and viewpoint-based distinctions.  Otherwise, 
you get the absurd result --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not only absolutely 

entitled, it has to do so.  It -- it has no choice, does 
it?

couldn't formulate and express viewpoints, I would be

here today in support of neither party.  And the 
Government, frankly, would be prevented from doing much 
of anything.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can't run a museum if 

you have to accept everything, right?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes.  Now, yes -- I mean --

yes, if it's just the simple point that we can do 
content and viewpoint discrimination in this context. 
And Forbes recognized that when the Government -- even 
if it's private speech, Forbes recognizes that as a 
curator we can do this.  An example, though, of the 
question --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does the law always 

require us to adopt an all-or-nothing position?  Aren't 
there some extreme cases indicated by the hypothetical 
where the First Amendment does enter in?  Do we have to 
decide this case that it's all or nothing?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Of course, the Court could 

put limits on its holding if it so desired.

 But if I could address the, sort of the 
hybrid speech which seems to worry some people.  The 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a great example.  People 
are permitted there to put private objects next to the 
wall.  That's clearly authorized speech.  It's 
authorized public speech.  But at the end of the day,

the Government comes around, takes it away, puts the 
nonperishable objects in a Government warehouse, and 
then decides which of them to display in the 
Smithsonian's American History Museum.

 So what starts off as public speech -- or as 

private speech, clearly becomes Government speech when 
the Government assumes control over it.  It's the same 
as the Government putting a painting --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  It would be -- the 

trouble --

MR. JOSEFFER:  -- in a Government museum.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I see your point, but the 

trouble with that as an argument here is the private 
part of the speech is just as much chiseled in stone as 
the public part.  So it's not going to go away at the 
end of the day, and there isn't any way that the 
Government in effect can engage in the gesture of saying 
all private speech is treated the same way, whatever way 
that might be.  So we've got a -- we've got a -- we've 
got a more difficult problem here.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  But if the Government -- take 
a museum.  The Government could choose or not choose to 
put, say, a Gilbert Stuart painting that has a favorable 
portrayal of a former president on display.  The 
Government didn't paint it.  It has Gilbert Stuart's

name all over it.  But when the Government chooses to 
put that in a -- in a display, it's the Government that 
is speaking, and the Government, therefore, has an 
absolute right to decide its own speech.  That should 
become --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What you are, in effect, 
saying -- and this may be -- I don't mean I think this 
is necessarily the wrong answer -- but you're, in 
effect, saying, yes, you can find instances of 
Government speech in which there is clearly a -- a 
private identification consistent with it, but the only 
appropriate analysis is the analysis for government 
speech.  You can't have it both ways, you've got to pick 
one or the other; and it is -- it is the Government 
aspect which controls the First Amendment purposes. 
That, I take it, is your answer?

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes.  And when we are talking 

about physical objects that constitute the speech, 
that's oftentimes the case in museums, sculpture 
gardens, parks across the country.  So, frankly, there 
is -- there is nothing even unusual about it.  And the 
reason is that all the free speech clause does --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  There is nothing unusual 
about it, but we haven't had this kind of a challenge 
before.  So, I -- I guess it still rests on you to say

why should we submerge the private part to the 
Government part.  There may be a very good reason, but I 
want to know what your reason is.

 MR. JOSEFFER:  It's simply that once the 
Government is speaking, it is the one -- it turns on 
control, right?  So once the Government takes control of 
something, says this is our speech, then it's the 
Government speaking.  And here, I mean, it does --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, maybe they can't do 
it in museums, either.  I mean, yes, we've been doing 
this for a couple of hundred years, but maybe we've been 
wrong all along and maybe the Government can't run 
museums.  It's possible, right?  It's a brave new world.
 MR. JOSEFFER:  And frankly, public parks are 

no less absurd, because we've been doing it in public 
parks for probably at least as long as well.  And in 
fact, there are thousands of privately donated monuments 
and sculptures in public parks across the country, and I 
suspect a great many of them don't have some formal 
disclaimer on them saying "I am the United States and I 
approve this message."  That's not the way that 
Government speech has ever been thought to work.

 The question, though, with Government speech 

turning on control, this is the easy case because we 
have a physical object that Government has both legal

and physical custody over.  It chooses to display it, 
and then it can do whatever it wants with it.  It can 
move it, modify it, destroy it, drop it to the bottom of 
the ocean, sell it on eBay.  So you'll never get a 
better example of control, which this Court held in 
Johanns is the touchstone for Government speech that's 
not subject to the free speech clause.

 Thank you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA HARRIS
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. HARRIS:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 The city here gave the Eagles access to its 
public park for s display about the Ten Commandments and 
it denied Summum access for a display about the tenets 
of its faith.  That's a violation of the core free 
speech principle that the Government may not favor one 
message over another in a public forum.  The Eagles 
display here is not Government speech.  The city had 
nothing to do with the Ten Commandments Monument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say in a public forum. 
I mean, that sort of begs the question.  I mean, that --
that encapulates your -- your -- encapsulates your

answer.  Has the -- has the city allowed anybody to put 
up a monument there willy-nilly?

 I mean, a public forum, as you know, we can 
have praise in the park, we can have protest.  Anybody 
can do it, so long as you get a license and you're not 
interfering with some other group.  That's a public 
forum.  Has this city said anybody can put up a monument 
in this park?

 MS. HARRIS:  Justice Scalia, there is a very 
serious factual question in this case about whether the 
city ever had a bona fide selection policy for this 
park.  But putting that to one side for a moment, a 
public park is a public forum.  A monument in a park may 
be a mode of communication for that forum --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a public forum for 

some things.  Is it a public forum for everything?  It 
may be a public forum for processions, for parades.  But 
it is a public -- is it a public forum for anybody 
constructing a monument?

 MS. HARRIS:  If you look at the question 

that way, Justice Scalia, it might be said that a public 
park is not a forum for sound trucks, it's not a forum 
for sleep-ins, it's not a forum for news racks.
 What that means is that there is no 

unfettered right to engage in those forms of

communication.  But if the Government allows it all --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Those are time, place, and 
manner regulations, with which we are all familiar.  But 
my concern is that this -- this case is an example of 
the tyrannies -- of the tyranny of labels.  Because it's 
a public forum, as Justice Scalia indicated, for 
parades, for protests, which are limited temporally, 
it -- it -- it just seems wooden and rigid to say to all 
of a sudden say, well, it's a public forum for something 
that will last 30 years for which there is only limited 
space.  It just doesn't make common sense.

 MS. HARRIS:  And that is exactly why, 

Justice Kennedy, the city, any city, is permitted to 
make a decision that it will close its public parks to 
all unattended displays.  The Court said that in 
Pinette.  It said that earlier in Vincent.  But Because 
there --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How far do you push 
that?  I mean, what about the hypotheticals on the other 
side?  I mean, you have a Statue of Liberty; do we have 
to have a statue of despotism?  Or do we have to put any 
president who wants to be on Mount Rushmore?  How do you 
answer those?

 MS. HARRIS:  Of course not, is how I answer 

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

Any city has available to it two very 

straightforward options for dealing with this question 
if by some happenstance they do have a monument on 
public land that is not now a Government monument.  The 
first thing they can do is adopt any existing monuments 
as Government speech converts them.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  How do they do that?  What 
is the -- you mentioned that frequently in your brief, 
and I'm not sure what formality you have in mind when 
you say adopt.

 MS. HARRIS:  Governments can do it different 

ways, Justice Souter.  The way the national Government 
does it under the Antiquities Act of 1906 is they 
formally designate pre-existing structures as a monument 
of the United States or a memorial of the United States.
 And that, by the way, Mr. Chief Justice, is 
the response to the Statue of Liberty problem.  In 1924 
it was so designated.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, it's frozen into 

time.  Everything up until now is okay, but anything 
going forward is not?

 MS. HARRIS:  I'm not sure I understand.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought you 

said the Government can accept what's there and say 
that's our speech.  But you're challenging the ability

to do that going forward.

 MS. HARRIS:  No.  No, Your Honor.  If the 

Government accepts what's there -- what is there now and 
says that's ours, then they can say we are not taking --
we have closed this forum to private speech, these parks 
are available only to Governmental displays.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The other side says that 
some of these monuments, especially in the Civil War 
battlegrounds, do indeed show who the donors are.

 MS. HARRIS:  I'm sorry?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- Mr. Sekulow says 

that some of these monuments, notably those in the Civil 
War battlefields, do show who the donors are.

 Now is that Government speech or private 

speech?

 MS. HARRIS:  It depends if they were 

privately formulated and handed off to the Government as 
a completed object, they are only Government speech if 
the Government has since then converted them --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So they have to go?
 MS. HARRIS:  -- by adopting them.  They 

don't have to go.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now that the Government 

converted them, it passes a law saying, what, we -- we 
adopt this?

MS. HARRIS:  That has happened.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't it enough that the 

Government accepts ownership of it and places it on the 
Government's property?  Isn't that a manifestation of 
the Government's adoption of it?

 MS. HARRIS:  Let me answer both of your 

questions, Justice Scalia.  The way it does that even if 
they -- even if a monument makes clear that it was 
privately formulated, a Government can still adopt it as 
its own speech.  It can put --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  So this case -- your claim 

would disappear if this town in Utah had passed an 
ordinance saying we adopt the Ten Commandments Monument?
 MS. HARRIS:  It would, Justice Souter.  We 

would no longer have an equal access right going 
forward --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that's -- I mean, if 

that's all that's involved here, we're engaging in kind 
of a -- almost a silly exercise in formality.

 MS. HARRIS:  Absolutely not, Justice Souter. 

And the reason we know it's not a formality is because 
the city here refuses to do it.  If it were just a 
formality, they would check the box.  They won't do 
it --

got to take the monument down if they don't do it, don't 
you think they are going to pass that pretty quick?

 MS. HARRIS:  I don't think they are, Justice 
Souter.  And I think it would be partly a concern about 
establishment clause exposure, which we already heard 
about today.

 I think that there are substantive reasons 
why they might not want to adopt one version of the Ten 
Commandments as the city's own speech.  As it happens, 
the version of the Ten Commandments on the Eagles 
monument isn't even the Mormon version of the Ten 
Commandments.  That might raise sensitivities in this 
town.  And whenever the Government adopts one version of 
the exodus account, that is not legally sensitive but 
politically sensitive as well.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It depends on what you mean 

by adopting one version.  If it's adopting the version 
by saying these Ten Commandments are the word of God, 
that's one thing.  If it's adopting it by just saying 
this is a version of the Ten Commandments that has had a 
very significant place in the history of the American 
people.

 MS. HARRIS:  I think that those are --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wouldn't care what 

version it was if that's all they're doing.

MS. HARRIS:  Those are very different --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Nor would the Mormons in 

Utah, I think.

 MS. HARRIS:  Well, those are very different 
for establishment clause purposes, Justice Scalia.  But 
the only way the Government can be adopting anything in 
this context is by saying through the act of selection 
we have adopted it.  And the problem with that is that 
the Government is not allowed to select which private 
speech it wishes to present to the public in a public 
park.

 It can do that.  It can do that in museums. 

It can do it in libraries.  It can do it --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me give you this 

example.  Just by chance yesterday I was taking a walk 
in a little neighborhood park , and I saw that there was 
a monument -- a small monument, donated, and it says 
right on there donated by a private neighborhood 
association to commemorate a number of people who were 
killed in the 9-11 attack on the Pentagon.  And now if I 
searched the town records or the county record and I 
don't find any resolution saying they adopted this 
monument as their monument, does that mean that if I 
would like to put up a monument in the park to 
commemorate loved ones who died, or people who I

respect, I have a First Amendment right to do that?

 MS. HARRIS:  No, Your Honor, and really for 

three separate reasons.  First of the all, it may be 
that the Government -- even privately donated monuments 
often involve a great deal of Government involvement at 
the front end, when they are created.  Government often 
works in partnership with private donors to create the 
content of that monument.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well what if the situation 
is a neighborhood association prepared this; they said 
we'd like to display it in the park; and the county or 
the town says fine, go ahead and do it?

 MS. HARRIS:  Even under those more usual 

circumstances there would be two things the city could 
do to keep you out of their park.  As I said, they could 
adopt the monument that is there.  The other thing any 
city can do is adopt some kind of a content-neutral ban, 
or a content-neutral limit, on the number of private 
displays it wants to have in its park.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Harris, we -- we need a 

clear rule here.  We -- we can't expect the courts or 
the cities for that matter to investigate in every case 
what the degree of the Government's involvement in 
and what is the degree, 50 percent, 45 percent, 
the --
36 years?  I mean, we are going to make up a percentage?

That's -- that's not the way threshold constitutional 
questions ought to be resolved or resolvable.  We need a 
clear rule that the cities can rely on.

 MS. HARRIS:  I agree that we need a clear 
rule, and if clarity is important here the easiest way 
for the Government to make clear that it has adopted a 
privately formulated message as its own is to adopt it 
clearly and publicly.  It can put up a plaque; it can 
designate it a city monument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there an historical 

basis for that, or you just made it up?  You think it 
would be a good idea?  I mean, if that had been the 
practice over the past 200 years for all of these 
monuments that -- that, you know, are strewed across the 
landscape, then I'd say yes, that's probably what the 
difference is.

 But I'm not aware that there is any such --
such requirement and any such practice on the part of 
Government.  You're -- you're creating a new world.

 MS. HARRIS:  I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It may be a very nice world 

but it happens not to be the world under which our 
Constitution has subjected this country.

 MS. HARRIS:  If this is uncommon, that is 
because usually the Government does reserve monuments

for governmental speech, monuments that it helps to 
create or monuments that it is happy to endorse after 
the fact.  If this case is unusual, it's because 
Pleasant Grove has done an unusual thing here by 
allowing a private party to erect a permanent monument 
in its park, even though it is not willing to endorse 
the content of that monument.

 And I do want to say that although clear 

rules are necessary, whatever the particular details of 
how a monument came to be on public land, there are 
these two clear safe harbors for any city facing that 
problem.  Adopt it now or enact a content-neutral limit 
on the number of monuments in the park; and we think the 
city could do that on a going-forward basis.  It could 
say we have room -- for aesthetic reasons, for space 
constraint reasons, We would like --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that's all right, the 

first 95 monuments, whoever -- whoever put them up, 
okay?  It's a monument to chocolate chip cookies or 
whatever else, is that it?  First 95?

 MS. HARRIS:  Sure.  A city could say we 

think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is a practical 

solution to the problem?

confronting this problem now can look at its park and 
say we have four monuments --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're saying the last 
generation had much more freedom than the present one?
 MS. HARRIS:  I'm saying that as long as it 

does it on a content-neutral basis, because it is 
genuinely concerned about aesthetics, space constraints, 
clutter in its parks, a city can enact a ban or a limit 
on the number of displays; and if that has the effect of 
grandfathering in existing displays --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we go back to -- your 
basic premise is this is a public forum, in any and all 
instances; and we do have, certainly in the speech area, 
demonstration area, from time immemorial public parks 
have been places where people can speak their minds. 
But I don't know of any tradition that says people can 
come to the park with monuments and put them up if they 
will, so long as they meet the equivalent of time, place 
and manner.

 So you're making an assumption that from 

time immemorial, monuments, just like speeches, can be 
presented by anyone who wants to.

 MS. HARRIS:  No, Justice Ginsburg. 

Monuments are different from speeches and because 
monuments are different, the Court has held that unlike

oratory, a city can decide to close its parks entirely 
to all private unattended displays.  It could not say, 
"We've heard enough speeches; no more speeches."  It can 
say no private --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  If that -- it that is so, 
what is the point of using the public forum analysis at 
all?

 MS. HARRIS:  Because here the city has not 
done that.  The city has not closed -- it has not made 
the decision that it will bar all private unattended 
displays.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That -- that may mean that 
you have the foundation for a -- a speech discrimination 
argument --

MS. HARRIS:  That --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- but that would not be 
the answer if we were dealing with a -- a traditional 
public forum in -- in the sense that the Court's cases 
have used the term.

 MS. HARRIS:  Oh, I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  So it seems to me that your 

use of public forum is just by kind of remote analogy 
here, and I -- I'm not sure that it's helping you or 
would help us if we used it as criterion for decision.

Justice Souter, because once we know that we are talking 
about a public forum, we know that access cannot be 
limited on a content basis.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, your -- you can 
stick with it as long as you want; that's what the --
the Tenth Circuit did, but suppose that we were to say 
that we were unconvinced by the comparison between 
speeches and parades on the one hand and monuments on 
the other, so we did not apply the public forum analogy. 
Would that be the end of your case?

 MS. HARRIS:  Oh, no, Justice Kennedy.  Even 

outside a public forum, in any context -- even in a 
museum or library -- in any context in which the 
Government is regulating private speech, it may not act 
in a way that is designed to suppress one particularly 
disfavored message or view; and we think that's what 
happened here.  As I said earlier --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it does 
all the time.  The -- you don't get equal time -- the 
cigarette companies don't get equal time because the 
Government says the Surgeon General has determined it is 
bad for your health.  It always suppresses alternative 
viewpoints.

for itself, then the Government does have a right to

prefer certain viewpoints over others, but here the city 
has consistently refused to adopt the content of this 
monument as its own, and it is still disclaiming 
endorsement of that monument.  The city here -- the 
justification for that Government speech exception is 
that sometimes, as the United States has said, the 
Government is entitled to speak in its own voice to 
promote its own messages, its own policies.  But it says 
it's not doing that here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You will say just the 

opposite when you come back here to challenge the Ten 
Commandments monument on -- on Establishment Clause 
grounds.  You will say something like this:  Anybody who 
comes into this park and seeing this monument owned by 
the Government, on Government land, will think that the 
Government is endorsing this message.

 That's what you will say now.
 MS. HARRIS:  Um --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now why would it be true 

there, but it's not true here?  Would anybody think that 
on public land owned by the Government the Government 
disagrees with this message?

 MS. HARRIS:  Justice Scalia, for one thing, 

if this case were being litigated under the 
Establishment Clause, it wouldn't be critical whether

the monument were actually Government speech, because 
the Establishment Clause can be implicated by the 
Government's interaction with private speech as well. 
That said, I do not think it's the case that anybody who 
came across this monument would know that the Government 
is speaking.

 The monument says it is presented by the 
Eagles.  It has the Eagles emblem.  The mayor himself 
testified in his deposition that he thought the monument 
was owned by the city, because it's the Eagles and not 
the -- I'm sorry; was owned by the Eagles, because it is 
the Eagles and not the city that maintains that 
monument.

 I think there is a very real question about 

what people would think here and if those perceptions 
are important the easy way to clarify it is for the city 
to step up and adopt the monument as Government speech, 
which it won't do here.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't merely allowing the 

monument to be built on public property sufficient 
acceptance?  If somebody came up to you and said I'd 
like to put up a monument in your front yard, and you 
said sure go ahead, do that, aren't you accepting 
that -- whatever the monument says, in a sense?

different from a public park, and that matters because 
when all the Government has done is said sure, go ahead, 
put your monument in our park, that's all the Government 
ever does when it administers access to a public forum. 
If it's doing it on a content basis, that's a problem. 
The Government --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but it doesn't -- it 

doesn't have to do that, say, for time place and manner 
restrictions for access to a public forum if it really 
is a public forum.  There is something more involved 
here.

 This is closer to the case of the individual 
who says sure, put the McCain sign on -- on my lawn.  No 
one is going to doubt that the person whose house is 
there is in favor of McCain; and -- and it seems to me 
we are in the same situation with the monument in the 
city.

 MS. HARRIS:  Again, I think because it's a 
public park and because public forums are always used 
for the expression of -- of ideas that the Government 
does not necessarily agree with --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Sure, but when you get the 

monument --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  We do not -- there is no 
pervasive understanding or non-pervasive one, I would 
have thought, in the United States that anyone who wants 
to display a message in granite in a public park can put 
it there.  No one assumes that.  Everyone assumes that, 
if the granite monument is there, the city or whatever 
has said, yes, we approve it, put it there.

 MS. HARRIS:  The city in this case --

everybody may assume that, and they would be right.  The 
city in this case did say, yes, we approve that monument 
and not that one.  So you can put yours up, and you 
can't.  That doesn't solve the First Amendment problem. 
That is the First Amendment problem that the Government 
--

JUSTICE SOUTER:  It may create the First 
Amendment problem, but it seems to me, going back to 
Justice Alito's question, that the City's decision is a 
clear adoption of the monument.

 MS. HARRIS:  If all we have, I think, 
Justice Souter, is that the city has permitted one 
private speaker to erect a monument, there is no 
constitutional or judicially manageable line between 
that and just the ordinary thing the Government always 
does when it grants preferred access to a public forum, 
which is to say you're in, you're out.  If that's enough

for adoption, then there are no more First Amendment 
violations through lack of equal access.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but even on your own 

criterion, if the city passes a resolution saying we 
adopt this, you're still -- you're going to be faced 
with precisely the content discrimination problem that 
you're arguing about here.

 MS. HARRIS:  But because it's adopted it as 

its own message, then we think the Government is 
speaking.  And when the Government is speaking, as the 
United States, said it is entitled to make content and 
viewpoint distinctions, but in order to do that, it has 
to step up and speak itself.  That's the justification 
for the Government speech doctrine.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  You're basically just 

arguing for a clear statement rule.  I mean, Justice 
Alito's question, my analogies are suggestive of the 
fact that there is an affirmative Government act of some 
indication of approval when it says, yes, you can put 
the monument here.  And what you're arguing for is, 
well, we want a clearer statement, we want it to say, 
yes, we really adopt it, it's ours from the heart.  And 
that seems to be the difference between your position 
and the -- and the position that acceptance of the 
monument is enough.

MS. HARRIS:  I would formulate it only 
slightly differently, which is not so much a clear 
statement but that those are really two different 
things, approving it for access and adopting the message 
as the Government's own.  And that the differences --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you can --
MS. HARRIS:  --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  You can make that

distinction.  There's no -- I understand the distinction 
you're making, but because I don't see that that's a 
distinction that a reasonable member of the public would 
understand to be implied by the -- or at least to be --
to be raised by the placement of the monument, I don't 
know why it's a distinction that should be significant 
for First Amendment purposes.

 MS. HARRIS:  If what matters is the public 
perception, then, yes, we do think that to clarify an 
unclear situation like this, where have you a monument 
that says it's presented by the Eagles, it has the 
Eagles emblem, the Eagles are continuing to maintain it 
in the park, and that's a fact we should assume a 
reasonable observer would know, then, yes, be clear. 
The Government -- there's one way to clarify that, and 
that's for the Government to adopt it.

it, can it at that time specify what it understands the 
statement to be?

 MS. HARRIS:  I think it can, Justice Alito. 
It can adopt -- now the Government is speaking, now this 
is the Government's own message, and it can tailor its 
adoption to make clear what message it's adopting.

 And in answer to some of Justice Scalia's 
questions, I think the Government here could put up a 
plaque in front of the Eagles' monument that says 
"Monument of the City of Pleasant Grove and dedicated to 
the role that the Ten Commandments play in secular law." 
It can do that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose the resolution of 

adoption by the City Council just says, "The City 
Council agrees that this monument of the Eagle 
Association expresses an idea worthy of the public's 
attention."

 MS. HARRIS:  I think the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that enough?
 MS. HARRIS:  No.  I think that the ordinance 

-- or the ordinance has to do one more thing, which is 
to -- which is to say, "This is a monument of the City 
of Pleasant Grove, we adopt the content of the 
monument," not just "we approve it."  "We are giving it 
preferential access, and here is why."

JUSTICE SOUTER:  You want a signing 

statement as well as a signature?

 (Laughter.)
 MS. HARRIS:  Like that.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it depend on --
given the focus on public perception, does it depend on 
the content of the speech?  In other words, if you came 
across a monument and it said, "The Eagles are a lot 
better than every other organization, you should give 
money to the Eagles," someone is going to walk by that 
and say, "Well, that's probably not the City, that's 
probably the Eagles."  But the Eagles, you know, for all 
the good they do, did not come up with the Ten 
Commandments, and somebody is going to look at that and 
say, "That's probably the City."  They are not going to 
look at that and immediately say, "That's what the 
Eagles believe."

 MS. HARRIS:  Well, I think it's actually 
trickier than that, more complicated than that, Your 
Honor.  Again, given this monument, I think there will 
be questions about whether this is the speech of the 
Eagles.  And I actually think that, given all the legal 
sensitivities around a Ten Commandments monument, your 
average citizen, when they see a religious monument in a 
park, may well think that may be private speech because

the Government usually can't endorse or at least 
sometimes can't endorse religious speech.  So I actually 
think these questions are very complicated.

 And, again, if you want to be clear about 

who's speaking, there's an easy way to do that, which is 
for the Government straightforwardly and clearly to 
adopt this speech as its own.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if it's just a statue 

of George Washington?  What kind of a resolution does 
the city council adopt?  "We endorse everything George 
Washington ever said"?

 MS. HARRIS:  No.  No.  Again, and in my 

answer to Justice Alito, they can adopt any resolution 
they want so long as they adopt that statue as a --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, if --
MS. HARRIS: -- city memorial.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right, and I think 

they would adopt a resolution that says, "We think 
George Washington is worthy of respect and emulation on 
the part of our citizens."

 MS. HARRIS:  And so long as that is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it could say that, why 

couldn't it say the same thing about the Ten 
Commandments?  "We think the Ten Commandments are worthy 
of respect and" -- and I wouldn't say "emulation"; I

would say "respect and reverence by our citizens."

 MS. HARRIS:  So long as --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would that be enough?
 MS. HARRIS:  So long as it is preceded by a 
statement that the city actually adopts the memorial as 
its own, that this is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what that 

means.

 MS. HARRIS:  -- a Pleasant Grove memorial or 

a Pleasant Grove monument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It has acquired the 
memorial.  The City has acquired property in this 
memorial and has agreed for this memorial to be placed 
in the city park.  Period.  "We believe that the Ten 
Commandments which are embodied in this memorial are 
worthy of respect by the citizens of Pleasant Grove" --
is that enough?

 MS. HARRIS:  It may be that if the 

Government goes on long enough, it will have connoted 
what is very important here, which is that it is 
prepared to adopt the content of that monument as its 
own.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what that 
means.  You keep saying it, and I don't know what it 
means.

MS. HARRIS:  It means --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would have thought 
adopting what I said shows that it is adopting the 
content of the monument insofar as the monument says the 
Ten Commandments should be respected by the citizens of 
Pleasant Grove.  Is that enough?

 MS. HARRIS:  If the City says --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or it has to say, "We 

believe in the Ten Commandments"?

 MS. HARRIS:  No.  No.  I understand your 
question, Justice Scalia.  If the City says what you 
just said, "We are adopting this monument insofar" and 
however it wants to finish that sentence, that is fine.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't think that's 
fairly implied by the mere fact that it is there in 
Pleasant Grove's park and that Pleasant Grove City 
Council has allowed it to be constructed there?  Don't 
you think that's implicit?

 MS. HARRIS:  No, I don't, Your Honor.  I 

think that all that implies is that Pleasant Grove has 
decided this speech is worthy of display in this public 
park based on its content.  And that is the decision the 
City can't make.  If it were just a formality, if it 
were simple, and it's all the same, who cares?, then I 
think that Pleasant Grove would be here saying something

different, which is, "We adopt.  We adopt.  We'll check 
that box."  There are substantive reasons why it doesn't 
-- it may be a fine line --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe the City doesn't know 

--

cross it.

MS. HARRIS: -- but the City doesn't want to 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- know what you mean by 
"We adopt," just as I don't know what you mean by "We 
adopt."

 MS. HARRIS:  Well, whether or not the City 
knows what we mean, what we know from the City's brief 
is that what it's saying is -- and this is on page 33 of 
its brief -- the Government speech here is only in the 
act of selection.  Selection.  It's not about the 
content of that monument.  That's not enough to make a 
Government speech, and the City is not permitted to 
speak through selection, and --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What do we do -- is this 

monument suspiciously similar to the one in Texas?  And 
so if the history is the same, you would know that there 
was -- a big element of this was Cecile B. DeMille 
trying to promote his movie, The Ten Commandments.  So 
he gave money to the Eagles, and the Eagles put Ten 
Commandments all over because it would be good for the

morality of people, and also it would help promote the 
movie.  All right?  Is that true -- is that the actual 
description here?

 MS. HARRIS:  This is part of the same Eagles 

project --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
 MS. HARRIS:  -- that was --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so if that's the 

history of it, what does that mean?  I mean, where do we 
go with that?  Then this is in fact partly an attempt to 
promote morality, partly an attempt to be civic, partly 
an attempt to promote a movie.  So, what do we do with 
that?

 MS. HARRIS:  It's all a private message, and 

it may be a private message that has many different 
elements, but nothing about that suggests Government 
speech.  And even if all the Government is doing in its 
public part is promoting one version of the Cecile 
DeMille movie, it can't do that on a content basis.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?  Why not?  Why --
suppose that there -- there are certain messages that 
private people had like "eat vitamins" --

MS. HARRIS:  Uh-huh.

with a totally different content, "ride the roller 
coaster," and they say this part of the park is designed 
to get healthy children, not put children at risk.  So 
therefore we like messages to eat vitamins, and we don't 
want messages, "ride the roller coaster."  This is all 
private.  It's the -- you know -- now what?

 MS. HARRIS:  The problem is that it's a 

public park, and content --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So in other words, they --

the --

MS. HARRIS:  Eating vitamins and roller 

coasters are not --

JUSTICE BREYER:  They can't do either.
 MS. HARRIS:  No.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any case that says 

-- can they have playgrounds in the park?

 MS. HARRIS:  They can have playgrounds, yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, so we have right in 

the playground, we have "eat vitamins," "eat your --
clean up all your -- all the food in your plate," "don't 
throw food at your brother," okay?

 So -- I mean --
MS. HARRIS:  Those are private messages.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, all private.
 MS. HARRIS:  Uh-huh.  Okay.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because there are various 

groups that feel that's important; the city says yes, it 
is; and we don't want things like pull the dog's tail, 
or --

(Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- whatever.  So -- so 

what's wrong with that?  Where does the First Amendment 
forbid that?  You promote -- they want in this corner, 
promoting in the playground good things that they like 
and not bad ones.  Where does it permit it?  What's the 
case that says that the Government couldn't do that?

 MS. HARRIS:  It's all the cases that say the 

Government can't do it.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Give one and I'll read it. 

Give me three; I'll read them.

 MS. HARRIS:  I'll give you Pinette.  The 

Government can't make content based decisions in a 
public forum.  And there is not a limit --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But the children's 

playground isn't the public forum.

 MS. HARRIS:  Oh, but the Government -- a 

public park is a public forum.  If the Government wants 
to set aside part of that park -- change the physical 
characteristics, change the principal use and bear the 
attendant cost, it can definitely do that.  That is in

fact the answer to the sculpture garden; that's what 
happened there.  The Government waived part of what it 
been a public forum; it put up fences; it changed the 
principal use; it limited the public access.  It is no 
longer a park.  It is now a museum.

 I'm sorry.  I misunderstood.  The Government 

can --

Thank you.

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see where you're going. 

 MS. HARRIS:  Okay.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you taking this line 
because you say if the city council votes for it, then 
the voters can know those people voted to put up the Ten 
Commandments; we don't like that; so we are going to 
vote them out?  Is that -- what underlies this notion 
that it isn't good enough for them to approve the 
placement of the monument, but it has to be some kind of 
formal declaration?

 MS. HARRIS:  What underlies it is that the 
Government speech -- the Government speech doctrine is 
an exception to normal First Amendment, and very 
important First Amendment constraints.  And what 
underlies the distinction is that that exception is 
justified only when the Government is speaking for 
itself.  The Government needs to be able to promote its

own messages, its own ideas.  But if it's not doing 
that, if it's disclaiming the content of the monument, 
saying those are not our own ideas, those are not our 
own messages, then there is just no justification for 
allowing it to prefer one form of private speech over 
another.  The justification for allowing that exception 
is missing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But it's not disclaiming it 

here.  The Government isn't disclaiming it.  And the 
difference it seems to me between you and your friends 
on the other side is you want this clear statement.  You 
want a statement -- for example if you took Justice 
Scalia's statement, that would satisfy you, and it would 
also be the poison pill in the Establishment Clause. 
Isn't that what's -- I mean, that's okay with me.  I 
don't see that as an illegitimate object.  I was a Van 
Orden dissenter -- I mean, but isn't that what is 
driving this?

 MS. HARRIS:  Well, I do think that the --

the city is a bit on the horns of a dilemma because it 
wants to have it both ways.  It wants to be able to say 
this speech is governmental for purposes of blocking 
equal access rights; but not so governmental at that 
it's a big Establishment Clause problem.  So yes, I 
think there is a dilemma here for the city.

Thank you, Your Honors.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Sekulow, you have two minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SEKULOW:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
 With regard to the hypothetical about the 

Senator McCain or President-elect Obama signs, there is 
another factor that's important here; and that is those 
signs are created by those -- usually by the campaigns. 
So the fact that it's created by a third party doesn't 
in any way diminish the speech aspect of an individual 
who has put that sign in their home.  Also with regard 
to the adopt the monument, governments don't adopt 
monuments; they adopt resolutions that accept monuments. 
That's the way it worked here; that's the way it works 
in most municipalities.  That's this -- the trigger of 
allowing the monument to be displayed.  Here there are 
two.  The city -- it was approached and made a formal 
acceptance, and it was noted later in their minutes as 
well, so in two different places.

 With regard to the adoption of the speech 

problem, Justice Alito, under the hypothetical or -- not 
hypothetical, the factual situation that you talk about, 
under the Tenth Circuit's theory, the case, in

Respondent's theory of the case, al-Qaeda sympathizers 
could come in and say we want to erect a monument 
praising the value of the terrorists, and unless there's 
a compelling governmental interest, there would be no 
basis on which to deny it.  That's why the whole public 
forum analysis on this, in our view is absolutely 
incorrect.

 And finally on the adopt a speech, there are 

monuments and memorials that incorporate a variety of 
message, including Holocaust memorials, and they will 
often have in place Nazi-era propaganda, the signs from 
the Nazis that were designed to draw hatred towards 
Jews; and they will incorporate those into the monuments 
and the displays.  They are not adopting the message of 
the Nazis; they are showing the history of what took 
place during an era.  That's very, very different.

 The Statute of Liberty, which was donated to 
the United States, was from the Franco-American Union, a 
private organization.  The United States -- and it's 
found in the appendix to our reply brief -- specifically 
accepted the monument, authorized the president to 
accept and they erected the pedestal.  All privately 
funded in that regard, and it was originated by a third 
party.  The Government was speaking when they erected 
that monument; the fact that the Antiquities Act came

into play, which just means you cannot harm those 
monuments, it's no different than Pioneer Park, which is 
a national historic treasure.

 And last point, Mr. Chief Justice, if I man, 
is the reliance on Pinette is misplaced because as this 
Court said, Pinette is an Establishment Clause case, and 
the reliance here by the Respondent has been on the Free 
Speech Clause.  We think the Tenth Circuit is wrong, 
both under the Government speech analysis and under the 
forum approach, and for that reason should be vacated.

 Thank you.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
