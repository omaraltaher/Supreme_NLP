CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-628, Linda Frew v. Albert Hawkins.


Ms. Zinn.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN F. ZINN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MS. ZINN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may


it please the Court:


Sovereign immunity should not bar enforcement of


the consent decree in this case for two reasons. 


First, when State officials ask a district court


to enter a consent decree, they submit their rights


concerning the decree for judicial determination, thereby 

waiving any possible claim for objection on the basis of


immunity.


Second, the decree in this case provides


prospective relief to protect the supremacy of Federal


law, exactly as envisioned by Ex Parte Young.


QUESTION:  May I ask on -- on the first point? 


You say when State officials submit to -- to a decree. 


It's -- it's immaterial, as far as you're concerned,


whether the State Attorney General defended the -- the


suit or represented these officials.  Is that right?


MS. ZINN:  No, it's not immaterial.  The --

Texas' Attorney General is authorized by the legislature


to represent the State and its employees --


QUESTION:  No.  I understand that, but suppose


he hadn't been and suppose it is just the State officials


who appeared in an Ex Parte Young suit.  They're --


they're sued.  There's no other State official who takes


part in the proceedings.  Nonetheless, they enter into a


consent decree.  Is it your submission that even without


any other participation by anybody else in the State, that


consent decree binds not just them, but I gather you say


future officials in -- in their offices?  Right?


MS. ZINN:  Unrepresented by the State Attorney


General.


QUESTION:  Unrepresented.  You would --


QUESTION:  Well, but wouldn't -- wouldn't there


be a question of fact in that case?  I mean, it would be


odd, I -- I would suppose not to have the State Attorney


General there, and -- and wouldn't the -- if I were a


trial judge, I'd say, well, is this the State that is


submitting this -- this settlement?  I mean, wouldn't --


wouldn't there be, theoretically at least, a fact question


in Justice Scalia's circumstances? 


MS. ZINN:  Fact and a matter of law, Your Honor. 


The question under this Court's decision recently in


Lapides would be whether those officials are authorized to

represent the State in court, even absent their attorney. 


That would be so unusual in Texas I can't imagine it even


happening, but --


QUESTION:  No, but that -- but that's a waiver


theory.  I mean, if you're proceeding on a waiver theory,


you -- you need the State there. 


But let's assume you're not proceeding on the


waiver theory.  You have the second ground, which is just


if you have authority to enter the decree, you have


authority to enforce the decree.  Now, for purpose of that


argument, does it make any difference to you whether the


State Attorney General is there or whether these officials


have the power to represent the State?


MS. ZINN: 


Under our second argument, our 

position is that since the decree is a remedy ordered in a


valid Ex Parte Young case, it provides prospective relief


only from alleged ongoing violations of Federal law.  The


-- the remedy is proper.


QUESTION:  And therefore it's consistent with


the Eleventh Amendment without any waiver.


MS. ZINN:  Correct.  The Eleventh Amendment is


not engaged for that -- for that --


QUESTION:  Can you tell us how it worked?  The


representative of the Attorney General was in court and he


stands up and he says, we insist on sovereign immunity,

and the judge say, all right, that's act one.  It's


closed.  And then did the same officials stay and they


say, well, now we're here on the Eleventh Amendment?  I


mean, how -- how did this work?  And --


MS. ZINN:  In -- in this case --


QUESTION:  And let -- let me just say also


there's no excerpt of record or docket entry.  The only


thing I have is the consent decree.  Was there any order


saying the consent decree dated so and so is hereby


entered as the judgment of the court?  I mean, can I find


that anywhere?


MS. ZINN:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- the lodging


has the -- as its last page, the order to correct the


consent decree which states that the -- the order was --


the unopposed motion to -- to correct the consent decree


has merit and should be granted.  The decree was entered


as the court's order in February of 1996.


QUESTION:  And --


QUESTION:  There was no separate order.  It was


just this consent decree that's in the lodging.  That's --


MS. ZINN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  -- that's it.


MS. ZINN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Now maybe we can go back and


you can tell me who the -- was there an act one and an act

two, act one being the State asserts immunity, act two


being the Eleventh Amendment, or -- or were the same


parties before the court at all times?


MS. ZINN:  The same parties --


QUESTION:  Wearing different -- wearing


different hats or proceeding under some different theory.


MS. ZINN:  The same parties were before the


Court for the entire case with the exception of two State


agencies which were dismissed early on.


QUESTION:  Right. 


QUESTION:  That's the puzzle in this case.  The


State as State was dismissed at the threshold, and then we


have an Ex Parte Young case.  And now we're talking about


Eleventh Amendment immunity again.  So the State is out of


the case.  It's proceeding as an Ex Parte Young case.  How


did it then become converted back into a case against the


State so that we're talking about whether the State waived


its immunity?


MS. ZINN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  Our position,


as well recognized apparently, is that this is an Ex Parte


Young case.  However, the State officials in their


briefing have urged that that is not correct and that this


-- this, at least in part, is not a valid order under Ex


Parte Young.


QUESTION:  The State, if -- if I remember

correctly, came before the judge and urged the approval of


this consent decree.


MS. ZINN:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Did it not?  And there were -- there


were several representatives of the State who so


testified.


MS. ZINN:  Correct, and they were unanimous. 


The -- all of the State officials and their lawyer were


unanimous in requesting the district court to enter the


consent decree.


QUESTION:  That -- that's your waiver.  That's


the waiver side of your argument. 


MS. ZINN:  Correct. 


QUESTION: 


I frankly am reluctant to -- to 

decide the case on that ground if another ground is


available simply because that would require a case-by-case


investigation as to -- to what extent the participation by


-- by other State officials existed, whether they were


authorized to participate and so forth and so on. 


Whereas, your other ground doesn't require that -- that


case-by-case investigation, and wouldn't that be a -- a


much clearer line to -- to establish?


MS. ZINN:  In our -- in our view both positions


are clear in this case.  The -- the --


QUESTION:  You have to make sure that the State

Attorney General was authorized to represent the State in


this case or whatever other official you say committed the


waiver.  That would -- that would be a factual


investigation in every case, wouldn't it?


MS. ZINN:  No.  In Lapides, it appeared to -- to


be a question of law.  The issue --


QUESTION:  No, but Justice Scalia's question


didn't go to waiver.  It went to representation.  And


Lapides says, if you can represent, you can waive.  But


there would be a question of representation, wouldn't


there?


MS. ZINN:  But in Lapides, it appeared to me


that that was resolved fairly simply based on the


application of Federal law to the State --


QUESTION:  Once -- once it was understood that


he could represent. 


MS. ZINN:  Yes, which was determined by an


examination of the State statutes involved.  And the Texas


law on that point is almost word for word the same as the


-- the Georgia constitutional provisions --


QUESTION:  Oh, sure.  Easy.  I mean, I'm -- I'm


not saying that this would be a difficult case, but you


would have to, I suppose, make that inquiry.


MS. ZINN:  But --


QUESTION:  This case might not be difficult, but

I -- I don't like going rummaging around in State law.  I


find Federal law hard enough. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. ZINN:  I do too, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Zinn, I thought that you said in


response to my question that this -- this waiver -- that's


not your preferred ground.  You said you're arguing it


because the State insisted that this was Eleventh


Amendment and it wasn't waived.  But your -- you brought


an Ex Parte Young suit.  You've got a consent decree under


that heading, and -- and that argument, if it prevails,


would be -- one would not need to reach the question of


the Eleventh Amendment in the --.


MS. ZINN:  That's correct. 


The -- one way to 

look at this is that given the Texas Attorney General's


argument that this is not an Ex Parte Young case, not a


valid order under Ex Parte Young, to the extent that the


Court agrees with that, those points have been waived


because by asking the district court to enter the consent


decree, the State officials submitted their rights


concerning the decree for judicial determination.  And by


doing that --


QUESTION:  Let's put -- put it this way.  Are


you saying that if the State officials negotiate a consent


decree that goes beyond the Eleventh Amendment -- or that

goes beyond -- pardon me -- that goes beyond Ex Parte


Young's --


MS. ZINN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- rules, that then there must be a


waiver?


MS. ZINN:  No.


QUESTION:  All right.  How can they do that


without a waiver?


MS. ZINN:  Well --


QUESTION:  Especially if they've asserted their


immunity at the beginning.


MS. ZINN:  Because under this Court's


traditional rules concerning equitable decrees, even a


disputed injunction need not be specifically tied to the 

provisions of law for the --


QUESTION:  So you want us to write an opinion


that says after the State has specifically asserted its


Eleventh Amendment immunity, its officials may negotiate a


consent decree which goes beyond the boundaries of


jurisdiction set forth in -- in Ex Parte Young without


waiver.


MS. ZINN:  The question of the scope of remedy


is a different question from the Eleventh Amendment/Ex


Parte Young question.  The Ex Parte Young question is a


jurisdictional question, but the question of the scope of

proper remedy --


QUESTION:  Well -- well, you introduced the


point of remedy.  That wasn't part of my question.  My --


my question was whether or not, having asserted the


immunity in a -- in -- under the assumption that the


immunity has not been waived, the State officials can


negotiate a consent decree that goes beyond the usual


rules of Ex Parte Young, it goes beyond the authority


granted to the courts under Ex Parte Young, without


relying on the theory of waiver.


MS. ZINN:  For example, damages?  Would that fit


within your hypothetical?  Because in that case without


waiver, no.


QUESTION: 


You -- you really can't tell until 

the decree is entered whether or not it complies with Ex


Parte Young, I would think, because it isn't necessarily


fought out on the -- in the -- in the trial of the case


exactly what the remedy will be.


MS. ZINN:  The -- the validity of consent decree


should be -- as in an Ex Parte Young case, should be


measured under this -- this Court's decisions, for


example, in Milliken and Rufo.  Milliken says that the


remedy must tend to or to remedy the violation proven. 


And Rufo says that when you have a consent decree, it may


aim even higher than that.  Because in the course of --

 QUESTION:  But maybe -- maybe there should be a


special rule for Ex Parte Young cases.  In the ordinary


case, going beyond the mere violation does not offend any


other provision of the Constitution, but the argument here


is, oh, once you go beyond holding the officer to


compliance with Federal law, once you go beyond that,


you're out of Ex Parte Young and you're moving against the


State and the Eleventh Amendment is a bar.  So maybe


there's a special rule with regard to remediation in -- in


Ex Parte Young cases.


MS. ZINN:  Milliken involved a State official,


and it's one of the key cases about the scope of disputed


injunctions.  And it says that remedial orders may go


beyond the exact scope, the precise scope of the violation 

at issue.


QUESTION:  Is this outside of Ex Parte Young?  I


-- I mean, the way I was thinking about it, which might


not be right, is that what you were saying in the second


part of your argument is that Ex Parte Young permits,


without the consent of a State, an individual to sue a


State official in his official capacity, asking for an


injunction on the ground that the official has violated


Federal law.  That's what Ex Parte Young says.


MS. ZINN:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  And now you get that injunction, and

that injunction contains provisions that aren't all about


Federal law.  Some of them are about related State law. 


And I thought perhaps the way to look at it was, and that


injunction does not violate the Eighth -- the Eleventh


Amendment.  You don't need a State to give consent because


it's all part of an effort to cure the Federal violation


with related matters thrown in.


MS. ZINN:  Correct.


QUESTION:  Ex Parte Young authorizes such a


thing.


MS. ZINN:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Now, is that last statement right?


MS. ZINN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  So then it's not outside Ex Parte


Young.  You're giving us an interpretation of what Ex


Parte Young means.


MS. ZINN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And what is your authority for saying


that Ex Parte Young validates the going beyond the Federal


issues involved?  You mentioned Milliken.  Is that -- is


that authority for that?


MS. ZINN:  Milliken.  Hutto v. Finney would be


another example.  A district court need not sit back and


hope that the State officials will comply with its proper


remedial order.  It can enforce that order.

 QUESTION:  Well, I'm not talking so much about


enforcement as about entering it in the first place


consistently with Ex Parte Young.


MS. ZINN:  Well, this Court's decision in


Firefighters generally sets out standards for entry of a


consent decree, and a decree is properly entered, as this


one was found to be, if it furthers -- if it serves to


resolve a dispute within the court's subject matter


jurisdiction, which is the case here -- this is a Federal


question about the Medicaid Act -- if it is generally


within the scope of the pleadings, which is true in this


case, and if the remedy in the decree serves to further


the objectives of the -- in this case, the Medicaid Act,


which is true about all of the provisions of the decree in 

this case.


QUESTION:  So you're really saying that it


doesn't go beyond Ex Parte Young.  I mean, the -- the


premises of some of the arguments here that it does go


beyond it, in your judgment, is -- is in fact a false


premise.


MS. ZINN:  That's correct.  Our position is that


the district court could have entered this -- this decree


as a disputed injunction if the State officials had not


decided to consent.


QUESTION:  When you had --

 QUESTION:  Would you help -- excuse me.  May I


ask one more question? 


Would you help me on one thing?  My


understanding was -- and I -- I may simply be wrong on


this.  My understanding was that the claim that this went


beyond Young was not a claim that it -- it mandated State


law -- or mandated the performance of State law


obligations, but that it went further than it had to to


enjoin the Federal violation by getting into details about


what the State officers had to do or had to refrain from


do -- from doing.  Am I correct that it's -- it's not --


the claim is not that it got into State law but that it


simply went beyond the scope of a proper remedial order


under the Federal law?  Is that correct?


MS. ZINN:  Well, I'd hate to put words into Mr.


Cruz's mouth.


QUESTION:  I know.  I should be asking --


MS. ZINN:  But I believe that is part of their


claim. 


QUESTION:  Okay.


MS. ZINN:  May I reserve the rest of my time?


QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. Zinn.

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Enforcement of the decree in this case does not


violate the Eleventh Amendment for two reasons.  First,


any Eleventh Amendment objection was waived, and second,


enforcement is permissible under Ex Parte Young.


Now, the waiver issue arises in this case


because the State officials are arguing that the relief in


the consent decree that is directed to them violates the


Eleventh Amendment, and it is that Eleventh Amendment


objection that those same officials, together with the


Attorney General, waived when they asked the district


court to enter the very relief that they are now objecting 

to on Eleventh Amendment grounds. 


And the reason that there is waiver is that


under this Court's cases, when the Attorney General on the


-- of the State on behalf of the State invokes a Federal


court's jurisdiction, Eleventh Amendment immunity is


waived.  Now, when the Attorney General in this case


entered into a consent decree on behalf of State officials


in their official capacity and then asked the district


court to enter that decree, he clearly invoked that


court's jurisdiction and waived any Eleventh Amendment


objection to the entry of that judgment against those

State officials.


QUESTION:  Suppose the Attorney General had not


been involved and simply the State officials on their own


entered into this consent decree.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  First of all, you would have the


question of waiver, and that is answered by the inquiry


that Lapides and other waiver cases have -- have


instructed, which is do those -- are those officials


authorized by State law to conduct litigation on behalf of


the State.


QUESTION:  So that would be a factual inquiry in


every case whether the particular official --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, I would say -- I would say


it's a legal question --


QUESTION:  I understand. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- that typically in almost


every State, Justice Scalia, it would be the Attorney


General who is authorized to represent the State in


litigation. 


QUESTION:  Well, Justice Scalia can preserve his


own hypothetical. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Right. 


QUESTION:  But suppose that there was -- that


the officials did not have the authority to waive the


Eleventh Amendment, but they did enter into a consent

decree.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes.  Then you get to the second


argument in this case which is an Ex Parte Young argument,


and the Ex Parte Young issue is that the consent decree in


this case is permissible under Ex Parte Young because it


provides prospective relief against State officials based


on the Federal Medicaid statute.  And those are the three


requirements of an Ex Parte Young suit, that it be --


QUESTION:  This -- this carries you so far


beyond the theory of Ex Parte Young, and the theory of Ex


Parte Young is you're not impinging upon State sovereign


immunity when you are simply requiring State officials to


adhere to State law.  They are acting ultra vires when


they're -- when they're violating Federal law, and 

therefore, you're not impinging upon the State's sovereign


immunity.


But now with the theory that you're expounding,


you're not only holding them to compliance with Federal


law, but you're saying even when you're not acting ultra


vires, when you have a lot of perfectly legal options of


how to comply with Federal law, you will -- you will


choose this option.  And that -- that is, it seems to me,


impinging upon State sovereign immunity in -- in a way


that -- that the mere theory of Ex Parte Young does not


justify.

 MR. GORNSTEIN:  In an Ex Parte Young action,


State officials like all other Federal litigants are free


to enter into consent decrees that go beyond what is


strictly required by Federal law on one or more issues


because there is a tradeoff.  They then get less relief or


no relief on other issues that they may care about.  So


this is a system that benefits Federal court litigants


generally, and it is also one that benefits the State and


its State officials.


QUESTION:  I'm not worried about the officials. 


Yes, the officials get a good deal.  They -- they get of


the suit.  They get a -- a decree.  But what about the


State who on our -- on our current hypothesis, the State


is out of the proceeding. 


The Attorney General is not 

there and here are these State officers who are giving


away a whole lot of -- of options that the State has, and


they're -- they're saying, yes, bind the State even though


the suit is just against me.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  First of all, we -- we presume


-- this Court presumes that State officials, when they act


in their official capacity, are acting in good faith to


implement the best interests of the State. 


Second of all, the State does benefit when its


officials can enter into decrees that --


QUESTION:  Mr. Gornstein, is -- is taking the

Attorney General out of it kind of a hypothetical


question?  Do you know of any institutional decree,


whether it involves schools, prisons, the Medicaid program


which the State Attorney General isn't there?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  I don't know of any such case,


and as I was telling Justice Scalia before, all the


Court's waiver cases up until now have been ones in which


the Attorney General has represented the State and has


waived the -- has -- has been authorized by the State to


represent the State's interests in litigation. 


QUESTION:  Might be improper for -- for the --


for the trial court to go beyond strict compliance with


Federal law, to -- to approve a consent decree that goes


beyond that without the presence of the -- I mean, maybe 

waiver is a necessary concomitant of -- of the theory of


Ex Parte Young that you're giving us.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No, I don't think it -- it is a


necessary -- waiver is not a necessary concomitant because


it is a component of an Ex Parte Young case.  This Court


said, for example, in the Rufo case that State -- it had


no doubt that State and local officials, in order to


resolve litigation, could agree to relief that goes beyond


what's required by Federal law.


QUESTION:  Mr. Gornstein, I want to clarify what


you mean in your argument when you say go beyond.  There

are -- and here are two possibilities. 


One, you throw in an entirely new obligation,


and you say, you know, by the way, we'll -- we'll also


agree to a program of pediatric podiatry, which isn't


covered by the statute.  We'll do that too just to show


you how good our faith is.


A second possibility is we'll show you how we


will implement our agreement to abide by what we


understand to be Federal law.  We will throw in a how-to-


do-it or a how-we-are-going-to-do-it clause. 


I understand your argument, when you refer to


going beyond the letter of Federal law and agreeing to


that in a settlement, to refer to a how-to-do-it kind of


agreement as opposed to a new substantive obligation 

agreement.  I assume.  Is that correct?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes, but let -- let me explain


further.


QUESTION:  I guess my question is --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- why do you acquiesce in this


phrase, going beyond Ex Parte Young?  Have you ever --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No, I --


QUESTION:  Has anybody seen a consent decree


that simply said, we'll obey the law?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  I didn't say it went beyond

Ex Parte Young.  I said it went beyond what was strictly


required by Federal law.  And as this Court said in the


Rufo case, every Federal court remedial order that's


entered by a Federal court goes beyond what's strictly


required by Federal law.


QUESTION:  That's all --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  And Milliken permits that as


long as it's aimed at remedying a violation. 


But there's one step beyond Milliken here, and


that Rufo says that you can even agree to relief that goes


beyond what a court would order after a trial as long as


the relief furthers the objectives of the underlying law


because there you are operating with the consent of the


State officials in -- in selecting that relief. 

QUESTION:  You should have given a different


answer to Justice Souter then because certainly pediatric


podiatry would further the objectives of the law to


provide the medical care to -- to children. 


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, at some point it has to


resolve a bona fide dispute within the subject matter


jurisdiction of the court as well, and if there's no


arguable violation of Federal law that the relief relates


to, then it falls outside of what a court should enter as


a decree under Rufo.


QUESTION:  Well, you really haven't saved us a

whole lot of trouble then.  I -- I frankly thought that


one of the attractive features of your position was that


once you have an order, that's the end of it.  You don't


have to try the order when -- when you seek enforcement to


parse out which parts of it go too far and which parts


don't go too far.  You tell me there are some -- some that


can go too far.  We have to look to whether this is


pediatric podiatry or -- or not.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  In general, once a decree has


been entered, there's no objection that can be made at the


enforcement stage other than subject matter jurisdiction. 


But subject matter jurisdiction would include an inquiry


into whether what was at issue in the case was -- if it


was an arguable Federal claim or sought to further the 

objectives underlying an arguable Federal claim.  That's


going to be rare that it won't do that, but if it doesn't


do that, the State has a right to object to that on


subject matter jurisdiction grounds. 


By the way, the State also has the right always


to move for modification of provisions under this Court's


decision in Rufo that are not arguably related to -- that


are not related to any arguable violation of Federal law. 


If it's just a frivolous underpinning to the suit, the --


the State could always move for modification and get that


provision eliminated under Rufo.

 QUESTION:  The Attorney General was involved in


the case in Rufo.  You said in all of the cases that you


know --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No, no.  I -- no.  Rufo itself


was a suit against local officials, but what Rufo said is


that State and local officials can enter into these --


these kinds of agreements and that State officials and


local officials could obtain modifications based on


changes in circumstances. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.


Mr. Cruz, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. EDWARD CRUZ


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. CRUZ: 


Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court:


This case presents the basic question whether


Federal district courts are immune from the strictures of


sovereign immunity and Ex Parte Young when administering


Federal consent decrees. 


In this case, it is clear what Federal law


requires.  The Medicaid statute is very clear and


everything that Federal law requires, the State of Texas


is doing.


The dispute that the parties are having here is


not simply a theoretical dispute about whether -- what

degree of connection there should be between a remedy and


-- and an ongoing violation of Federal law.  There is no


violation of Federal law, and that fundamentally is the


problem. 


QUESTION:  But can I ask you this question?  You


say there's no violation of Federal law now.  Does that


mean there was no violation of Federal law when the


lawsuit began?


MR. CRUZ:  It does not necessarily mean that and


no court has determined that. 


QUESTION:  No, but isn't it -- isn't the -- in


order to determine the court's power to act, don't you


have to look at the facts at the time litigation started?


MR. CRUZ: 


Well, under Ex Parte Young, the 

question is not retrospectively was there a violation of


Federal law, but -- but --


QUESTION:  No.  I understand that, but still it


seems to me your -- your jurisdictional inquiry would


focus on the situation at the time the litigation


commenced.


MR. CRUZ:  There is a strong argument that there


was not a violation of Federal law at the time the


litigation commenced, but that matter was never


adjudicated one way or the other.


QUESTION:  That's right because the State, in

effect, waived its right to adjudicate that.


MR. CRUZ:  What the State did is pursue an


option to settle the -- the matter and avoid an


adjudication.


QUESTION:  But doesn't that mean there was at


least a potential violation of law that would give the


court jurisdiction to enter a remedy, which might go


beyond merely saying, don't violate the law in the future,


that because you may have violated the law in the past, I


have the power to order you to do some things that may not


in themselves be illegal?


MR. CRUZ:  We would agree that this case was


initially properly brought under Ex Parte Young in that


the complaint, under the terms of the Verizon decision, 

alleged a violation of Federal law.  However, Ex Parte


Young is not simply a formulistic pleading requirement. 


It also is -- is, under this Court's decision in, among


other things, Green v. Mansour, a restriction on the


Federal court's jurisdiction that -- that what there would


have to be for your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, to


carry through is not simply a determination that there


might be a violation of Federal law.


QUESTION:  Well, do you think in order to enter


a consent decree, the judge had to adjudicate that there


was a violation of Federal law?

 MR. CRUZ:  No, Your Honor.  But in order for the


court now to exercise the coercive authority of the


Federal court and to order the State officials to engage


in a very detailed course of conduct, the predicate that


justifies the Young fiction in the first place is an


ongoing violation of Federal law.


QUESTION:  So you're -- you're telling us that


the effect of this consent decree, what Texas achieved by


it, is it comes into court and says, oh, let's -- let's


not fight about whether there was a violation or not,


we'll accept a consent decree, and the effect of this


consent decree is simply we'll fight about this same


question later.  Right?


MR. CRUZ: 


If the agreement was --

QUESTION:  And you haven't given up anything


else.  You've just said, let's -- let's not fight about


this.  Why would the other side ever accept such a consent


decree?  It's crazy. 


MR. CRUZ:  Well --


QUESTION:  You're just telling them, you know,


just dismiss this case, and if you want to get us, bring


the same case later.  Why would I enter into such a


consent decree?


MR. CRUZ:  The consent decree offered the other


side a great deal.  For one thing, the State, as a

voluntary agreement, agreed to carry out an extensive


course of conduct.  And if you look at the actual


record --


QUESTION:  Only so long as the State chose to do


it because on your theory, you -- you create this oddity. 


They had power -- the court had power to enter the decree


but not to enforce it. 


Would you take the same position if this had


been a litigated judgment and the exact same decree came


out at the end of the line?  And then the State says,


well, this was an Ex Parte Young suit and even though we


litigated and lost, we can still say all bets are off


because at the enforcement stage, you have to prove the


case all over again. 


Now, are you making a distinction between a


consent decree and a litigated judgment, or do you accept


that this -- if this case had been litigated and that


decree entered, it could be enforced?


MR. CRUZ:  Justice Ginsburg, we're -- we're


making both distinctions.  This would be a more difficult


case if there had been -- it had been litigated and there


had been a determination of a violation of Federal law,


but --


QUESTION:  Why?  Why would it be more difficult? 


It seems to me this is more difficult.  You agreed to it.

 MR. CRUZ:  It would be more difficult because


you at least had the predicate for Ex Parte Young in the


first place.  You had a violation of Federal law.


QUESTION:  Well, but it seems to me that when


matters are in doubt and a consent decree is entered,


obviously with the consent of both parties -- that's what


it means -- that it is a question of Federal law.  It's a


Federal judgment. 


MR. CRUZ:  It -- it is absolutely a Federal


judgment, but on the terms of the consent decree, there


was no concession of liability.  No court at any time has


ever found the State of Texas was violating Federal law.


QUESTION:  No.  But your argument, as I


understood it a moment ago, is that you can't go beyond 

Federal law because there's no violation of Federal law


now.  And that would be exactly the same whether the


predicate was a -- a litigated judgment or a consent


decree.


MR. CRUZ:  In essence --


QUESTION:  So we're in -- it seems to me you're


in the same boat under Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical. 


MR. CRUZ:  The second part of Justice Ginsburg's


hypothetical about whether even if this were fully


adjudicated, would this content -- consent decree be


proper, the answer is plainly no because this consent

decree does not enjoin ongoing violations of Federal law. 


There are a number of provisions in this consent decree --


QUESTION:  So in other -- I take that to mean,


yes, we would be making exactly the same argument --


MR. CRUZ:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  -- if this had been a litigated


decree.  We would -- we would say that --


MR. CRUZ:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  -- that the order saying, A, you did


something wrong, you violated Federal law, and B, in the


future to avoid that, you've got to do the following


things, A, B, C -- you would say so long as at the moment


of enforcement we are not then violating Federal law in


the sense found in the judgment, they cannot order A, B, 

C, and D.


MR. CRUZ:  Under Milliken, the question would be


the relation --


QUESTION:  No.  I want to know under you. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  On your theory, isn't that going to


be your answer? 


MR. CRUZ:  Our answer is going to be that the --


the jurisdiction that this Court has created under Ex


Parte Young and its progeny exists for one purpose, to


vindicate the Supremacy Clause.

 QUESTION:  No, but you're -- you're getting into


-- into a general answer, and I want a specific answer. 


As I understand it, you would say that in -- that


following the litigated case with an A, B, C, D order, you


would say that if -- if the State -- if the -- if the


other side tried to enforce A, B, C, and D, you could come


into court and say, we are not now violating Federal law


in the sense originally alleged.  Therefore, A, B, C, D,


and E cannot be enforced.  Isn't that correct, that that


would be your position? 


MR. CRUZ:  If C and D were necessary to ensure


compliance with Federal law, then they would be


permissible remedies once there was a finding under


Federal law.


QUESTION:  Well, all right.  Let's -- let's


compromise on an answer to the question.  Your answer


would be we can always object to A, B, C, and D.  We may


or may not succeed, but we can always object to it, even


though we haven't appealed it. 


MR. CRUZ:  If there's an ongoing injunction --


QUESTION:  We didn't -- we didn't appeal saying,


look, Supreme Court, they -- you know, they -- they nailed


us to the wall on liability, but they do not have


jurisdiction to order A, B, C, and D and E because they


don't have jurisdiction to enforce it.  You didn't take

that appeal and yet you feel you can raise that later.


MR. CRUZ:  If the injunction is ongoing, then


the State officials could come in at any point and say, C,


D, and E are not necessary --


QUESTION:  Can I ask you what is the purpose of


doing this?  I mean, let's think of the Medicare


provisions or the Social Security provisions, the


regulations, the statutes.  They cover volumes.  Think of


consent decrees.  Yours is only 80 pages.  I guess others


might be hundreds of pages.  And so what you're saying is


that after these have been entered, they've been entered


because there was a violation of Federal law in the view


of the plaintiff and the defendant agreed.  Okay?


Now, what you're saying is at any time, we go 

through these hundreds of pages and we try to figure out


whether each word in these hundreds of pages actually in


itself reflects the Federal law violation, of which,


remember, there were 3,000 volumes, or the State law


violation, of which there were 10,000 more volumes, and


once we figured that out, then you're going to say you can


do paragraph 867 but you can't do paragraph 868.  Now, I


just wonder what is the purpose of this exercise?


MR. CRUZ:  Justice Breyer, two responses.  First


of all, there was not an agreement that there was a


violation of Federal law.  It's certainly true the

all.  So would you please direct yourself to my question? 


MR. CRUZ:  The second response -- your -- your


question refers to volumes of Federal law and State law


that may or may not have been violated.  This case is very


simple.  It's one short section of Federal law.


QUESTION:  I'm not asking about this case.  I'm


asking about the purpose of the exercise that you are


suggesting that the Constitution requires us to undertake. 


My suggestion was that it is -- I was trying to make it


look absurd to go through that exercise because it would 

put everybody to a lot of work for no real reason.  That


was what I was trying to suggest.  Now, I suggested it so


you would respond to it because I'm sure you don't agree


with that, and therefore, I'd like you to present the


response. 


MR. CRUZ:  Justice Breyer, the exercise of


requiring a -- a violation of Federal law derives from


this Court's cases beginning with Ex Parte Young and


moving on. 


QUESTION:  You're saying the cases require it. 


Now, if that's so, that's the end of it.  You're right.

But I had the impression a different case had a much


better solution to the problem that you raise, which is


that there's some provisions in this thing that really


have nothing to do with Federal law at all.  And that's


called Rufo.  And what the -- what -- what you're supposed


to do in that situation is you can make your argument. 


You go to court.  You say rule 60(b).  You say, judge, you


see this provision over here?  This has nothing to do with


anything.  And if the judge is right, you win.  Now, why


isn't that a much more practical approach for the problem


that you're raising?


MR. CRUZ:  Justice Breyer, under the Fifth


Circuit precedent, the means to challenge this sort of


decree is precisely what we did, to challenge it.  Under


the Lelsz v. Kavanagh case, the means to challenge it is


to challenge the enforcement and --


QUESTION:  You mean you can never move for


modification prior to an enforcement action?


MR. CRUZ:  Well, you can, and that's the second


part which is the Fifth Circuit treated what we did as a


motion to modify or vacate the decree.  That's how the


Fifth Circuit interpreted what we did.  The -- the


plaintiffs came in at a year and a half --


QUESTION:  The Fifth Circuit -- excuse me.  The


Fifth Circuit said you had to -- you had to segment this

decree into bites, and plaintiff had to prove each one of


them as a violation of Federal law.  That's worlds


different from saying, here's a decree, time has shown


that it's not -- that it's too onerous, so court, please


modify it.  60(b)(5) accepts the decree as valid and


enforceable, but says that it should be modified in light


of our experience under it.  Now, that's quite different


from saying you can't enforce it.  You have to prove the


case all over again at the enforcement stage.


MR. CRUZ:  It is true that treating our -- our


argument as a motion to modify is not purely based upon


changed facts and law.  It is in part because you have the


2 years of compliance and the tremendous record the State


has, but another fundamental element of it was a challenge 

that the terms of the consent decree go far beyond what


Federal law requires.  And let me focus just for a


moment --


QUESTION:  Why don't you make a virtue of a


necessity and say that that is precisely your response to


Justice Breyer, that you cannot do what you want to do


under rule 60(b)?


MR. CRUZ:  That --


QUESTION:  Why not?  That's --


QUESTION:  For the reason that Justice Ginsburg


stated, that all 60(b) enables you to do is to eliminate

provisions that -- that have been found too onerous, not


to eliminate provisions that are not indeed terribly


onerous but go beyond what -- what the court had


jurisdiction to impose.  It's a totally different


question. 


MR. CRUZ:  My -- my --


QUESTION:  Right? 


MR. CRUZ:  My hope --


QUESTION:  So that's your answer to Justice


Breyer. 


MR. CRUZ:  My -- my hope would be --


QUESTION:  But that -- that leaves you with


Justice Ginsburg's problem.


(Laughter.) 


MR. CRUZ:  My hope would be to make virtues out


of either approach and to say that it could either be done


on -- under an effort to modify or a challenge of


enforcement, that either avenue is available.  And the


Fifth Circuit treated it as both.  I mean, that's


precisely what the Fifth Circuit did.  The -- the --


QUESTION:  Modification doesn't depend on


changed circumstances, does it, under that theory?  You're


saying we want to modify it because we shouldn't have


agreed to it in the first place.


MR. CRUZ:  Well, we don't know what the

circumstances were when -- when this matter was entered


because there was no adjudication on the merits.  But we


do know now --


QUESTION:  Well, but there are allegations of


fact that would have -- the allegations did allege a -- a


violation of Federal law, did they not?


MR. CRUZ:  If those -- they did, and if those


allegations were true, then there are changed


circumstances because the district court was very clear


that there is absolutely no evidence that even a single


class member has ever requested services and been denied.


And that really is the nub of the dispute because


petitioner --


QUESTION: 


Yes, but that's not an answer to all 

-- the statute requires more than waiting for requests to


be made. 


MR. CRUZ:  But -- but that really is the


critical dispute because the statute, the Medicaid


statute --

made marvelous and extensive changes in your practices,


and that's why you're in such wonderful shape now.  But


maybe you wouldn't have been if the lawsuit had never been

fairly characterized as a motion to modify because there


is not an ongoing violation of Federal law now. 


What the Federal law requires is that whenever


an eligible member requests screening, they receive it. 


Petitioners don't like that reading and what the


petitioners convinced the Federal district court to do in


this case is read the words where they are requested out


of the statute.  And all of this fight about what the


proper baseline is, is it Federal law or is it the


consent --


QUESTION:  Well, but I want to know if you could


go -- could you go through 60(b)?  That's interesting.


Now, imagine -- I'll give a silly example to


make it clear -- that there's a requirement in the consent 

decree you have to give every child a hair cut.  And


Federal law doesn't require that, but there's a provision


in State law that the barbers' union got in.  All right? 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  So every child has to have a hair


cut.  So you find the decree and you go say, judge, I want


this modified.  Look what it is over here.  They give


every child a hair cut.  That has nothing to do with


Federal law whatsoever.  We don't want to give every child


a hair cut.  Can you get the decree modified under 60(b)?


MR. CRUZ:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  Yes.  All right.  Well, then if you

solution.  You don't need your solution.  You can go in


under 60(b).


MR. CRUZ:  And that's what the Fifth Circuit


treated what we did.  So we --


QUESTION:  All right.  So then there's no


problem.  We're all in agreement.


MR. CRUZ:  We will prevail either way.


QUESTION:  So if we think you have a right to go


in under 60(b), is that the end of the case?


MR. CRUZ:  If -- if what we did is deemed that,


because --


QUESTION:  Mr. Cruz --


QUESTION:  You have to assume that it's too


onerous, that everything that goes -- goes a bit beyond


what Federal law demands is, quote, too onerous.  Is that


-- is that your theory of 60(b)?


MR. CRUZ:  It's not a bit beyond and -- and one


important caveat of 60(b) is most of this Court's 60(b)


cases are in a context where the State or a State official


is not a defendant. 


QUESTION:  Well, 60(b) is basically changed


circumstances or changed law, isn't it?


MR. CRUZ:  It is.  And --

 QUESTION:  But beyond that, Rufo said that when


you're dealing with a State or a municipality, that the


60(b) is more flexible than it would be if you were


dealing with a private party.


MR. CRUZ:  It -- it did.  Rufo was easing the


standards for modification, and Rufo did not address the


Eleventh Amendment.  That was not an issue that was


litigated, and the Court --


QUESTION:  Yes, but we're talking about 60(b). 


And I think the -- the -- you're saying, well, this is


essentially the same thing.  It isn't because what you've


confronted us with is you said, yes, the court had


jurisdiction to enter this decree, but it had no


jurisdiction to enforce it. 


That was your plain position, 

and that's not a 60(b) position.  60(b) is the court can


enforce it unless and until you show grounds for


modification. 


MR. CRUZ:  We don't necessarily concede that the


court should have entered this decree, but the point at


which we litigated it is the point at which the Federal


court began to exercise coercive authority of a Federal


court over the State.  And at that point --


QUESTION:  It didn't exercise authority till the


plaintiffs came in and said, look, they're violating the


decree.  They're not carrying out all their promises.

 MR. CRUZ:  But --


QUESTION:  You could have said, yes, we are.


MR. CRUZ:  But what --


QUESTION:  You didn't say that.


MR. CRUZ:  We did say that.  We argued


extensively that we were carrying out our promises.


And that actually highlights a point.  One thing


petitioners argue a great deal is the unfairness, and that


was a motivating factor in this Court's Lapides decision. 


But I would point out petitioners did not give anything up


when they signed this agreement.  It's not as if we could


sign an agreement with them and agree we're going to


comply with 80 percent of Federal law.


QUESTION: 


They gave up their lawsuit, and 

you're -- you're -- and you know, packed up and went home,


and you're telling them that they -- that they


accomplished nothing by doing that.  They got to re-


initiate the whole -- the whole legal process to get you


to do what they want you to do.


MR. CRUZ:  Justice Scalia, they accomplished a


number of things.  One, the State voluntarily engaged in a


number of changes as a result of that agreement.  Two --


QUESTION:  Well, you can't say it was


voluntarily.  They did it because the decree required them


to do it.  That's coercive.  I mean, you say it's

voluntary, but then why didn't you do it before the


lawsuit started?


MR. CRUZ:  The State officials endeavored to


improve the program --


QUESTION:  To comply with the decree.


MR. CRUZ:  But the decree was drafted as an


effort to end this -- this litigation. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but it imposed obligations on


the defendants which they had to perform in -- to avoid


being held in contempt of court.


MR. CRUZ:  Your Honor, that actually opens the


door to yet another reason why we do not believe this


Court should hold that Ex Parte Young defendants can


engage in commitments that extend far beyond Federal law 

because that open -- opens a Pandora's box to separation


of powers problems. 


QUESTION:  It's -- it's maybe far beyond.  I'm


-- I'm not sure that it is but it's permissible.  Rufo was


concerned with requirements that were not permissible


under Federal law.  And that's -- that's not this case. 


And you have the obligation, even under 60(b), to show


that compliance is burdensome and there's changed


circumstances, and you haven't shown that.


MR. CRUZ:  Justice Kennedy, no body of law,


Federal or State law, requires virtually everything that's

in the consent decree.  The consent decree requires data


collection, and there's no reference to that in Federal


law.  The consent decree requires the State officials --


QUESTION:  These are just necessary procedures


to implement the program and to make it work well. 


MR. CRUZ:  I mean, the consent decree --


QUESTION:  And they were agreed to you by your


client. 


MR. CRUZ:  The consent decree requires that the


State officials train private health care workers in


cultural sensitivity.  Now, that's not required by Federal


law.  That's not necessarily to ensure compliance with


Federal law.  It is something quite simply --


QUESTION: 


Well, suppose it were shown that the 

failure to do this caused serious flaws in the


implementation of the program. 


MR. CRUZ:  The Federal law requires --


QUESTION:  The court surely has the authority --


and the parties certainly have the right -- to stipulate


to provisions that will make the consent decree effective.


MR. CRUZ:  A State official does not have the


right to bargain away his or her constitutional authority


or the legislature's.  If one might imagine a


hypothetical.  The legislature --


QUESTION:  But that's -- that's the issue.

 QUESTION:  Well, excuse me.  Certainly the State


Attorney General has -- and by the way, I would like you


to say a few words about the other -- the other basis and


that is the waiver basis.  Certainly the State Attorney


General does have the power to bargain away the State's


sovereign immunity if -- if you consider that bargaining


it away. 


MR. CRUZ:  Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  Why -- assuming everything you said


is true, that this goes beyond what could have been


imposed under Ex Parte Young, nonetheless, you had the


State Attorney General who agreed to all of this.  It was


not just these individual officers.  The State Attorney


General who had power to waive sovereign immunity signed 

this consent decree.  Why shouldn't that be the end of the


case? 


MR. CRUZ:  Justice Scalia, the premise of the


question that the Attorney General had power to waive


sovereign immunity is not correct under Texas law.  Now,


it is admittedly a question of Federal law, but Federal


law looks to State law. 


In answer to your question about waiver, we have


seven reasons why we believe the Court should not find


that there was a waiver.


First, that this was waived below.

 Secondly, there's no clear and unambiguous


waiver, as this Court's decisions require.


Thirdly, there has been no waiver by the


legislature of immunity from liability in State court, a


critical predicate for Lapides, and in fact, the United


States in Lapides argued that all the Attorney General


could waive was forum immunity, not immunity from


liability -- immunity from suit at all.


QUESTION:  May I stop you at that point?  Could


a State then simply say -- every State say our Attorney


General has no authority to waive our sovereign immunity,


and then you would have the highest legal officer


appearing in Federal court on behalf of the State and


representations that that person makes count for nothing? 

Is that --


MR. CRUZ:  Justice Ginsburg, your -- your


hypothetical is in fact the law in the Texas, in that the


legislature has explicitly said the Attorney General may


not waive sovereign immunity in Government Code 402.004.


QUESTION:  Then what was the attorney -- then


the Attorney General was really deceiving the Federal


court when the Attorney General said, this is a consent


decree that we worked out, we urge the court to adopt it. 


Now, if the Attorney General had no authority to enter


that consent decree, he should have told that to the

Federal court, but there was no -- no such representation.


MR. CRUZ:  Justice Ginsburg, the Attorney


General didn't deceive the court because the Attorney


General never represented that this was a waiver of


sovereign immunity.  Those words are not found in the


consent decree.  The consent decree says the defendants'


defenses are all preserved.  This was an effort, unlike


all of the voluntary invocation of jurisdiction cases,


where the State makes an affirmative decision, we want to


be in Federal court.  In this case the State was hailed


involuntarily --


QUESTION:  But nothing required the State to


agree to this consent decree.  I know you distinguished


the case -- Lapides was -- you said that they -- the State 

made the move to get the case into the Federal court.  But


here, yes, the State is a defendant.  Nothing in the world


compelled it to enter the consent decree, to urge the


court to accept its consent.  So when a State Attorney


General says to the Federal judge, Federal judge, we think


this is a sound decree, we want you to enter it, that's


hardly being hauled before the court.  That's a voluntary


decision. 


MR. CRUZ:  The State acted in an attempt to


avoid a long, protracted litigation.  We were hailed


involuntarily before the Federal court.

 QUESTION:  In Gunter, the State was also hailed


involuntarily before the Federal court.


MR. CRUZ:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but Gunter


was an adjudication on the merits and found an ongoing


violation of Federal law and then enjoined that ongoing


violation.  Had that happened, we wouldn't have a dispute. 


We don't --


QUESTION:  Well, you prevented it from happening


by entering into the consent decree.


MR. CRUZ:  But that could have happened at the


stage of enforcement.  Before a Federal court orders a


State to do something, this Court has said that Ex Parte


Young is a fiction, that -- that the courts will pretend


the State official, who is not really a State official, is 

acting ultra vires for the limited purpose of vindicating


the Supremacy Clause.  That limited purpose is not served


when no court has ever found a violation of Federal law,


and when there is in fact not a violation of Federal law.


The reasons petitioners are litigating today is


because if they had to demonstrate a violation of Federal


law, they could not do so.  So what they would, instead,


like is for the baseline to be the consent decree.


QUESTION:  Are you suggesting they filed a


lawsuit they didn't think they could win?


MR. CRUZ:  They filed a lawsuit that was filed

before Judge William Wayne Justice --


QUESTION:  It was filed in good faith alleging


violations of Federal law, was it not?


MR. CRUZ:  It was -- it -- we presume it was


filed in good faith and it alleged violations of Federal


law.  We don't believe they could have demonstrated then


and we -- we absolutely don't believe they can demonstrate


now any violations of Federal law.  Both the district


court and --


QUESTION:  Then why enter a consent decree?  It


just doesn't make sense.  I assume that whatever counsel


was representing the State at that time thought there was


sufficient grounds to justify entering into a consent


decree, unless you want to take the position that the 

attorney was acting totally ultra vires.


MR. CRUZ:  It was an effort to end the


litigation.  It was an effort that ultimately failed.  I


mean, there -- there are two additional key reasons why


there's not waiver.


QUESTION:  No.  But you're saying then that the


consent decree is basically a continuance. 


MR. CRUZ:  It is a voluntary agreement and it


allows -- it agrees that the district court is available,


it's familiar with the law and facts and can -- the case


can be brought back to it if there's ongoing dispute.

 QUESTION:  Right.  We'll see -- a consent decree


means we'll see you later.


MR. CRUZ:  Or we'll agree to this and that will


resolve the matter.


I will point out if signing a consent decree is


a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity or sovereign


immunity, then plaintiffs' argument proves too much.  It


means every consent decree is utterly immune from Ex Parte


Young.  It means once a consent decree is there, the


requirements of Federal law don't matter.


QUESTION:  Only with the State Attorney General.


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  You haven't made another argument


that -- that I thought you -- you would make, and that is 

not applicable to the waiver argument, which requires that


the State Attorney General or someone authorized to act


for the State is there.  What -- what troubles me about --


about the non-waiver argument made by the petitioner is


that some of these consent decrees are imposed upon --


upon absolutely willing State officers who want to be


thrown into the briar patch.  A suit is brought against a


-- a secretary of health and human services in the State


who absolutely wants to do these wonderful things for


pediatric care that are not required by Federal law.  And


if the State Attorney General were not in the situation, I

am very reluctant to think that this official can go in


and say, yes, require me to do these wonderful things that


State law does not require, that Federal law does not


require, but that I would like to do, signs the consent


decree, and then we're stuck. 


MR. CRUZ:  That --


QUESTION:  But that's not this situation.  Your


Attorney General appeared and said, this is okay as far as


we're concerned.


MR. CRUZ:  But -- but that is a fundamental


problem with these cases.  It was a prior Attorney


General, a prior head of the health department, and those


prior officers under petitioners' theory had bargained


away the legislature's authority.  It's clear the


legislature couldn't pass a statute that said, we're going


to allow the Federal District Court for the Eastern


District of Texas to run our Medicaid program.  That would


be a fundamental violation of federalism and separation of


powers.  Nor could the Attorney General sign a contract to


do that.  Therefore, they should not be able to sign a


consent decree to do that unless it is necessitated by an


ongoing violation of Federal law.  It is only the


Supremacy Clause that justifies that.


In addition, this course's voluntary -- this


Court's voluntary invocation of Federal jurisdiction cases

have, by and large, not been Ex Parte Young cases.  In


Lapides, in Gardner, in Clark, they were suits against the


State.  They were not Ex Parte Young cases, and this Court


would be breaking new ground by saying an Ex Parte Young


defendant who, under the legal fiction, is not the State,


is simultaneously the State for purpose of being able to


waive sovereign immunity by litigating. 


And as was pointed out in the earlier colloquy,


the State was a defendant, raised the Eleventh Amendment,


was dismissed on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. 


And to say now that ambiguous and conflicting provisions


of the consent decree, signed by the State officials as Ex


Parte Young defendants, can waive the sovereign immunity


is to extend the Ex Parte Young fiction beyond --

QUESTION:  Well, surely they had attorneys,


State attorneys, representing them, did they not?


MR. CRUZ:  They -- they did, Mr. Chief Justice. 


But those attorneys, just like the State officials, are


temporary officeholders, and temporary officeholders are


in effect, as this Court recognized in Alden v. Maine and


also in Justice Thomas' and Justice O'Connor's opinions in


Missouri v. Jenkins, there are serious separation of


powers issues that are raised when one official bargains


away the authority of another.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Cruz.

 Ms. Zinn, you have 4 minutes remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN F. ZINN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MS. ZINN:  Some of the arguments made are not


tethered in -- tethered or tied to the record in this


case.  The district court, before enforcing the consent


decree, found violations of -- ongoing violations of


Federal law.  That finding is found at pages -- at the


bottom of page 272 and 273 in the appendix to the cert


petition.  And it -- it refers and relies on the Court's


earlier extensive findings of fact.


Second, there has been no contested motion to


modify filed in this case.  There was no contested motion


to modify pending before the district court or pending 

before the court of appeals, and this is an important


matter for this Court to consider.  Of course, a motion to


modify would allow State officials to present legitimate


concerns, if they have any, concerning the consent decree


to the district court so that the district -- with them


having the burden of proof, so that they could have their


best shot to show the district court what's wrong with the


consent decree under this Court's decision in Rufo.  That


-- that burden of proof gives the district court a full


record to base its decision on about whether or not to


modify the decree and it also creates an adequate record

for appellate review of those questions, which is not


present at the moment. 


Indeed --


QUESTION:  Would a change in administrations be


a change of circumstances that -- that justifies 60(b)


being invoked?


MS. ZINN:  No.


Indeed --


QUESTION:  Is there then a way to deal with the


problem that Justice Scalia raised, which is a serious


problem I think? 


MS. ZINN:  If a change in -- in administrations


results in --


QUESTION: 


Well, what they do is they go examine 

this decree and there all kinds of things in the decree


that may be very nice and really helpful to people, but


actually the legislature would never pass them, and they


have nothing to do with Federal law.  Now, what he's


looking for is a remedy for that situation.  I'm not


saying your decree has that problem. 


MS. ZINN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  But it's a known problem, and what's


your solution to it?


MS. ZINN:  As has been pointed out, Rufo does


create a more flexible standard for modification when


54 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 

consent decrees are involved in institutional reform


litigation of this type.  That flexibility, though, does


not sink down to the level of mere inconvenience.  So just


because it becomes inconvenient for a successor


administration to comply with the consent decree is not


justification for modification.  But if the -- the new


State officials can bring legitimate concerns to the


district court's attention, modification may be


appropriate. 


Unless there are further questions, there's no


further reply.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms. Zinn.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
