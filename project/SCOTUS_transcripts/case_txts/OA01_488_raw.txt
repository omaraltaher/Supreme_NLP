CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-488, Timothy Stuart Ring v. Arizona.


Mr. Hurwitz.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HURWITZ


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. HURWITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In Apprendi v. New Jersey, this Court held that


the Sixth Amendment guarantee of jury trial extends to the


finding of any fact that exposes the defendant to a


greater sentence than he could have received on the basis


of the jury verdict alone.  We submit that that principle


controls this case. 


In Arizona, a defendant convicted of first


degree murder may be sentenced on the basis of the jury


verdict alone only to a sentence of life imprisonment. 


The judge in Arizona has no power, no legal discretion


under the law to sentence a convicted first degree murder


defendant to death.


QUESTION:  Well, if you're correct, Mr. Hurwitz,


I take it we would have to overrule not merely Walton, but


Clemons against Mississippi, Cabana against Bullock, and


Spaziano against Florida.

 MR. HURWITZ:  Your Honor, let me take those


cases separately because I do not think that at least two


of them are implicated by the position that we urge today.


Certainly Walton would be have to be -- would be


overruled because it's directly on point. 


And certainly, to the extent that Spaziano says


that a judge may, in the first instance, make the finding


of fact to -- to -- of -- of an aggravating circumstance


in order to allow a death sentence, it would be also -- it


would be also implicated and overruled by the position we


urge today. 


With respect to Clemons, Clemons was a case in


which a jury made findings of fact on multiple counts that


allowed a defendant to be sentenced to death, and the


issue on appeal was rather whether, one of more of those


factors having fallen out, the remaining factors could be


weighed against mitigating factors for purposes of


determining in the sentencing phase, the discretionary


phase of the -- of the capital punishment issue, whether


or not there could be imposed a capital punishment at that


point.  So, I do not believe that Clemons is implicated by


our position today. 


Rather, our point is very --


QUESTION:  How about Cabana? 


MR. HURWITZ:  Cabana, Your Honor, I suggest is a

more difficult question.  Its reasoning would be


implicated by our position today, but I -- as we suggested


in our brief, I think there is a distinction.  In Cabana


-- or Cabana -- the issue was whether or not a particular


sentence, where all the facts necessary under State law


had been found by the jury, was unconstitutional as


applied to a particular defendant.  That sort of as-


applied analysis is the kind of thing that judges


typically do.  They look at the law and lay it next to the


facts of the case and determine whether or not that law,


as applied, is unconstitutional with respect to a


particular defendant or a particular sentence. 


The issue posed by -- by this case and by


Apprendi is, I think, a quite different one.  It is when


State law expressly requires a number of factors as a


prerequisite to the imposition of a particular penalty,


the maximum penalty allowed by law, whether or not the


State can systematically deny to defendants in those cases


the right to a jury trial. 


QUESTION:  What other States have schemes that


under your position would also fail the Apprendi test? 


MR. HURWITZ:  Your Honor, we -- I think we


attempted to summarize the -- the status on page 38 of our


brief.  We think there are eight or nine States whose


systems would be implicated by this.  But what is not

clear in all of those States -- and to take Florida as an


example, Your Honor -- is whether or not in a system


which, as this Court suggested in Jones, where the jury


makes, by implication or by necessity, a finding of a


particular aggravating factor in order to recommend a


death sentence, whether or not that system would -- would


be affected by the principle that we urge.  Certainly


those States where there is no jury involved in finding


the necessary aggravating circumstance would be the ones


that would be implicated, and I would suggest that that


category is probably somewhat less than the category in


footnote 35 of our brief. 


It is clear, however, that whatever the effect


on other States, Arizona's system precisely complies and


precisely matches up to the rule that this Court announced


in Apprendi.  It is simply not possible in Arizona for a


judge to impose this sentence of death without first


finding a fact that Arizona's State law specifies is


necessary for the imposition of that maximum punishment. 


And under that circumstance, we suggest there is no basis


for distinction of Apprendi. 


Now, the State has suggested in this case that


one basis for a distinction is that the Arizona statute


says, within one single statute, the range of punishment,


the possible punishment for first degree murder is either

life -- life without possibility of parole, or death.  But


I would suggest that distinction makes no difference. 


Certainly in the Jones case, the precursor to


Apprendi, a case that this Court considered a year before


Apprendi, a single statute set forth the range of


punishment.  In the Harris case, the case this Court


considered only several weeks ago, where the government


conceded that section 841, the drug statute, was covered


by Apprendi, several different punishments are set forth


in a single statute. 


It is difficult to believe that Apprendi would


have been -- come out differently, that there would have


been a different result in that case, if the statute


instead read there's a possible punishment of 20 years for


discharging a firearm with racial motivation, but the last


5 years may not be imposed.  You may not exceed 15 years


in the absence of racial motivation.


QUESTION:  If we were to accept your position,


Mr. Hurwitz, what would it do to the Federal Sentencing


Guidelines? 


MR. HURWITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, let me focus on


only one aspect of the sentencing guidelines because it


seems to me that there's no implication whatsoever for


downward departures and that the -- this Court has already


made clear, as the guidelines themselves say, that you

can't exceed the maximum sentence provided by the


underlying substantive statute. 


So, if I can focus on the question of what would


happen --


QUESTION:  Upward -- upward adjustments within


the maximum. 


MR. HURWITZ:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  With


respect to those, I think there is a distinction, and let


me suggest it to the Court.


In Arizona, the -- the judge simply has no legal


power, no discretion, no ability whatsoever to impose a


sentence greater than life in the absence of finding a


particular aggravating circumstance specified by the State


in its statutes. 


With respect to the sentencing guidelines, a


judge has discretion, and we know that because you review


sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion.  So, the


judge has the legal discretion to impose a sentence in


excess of the so-called presumptive range upon the finding


or upon noting in the record any number of particular


facts, not specified by statute. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but he didn't -- it's a strange


kind of discretion that can be reversed on appeal.  He


doesn't have discretion.  The whole purpose of the


guidelines is to eliminate the discretion, to say you must

give this sentence if these factors exist.


MR. HURWITZ:  Justice Scalia, my point is, I


think, that in our case the judge has no power at all.  He


can never find -- he can never exceed that particular


limit, the limit being life, in the absence of -- in the


absence of finding a fact specified by the State, a fact


chosen by the State as necessary to impose the sentence.


The sentencing guidelines strike me as somewhat


distinguishable because the range of factors that a judge


may choose to depart upwards is -- is by the guidelines


relatively unlimited. 


QUESTION:  Well, in -- in this case, the


aggravating fact was killing for pecuniary gain. 


MR. HURWITZ:  Correct, Justice --


QUESTION:  And that was clearly implicit, if not


explicit, in the jury's finding.


MR. HURWITZ:  I -- I would suggest neither in


this case, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  They didn't find a robbery? 


MR. HURWITZ:  The jury found a robbery, but


under Arizona law, as the cases make quite clear, in order


in a felony murder case for there to be a finding of


pecuniary gain, or in any murder case to be a finding of


pecuniary gain, there must be a showing that the murder


itself was motivated by a desire for pecuniary gain.  And

the Arizona Supreme Court has said on three or four


occasions it is not enough that a murder was committed in


connection with a robbery or, indeed, even in connection


with a felony murder.  The issue is motivation for the


particular homicide. 


In this case, the Arizona Supreme Court said


expressly we can't tell from the trial record why the


driver was killed.  There is virtually no evidence in this


trial record as to why the driver was killed.  It was on


the record made in the post-trial proceedings, the record


made on the basis of the accomplice testimony, that the


Arizona Supreme Court concluded that.


So, in this case when the Arizona Supreme Court


says two things -- one is the issue for pecuniary gain is


whether or not there has been proof of the motivation for


the murder, and second, in this case we can't tell why the


person was murdered -- I would suggest there is neither a


necessary, implicit, or even logical finding by the jury


in this case of -- of pecuniary gain.  The Arizona Supreme


Court I think addressed that issue quite straightforwardly


and directly.


Now, the State suggests that one distinction


between this case and Apprendi is the idea that these


aggravating circumstances are so-called sentencing


factors, not elements of the crime.  But I think that --

that argument was answered in Apprendi. 


What this Court said in Apprendi was that the


real test is not one of labels.  The real test is one of


function.  Is this a fact that is necessary under the


State law to allow the judge to sentence somebody to the


maximum sentence provided by law?  And plainly it is, and


whether you call these aggravating circumstances


sentencing enhancements or whether you call them elements,


you arrive, I would suggest, at the same result.  This


case on its face is covered by Apprendi. 


One way to -- one way to -- to get into that


issue is to -- is to imagine the following circumstance. 


Let's assume that Arizona law, instead of providing


precisely what it does now, said instead that the penalty


for first degree murder is life without -- is life with


possibility of parole.  But that penalty may be increased


to life without possibility of parole upon finding of one


of 10 specific aggravating circumstances, so that we had


exactly the same statute that we have now, but at the


first level you get life with possibility of parole after


25 years, and at this next level, you got life without


possibility of parole.  I don't think there could be any


doubt, under those circumstances that on its face the rule


this Court set forth in Apprendi would apply. 


QUESTION:  I think that's true, and I think that

in the -- in the normal circumstance when a State does


something like that, even if it is not calling it an


element of the crime, it is an element of the crime.


What we have here, however, this -- this statute


was enacted in -- in what?  '73?


MR. HURWITZ:  Initially in '73, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  Which was the year after Furman.  And


what Arizona was saying was, you know, we -- we never


thought we had to have any finding of aggravated --


aggravating factors in order to impose the death penalty,


but the Supreme Court, in a decision that -- that had no


-- no rooting in the common law, said that we cannot


impose capital punishment without aggravating


circumstances.  Okay.  We'll make a finding of aggravating


circumstances necessary and we'll have that finding made


by a judge. 


Now, I -- I don't regard that as Arizona


adopting the aggravating circumstance as an element of the


crime, nor does the statute read that way.  So, you're --


you're talking about something that is unprecedented in --


in the common law.  You're talking about a finding that


has been mandated by the Supreme Court and the issue is


whether the finding mandated by the Supreme Court has to


be made by the jury or -- or the judge.  And we've said in


several cases that it's enough if it's made by the judge.

Now, why isn't --


MR. HURWITZ:  Justice --


QUESTION:  -- why isn't that enough to resolve


the case? 


MR. HURWITZ:  Justice Scalia, if the -- if the


point here is that the State was forced to do this and,


therefore, this cannot be an element under the Apprendi


test, I would suggest that presents several analytical


problems. 


The first is that this Court has said on any


number of occasions to the States, here is something that


must be in your law.  The very same term that this Court


decided Furman or the year before, it decided Miller, and


in Miller it said if you want to have a constitutional


obscenity law, State, you must have a specific definition


in that State -- in the law of the kind of conduct that


you wish to -- to punish, the kind of -- the depiction of


the kind of conduct that you wish to punish.  We're not


telling you, States, by the way, what specific factor you


have to have.  You decide.  Here are some suggestions.


Arizona, the year after Miller was decided,


amended its statutes to add to its obscenity laws a


specific requirement with respect to proof of specific


types of sexual conduct.  This Court made them do that. 


The Constitution made them do that.  But I do not believe

it would be suggested that those specific elements of the


crime, those specific factors that are necessary to impose


the maximum punishment allowed by law, are somehow


exempted from the Sixth Amendment for that reason. 


QUESTION:  No, but in -- in the -- in the


obscenity field, we didn't invite the kind of procedure


that -- that was adopted here by -- by establishing a


separate -- a separate category, the -- you know, the --


the guilt phase and the penalty phase.  We -- we invited


the -- the severing of the trial into those -- into those


two portions.  And it seems to me it's up to us whether


the constitutional requirement that we've imposed upon the


States requires a finding by the judge or a finding by the


jury.  It's -- it's simply not was simple as to say, well,


it's an element of the crime and therefore has to be found


by the jury.  It's -- it's rather what does the -- what


does the Constitution, as interpreted by this Court,


demand.


MR. HURWITZ:  Justice Scalia, let me -- let me


come at that at -- at two levels. 


The first one is I think the basic


constitutional principle that underlies the Sixth


Amendment.  And that principle, as this Court articulated


in both Jones and Apprendi, is the notion that before


you're handed over to the State and before the State is


14

allowed to exact the maximum punishment permitted by law,


a jury of your peers is allowed to you to find those facts


to put the State in that position.  Certainly that


principle is directly implicated by the death penalty


situation on its face.  So, this underlying Sixth


Amendment principle strikes me as no different. 


With respect to bifurcation, there is, of


course, no constitutional requirement that the aggravating


circumstances be found in a penalty phase of the trial. 


This Court has made clear on any number of occasions that


the aggravating circumstances, these so-called narrowing


circumstances, the facts necessary under State law to


allow the imposition of a death penalty can be found in


the so-called guilt phase of the trial. 


QUESTION:  But if -- if Apprendi was based on a


long common law history, as -- as it certainly seems to


have been, wouldn't that distinguish it from the


aggravating/mitigating, which certainly is not based on


common law history at all?


MR. HURWITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, it strikes me


that the common law history here makes the central


principle.  The central principle in the common law


history is, after all, the one that Apprendi and Jones


articulate about the protection of the Sixth Amendment. 


The procedure faced in Apprendi was not known at the


15

common law.  The procedure of having a specific


aggravating factor that might enhance a sentence was


unknown to the common law.  Yet, this Court in Apprendi


said the basic Sixth Amendment principle that underlies -­


underlied the adoption of the Sixth Amendment in 1791


should apply to this circumstance.  I think that's --


QUESTION:  Mr. Hurwitz, may I ask why you have


-- you have certainly made a case about the aggravating


circumstances, but you haven't put, as part of that case,


the so-called Enmund/Tison findings.  And it seems to me


that if in Arizona someone can be put to death only if he


was the triggerman, or was a -- what is the other phrase,


a major participant, you haven't made anything of those


factors, and I think if -- if the aggravating factor has


to be found by the jury, then surely those would have to


be as well. 


MR. HURWITZ:  Justice Ginsburg, that may well be


the case.  As I think I suggested in response to the Chief


Justice's initial question, it -- it has struck us that


there is a difference between the sort of as-applied


analysis that an Enmund/Tison finding requires, a


proportionality analysis, and the issue of whether the


State systematically denies with respect to a particular


factor that it's picked out, and nothing in this Court's


jurisprudence required the State to adopt any particular

aggravating circumstance. 


With respect to those particular factors, it


strikes us that's at the core of Apprendi.  I don't resist


the suggestion that perhaps the principle in Apprendi


extends farther, and it extends to -- to the Enmund/Tison


findings.  What I do suggest is that -- is that the core


of Apprendi, the very central holding of the case


necessarily extends to facts which the State itself has


said in its statutes are necessary in order to find -- in


order to allow the maximum punishment to be imposed by


law.


QUESTION:  But -- but the other factor you


haven't discussed is the mitigating circumstances. 


MR. HURWITZ:  Correct, Justice Kennedy.


QUESTION:  The common law, in defining elements,


doesn't usually have some factors on the other side that


-- that are mitigating.  Perhaps -- perhaps you can


suggest some examples where they do.  But again, this goes


very much, it seems to me, to show that this is part of


our Eighth Amendment protections that have been mandated. 


In Apprendi, the judge could always, once he or she found


the racial animus, enhance the sentence; in fact, had to. 


Here there's still a balancing that has to take place and


-- and that -- that certainly is -- is not something


classically reserved for the function and province of the

jury. 


MR. HURWITZ:  And that's -- that's correct,


Justice Kennedy, and we don't suggest that mitigating


circumstances or circumstances that suggest leniency must


be found by the jury.  It has always been the case that


once the judge was empowered to enter the maximum sentence


allowed by law, that judge could consider whatever factors


or the State could consider, in -- in whatever form it did


so, those factors that might provide for a sentence of


less than the maximum sentence allowed by law.


QUESTION:  What about that kind of argument that


initially Justices Stewart and Powell and Stevens have


made, that there's a necessary connection between the


determination that death in a case is not cruel and


unusual and the jury is doing the weighing in order to


show that it reflects a community sentiment in that


community that the death penalty is not cruel and unusual?


MR. HURWITZ:  And, Justice Breyer, had this


Court accepted that as -- as a correct statement of the


Eighth Amendment, we obviously wouldn't be here today. 


We're operating -- we're operating with the constraints of


this Court's decisions which have said that kind of jury


weighing, that kind of jury sentencing is not required


by --


QUESTION:  Were it up to you, you would make

that argument if you felt it was open.


MR. HURWITZ:  If it were open, it's an argument


we might make, but it is --


QUESTION:  Well, presumably you would make any


argument that's open to you.


MR. HURWITZ:  We're open. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. HURWITZ:  To be sure, Mr. Chief Justice.


But -- but my point is it's not an argument we


need make in this case.  We are not suggesting that jury


sentencing is required.  We are suggesting that jury fact


finding is required. 


And if I might, let me suggest the difficulties


of adopting a rule that somehow has one -- one approach if


something was done pre 1972 and another one after.  If


Arizona had adopted this very same statute identically


worded in 1965, when the ALI first suggested it as a


possibility to the States, it seems to me clear, on the


basis of Apprendi, that the aggravating circumstances


would be elements, or at least sentencing enhancements, as


the Court said, and required to be found by the jury.


QUESTION:  But if it adopted the statute in


1965, it could have simply had the exact language that it


had and said the decision as to whether death or life is


simply up to the discretion of the judge, and it would

have been perfectly okay. 


MR. HURWITZ:  Because Apprendi and Jones had not


been decided at that time, Mr. Chief Justice. 


QUESTION:  And because Furman had not been


decided.


MR. HURWITZ:  To be sure.  But my point is that


if this Court -- this Court will enact an unworkable


system if what it does is start looking at State statutes


and trying to determine whether or not particular factors


in those statutes arose in response to Furman, before


Furman, after Furman.


One example is suggested in our brief.  The


State of New York in the mid-1960s determined to narrow


its capital punishment laws and apply them only when the


victim was a peace officer.  Arizona made that decision in


1988.  Was Arizona's decision in response to a mandate


from this Court, or was Arizona's decision because, as New


York, it made a policy decision? 


QUESTION:  Arizona has decided to apply its


capital punishment only to when the victim was a peace


officer? 


MR. HURWITZ:  No.  That's one of the -- one of


the narrowing circumstances in Arizona law.  And my -- my


point, Mr. Chief Justice, is let's assume two States, one


of which made that decision in 1965, and another one made

that decision in 1988, and it was the only aggravating


circumstance that that State had adopted.  Would this


Court then say, with respect to State number one, the


aggravating --


QUESTION:  But here it's a whole procedure


designed to have express mitigation and -- and aggravation


to be considered by the same trier of fact and balanced. 


And you -- you seem to give again very -- very little


force to the mitigation aspect. 


MR. HURWITZ:  Justice Kennedy, I don't mean to. 


I think it is entirely appropriate and entirely possible


for a State to design that weighing and that mitigation


issue to a -- to a jury.  But this Court has made clear,


not only in this context, but in other contexts, that --


that a defendant is not entitled to a jury trial to


establish mitigation from the maximum sentence that the


law might allow. 


Once again, I would return, I think, to the


underlying Sixth Amendment principle, as this Court stated


it in Jones and Apprendi.  The notion was in 1791 that


before a defendant was put, in effect, into the tender


mercies of the State to be -- to be subjected to whatever


sentence the law might allow, first that defendant got the


right to have a jury of his peers find the facts that were


necessary to do so.  He did not have the right at that

time to have a jury of his peers find whatever facts might


persuade the sentencer to give him less than the maximum


allowed by law. 


So, I would suggest that when you return to the


underlying Sixth Amendment principle here, it does provide


a distinction between facts that would call for leniency


and facts that -- that are necessary under the State's law


to impose a particular sentence.


QUESTION:  Except that Arizona has designed its


system, and you could design other systems, but it's


designed its system in order to sort out the most culpable


offenders and it uses this balancing mechanism.


MR. HURWITZ:  Well, I would separate, Justice


Kennedy, the two parts of the death penalty process.


There is a sorting at the front end.  There is a


narrowing that is required in order to determine which


defendants among all those convicted of homicide are, in


effect, the most culpable and can be sentenced to death. 


There is a second proceeding.  The second


proceeding is the sentencing proceeding.  And what this


Court has made clear is that with respect to that first


proceeding, there must be specified facts.  That's the


Furman analysis.  And that's the aggravating circumstance


that we contend is required under the Constitution to be


found by the jury.

 With respect to the second decision, this Court


has made plain on any number of occasions that that can be


made a discretionary decision for the judge. 


Proportionality measurements are no longer required at


that level.  What this Court has said, however, is you


just have to let the defendant have the opportunity at


that circumstance to argue for individualized treatment or


to argue about leniency, to bring the facts pertinent to


his case to the attention of the court.  So, I would


suggest it is at this first stage, this narrowing stage,


that the Apprendi principle applies.


QUESTION:  What you're saying is you're not


entitled to a finding of -- of mitigation.  You are


entitled to a finding of -- of aggravation. 


MR. HURWITZ:  Precisely so, Justice Scalia.  And


I -- and I think not only are you not entitled to it, but


-- but there is nothing in this Court's jurisprudence that


requires that the State specify a particular fact in


mitigation. 


Here we have facts chosen perhaps under the


compulsion of the Constitution, but nonetheless chosen by


the State as necessary prerequisites to the punishment.


Unless the Court has other questions, I will


reserve the balance of my time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Hurwitz.

 General Napolitano, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANET NAPOLITANO


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Opposing counsel began with Apprendi, but let me


take up on the suggestion by Justice Scalia that this case


really begins with Furman because after Furman, the States


were left with the mandate that death penalty decisions


could not be left unguided under the Eighth Amendment, but


requires a standard of judgment. 


Some States imposed mandatory death sentences, a


practice this Court later found unconstitutional.  In


contrast, Arizona amended its death penalty statute to


comply with Furman by adding a series of factors which the


judge would take into account in choosing between the


alternative punishments of life or death. 


In Walton, this Court fully considered and


upheld the constitutionality of Arizona's law.  The


question now is whether at this late date Apprendi


requires you to overrule Walton.  And the answer is no. 


Apprendi is a Sixth Amendment issue.  Furman, Walton, and


this case Ring concern the Eighth Amendment. 


In addition, principles of stare decisis are


heavily implicated here because, as Chief Justice


24

Rehnquist mentioned, there have been any number of


precedents in this Court that would be implicitly, if not


explicitly, overruled should this Court overrule Walton.


Let me, if I might, turn to two important


distinctions between Ring and -- and Apprendi.  One is


substantive and one I would call formal. 


The substantive distinction is this.  The


sentencing statute in Arizona derived from Furman.  It was


passed in 1973.  The pecuniary gain aggravating factor was


one of the original aggravating factors in that statute. 


There was never a -- a suggestion that Arizona was playing


a game, moving something that previously had been an


element into the sentencing factor side of the statute. 


There's never been any suggestion that this was anything


other than a way to decide which of all first degree


murders deserve the death penalty.


QUESTION:  Are we going to have to try to figure


that out case by case with -- with respect to every


State's statute, as Mr. Hurwitz suggested we -- we would


have to do?


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Your Honor, I think --


QUESTION:  I mean, what about the New York


statute that -- you know, that makes an aggravating


circumstance the death of a -- of a peace officer? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Your Honor, I think what you

have to do is just look at what was the underlying first


degree murder statute, what is the underlying statute


which gives rise to the possibility of a death penalty. 


In Arizona, the underlying first degree murder


statute has been the same since 1901, and in fact, around


the country, most first degree murder statutes can trace


their routes to England in terms of how they are defined,


the mens rea, the actus reus, and the causation


requirements. 


QUESTION:  But you're --


MS. NAPOLITANO:  It's not a difficult process to


go through. 


QUESTION:  But you're saying -- the implication


of what you're saying is that any, in effect, departure or


innovation in the modern law which doesn't have a clear


antecedent, at least as of the time of the -- of the


framing, is exempt -- is a fact exempt from the jury trial


requirement.  I mean, that's -- that -- we'd have to adopt


that rule in order to see it your way.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  No.  No, Your Honor, you would


not have to adopt such a blanket rule.  What I am


suggesting is this.  In a situation where you have a


statutory scheme that quite clearly, plainly, and


unequivocally derives from this Court's Eighth Amendment


jurisprudence, some of the Sixth Amendment questions that

were raised in Apprendi are not implicated.  And you can


make --


QUESTION:  So, if the State comes up with a new


condition, the jury trial guarantee applies.  If this


Court comes up with it, for whatever reason, it does not


apply. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Not necessarily, Your Honor. 


And it gets you into the discussion of what is the intent


of the legislature, what does it mean to be an element of


the crime in the first place.  But under --


QUESTION:  Why -- why does it matter whether


it's an element or not?  I mean, doesn't Apprendi say call


it an element, call it a factor, we don't care what you


call it?  If it's a fact necessary, et cetera, it's got to


be found by the jury. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Well, I think in -- in looking


at McMillan and Jones and Apprendi and that whole line,


there has been a question created by this Court as what is


an element because if it's an element, what this Court has


said is it has to be charged, it has to be proved beyond a


reasonable doubt, and it has to go to the jury.  If it's a


sentencing factor, if it's -- if that's what's going on,


those requirements do not apply. 


QUESTION:  Well, let me -- let me go back.  I --


in effect, I sort of put you off track here.  You -- you

were saying that there isn't a simple distinction on your


theory between facts added by a legislature and facts


required by this Court.  So, tell me -- tell me why there


isn't such a distinction as -- as you're arguing it now.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  What we're arguing, Your Honor,


is that when a fact is found purely for the purpose of


sentencing -- and -- and recognize the fact here murder


for pecuniary gain was never a part of the definition of


first degree murder.  First degree murder is the


intentional killing of another or a felony murder with


certain underlying felony predicates.  The jury found that


here.  It was charged here.  There was a death notice in


the actual indictment.


QUESTION:  Right. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  The jury was death qualified. 


So, there's no question of surprise here. 


QUESTION:  Well, are you -- are you saying then


that if a legislature adds a fact -- call it an element if


you want -- purely for purposes of determining the


sentence, that that too would be exempt from the -- the


guarantee of the jury trial? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  I think it could be exempt


depending on the circumstances, yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  But would it be -- I mean, is that


the theory that you're arguing?

 MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes that there are --


QUESTION:  I just want to know what you're --


you're arguing. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes, Your Honor.  I'm sorry. 


That there are some facts that the legislature is entitled


to find which don't go to the definition of the crime but


go to the punishment.  And this Court has never held that


there's a Sixth Amendment right to jury sentencing.


QUESTION:  What -- what do you do with the


broader principle which we express from time to time that


the -- the ultimate point of the jury right in -- in a


criminal case is to -- is to place the jury between the


defendant and the State?  If -- if that's a fair


statement, then you're saying, well, only part way between


the defendant and the State.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  In the death penalty context,


Your Honor, this Court has already limited the kind of


offenses for which the death penalty can even be a


possibility.  So, you don't have the kind of broad ranging


legislative discretion that you would in another


circumstance.  That's why I say you -- you -- in those


kinds of non-death cases, you may have to do a different


kind of analysis.


But in the unique context of the death penalty


world where you have to have either a first degree murder

or a felony murder -- and if it's a felony murder and you


have a non-shooter, you have to make the Enmund/Tison


finding, and that has to be made and can be made by the


judge -- there -- the legislature is not -- they're not


charging the death penalty for jaywalking.


And then the question is, all right, is the


legislature entitled under the Eighth Amendment or does


the legislature under the Eighth Amendment have to channel


discretion?  And they do.


And then the question is, does Apprendi somehow


require that that Eighth Amendment jurisprudence be


converted into a jury right on this -- on the aggravating


factors?  And as this Court has said time and time again,


no, starting with Proffitt v. Florida all the way through


Walton.  Poland v. Arizona is a great example where --


QUESTION:  But -- but your -- your principle, in


fact, is broader than that because, as I understand it,


your principle is that what we have traditionally referred


to as sentencing factors -- maybe change that to a neutral


term, facts that bear solely on sentencing -- they can be


excluded from the -- the jury finding guarantee.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  In the unique context of


the death penalty and then it remains for this Court to


decide whether you want to broaden it.  But the rule


proposed by the petitioner here would be equally broad

taken out of the death penalty context because you could


have no fact that enhanced a sentence that didn't first


have to be found by a jury. 


And in response to a question that was posed


earlier, that would throw into question the Federal


Sentencing Guidelines and their structure and -- any many


State sentencing structures where, once you are convicted


of a particular offense, the State law requires the judge


to give you a presumptive sentence unless he finds


additional facts, in which case he can depart upwards. 


It's not just the Federal Sentencing Guidelines that use


that structure.  Many States use that structure.  So, if


you are to hold that an aggravating factor even in a death


penalty case has to go to the jury, it is hard to imagine


why that wouldn't extend throughout the sentencing systems


of the States. 


QUESTION:  General Napolitano, how many death


sentence case are there presently in Arizona that would be


affected by a reversal here? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  We've had 89 death sentences


imposed since Walton, and approximately 30 are in some


type of direct review.  So, it's a substantial number, and


that's just in -- in Arizona. 


QUESTION:  Maybe Apprendi throws into play some


of those earlier cases, even if you don't agree with

Apprendi or feel it's quite limited.


What about the other cases I mentioned where


Powell and -- and Stewart -- Stevens all thought that a


jury should make this determination as part of the Eighth


Amendment jurisprudence because it's very important that


the death penalty be applied only where opinion in that


community believes that it is consistent with the cruel


and unusual punishment prohibition? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Two responses to that, Your


Honor.  One is this Court itself in a later case mentioned


that they thought judicial sentencing may, in fact, be a


better way to guarantee against the arbitrary imposition


of the death penalty. 


QUESTION:  The statistics seem to suggest that


it is absolutely no reason to think that.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  The statistics seem to suggest


that there is absolutely no reason to think that jury


sentencing is any different, that they're a wash.  But


there hasn't been a lot of literature on this subject. 


And --


QUESTION:  Well, yes, but there has -- there was


a long -- you know, Potter Stewart went into all of this.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Go ahead.  I don't want to interrupt


you.  I'm sorry.

QUESTION:  I want to hear your answer.  Now,


please go ahead. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Well, the jury is involved in


this case.  The jury is a protector in this case.  This


was an indicted case, indicted for first degree murder.


That went to the grand jury.  It was then presented to the


petit jury.  They made the determination about the felony


murder.  They weighed the evidence.  They knew or were on


notice that this was a death case.  The jury right was


embraced here, just as it was pre Furman.  The only


difference is the post-Furman addition of the sentencing


factors. 


QUESTION:  No.  The difference is that the


individual juror does not have to take the individual


responsibility of saying I as a human being have decided


that this person should be sentenced to death.  Now,


that's quite a difference. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Your Honor, even under


petitioner's argument, an addition -- and a -- and a juror


may not have to make that decision because even


petitioner's argument says, we just want them to find a


fact. 


QUESTION:  That's true.

argument is on your part. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Well, the answer is that the


jury here is embraced and is performing the function of


juries that has come down from colonial times or pre-


colonial times.  There's nothing different.  The jury has


to find intent to kill.  The jury has to find a death. 


The jury has to find causation.  The instructions are the


same to the jury.


QUESTION:  But it could make all those findings


and it would not authorize the death penalty.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Excuse me?


QUESTION:  It could make all those findings that


you just recited, and yet the law of Arizona would not


permit the imposition of the death penalty.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  The jury verdict at that case,


under that part of our statute, would say that the maximum


death penalty is death.  But you're right, Justice.  It


can't be enforced until the judge conducts the second


sentencing hearing.

 QUESTION:  Unless the judge makes an additional


finding of fact. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  He must find an aggravating


fact and then he can find -- weigh those against the


mitigators and make the determination as to whether death


is the appropriate punishment. 


But again, this is part of the process this


Court has dictated to the States to determine which of the


worst murders deserve the worst penalty.


QUESTION:  General Napolitano, the -- the


expanded argument that Justice Breyer is -- is suggesting,


which -- which isn't urged by Mr. Hurwitz, is really an


Eighth Amendment argument rather than a Sixth Amendment


argument, isn't it?  That is, the fact that the jury


should also be required to do the weighing and to make the


final determination that this person deserves the death


penalty.  That's not a Sixth Amendment argument; it's an


Eighth Amendment. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  I think it could be construed


as an Eighth Amendment argument, yes, Your Honor. 


And -- and as I said at the beginning of my


argument, this whole situation, this whole statute derives


from Furman and from the Eighth Amendment.  It does not


implicate the Sixth Amendment or the concerns that were


expressed in Apprendi.

 And let me, if I might, go to the stare decisis


part of my argument, because it's not just the cases you


listed, Your Honor, that I think would be implicitly


overruled, but let me give you a list:  Proffitt v.


Florida, Spaziano, Cabana v. Bullock, which does allow


the --


QUESTION:  But do you think it's perfectly clear


-- you cite a couple of Florida cases -- that if the


Florida advisory jury made the findings of fact that would


be -- make them -- the defendant eligible for the death


penalty, that that case would be covered by the decision


in this case? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes, and I think it's important


to understand how the Florida system works under Florida


law.  What happens is after conviction, the jury hears a


separate sentencing proceeding.


QUESTION:  Correct. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  And it comes out with really a


unitary form, and all that form says is life or death.  It


does not specify which aggravating facts the jury may have


found or which mitigating facts the jury may have found. 


And then the trial judge takes that form --


QUESTION:  But supposing it did just to -- just


to go with me on the -- on the hypo.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Okay.

 QUESTION:  Supposing, as a part of the


procedure, the judge did require the jury to accompany its


recommendation with a finding of fact as to the


aggravating circumstance.  Would that then be covered by


this case? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  I think it would, Your Honor,


because you're still allowing the judge to make the final


determination.  And if the judge is able to disagree on


the facts --


QUESTION:  But that's the Eighth Amendment


issue.  The judge is making the final determination but


not necessarily -- but it would be supported by a jury


finding that was sufficient to authorize the death


penalty.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  In this case, the jury finding


of first degree felony murder authorized the death


penalty.  The question was, could it be imposed and what


is the -- what is the way to do --


QUESTION:  It doesn't authorize it without an


additional finding by the judge.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  It authorizes the judge to go


forward and conduct a separate sentencing hearing.


QUESTION:  In some -- in some States, it's my


understanding that the jury simply makes a finding that


the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating

circumstances without specifying either.  Now, would that


be affected, at least by Justice Breyer's argument? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  I think it -- it could


conceivably.  I mean, I -- you know, what we're dealing


with here is a very difficult --


QUESTION:  But -- but isn't it clear that the


aggravating circumstances could not outweigh the


mitigating circumstances unless there were a finding of at


least one aggravating circumstance? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Which in turn --


MS. NAPOLITANO:  But you could have --


QUESTION:  -- would make him eligible for the


death penalty. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  I -- yes, Your Honor, but you


could have the situation such as a State like Florida


where the judge doesn't know what aggravating circumstance


was found, and you're still --


QUESTION:  Well, he doesn't know which is found,


but he knows that one is found.  It seems to me if you say


that's not enough, then you are making the Stewart Eighth


Amendment argument, aren't you? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  And -- and the -- the


problem there is if the Eighth -- if an aggravating


circumstance is found by a jury and the judge doesn't know

what it is, and the judge still has to go through all of


the evidence and do the weighing as to what weight that


aggravating circumstance should find versus the


mitigating, the basic -- one basic question is, well, what


is the function of the jury there anyway?  What is the


protection the Sixth Amendment is providing to a defendant


there? 


And I would suggest that a defendant such as


Ring and such as a defendant in Florida has already


received all the protections that the Sixth Amendment


entitles him or her to.  And all that is going on here is


a narrowing process where the judge's discretion is


actually being narrowed in sentencing, not broadened.  In


Apprendi, you could actually say the discretion was being


broadened, the same as in Jones, but it is being narrowed.


QUESTION:  Yes, but it's narrowed to the extent


that he now knows he must make an additional -- one single


additional finding of fact in order to put this man to


death, which is -- the jury has not made that finding of


fact.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Well, yes, Your Honor, at a --


at a statutory level in Arizona that is absolutely true.


QUESTION:  That's what your Supreme Court says


is the case here. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes.

 Now, in -- in the Ring case, there -- there is


the issue of the fact that he was convicted of armed


robbery and conspiracy to commit armed robbery.


QUESTION:  May I ask if you disagree with your


opponent's analysis of the pecuniary circumstance issue? 


He says that there's a difference between armed robbery on


the one hand which is for a pecuniary purpose and the


pecuniary motivation in a death case, and that has to be


the motivation for the killing itself, is that the robbery


-- robbery alone would not satisfy that.  Do you disagree


with that? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes, Your Honor.  And I would


cite the -- this Court to State v. Gretzler which is cited


in our brief. 


But on the record before this Court and on


the --


Court.


QUESTION:  You'd cite State v. Gretzler to the


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  It's in our brief, Your


Honor.  It's an Arizona Supreme Court case.


But I would also add that in this case, based on


the trial transcript and the sentencing hearing


transcript, which are part of the joint appendix before


the Court, it's very clear that the reason Mr. Magoch was


killed was because he unfortunately was the driver of an

armored car that Mr. Ring decided to rob.


QUESTION:  I -- I agree when you say sentencing


transcript, but what about just the guilt phase


transcript?  Would you make the same -- the same --


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes, I would, Your Honor 


QUESTION:  -- draw the same conclusion? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Yes, Your Honor, and -- and I


think that's why the jury convicted him of armed robbery


and conspiracy to commit armed robbery and rendered a


unanimous verdict on the felony murder portion even though


they didn't render a unanimous verdict on the


premeditated --


QUESTION:  General Napolitano, will you correct


me if I'm wrong about this, but I thought that the proof


at the trial itself didn't even place the defendant at the


scene of the crime.  Certainly he was involved in planning


it.  They -- but they didn't even place him at the scene


of the crime at the trial.  That didn't come up until


sentencing when the co-defendant testified.  So, how could


the jury have made the finding that he killed for


pecuniary gain when he wasn't even at the scene? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Your Honor, it goes to the fact


that he was at a minimum a major -- major conspirator in a


conspiracy that resulted in the death of an armored car


driver.  The purpose of the conspiracy was to rob the

armored car.  The jury, by finding the armored car


robbery, the -- the membership in the conspiracy, and then


the sentencing court and then later the Arizona Supreme


Court making the Enmund/Tison finding impliedly, if not


explicitly, proved the pecuniary gain issue. 


But if there's any question for this Court on


that point, and should you be inclined to overrule Walton,


which you should not, that's a matter that always could be


remanded back to the State Supreme Court for further


explanation. 


QUESTION:  Would you tell me how one would


explain to a citizen that you can't get 5 years added on


to your sentence unless the jury makes the critical


finding, but you can be put to death with the judge making


the critical finding? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Because, Your Honor, the -- the


difference is what is the source of the punishment.  Where


does it come from?  What is the source of the sentencing


at issue?  And in the prior situation, in a -- in a non-


death penalty case, what the Court has been doing and what


Apprendi does is expand the range of the jury trial.  But


what the Court has not done is expand the Eighth Amendment


protections that it -- that it incorporated onto the


original elements of first degree murder for death penalty


cases and say not only are these Eighth Amendment issues,

now we're going to even transfer it further and make them


Sixth Amendment issues.  And -- and the implications are


large. 


QUESTION:  It seems to me that you're making a


novel application of the principle we've repeated several


times, that death is different. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Death is different. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  I mean, there's no doubt about


it, Your Honor.  And -- and your jurisprudence has said


that.  But, you know, you don't have this kind of


elaborate sentencing procedure in a non-death case either. 


I mean, this is all driven by -- by Furman and all of


Furman's progeny to make sure that we are getting the


right defendants and imposing the right penalty on those


defendants.  And that's an Eighth Amendment issue and has


not been, by this Court, expanded to the Sixth Amendment.


And -- and again, if this Court were to overrule


Walton and reopen all of the cases in Arizona, at least


that are on direct review and in the other States, it's


hard to imagine how you then would not also have to


overrule Clemons, Hildwin, Poland, all the cases we've


cited to the Court before, because they all recognize and


state that these cases are different and that there is a


separate rule for the judge in these kinds of cases.

 QUESTION:  The -- the difference obviously is


that, of course, it's different.  It's worse, not better.


So, the obvious argument is that if you're going to insist


that a jury find a fact that could enhance a sentence from


10 years to 15, surely a jury, when you're under the


Eighth Amendment or the Sixth Amendment, should find the


fact that could enhance the sentence from life in prison


to death.  I mean, I think that's what it's --


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Well, I think that's --


QUESTION:  -- is the underlying point here.


MS. NAPOLITANO:  I think that's petitioner's


basic argument, and -- and our response is it's more


complicated than that.  That doesn't really answer the


question because in the death penalty world, the case law


is different, the tradition is different.  This is all a


creation of Supreme Court precedent, really not of the


common law as it came down through colonial times.  And


what is going on here are additional protections for a


defendant, not fewer protections for a defendant. 


And remember, in this case, you know, if you


just took the -- the literal language of Apprendi and --


and didn't go beneath it, and you took the literal


language of the Arizona first degree murder statute, the


maximum penalty under the statute is death, and the judge


is simply making a choice between life or death.  And the

jury's verdict authorizes the judge to go forward and


enter into that sentencing proceeding.  And that is a


procedure that this Court has embraced, upheld, and


specifically said does not violate the Sixth Amendment.


QUESTION:  Would you comment on your opponent's


suggestion that that would apply to other statutes like


the drug statute?  The maximum penalty under the same


statute is life in prison and so forth, but nevertheless,


Apprendi applies.  Or Apprendi itself -- supposing the two


-- instead of two statutes, there had been one.  Would


that have made a difference? 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  You know, in the statutory


analysis that Apprendi suggests, part of that analysis is


you have to look at each statute and how it was


constructed and so forth.  I don't know whether


automatically it would apply because, again, as I've made


the argument today, the Eighth Amendment death penalty


cases just are different. 


But, again, if you overrule Walton, it -- it is


hard to imagine how any judge would have the authority


under the Sixth Amendment to find any kind of fact that


would be used to enhance a sentence.  And if that's what


Apprendi is supposed to mean, that's a very, very broad


ruling. 


QUESTION:  To -- to enhance a sentence beyond

that which was otherwise authorized by law by the jury's


verdict. 


MS. NAPOLITANO:  Well, or enhance a sentence


beyond the presumptive sentence, because what's the


difference between a sentence authorized and a presumptive


sentence set forth in either guidelines or in legislation? 


We're cutting very fine hairs here. 


And I think the ultimate question is, what is


the role of a jury?  Was that jury's role embraced by


Arizona?  Yes.  Did the role of the jury in this case


change at any time from what it was pre-Furman to post-


Furman?  No.  Did the jury in this case know it was a


death case?  Yes.  Did the defendant know it was a death


case?  Yes.  Everyone knew it was a death case.  There's


no surprise.  There's no adding on at the end, oh, by the


way, we're going to ask for an additional 10- to 20-year


enhancement like they did in Apprendi or an additional 10-


year enhancement as in Jones.  None of that happened. 


This was a death case from the beginning and it should be


a death case now.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Hurwitz, would you address the


question that General Napolitano made about this is an


Eighth Amendment requirement, not a Sixth Amendment


requirement, and that's a huge difference? 


MR. HURWITZ:  I -- I will, Justice Ginsburg.  It


seems to me that the State's position is that when a fact


is required by State law at the policy whim of legislators


in order to impose the maximum punishment allowed by law,


that fact gets Sixth Amendment protection.  But when a


fact is required by the Constitution or by decisions of


this Court, that it somehow obtains less Sixth Amendment


protection.  I would suggest there is no basis in the


jurisprudence of this Court for that kind of conclusion. 


What the Attorney General seems to be saying to


you today are two things.  First, the State doesn't like


Apprendi.  Hence, the distinction between facts that we


added in order to impose sentences and facts that were


elements of the crime.  But I suggest that problem was


solved in Apprendi. 


The separate question is whether or not, as


Justice Stevens put it, death is so different as to


require a different rule than in Apprendi.  And I would


suggest that the purpose of the Sixth Amendment here, the


protection of the right to jury trial, applies with no


less force under a circumstance where the enhanced


47

sentence may be from life to death than under a


circumstance where the enhanced sentence may be from 10


years to 12 years.


It may well be true that this Court's Eighth


Amendment jurisprudence is unique, but in the context of


the Sixth Amendment, in the context of the facts necessary


and specified by State law, in order to allow the maximum


punishment allowed by law, there should not be an Eighth


Amendment exception. 


The State has chosen to make specific facts


necessary for the imposition of the ultimate sentence, and


when the State chooses to do so, whether it chooses to do


so because it merely thinks it's a good idea or it chooses


to do so because the Constitution of the United States


requires it to do so, the same Sixth Amendment principle


ought to obtain.  And that Sixth Amendment principle is


that you're entitled to have the jury find those facts. 


With respect to the question Justice Breyer


asked -- and I think as clarified, it's important to note,


the second issue is really an Eighth Amendment issue, and


that Eighth Amendment issue is not one that we -- that we


urge in this case.  But even if you don't urge that Eighth


Amendment issue, the underlying Sixth Amendment issue


strikes us as precisely the same.  And therefore, you may


have a system under which a judge can do this ultimate

weighing, this ultimate discretionary decision at the


second level of whether this is a particular penalty


that's appropriate for this defendant.  But the State's


narrowing, the State's choosing of factors and putting


them in its law and saying to the defendant, this is a


fact that must be found before you can receive this


maximum sentence, is a Sixth Amendment point.


One final point.  With respect to notice, this


is plainly not a notice case.  I don't believe Apprendi


would have come out a single bit differently if, before


his trial, Mr. Apprendi was told you're going to be tried


on the firearms charge and at the end of the charge, the


judge is going to determine whether there's racial


motivation and he's going to give you an additional


sentence.  Apprendi was not about notice.  This case is


not about notice. 


This case is, however about that central Sixth


Amendment point, and I would suggest to the Court that try


as you might, unless you simply say in the end we're going


to have a different rule for capital punishment, you can't


distinguish the issues in this case and the underlying


Sixth Amendment principle from the principles in Apprendi.


And for that reason, we suggest that this case is


controlled by Apprendi and that the sentence of death


imposed on this petitioner was inappropriate under the
