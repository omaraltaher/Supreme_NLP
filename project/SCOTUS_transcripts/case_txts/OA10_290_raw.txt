 JUSTICE SCALIA:  We'll hear argument now in 

Case No. 10-290, Microsoft Corporation v. i4i Limited 

 (11:03 a.m.)

Partnership.

 Mr. Hungar, you may proceed.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. HUNGAR:  Thank you, Justice Scalia, and 

may it please the Court:

 The Federal Circuit's clear and convincing 

evidence standard ensures the enforcement of invalid 

patents, even though this Court recognized in KSR that 

invalid patents stifle rather than promote the progress 

of liberal arts.  Under this Court's decisions Grogan 

and Huddleston, the default preponderance standard 

should govern in all cases because section 282 does not 

specify a heightened standard of proof.

 And as this Court suggested in KSR, it makes 

no sense to have a heightened standard of proof when the 

relevant prior art evidence was never even considered by 

PTO.  Under any view, it was error to require clear and 

convincing proof of invalidity in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It would be hard to 

argue, Mr. Hungar, that it makes no sense, but it made

sense to Cardozo and Judge Rich.

 MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, Justice Cardozo was 

not addressing a case in which the evidence at issue had 

not been considered by the Patent Office.  To the 

contrary, the Court made clear -足

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you can't keep 

shifting horses, now.  Are you going to argue for all 

the time, in which case, you can appeal to the general 

rule that we always apply, or are you going to say, oh, 

yes, we won't apply it normally but only when the prior 

art hadn't been considered?  I mean, you -- you can't 

ride both horses.  They're going in different 

directions.

 MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, our position and 

our view of the correct interpretation of the statute is 

that Grogan and Huddleston approach.  The statute does 

not specify a heightened standard; therefore, 

preponderance, the default standard; applies.

 I was attempting to answer Justice 

Ginsburg's question about the RCA case.  And the RCA 

case didn't address the question that was discussed in 

KSR, but we believe, as I said, that the -- that the 

preponderance standard should govern across the board.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, you're contradicting 

Cardozo?

MR. HUNGAR:  To the extent that -- that 

Justice Cardozo was discussing a heightened standard in 

the limited context of priority inventions, we think 

that that's not consistent with section 282, which, of 

course, came later.  Moreover, I would note that the 

concerns that undergirded the Court's heightened 

standard in priority of invention cases, where -- those 

concerns were addressed to the -- the problem of 

primarily oral testimony being offered to substantiate 

priority of invention claims.

 The Federal Circuit has separately addressed 

that issue by means of its corroboration requirement, 

which operates separate and independent of the clear and 

convincing evidence standard, so the concerns that 

undergirded RCA are -- are completely taken care of by 

that as well.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Justice Cardozo 

certainly didn't limit his holding in the way you 

suggest.  The language of that opinion is extremely 

broad.  And if you read that opinion, no one would 

gather from that opinion the kinds of limits that you're 

suggesting on it.

 MR. HUNGAR:  Actually, Your Honor, I agree 

that there is some grand language used in dictum in that 

case.  Certainly, the holding doesn't extend beyond

the -- what was presented before the Court.  But, 

actually, if you read the language carefully, you'll see 

again and again he refers to the fact that it's a 

question of -- of prior invention.  He says when the 

defense is a prior invention, and then he quotes the 

heightened standard on page 7.  Again, on page 8, he 

talks about the defense of invention by another.

 So he -- and every single one of the cases 

that he cites there, without exception in that 

discussion on pages 7 to 8, is a priority of invention 

case, The Barbed Wire Patent case being the leading 

example which had explained this rationale for a 

heightened concern in that specific context.  But you 

don't have cases applying -- Supreme Court cases 

applying the heightened standard in other contexts. 

And, indeed, you have many cases decided after RCA that 

don't mention any heightened standard in viewing 

invalidity questions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But just taking RCA 

itself, Cardozo said through all the verbal variances 

there runs this common core of thought and truth, that 

one otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a 

patent bears -- upon its face, bears a heavy burden of 

persuasion and fails unless his evidence has more than a 

dubious preponderance.

MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, Your Honor.  And read -足

taken out of context, that could have broad 

implications, but the sentences before and after clearly 

make -- indicate that he's talking about priority of 

invention.  He talks about the title of the true 

inventor and so forth.  So -- so, again, that's what 

those cases said, and that's what a fair reading of RCA 

says.

 But, regardless of the best reading of RCA, 

we -- the -- the question here is what did Congress do 

in 1952?  And we know that Congress in 1952 could not 

possibly have understood the law to be an 

across-the-board clear and convincing evidence standard.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then you -- then you have 

to be saying that Judge Rich got it wrong because he 

does deal with the -足

MR. HUNGAR:  Well, certainly -- yes, Your 

Honor, certainly we think American Hoist is wrong, 

although I would note that Judge Rich, in American Hoist 

decision, says that the cases prior to 1952 were all 

over the map.

 But -- but the relevant question is what 

would Congress have thought the state of the law was in 

1952.  If you think that there's any merit at all to the 

judicial codification argument, it's perfectly clear

that Congress could not have thought in 1952 that the 

law was an across-the-board heightened standard, because 

case after case after case rejected the proposition that 

there is a heightened standard or that the presumption 

was unaffected when the evidence was not considered by 

the Patent Office.

 The -- we've cited numerous cases in our 

brief at pages 34 through 36.  The -- and we also in the 

reply brief at footnote 3 reference a list of over 200 

cases, some from before 1952 and some from after 1952, 

all recognizing that the presumption of validity was 

weakened or eliminated when the prior art evidence was 

not considered by the Patent Office.  So, you just -足

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Hungar, it seems 

to me that RCA would matter, even under your view of the 

world, because if you think that Congress did not codify 

the existing state of the law as to the standard of 

proof and you think that Congress -- that -- that 

section 282 was essentially silent as to the standard of 

proof, then the question is, what do we do?  And one 

answer to that question is we go with our prior 

precedent, which is RCA.

 MR. HUNGAR:  Well, first of all, again, 

because RCA in context was a case where there was a 

priority of invention dispute that had been adjudicated

in the Patent Office on the same evidence previously 

resolved by the Court, a priority of defense dispute, 

where the heightened standard cases had some 

application, it clearly wouldn't affect the standards in 

this case.  But, more fundamentally, that's not what 

Congress thought in 1952, and when you don't have a 

clear rule to be codified, the default rules of 

statutory construction apply.  The default rule of 

statutory construction in a -- on this question, in 

Grogan and Huddleston, the preponderance standard 

applies.

 And, moreover, while the statute does not 

specify a heightened standard, it does actually speak to 

and -- and preclude the argument that i4i makes, because 

the first sentence refers to patents being presumed 

valid under this Court's precedent, a presumption shifts 

the burden of going forward, and the second sentence of 

the original statute refers to the burden of proof. 

Under their interpretation, presumption does all the 

work.  The first sentence not only shifts the burden of 

going forward, also shifts the burden of proof, and does 

so under a heightened standard, which has never been how 

presumption is interpreted generally in the law, and it 

renders the second sentence entirely superfluous. 

There's no need for it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's -- it -- it is true 

that the Federal Circuit has been consistent now since 

almost the beginning, since that court came on the 

scene, and it does have a monopoly on appeal in patent 

cases since 1984.  Because the -- the Federal Circuit 

has consistently taken this position, one would have 

expected that there would have been bills proposed to 

change it.  Were there any?

 MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor, not that I'm 

aware of.  But I would note that this is, I think, i4i's 

congressional acquiescence argument, if you will, and 

that argument fails for numerous reasons.

 First of all, if there could be any 

acquiescence, and we don't think that the -- this 

Court's extremely high requirements for such a claim 

have been satisfied here, but if there could be any 

acquiescence at all, the first 30 years after enactment 

of the statute would be the most relevant consideration 

in determining what Congress had acquiesced in, and it's 

perfectly clear that the regional circuits all rejected 

the across-the-board heightened standard that i4i is 

arguing for.

 So if Congress acquiesced in anything, it 

was not an across-the-board heightened standard.

having read some of those cases that you've cited that 

you claim weakened or eliminated the burden of proof 

standard, most of them didn't quite eliminate it. 

Virtually all of them added an instruction to the jury 

of some sort that said that the application of the 

standard should take into account the fact that the PTO 

did not consider evidence -- did not consider the prior 

art relied upon in the invalidity challenge.

 You didn't ask for such an instruction in 

this case; is that correct?  And if you didn't, why 

isn't that adequate to convey the point that you're 

trying to convey, that a jury should, in fact, consider 

that the PTO never got to see that prior art?

 MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, if I understand 

the -- the question correctly, first of all, I would 

disagree with the characterization of the cases, but 

with respect to the preservation issue, we objected to 

the clear and convincing evidence instruction, and we 

also said that if -- if any instruction on the 

heightened standard is going to be given, it needs to 

reflect that -- the fact that, at least with respect to 

prior art combinations that were not considered by the 

Patent Office, the standard should be a preponderance. 

And, indeed, that's true of all of the prior art 

combinations that were at issue in the case.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But other judges give a 

slightly different standard.  They give a clear and 

convincing standard, and they add a separate instruction 

that tells the jury, in applying that standard, you 

should consider the fact that the PTO did not see this 

evidence.  You didn't ask for that?

 MR. HUNGAR:  We didn't ask -足

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You just asked for the 

preponderance of the evidence charge?

 MR. HUNGAR:  But, Your Honor, we did object 

to the clear and convincing evidence instruction, and so 

if -- we don't think that's the right answer, the more 

easily satisfied instruction, if that's what Your Honor 

is referring to.  But if that were the court's 

conclusion, that that is in fact what the law requires, 

then our objection to the clear and -- the unmodified 

clear and convincing evidence instruction would justify 

a new trial here.  But more fundamentally, even the 

Federal Circuit -足

into account -足

MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, that construction 

would not solve the fundamental problem, which is that 

when the Patent Office didn't even consider the 

evidence, it makes absolutely no sense, as the KRSR 

court indicated, to have this heightened deference.  The 

statute requires a degree of deference by shifting the 

burden of proof and the burden of going forward, but for 

i4i to say that we need to go beyond what the 

presumption is, the normal default standard of 

preponderance, you need some heightened reason for that. 

There's absolutely none, particularly when the Patent 

Office didn't consider the evidence, didn't make a 

decision, there was no decision and no evidence 

considered going to the relevant question.  That's 

not -足

JUSTICE BREYER:  I have one question here I 

would like to get your view on.  I'll assume that the 

language is open enough in the history so that we could 

make what would be a change, I think it would be a 

change.  The reasons as I get from the brief for doing 

that are because there are two types of errors:  It's a 

bad thing not to give protection to an invention that 

deserves it; and it is just as bad a thing to give 

protection to an invention that doesn't deserve it.

Both can seriously harm the economy.

 And you are also saying that the Patent 

Office is out of control, not through its own fault, but 

there are too few people and too many inventions.  And 

therefore type two error is a real risk.

 So I'm turning you to and say:  Well, what 

should we do about it?  I know your proposal.  But we 

have also seen in these briefs the following proposal: 

One, somebody who thinks there is a type two error, go 

back to the Patent Office and ask for reconsideration. 

That's pretty good.  We get the experts to look at it 

again.

 And then that's coupled with:  Tell the 

district judges to stick very closely to their job, 

allow the clear and convincing standard to apply to 

facts, and by that we mean brute facts, and let them 

decide the brute facts, but let the judge decide whether 

that amounts to obviousness, novelty, or any of the 

other prerequisites.

 Now, I've gotten that out of the amicus 

briefs, some of which say they support you but they 

really don't.  So I would like -- I would like your 

views on those two suggestions as being sufficient to 

cure the problem that you point to.

 MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, Your Honor.  First of all,

with respect to re-exam, re-exam is not a solution to 

the problem or an answer to the absence of justification 

for a heightened standard, for several reasons.  First 

of all, re-exam is limited in scope.  It can only 

consider certain types of prior art evidence and issues. 

It couldn't, for example -- it was not available for the 

issue that we're talking about here, the on-sale bar. 

There are various issues, the section 112 issues, such 

as written description and best mode and the like, are 

not susceptible of re-examination.  Statutory subject 

matter is not susceptible of re-examination.  Many kinds 

of prior art, anything other than actual patents or 

publications, cannot be referenced in the examination.

 So it is a limited mode of inquiry that does 

not address many types of prior art that come up in many 

types of important cases, technology cases in 

particular.  So that's one reason why the re-exam 

solution is not a problem, and of course it can't 

possibly be used to infer some intent on the part of 

Congress.

 I4i and the government try to suggest that 

this was part of the scheme of Congress and this is why 

clear and convincing makes sense.  But re-exam was 

enacted in 1980, long after the '52 act, so it doesn't 

shed light on Congress's intent in enacting section 282.

And it was enacted before the Federal Circuit had 

created its heightened standard, so it can't possibly 

have been an attempt to address the problems created by 

an across-the-board heightened standard that did not 

exist at the time.  In 1980 the law was clear that a 

preponderance standard governed in most or all cases and 

a preponderance standard, of course, governs in re-exam 

as well.  So re-exam is not a solution.  The more easily 

satisfied instruction or that type of approach.  If 

that's what I understand -足

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm getting that out of the 

American Intellectual Property Law Association.  I don't 

blame them for my phrasing of it, but that is what 

struck the thought in my mind that careful instructions 

limiting the juries to brute facts and giving the judge 

the notion, the job of characterizing that -- you heard 

what I said -- that that will go a long way towards 

curing the problem you're worried about.

 MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, I don't think it 

addresses the problem because the fundamental problem is 

imposing this heightened standard on the jury that has 

no moorings in the statute and no moorings in common 

sense, particularly in a case like this one where the 

relevant evidence was not only not considered by the 

Patent Office but withheld from the Patent Office.

Under those circumstances -足

JUSTICE BREYER:  It might not in your 

situation.  But the problem is in principle as it's put 

to us that the office and the Federal Circuit emerge 

giving protection to things that aren't really novel, 

that aren't really advances on the prior art, et cetera. 

Now, if that's the problem, and you carefully instruct 

the jury, the bad fake patents will go away because the 

judge will say:  Look, this metal case called a battery 

leakproof is not really novel.

 MR. HUNGAR:  But, Your Honor, if that were 

-- the judge can't give an instruction like that.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  The judge says: 

I 

want you to find if this metal container is leak proof. 

Jury:  Yes.  Now it's up to the judge.

 MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, I think in many of 

these cases it would be extremely difficult or 

impossible for judge to fashion at that level of 

specificity the factual issues to be considered by the 

jury.  But more fundamentally, if you're getting into 

that level of detail and addressing questions that the 

Patent Office didn't even consider or certainly did not 

have an opportunity to consider with the full array of 

procedural advantages that litigation and discovery 

offer, it just makes no sense to impose a heightened

standard.  As one of Your Honor's earlier questions 

pointed out, the fundamental problem here is that the 

interests on the i4i side of the equation, the policy 

interests, are outweighed if anything by this Court's 

repeated recognition that invalid patents stifle 

innovation and competition and are very harmful.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Hungar, could we go 

back to the statute that was enacted in 1952.  Before 

that the burden of proof on the issue of validity of the 

patent or the effect of the patent, that was on the 

challenger.  So when Congress added a presumption of 

validity, it must have had in mind something more than 

the defendant would have the burden of proof and the 

normal standard is preponderance.  So by adding a 

presumption of validity, must Congress have intended to 

do something more than simply repeat that the defendant 

has the burden of proof?

 MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor.  The law 

actually before 1952 was quite unsettled on that 

question, as we noted in our brief and as Judge Rich, I 

believe, noted in the American Hoist case, there were 

actually cases prior to 1952 saying that the burden was 

on the patent HOLDER to establish a validity.  So what 

Congress -足

burden of persuasion?

 MR. HUNGAR:  I believe -- you know, the 

cases aren't crystal-clear on that.  I think certainly 

they were talking about the burden of persuasion and 

presumably also the burden of going forward.  But I 

don't think -- I don't recall that they speak to that 

level of specificity.

 But certainly there are cases saying the 

burden is on the patent holder.  Congress overturned 

those cases by imposing -- by stating in the second 

sentence that the burden of proof would be on the 

defendant.  But it only makes sense, as I indicated 

earlier, for Congress to have added that sentence if it 

didn't view the presumption sentence as shifting the 

burden of proof to the defendant, let alone shifting it 

under a heightened standard, so -足

JUSTICE ALITO:  If the challenger has the 

burden of persuasion, wouldn't it almost go without 

saying that the challenger would also have the burden of 

production on the issue of invalidity?  So what would be 

added then by -- what role is played then by that 

sentence, a patent shall be presumed valid?

 MR. HUNGAR:  I think that's unclear, Your 

Honor.  Certainly there are circumstances in which the 

party with the ultimate burden of proof does not bear -足

does not have the burden of persuasion at every stage. 

And Congress -- there were also cases prior to 1952 

suggesting that the presumption had gone away, that 

there was no longer a presumption of validity or that 

the presumption went the other way.

 And so again, Congress wanted to be clear; 

it was saying there is a presumption which shifts the 

burden of going forward under this Court's precedence, 

and there is a burden of proof on the defendant, and 

that's all it did.  To infer that it did something much 

more, much more than the pre-1952 cases authorized -足

there are literally dozens of pre-1952 cases cited in 

that list of 200 cases referenced at footnote 3 of our 

brief, from prior to 1952, rejecting the notion that 

there's an across-the-board heightened presumption of 

validity; saying, no, if the evidence was not considered 

by the Patent Office or in some -- the Western Auto 

case, for example, from the Sixth Circuit says well, 

there's this -- the exception for oral testimony of 

prior invention, that's the RCA case; but everything 

else is preponderance.  So there's no -- there's no 

heightened presumption of validity in any other 

circumstances.

 So I think the law was clear, and the 

treatises we cite at page 9 of our reply brief also make

clear the treatise writers understood, there was no 

across-the-board heightened presumption that it was 

weakened or eliminated when the evidence was not before 

the Patent Office.  And some of the cases said -足

actually RCA itself cites with approval two court of 

appeals cases that we note in our reply brief, the 

Studie case and the Wilson case, which rejected the 

notion of a heightened standard across the board.  They 

said well, that's true when the issue was adjudicated 

before the Patent Office, but here where the Patent 

Office did not adjudicate the issue that doesn't apply. 

So again you just can't get out of the pre-1952 case law 

-- the rule that i4i is urging.

 If the Court has no further questions, I 

would like to reserve my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Scalia, and may it 

please the Court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Waxman.

 MR. WAXMAN:  The long-settled, clear and 

convincing evidence standard is correct, one, as a 

matter of statutory interpretation, two, as a matter of 

stare decisis in a field in which stability is 

particularly important, and, three, as a matter of first

principles.

 As to one, in 1952 Congress codified a long, 

uniform line of decisions from this Court holding that 

the presumption of validity imposes a heightened burden 

of proof, a burden of proof that this Court in RCA 

unanimously described as, quote, "clear and cogent 

evidence."  And for the past 28 years Congress has 

actively acquiesced in the Federal Circuit's consistent 

holding expressly drawn from RCA that the standard is 

"clear and convincing."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How actively do we 

acquiesce?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I would like that 

notion of active acquiescence.

 MR. WAXMAN:  I thought that might get a rise 

out of you.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. WAXMAN:  I hope I'll get a chance to go 

to first principles, but having made that provocative 

statement, the point is -足

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's like passive activity, 

right?

 MR. WAXMAN:  I may want to submit a 

supplemental brief on that point.

MR. WAXMAN:  What I mean to say is that this 

is not a statute that Congress enacted and then forgot 

about.  This is a statute in which beginning in 1980, 

even before the Federal Circuit was created, Congress 

started amending the law to address the problem of 

low-quality patents, with the first re-examination 

procedure in 1980, any number of amendments, including 

to section 282, the creation of interparties 

re-examination in 1999, and the current consideration of 

a post-grant review process.

 So Congress has been very, very active in 

this field, and what I mean by active acquiescence is it 

has been very active in this field, it is well aware of 

the clear and convincing evidence standard, and it has 

done nothing whatsoever to change it, even make any 

effort to consider making such a sweeping change in 

long-standing doctrine.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Waxman -足

JUSTICE ALITO:  If I could take you back to 

first principles, which is where you started, I have 

three problems in seeing your interpretation in the 

language of section 282.

 First, the statute says the burden of 

establishing invalidity of a patent, et cetera, et 

cetera, shall rest on the parties asserting such

invalidity.  If Congress wanted to impose a clear and 

convincing burden, why in the world would they not have 

said that expressly in that sentence?

 Number two, if the first sentence, "a patent 

shall be presumed valid," means that -- is talking about 

the burden, then it's superfluous, because that's dealt 

with in the second sentence.

 And, third, the phrase "shall be presumed 

valid" doesn't seem to me at all to suggest clear and 

convincing evidence.  A presumption normally doesn't 

have anything to do with clear and convincing evidence. 

Most presumptions can be disproved by much less than 

clear and convincing evidence.  So how do you read that 

in -- your -- your position into the language of the 

statute?

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, as to presumptions 

generally, I found particularly persuasive your opinion 

for the Third Circuit in GI Holding.  But more -足

JUSTICE ALITO:  I've gotten a lot smarter 

since then.

 (Laughter.)

with all due deference to the sensibilities of the 

presiding Justice for this argument, when Congress 

enacted section 282 in 1952, the revisers note the House

Committee report, the Senate committee report said that 

they were, quote, "codifying the existing presumption of 

patent validity," and this Court had unanimously said -足

and this is language from RCA that Microsoft does not 

address -- on page 2 of its opinion says, quote, "even 

for the purpose of a controversy of -- with strangers 

there is a presumption of validity, a presumption not to 

be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.

 Now, to be sure, that was dicta in the sense 

that the case in itself involves a priority issue.  But 

it was the holding of the Court 3 years later in Smith 

v. Hall; it was repeated on the very same day in Mumm, 

and it was -- the Court spent an entire page, I think 

page 7, the better part of page 7 and 8 of its opinion, 

explaining that -- enunciating a general principle of 

the law, and it would be a cruel joke on Congress to 

have said, we are, when it said we are codifying the 

existing presumption, that that presumption was not 

exactly what the Supreme -- the Supreme Court 

unanimously had said, which is a presumption not to be 

overthrown by clear and convincing evidence.

 Now, that's -- it's not that the first 

sentence uses the word presumption.  It uses the word 

essentially presumption of patent validity, which is a 

feature, a uniform feature of the Supreme Court's

jurisprudence since the Court first started addressing 

this issue in 1873, and indeed when Justice Story first 

decided the Washburn v. Gould case, there is -- their 

argument is the standard is a preponderance.

 There is not one opinion, there is not one 

sentence, there is not one phrase in any of this Court's 

line of decisions that supports that proposition -- and 

when Judge Rich said in 19 -- shortly after 1952 that 

there was some disarray in the courts' opinions, he 

was -- and you can look at his opinion in context.  He 

was talking about lower court decisions that had either 

ignored or misinterpreted this Court's very clear 

holdings -- holdings which, by the way, refute not only 

their argument for a universal standard, preponderance 

standard, but directly refute their argument that there 

somehow is some other standard of proof that applies 

with respect to evidence that assertedly was not before 

the Patent Office.

 That was true of most of this Court's cases 

decided before RCA, and for that matter after RCA.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you agree, looking 

to Judge Rich's opinions, that it would have been in 

order for the judge to instruct, if the judge had been 

asked to do so, that the evidence would carry more 

weight if it hadn't been presented, defendant's evidence

would carry more weight if it hadn't been presented to 

the Patent Office?

 MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, and the Federal Circuit 

has said that over and over and over again.  I mean, I'm 

going to quibble with the word "would" because I think 

the actual language of the instruction can't invade the 

province of the jury.  But you could -- certainly could 

say that the defendant contends that the patent is 

invalid because the law presumes that a patent issued by 

the PTO is valid, the defendant bears the burden of 

proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence, and 

in deciding whether the defendant has met that burden, 

you may find it more easily met with evidence that you 

conclude the Patent Office did not consider in 

evaluating patentability.

 That is the long-standing established rule 

of the Federal Circuit.  It was stated, as was 

recognized in American Hoist, in 1984, and the 

explanation for it, Judge Rich's explanation is exactly 

the same in cite that this Court's statement's in KSR 

is, which is that there -- there are -- there are 

reasons independent of deference to a particular PTO 

decision that warrant a clear and convincing evidence 

standard, and -- and this is key -- there is no case 

from this Court, to my knowledge, in Anglo-American

jurisprudence, that creates or sanctions a regime in 

which there are different standards of proof with 

respect to a particular issue that a jury has to decide.

 The question -- when there is -足

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, there are case -足

there are cases in which the presumption disappears?

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, there -- are you 

referring to cases of this Court?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  Well, I mean, 

there -- there -- there are instances in which a 

presumption disappears and then the -- the parties begin 

again with burden of persuasion, et cetera.

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, okay.  I'm -- I'm talking 

here about -- the argument here is about the standard of 

proof, that is, a jury has to be instructed is it beyond 

a reasonable doubt, is it preponderance, is it clear and 

convincing?  I'm not aware of any instance in 

Anglo-American jurisprudence, and certainly Microsoft 

and its amici have not cited one in which the jury is 

told that depending on the weight you ascribe to the 

evidence you heard, you should apply a different 

standard of proof.

 The issue goes to the weight of the 

evidence.  I mean, imagine a case in -- a regime in 

which you said, well, you've heard eyewitness testimony.

If you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, find that the 

eyewitness really had an unimpeded view, the standard is 

preponderance, but if you think that the view was 

impeded or obscured, the standard is clear and 

convincing evidence.

 The -- the assertion that there was evidence 

that the jury -- that the PTO didn't hear, and as the 

briefs point out it is far from black and white what the 

PTO does or doesn't consider.  And in addition the -足

it's far from clear whether the unconsidered evidence 

is, quote, more pertinent than evidence that was 

considered.  Even assuming that, the jury is told, for 

reasons of first principles, that I will articulate in a 

moment if left to my own devices, that the burden of 

proof is clear and convincing evidence, but you may find 

that burden more easily met if you find that there was, 

in fact, evidence relating to validity that was not, in 

fact, considered by the PTO when it issued this property 

right.

 Now, the first -足

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't there a lower 

court that has ruled that that standard, in the manner 

that you've articulated, could confuse a jury as to what 

clear and convincing evidence means?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so, the amici here 

have suggested alternatives to that language that you're 

endorsing -足

MR. WAXMAN:  There -- there are -- there are 

any number of formulations that trial courts have given. 

I think the one that would be clearest would be one that 

says in deciding whether the defendant has met his 

burden, you may give added weight to evidence that you 

find the PTO didn't consider in deciding validity.

 The case I think you're referring to was 

Microsoft's earlier case involving z4, where unlike this 

case, Microsoft did ask for an instruction but it was 

rejected by the court -- it was -- it was rejected by 

the court and found not to be an abuse of discretion. 

The key point with respect to that instruction goes to 

the articulation that was suggested earlier, because in 

that case the instruction said you -- you make -- I 

instruct -- I don't have it in front of me, but it was 

essentially a mandatory instruction to give greater 

weight or that the burden would be more easily met.

that you've proposed to the jury, like your adversary's 

proposition, would require determining what it was that 

the Patent Office considered.  So you -- you haven't 

avoided the -- the -- the problem of litigating an -- an 

issue that -- that would better be avoided.

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well -足

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have to do it for your 

instruction just as -- as he will have to do it for his.

 MR. WAXMAN:  There is a -- there is a great 

difference, Justice Scalia, between telling individual 

jurors what amount of weight they may or may not give to 

certain evidence in creating a dual standard of proof 

which would, for reasons that -- that Microsoft's own 

amici point out, requires -- would require the jury 

first to determine whether this evidence was or wasn't 

considered and was or wasn't more pertinent -足

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but your -- but your 

instruction requires that, too.  You're inviting the 

parties to litigate that issue so that the jury can be 

instructed.  If you -- if you find that it wasn't 

considered, you can give it -足

MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Scalia, as -- as I

reflect the -- the research, I believe, on footnote 12

many cases.  That is -- and it was true in this case. 

Evidence is put on that the jury -- that the PTO didn't 

consider this particular prior art, although, you know, 

in this case the file wrapper shows that there were five 

prior art rejections based on other art before the 

patent was allowed, and counsel argue it to and fro to 

the jury, as the Allison and Lemley article points out, 

the statistics bear out the common sense, which is that 

juries are, in fact, very influenced by the fact that 

there was art going to or questioning validity that was 

not considered by the PTO.

 In other words, the instruction, whether the 

instruction is necessary or not, juries get it, and 

juries apply it.  What they're not required to do is 

apply two different standards of proof following all 

sorts of predicate determinations that they would have 

to make.

 May I simply list the first -- the first -足

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- but why -- why -足

why not, Mr. Waxman?  If the whole reason for this extra 

deference, for this clear and convincing standard is a 

Patent Office is expert and so we defer juries similarly 

to defer to their judgment, but if they haven't judged 

anything, what is the justification for continuing to 

have the clear and convincing standard?

MR. WAXMAN:  There -- here are four 

independent principles that justify the clear and 

convincing evidence standard across the board regardless 

of what the jury considered.

 Number one, an infringer's validity 

challenge is a collateral attack on a government 

decision that has already been made, quite unlike Grogan 

and Huddleston, that bestows property rights by written 

instrument.

 Number two, the harm from an erroneous 

determination is hugely asymmetrical.  A single holding 

of invalidity by a single lay jury vitiates for all time 

the patent and all of the reliance interest by the 

inventor and the investors and the licensees who have 

relied upon that ex ante.

 Third, this grant of property rights not 

only induces reliance, which lack, like the land patent 

cases induce reliance, this is a grant of a property 

right that under the Constitution is specifically 

designed to induce reliance in exchange for the 

inventor's honoring her half of the patent bargain, that 

is public disclosure of her intellectual property for 

the public benefit, and the commitment of capital by 

investors and licensees that's necessary to bring into 

fruition for the public benefit.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Isn't there a limited amount 

of reliance that any patent holder can have, given the 

re-exam system?

 MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, and the fact -- yes, the 

re-examine system -- I think your point actually, I wish 

I had thought to make this point myself.  Re-examine is 

often invoked by the patent holder.  That is, because 

re-exam is done by the expert agency and allows the 

patent -- allows the agency not to have a binary choice 

of yes, the patent's fine or no, it's invalid for all 

time, but can narrow the scope of the patent in re-exam, 

many re-exams are requested by the patent holder.

 And more -- and also, when you request 

re-examination or when the PTO makes a re-exam decision, 

that decision is good for all time, whichever way it 

goes, unlike the stark asymmetry in trial court 

litigation where the patent holder has to win 100 

percent of the time.  If the patent holder loses once, 

the patent under nonmutual offensive collateral 

estoppel, Blonder-Tongue, the patent is out.  And I 

should point out that this Court's opinion in 

Blonder-Tongue, which of course was a case about patent 

validity -足

what a disaster is it is to the person once they're 

invalidated.  Okay.  I think the other side will say: 

In today's world, where nobody really understands this 

technology very well, a worse disaster for the country

consumers, et cetera.  You can imagine my spelling out 

this argument.

property rights actually induced reliance, and

finally -- and this is my final first principle, I

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Stewart, we'll hear 

from you now.

 MR. STEWART:  Justice Scalia, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to begin by addressing briefly 

this Court's decision in RCA, because I think it's 

important to notice not only that Justice Cardozo used

fulsome and extensive language that was intended to 

sweep broadly and that was intended to announce a 

categorical rule; the other thing is the discussion in 

RCA was intended and was set forward as a recapitulation 

of prior doctrine.  That is, Justice Scalia -- Justice 

Cardozo did not purport to announce for the first time a 

rule as to the weight that should be given a prior 

patenting decision.  He explained that this is what the 

Court had done since the latter part of the 19th century 

and in fact it had been done by Justice Story riding 

circuit in the early part of the 19th century.

 And the court in RCA said a patent is 

presumed to be valid until the presumption has been 

overcome by convincing evidence of error.  The 

requirement of heightened proof was part and parcel of 

the presumption itself in the same way that I think most 

lawyers in this country would say that the requirement 

of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is part and parcel of 

the presumption of innocence in criminal cases.  If a 

new criminal statute were enacted saying that the 

defendant is presumed innocent, but the presumption can 

be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence, that 

might be a presumption of innocence, but it wouldn't be 

the presumption of innocence as it's historically been 

understood in our country.

The second thing I would say about 

Congress's presumed intent when it acted in 1952 was 

that, at least when this Court's precedents are clear, 

Congress when it uses words that come right from those 

cases should be presumed to have codified this Court's 

holdings, not the decisions of lower courts that may 

have deviated from this Court's instructions.  And I 

think the presumption that Congress acts against the 

background of existing law, it's less a prediction or an 

assessment of what percentage of the legislature were 

actually aware of the details of RCA.  It's more a 

method of making the system work, by telling 

conscientious legislators:  If you do read up, if you do 

understand the contours of Supreme Court's decisions, 

you can be confident that your words will be -足

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, the problem 

with your argument, assuming its validity, is why do you 

need the second sentence?  If Congress was intending to 

sweep up in the use of the word "presumption" the need 

to overturn it by clear and convincing evidence, why did 

you need the second sentence saying that the other side 

now bore the burden of persuasion?

 MR. STEWART:  I think there is a belt and 

suspenders quality to the statute, no matter how you 

parse it, but I think that Microsoft has essentially the

same problem, because they have constructed a theory 

under which the second sentence does something that the 

first has not, does not, but they haven't constructed 

any theory as to why the first sentence is not 

superfluous.  That is, given the second sentence to the 

effect that the burden of establishing invalidity is on 

the challenger, there's no more work to be done by the 

first sentence.

 The other thing I would say in response to 

Justice Alito's question, which also goes to the natural 

meaning of the statute, Justice Alito asked, I think, 

basically, if these precedents were not on the book and 

we were just looking fresh at the language, what would 

we assume the standard to be?  And I think we would say, 

let's look at what the defendant is asking the judge or 

jury to do.  The defendant is asking the judge or jury 

to set aside a decision that has been made by then the 

Patent Office, now the PTO, and we would ask what sort 

of standard of proof ordinarily applies when a litigant 

asks a court to set aside an administrative decision.

 In a sense, this court had a variant of that 

problem a few years ago in Dickinson v. Zurko, which 

dealt with direct court of appeals review of a denial by 

the PTO of a patent applicant's application, and the 

statute clearly authorized judicial review in the

Federal Circuit, but said nothing about what standard 

would apply.  And the Court said in the absence of a 

conflicting standard imposed by the statute, we will 

look to background principles and administrative law, 

and the standard will be substantial evidence.  And 

that's basically what this Court said back in 1894 in 

Morgan v. Daniels.  It said the reason that we apply a 

heightened standard when an individual attacks the 

validity of an issued patent is that that litigant is 

asking the Court to set aside a decision made by the 

appropriate executive branch agency.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But that ground doesn't 

carry very much weight when the matter was never 

considered by the PTO.

 MR. STEWART:  I think you are correct that 

if Congress had focused specifically on the category of 

cases in which the only evidence brought forward to show 

invalidity had not been considered by the PTO, it might 

have addressed that separately.  In our view there are 

three independent reasons that it makes sense to apply a 

heightened standard even in that category of cases.  The 

first two have to do with the interests of the patent 

applicant, the third has to do with the interests of the 

PTO.

 The first one is that the patent -- the

grant of a patent has historically been understood to 

reflect a quid pro quo between the applicant and the 

government, and the applicant's part of the bargain was 

disclose that which might otherwise be maintained as a 

trade secret, and the government's part of the bargain 

was give a period of exclusivity.

 And I think there is a thread in this 

Court's cases, especially in the barbed wire patent 

cases, to the effect that once the patent applicant has 

honored his part of the bargain a court should be 

hesitant to essentially deprive him of the benefit for 

which he contracted unless the evidence is clear.  The 

court in the barbed wire patent cases said that whatever 

doubts there may be as to whether the patentee was 

actually the first inventor should be resolved in the 

patentee's favor because without question he was the one 

who first disclosed the information to the public, made 

it available to the public through the patent 

application process itself.

 The second is related to the patentee's 

reliance interests, but is more instrumental.  That is, 

independent of our concerns for fairness to the patent 

applicant, Congress could reasonably determine that 

there are enough uncertainties along the way to getting 

a patent, to having it overturned on various other

grounds that in an invalidity suit the patent -- the 

patentee should have reasonable confidence that it won't 

be overturned unless the evidence is clear.

 And I would like to respond briefly to Your 

Honor's question, Justice Kagan, about why isn't that 

diminished by the re-examination process.  I think it is 

diminished somewhat.  Re-examination is different both 

because it's done by the expert agency and because it's 

more nuanced.  There is.  The option to narrow the 

claims to revise the language.  It's not a blunderbuss 

tool, like setting it aside.  But I would still 

acknowledge the force of your observation that to some 

extent, the patent holder's confidence would be greater 

if there were no re-examination process at all.  And I 

guess I would say this is just one aspect of the patent 

law's balancing of competing interests in a way that 

doesn't serve either to the exclusion of the other; and 

to use an obvious analogy, the current term of patent 

protection is 20 years from the -- the date of the 

application.  Obviously Congress thought 20 years was 

better than 10 and presumably that was because 20 years 

gives greater incentive to innovation.  If somebody 

asked -足

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is -- why is 

re-examination sufficient to answer the concerns that

Justice Breyer mentioned, when re-examination can't 

consider certain issues, and a case such as this doesn't 

necessarily have to be stayed while re-examination takes 

place?

 MR. STEWART:  It's not fully sufficient to 

resolve all challenges to the -- the validity of an 

issued patent.  Now Congress now has it before it 

legislative proposals, one of which has passed the 

Senate, one of which has been voted out of committee in 

-- in the House, and is currently pending before the 

court -- the full -- full House of Representatives, that 

would expand the availability of post, what we now call 

post-grant review proceedings, where for a limited 

window of time after a patent is issued, people who 

oppose the issuance of the patent can come in and object 

on any ground.  And that wouldn't be limited to the -足

the grounds that are specified in the current 

re-examination proceeding.

 So this would -- it reflects Congress's 

understanding that there is a problem with patents that 

should not have been issued, but its desire to create 

additional mechanisms for the PTO to address that 

problem, rather than to have it be done through 

litigation.  But that -- the point I was going to make 

about the 20 and the 10 years is somebody could ask,

well if 20 years is better than 10, why wouldn't 30 be 

better than 20?  And the only answer is 30 presumably 

would give the patentee even more -- or the potential 

patentee even more incentive to invent, but at a certain 

point Congress decides that countervailing 

considerations require an end.

 And it has essentially done something of the 

same thing with re-examination.  It said we're not going 

to go so far in the direction of protecting patent 

holders' reliance interests as to preclude the PTO from 

reassessing what it's done, but that doesn't mean that 

reliance interests aren't important.

 And the third thing I would say is even when 

a defendant in an infringement suit comes forward with 

prior art that was not itself considered by the PTO, 

there's always the possibility that that prior art will 

be substantively equivalent to prior art that the PTO 

did consider; and so in cases like this, in form the 

defendant would be asking the jury to make a 

determination that the PTO had never made, but in 

substance, what the defendant would be asking the jury 

to do is conclude that what the PTO thought was a 

patentable advance really was not so.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. HUNGAR:  Thank you, Justice Scalia.  A 

few points that I would like to make.

 First of all, with respect to the suggestion 

that the jury should be instructed on the weight to be 

given various forms of evidence, I note that in the z4 

case that's been discussed, the Federal Circuit rejected 

the very, quote, "more easily carried," closed quote, 

instruction that i4i suggests as the solution, and it 

did so because it would confuse the jury about what the 

standard is.

 Having effectively three standards of proof 

in patent cases rather than two is hardly a solution to 

the problem; but more fundamentally, whatever 

instructions might or might not be appropriate regarding 

the particular evidence before the jury, there has to be 

a justification for departing from this default 

preponderance standard, and no sufficient justification 

has been offered.

 The statute doesn't provide for it, the 

legislative history doesn't reference it, the pre-1952 

case law can't reasonably be read in that way.  That the 

-- i4i and its amici do not point to a single case in 

the -- in the years leading up to 1952, the 15 or so

years prior where a court of appeals or any court or any 

commentator said that the rule is clear and convincing 

evidence across the board.  No one understood that to be 

the rule.  No one read RCA that way.  Congress would not 

have done so, either, so you can't get there under 

codification.  You certainly can't get there under 

principles of administrative deference.  Even the 

government admits those that principles don't justify a 

heightened standard.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What about the rule where 

-- I'm trying this on, I don't buy it necessarily -- the 

-- the heightened standard exists where the Patent 

Office did consider it or could have considered it had 

the infringer asked for reconsideration?

 In other words, put the burden on the 

infringing party to use this procedure, and if he does 

use it, it's going to get a heightened burden if he 

loses -足

MR. HUNGAR:  Well, first -足

JUSTICE BREYER:  And if he doesn't use it, 

it should get a heightened burden because he should have 

used it.

 MR. HUNGAR:  First of all, Your Honor, I 

don't see that any way you can get that out of the 

statute.  But it also wouldn't work, because re-exams -足

JUSTICE BREYER:  The statute itself doesn't 

-- we're all going on history here, I mean, and history 

brought up to date with the words of the statute I don't 

think cover it either way.  They talk about presumption, 

but put that to the side.

 MR. HUNGAR:  Well, there -足

JUSTICE BREYER:  I wanted your opinion on 

that as the validity or a useful instruction for juries.

 MR. HUNGAR:  Well, Congress certainly 

couldn't have intended that in 1952 because it hadn't 

yet created re-examination.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not asking that 

question.  I'm asking the question of whether in your 

experience as a patent lawyer or -- would -- what we're 

trying to do is we're trying to get a better tool, if 

possible, to separate the sheep from the goats.  That's 

what we're after, I think, and so what is that better 

tool?

 MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, as you know, 

re-exam is not available for many of the types of 

invalidity issues that arise.  But in any event, if -足

if -- if the Court had such a rule, the problem is, 

re-exam takes a long time, patents plaintiffs generally 

oppose stays of litigation for re-examination, because 

they want to get to the jury because they know that

juries are much more likely to uphold patents than 

either judges or the Patent Office on re-exam.  So they 

want to get the case litigated as quickly as possible so 

you get through the court system before the re-exam has 

been completed.

 So to the -- in fact if it were true, as 

some of the amici argue, that a patent applicant -足

patent holders are afraid of juries and want the experts 

at PTO to resolve the questions, which we don't think as 

a -- as a factual matter is accurate, but if that were 

true, the patent applicant, the patent holder has the 

absolute right to initiate re-exam themselves, and they 

could certainly go to the court and say please stay 

proceedings pending re-examination.  Normally when -足

courts refuse to stay proceedings, because they don't 

want to prejudice the plaintiff, who is opposing a stay, 

but if the plaintiff is asking for a stay, there's not 

going to be any problem.

 So the system already permits patent holders 

to -- to -- to follow that procedure and get 

re-examination if they want it.  The problem is they 

usually don't.  And in fact a preponderance standard 

would encourage that.

 With respect to the reliance arguments, the 

re-examination problem we think addresses that.  The

fact that this is a procedural rule under this Court's 

precedence makes clear that reliance interests are 

lessened.  In any event, the reliance interests aren't 

nearly as strong as the same arguments made by many of 

the same parties in KSR, and MedImmune and eBay where 

this Court was not persuaded.  It should not be 

persuaded here, either.

 With respect to the legislative history that 

they rely on, if you're going to look at the legislative 

history, what it actually says is that Congress is 

referring to the presumption as stated by the courts, 

plural -- not the Supreme Court, courts plural -- so if 

you're going to look at legislative history it actually 

makes clear that Congress was not looking only at the 

RCA case which is not even referenced in the legislative 

history, but was looking at rule as it was understood to 

exist in 1952, which is not the rule that i4i urges.

 With respect to the -- the presumption 

point, the presumption clearly does serve a purpose, the 

presumption language in the statute, by overturning the 

courts -- the prior to 1952 decisions that had rejected 

the presumption, and by making clear that the burden of 

going forward is on the defendant, so the plaintiff 

doesn't have the burden that it would otherwise have of 

pleading and putting forward evidence at trial of
