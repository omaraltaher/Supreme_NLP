(10:09 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 12-62, Peugh v. United 

States. 

Mr. Kinnaird? 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

In sentencing Petitioner Marvin Peugh, the 

district court applied the 2009 guidelines sentencing 

range of 70 to 87 months, rather than the 1998 range of 

37 to 46 months applicable at the time of his offense. 

Retroactive application of harsher guidelines passed 

after the offense violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if 

it -- if it creates a significant risk of increased 

punishment. 

Now, the government here objects that a 

guidelines amendment does not change the law, but that 

is incorrect.  The guidelines are legislative rules that 

define a term of a mandatory statute, namely subsection 

(a)(4) of Section 18 USC --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  A mandatory 

schedule?

MR. KINNAIRD:  Excuse me? 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  A mandatory schedule, you 

say? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, it's a term of a -- of a 

mandatory statute, subsection --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, okay. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  -- (a)(4) of -- of 18 USC 

3553.  That provision requires the district court to 

consider the guidelines sentencing range, and I'll 

quote, "established for the applicable category of 

offense committed by the applicable category of 

offender." 

So, in 1998, the guide -- that statute, the 

law mandated that the district court shall consider, as 

applied to Peugh's offense and offender category, a 

sentencing range of 37 to 46 months. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's say you prevail, 

and the case is remanded for resentencing.  Is there 

anything that would prevent the district court from 

saying -- you know, before the promulgation of the new 

guidelines, I thought the range in the old guidelines 

was about right for this offense. 

But, now that I've seen the new guidelines, 

I think that those really fit best under the factors 

that I have to consider under the statute in determining

the correct sentence, so I'm going to reimpose exactly 

the same sentence, not because it's required by the 

guidelines, in fact, I'm going to go outside the 

guidelines.  I just think, with the enlightenment that 

the new guidelines have provided me, that that's the 

best sentence. 

Now, would that be -- would there be an ex 

post facto problem there? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, it would not, Your Honor. 

You would, under the statute, have to follow all the 

steps in the Rita/Gall framework, but the district court 

is always able to consider any new developments that it 

wants.  What we're talking about is the change of law. 

And that was the point I was just getting to. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not a change of the 

law if -- if the law does not require the guidelines to 

be imposed.  Your -- your case rests upon the 

proposition you stated at the outset, which is that the 

Ex Post Facto Law applies -- prohibition applies -- if 

there is a substantial possibility of -- of a higher 

sentence -- was that the language you used? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Substantial -- significant 

risk --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Significant risk. 

Suppose -- suppose the district judge for the Federal

district in which somebody's crime was committed was a 

bleeding heart judge.  He always gave the lowest 

sentence possible, and everybody knew that. 

And he is replaced.  He retires after the 

arrest, after the crime, and he is replaced by Maximum 

John, who everybody knows gives the highest sentence, 

every time.  Ex post -- ex post facto violation? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, because the Ex Post Facto 

Clause only applies to laws where here are delegated 

lawmaking.  And here's where the change in the law was, 

Your Honor:  As I mentioned, in 1998, the law required 

the district court to consider a sentencing range of 37 

to 46 months. 

With the guidelines amendment, the law 

changed.  The law now required the district court for 

that category of offender and offense to consider as 

the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that what your 

definition of legal consequence is? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, legal consequence 

refers to punishment.  That's something -- that's 

something different.  So the fact --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, so you're 

taking -- you're disagreeing with the proposition of our 

older cases that to -- for there to be an ex post facto

violation, you have to have a legal consequence. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, not at all, Your Honor. 

The legal consequence is the -- is the ultimate sentence 

imposed.  And in Morales and Lynce, the Court said --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, there's a --

there's a disconnect for me.  Yes, I do accept that the 

district courts have to consider the guidelines.  But 

how do you tie that to the requirement that the 

punishment has to be tied to the guidelines? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, the Court said, in 

Morales and in Lynce, that -- and then when it was 

reconciling two different formulations of the 

standard -- and, in Lynce, the Court said it's the same 

test whether you increase the penalty or whether you 

determine if there's a sufficient risk of increasing the 

penalty because that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The real formula is --

significantly increased the risk of perform -- of 

prolonging the defendant's incarceration.  That's the 

standard you would like us --

MR. KINNAIRD:  That's the standard of Garner 

and Morales, yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And is -- is the heart of 

your argument that there really isn't much difference at 

all in what district judges are doing, now that the

guidelines are discretionary, than what they did when 

they were mandatory; that is, most of them will start 

with and stop with the guidelines. 

I think that's --

MR. KINNAIRD:  Yes.  That -- that is 

certainly one element of it, but the -- the fact -- it's 

not exactly the same, but the fact is that, even under 

the advisory guidelines, the change in law creates a 

significant risk. 

And when you're evaluating significant risk, 

I think you have to start from the premise that the 

ex post facto violation prohibits an increase in 

punishment of any quantum, even of 1 day. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your -- your brief spent 

some time on statistics, how often this happens.  But I 

take it you're not saying that our inquiry is a 

statistical one.  You're simply saying that the 

statistics bear out that, as an objective legal matter, 

the framework that you are explaining to us is and must 

be followed? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- and 

that's -- the inquiry in Garner -- in Garner, the Court 

said, you can demonstrate significant risk either by 

showing that the risk is inherent in the rule or as 

applied to your sentence and marshalling the evidence of

the practical operation of the rule. 

So statistical evidence is -- is evidence of 

the fact of significant risk by the operation of that 

framework. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about the statutes 

allowing relatives and friends of the victim to testify? 

Let's assume a crime committed before -- a horrible 

crime committed before that statute is enacted.  Does it 

violate the ex post facto law to give effect to that 

statute? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, Your Honor.  I think 

there's a series of cases saying those kind of changes 

in trial procedure would not be within the Ex Post Facto 

Clause.  It --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  Don't -- don't you 

think it creates a significant risk --

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, you have to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that the defendant will 

get a higher sentence?  Don't you think that's the whole 

object of the law, in fact? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, but -- what you have to 

show -- I think you have -- this is a core sentencing 

law.  It changes the law of punishment, which is 

different from procedure.  And, in Miller, the Court 

said that, when there's a change in the -- in the actual

sentencing standard, the number of years, that's 

substantive, not procedural. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if you have a 

law that sentencing judges must consider these factors, 

and one of the factors is whether the defendant has 

strong family ties that will be -- you know, jeopardized 

or whatever, if he's incarcerated.  You don't want to 

take him away from his family because that will penalize 

other people.  And then Congress thinks that's not a 

good idea and they take that away. 

Is that an ex post facto violation?  It 

increases the factors of -- or the risk that the 

defendant will get a higher sentence.  Before, he could 

take advantage of the fact that he had -- you know, a 

particular family situation; later, he could not. 

That's a change in what the sentencing court must 

consider and is to his prejudice. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I think, if it is simply a 

change in the mix of factors, even the mandatory 

factors, it wouldn't necessarily create a significant 

risk.  But the guidelines --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, under -- under 

our modification of the guidelines approach, isn't that 

just a list of factors that the Court should consider --

or must consider?

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, Your Honor, I think the 

guidelines are distinctive because they are the actual 

benchmark, and they must -- and the starting point for 

any sentencing.  It is critical at what range you 

start your sentencing analysis, it's going to affect the 

analysis, whether you're starting at a range of 20 to 

30 months or 120 --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that -- is that what --

who says that they're the benchmark that you start with? 

Where -- where is that writ? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  That's in Gall, so that's 

in -- a construction -- what's implied in the sentencing 

format. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  A court -- a court must 

begin with that? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Yes.  Yeah, that's the -- and 

the court not only must begin with it, it must be 

cognizant of it throughout the process.  And any --

any --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what if the --

what if the law said the court must begin with a 

comparison of what the average sentence is across the 

country, okay?  And the data collection, over time, 

becomes more sophisticated, and they can give you a more 

accurate number for what the average sentence is.  And

it turns out it's higher than what their informal survey 

was before. 

Is that an ex post facto violation? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I don't think necessarily so, 

but this is a -- a requirement to actually consider a 

range.  So if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  It'd be the 

same -- it'd be the same thing.  One of the things that 

the Sentencing Commission considers is, of course, what 

the average sentences were around the country.  And 

let's say that the law says that's something you have to 

consider, and the technology or the range of -- of 

judges that they can survey becomes more sophisticated, 

the number goes up. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I think it may be, if you had 

the exact same Rita and Gall framework --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  -- and that -- that framework 

is that that range actually is the benchmark and the --

and the starting point.  The district court must justify 

any deviation from that range -- and this is language 

from Gall -- with "sufficiently compelling 

justifications to support the degree of the variance." 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And so the answer --

MR. KINNAIRD:  And it is then reviewed on

appeal --

Official 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And so the answer to 

my question is? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  It would be -- I think it 

would be likely if it were -- if it were within the same 

framework, if it's the mandatory benchmark with 

appellate review for substantive reasonableness and a 

presumption --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just -- I'm sorry. 

Go ahead. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  And a presumption of -- of 

reasonableness on appeal would attach to that standard. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So just getting more 

accurate information violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, 

in the framework that you've set forth? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I think if it's -- if you 

could -- if it's an actual -- well, I don't -- the 

distinction I was trying to draw is that, if you 

actually -- if the -- if the statute has effectively 

delegated the specification of a specific range, as 

opposed to just a data factor that might change over 

time, and that's the key change in law here. 

As I mentioned, 1998, had to consider 36 to 

47 months.  With the guidelines amendment, the law 

changed.  He now must consider, for that offense and

offender category, a range of 70 to 87 months, and --

and -- as the mandatory benchmark.  That's a change in 

the law.  And then you go to the test of significant 

risk. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the -- what if the 

statistics showed that nationwide only -- let's say, 

25 percent of defendants were being sentenced within the 

guideline range; would that change your argument? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I think it makes the -- well, 

we have an argument that's specific to our sentencing. 

But if the -- if in a particular case, a defendant were 

making an empirical analysis, that may diminish the 

chance of significant risk, but with a caveat because 

it's not just sentences within the guidelines range, 

it's the fact that the district court, even if it 

sentences out of the guidelines range, the ultimate 

amount that it sentences to is going to be partially 

determined by that mandatory benchmark.  And that --

that's an important point. 

And, as I said, the significant risk is a 

risk of any increase in the quantum of punishment.  So 

it's really is there a significant risk that, had he 

been -- had the old guidelines been in place as the 

benchmark, that he would have gotten a sentence of less 

than 60 -- 70 months.  And -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I think there's a fair 

chance that, as time goes by --

MR. KINNAIRD:  -- I think it's clear --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- we're going to see fewer 

and fewer sentences within the guidelines.  As judges 

who began their careers during the guidelines, the 

mandatory guidelines era, leave the bench, new judges 

come in who never had to deal with the mandatory 

guidelines, I think we're going to see fewer and fewer 

guidelines sentences. 

And -- and the percentages in some districts 

are -- are really quite striking.  I'm told that, in the 

Southern District -- or the Eastern District of New 

York, now, only 30 percent of the defendants receive 

within-guidelines sentences. 

So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're assuming that's 

changed over time. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, when I was on the 

court of appeals we thought it was our responsibility to 

ensure that the district courts were complying with the 

Sentencing Reform Act.  That might not have been true 

across the river, but --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Let's say this case comes 

back in 20 years and the statistics show that --

only a distinct minority of defendants are being 

sentenced within the guidelines; would the case come out 

differently? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Perhaps, but, again, this is 

an as-applied challenge, so we look to current data. 

There has been a very slight, gradual decline, but 

there's still 80 percent of the sentences are either 

within the guidelines or they're below the guidelines 

range, pursuant to a guidelines sanction departure 

motion from the government. 

So it's an -- even the Sentencing Commission 

attributes that relationship to the fact that it's the 

initial starting point in the 2012 Booker report.  So I 

think it has a profound effect. 

Now, if the Court wanted to rule more 

narrowly in this case on significant risk, it could. 

And it could adopt a rule that, when the new and the old 

guidelines ranges do not overlap at all, so that any 

sentence that would be in the new guidelines range would 

have required an upward variance, and, here, a 

50 percent upward variance, those are as rare as hen's

teeth in the -- in the district courts -- that at least 

shows, at a minimum, a significant risk, absent any 

indication that the judge, as the question was posed, 

wasn't going to apply them at all. 

Here, the judge specifically and expressly 

deferred to the 2009 guidelines.  So it's clear that the 

significant risk was increased by this change in the 

law. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your -- your case depends, 

it seems to me, upon the proposition that significant 

risk is only applicable at the sentencing stage.  And 

I'm not sure that that's true.  I mean, what -- why --

why would that be so? 

What if -- what if you have a new law that 

permits evidence to come in, in a criminal trial, that 

previously was not allowed to come in?  Let's say the 

testimony of a wife or -- or whatever.  I think the law 

is pretty well established that that change in procedure 

does not violate the ex post facto law. 

And -- and your response to that is, well, 

that's not sentencing; it's trial.  So what?  I mean, 

if -- certainly making a conviction more likely is -- is 

even worse than making a higher sentence more likely. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I think my response would be, 

Your Honor, that's not -- that particular change would

punishment.  That would be in the fourth category, in 

the change of the evidence, where you don't even look to 

significant risk. 

But I think the -- the change in punishment, 

at a minimum, it's the sentencing law of this kind --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And would it be ex post 

facto in -- in the hypothetical Justice Scalia gave? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, I don't think 

so because I think -- well, it may, depending on the 

circumstances, be within the fourth category, but not 

under the third.  I think in the third --

Justice Scalia --

MR. KINNAIRD:  The narrow rule --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- which is 

procedures-change risks.  Having a victim testify at 

sentences -- at a sentence is likely, if you examined it 

statistically, to increase -- increase the sentence. 

So assume that's the set of hypotheticals. 

You change it; now, victims can.  Why is that not -- or 

is it an ex post facto change?

MR. KINNAIRD:  I don't think so because the 

Court has generally excluded procedural changes, even if 

you could show --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why is this not 

procedural? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Because the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Give me the rule where I 

can draw a line between those changes that are 

permissible and those that are not, not the general 

statement you're making because both increase the risk 

of a higher sentence. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it can't be that. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No.  What Miller -- what 

Miller said -- in Miller v. Florida, the argument was 

made that a change in the sentencing range, the 

presumptive range, was a change in procedure, and the 

Court said, no, that's substantive.  This is the 

substantive benchmark.  That is applied.  It's a 

substance standard. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that was in the --

that Florida case was the mandatory -- almost mandatory 

guideline, and I think our starting point is -- your 

starting point, too -- is that, when the guidelines were 

mandatory, it was ex post facto because our decision in

Is this sufficiently different now that the 

guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  No, Your Honor.  I think it 

would still be a substantive standard, regardless of 

whether it's binding or -- or whether it's advisory. 

It's still a substantive standard.  So, if it's a change 

in the substantive sentencing law, you go to significant 

risk analysis. 

And there you either look to the inherent 

risk -- and I think there is an inherent risk in this 

framework, that there's going to be some increase of 

some quantum of punishment beyond what they would have 

done if they'd applied the older guidelines as the 

mandatory benchmark. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But saying that the 

sentencer has to consider testimony from the victim or 

from relatives of the deceased, that -- that change in 

sentencing law is okay? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Under the fact that it's 

considered a procedural law, not substantive. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It pertains to sentencing. 

It -- it says what the sentencing authority, the judge 

or the jury, must consider.

say, and, after 5 years, it's proven that, when victims 

speak, the sentences are higher.  Is that a substantive 

or a procedural law? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, I think Miller did draw 

a distinction.  There are procedures that are involved 

in sentencing, and I'm not sure if the Court's 

procedure-substance cases have drawn that distinction. 

If it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I'm asking you to 

draw it.  So tell me, what's the rule?  Do you want 

something as broad that says even that kind of change 

can be an ex post facto?  And, if you don't, articulate 

how I draw the line.

could draw the line simply on substantive standards that 

are applied.  But, if the Court were to go the other 

direction, significant risk --

MR. KINNAIRD:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is not Miller. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, but even the -- there 

are -- there are sentencing factors that are mandatory 

other than the guidelines range. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I would have thought you 

would have gone back to Calder and Bull.  And Calder and 

Bull, which this Court refers to all the time, in these 

kinds of cases, has four categories, and the only one 

that fits this case is a law that changes the 

punishment --

MR. KINNAIRD:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and inflicts a greater 

punishment than the law annexed to the crime when 

committed.  So whatever these other hypotheticals are, 

they do not involve -- they are not laws that change the 

punishment, but yours is a law that changes the 

punishment. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  It is a law that changes --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does it "affix a higher 

punishment," in the words of Calder v. Bull?

question at all.  The answer to that is quite easy.  It 

does not affix a higher punishment, does it? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  But -- but the Court in 

Garner, in Lynce, have equated that with increased risk 

of significant punishment.  And that -- the importance 

of Garner is that it recognizes that the Ex Post Facto 

Clause --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Then rely on Garner, 

but not on Calder v. Bull. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Yes.  I think -- I think --

but Garner is applying that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I wouldn't concede that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't help --

(Laughter.) 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Okay.  So what Garner -- what 

Garner does say is that you look to the significant 

risk.  And it's important for ex post facto -- ex post 

facto jurisprudence because the exercise of discretion 

can't displace ex post facto protections.  You have to 

look to the effect on the actual punishment. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you remind me --

it's in the briefs -- if a sentence is appealed, what is 

the review authority of the appellate court?  It must 

begin with the guidelines as the framework?

review for both procedural and substantive 

reasonableness.  So procedural, I think, has been 

interpreted to look at whether there was a correct 

calculation, whether they -- they did not treat it as 

mandatory, that they considered it as the benchmark and 

the --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But isn't the important 

point, Mr. Kinnaird, that there's a presumption of 

correctness that attaches to guidelines sentences on 

appeal --

MR. KINNAIRD:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that does not attach to 

non-guidelines sentences? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Yes.  I was getting to that, 

Your Honor. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, this has, one would 

think, great legal consequence. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  It is.  And the second step 

is substantive reasonableness review, and the Court has 

held that an appellate presumption of reasonableness may 

attach, so that -- it attaches only to this guideline 

range.  And that makes the risk of reversal higher if 

you -- if you go outside the guidelines --

MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, I think that they are 

fairly low -- I don't know the precise statistics -- I 

believe they're low for defendant appeals.  But when --

partly, you're worried about here is -- is the 

government going to appeal.  They don't appeal very 

often, but they have a high rate of --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  I mean, I'm told that 

it's in the single digits.

but they prevail when they do.  And it -- and it does 

have some effect, but I think the Court --

MR. KINNAIRD:  The government tends to 

prevail when it brings, it's -- but -- you know, that's 

a potential deterrent effect.  But, even the fact of 

substantive reasonableness review, you have to have 

reasons, you have to be able to -- to justify your 

deviations --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Have you had -- are you 

aware of any circuit court case, in recent time, where a

basically because the deviation from the guideline was 

unreasonable? 

MR. KINNAIRD:  I'm not sure.  I haven't 

reviewed all those cases, Your Honor.  I'm not sure. 

So the -- returning to the -- the question 

of this particular sentencing, I think if the Court were 

to rule on a narrower ground, based on non-overlapping 

ranges, which is not going to be particularly common, 

here, is unquestionably a significant risk.  You 

have a defendant who, prior to this course of conduct, 

had lived an exemplary life. 

His threshold -- his -- the loss in his case 

barely crawled into the 2.5 to 5 million.  It 

was about 40,000 over 2.5 million.  And the district 

court sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines range, 

agreeing with the policy of increasing sentences with 

the amount of loss.  That same policy was present, but 

not the same level of increase, in the 1998 guidelines. 

So I think there's clearly, as applied to 

his sentence, the significant risk he would not have 

gotten 70 months, which would have been an upward 

variance of 50 -- of -- of 50 percent from the old 

guidelines range. 

And -- but I think, if the Court does wish 

to consider the broader ruling, I think it's also true

that it is inherent in this system, in the Rita and Gall 

framework, which provide for a mandatory benchmark, 

which provide for the substantive reasonableness review, 

that you're going to have some significant risk of some 

increased quantum of punishment as a -- as a result of 

this change in law.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. FEIGIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

This Court made clear, in Miller v. Florida, 

that an Ex Post Facto Law has to change "the legal 

consequences of a prior act."  A guidelines amendment 

doesn't do that.  A district court has the same 

authority and the same --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why are you fighting 

this proposition?  If the starting point doesn't matter, 

why didn't you stick to your old position, that judges 

should start from the old one and simply consider the 

new one?  Why this whole Supreme Court case?

we opposed certiorari largely on that ground.  We don't 

think the guidelines impose a constraint on a district 

court's exercise of sentencing discretion; that is, if a 

judge decides that a guidelines range that the 

Commission has suggested at some other time suggests a 

more appropriate sentence or if the judge believes that 

some sentence that's unrelated to any guidelines range 

is the most appropriate sentence, the judge has 

discretion to impose that sentence. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Practically speaking, do 

you believe it makes no difference? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I freely believe 

that the guidelines are very influential to many 

district judges and district judges often agree with the 

guidelines.  They often impose sentences within the 

guidelines range or close to the guidelines range.  But 

there --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is a change -- your 

position is -- is a change, at least in the position 

that the government took in -- in the Seventh Circuit 

case that started all this.  The government confessed 

error.

should have used the guidelines that were in effect at 

the time the offense was committed, and the government

came to the Seventh Circuit and confessed error. 

So there was not even an argument until the 

Seventh Circuit and Judge Posner wrote the opinion that 

included all the hypotheticals that -- that were aired 

earlier about the victim impact statement and all of 

those are in that opinion.  So it was only after --

after the Seventh Circuit opinion that the government 

changed its position. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, the government 

changed its position in response to this Court's 

decisions in Gall, Kimbrough, and Irizarry because, 

before those decisions came out, there was an argument 

that the guidelines still imposed some substantive legal 

constraint on a district court's sentencing discretion. 

After Gall, Kimbrough, and Irizarry, after Nelson and 

Spears, that argument no longer exists. 

Rita makes clear that district courts cannot 

presume a guidelines range to be reasonable.  Irizarry 

makes clear that a defendant is constitutionally on 

notice that he can get sentenced anywhere within the 

statutory range. 

And Gall makes clear that courts of appeals 

should apply the same deferential standard of review to 

every sentence, regardless whether it falls within the 

guidelines range, just outside the guidelines range, or

far outside the guidelines range. 

Official 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The guidelines range gets 

a presumption of reasonableness at the appellate level. 

MR. FEIGIN:  That's right, Your Honor, and I 

think Rita actually supports our position, not 

Petitioner's.  The Court made clear in Rita that the 

presumption of reasonableness on appeal that this --

that courts of appeals can choose to apply, but need 

not, has no legal effect. 

Rather, it reflects the commonsense 

proposition that when the Commission recommends a 

particular sentencing range as to a particular class of 

defendants and the district court, in its discretion, 

actually imposes the sentence within that range, that 

the sentence is likely to be reasonable. 

The entire premise behind the presumption of 

reasonableness that was adopted in Rita is that district 

courts are, in fact, exercising their discretion when 

they impose sentences, and that's the same premise on 

which we'd ask you to decide this case. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What is the reason that 

miscalculating a guideline is considered a procedural 

error? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, it's very 

clear, from 3553(a)(4), that Congress wants district

courts to start with the right mix of information, which 

includes the most up-to-date recommendation of the 

Sentencing Commission. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That begs the question. 

Obviously, if we hold it's a procedural error to 

miscalculate the guidelines, using the guidelines has 

some significant importance in the process. 

MR. FEIGIN:  It has importance, Your Honor, 

and as I've said before, they can be very influential to 

judges, but the reason why it's an error if -- to 

miscalculate the guidelines is not because the 

guidelines impose any substantive constraint on the 

district court's discretion. 

After reversal for miscalculating the 

guidelines, the judge is free to impose the same 

sentence anyway, and there's no constraint on the 

judge's discretion that arises from the guidelines 

frame. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what that suggests is 

that the guidelines are -- serve as an anchor and are 

supposed to serve as an anchor and that the reason why 

the miscalculation is error is because you've picked the 

wrong anchor and that's going to affect or -- or has a 

significant likelihood of affecting your ultimate 

decision.

And isn't that, really, what we've 

suggested?  Is the way the guidelines ought to work and 

the way you think the guidelines ought to work, that it 

serves as an anchor for sentencing decisions; yes, you 

can vary, you can deviate, but it's your anchor. 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Your Honor, there are two 

things you could mean when you use the word "anchor." 

One, you could mean that there's some sort of legal 

anchor, and we think that the Court's decisions that 

I've just described, in particular, the Court's repeated 

insistence that district courts cannot presume a 

guidelines range to be reasonable, means the district 

courts cannot treat them as a legal anchor. 

Second, you might be suggesting that they 

serve as some sort of psychological anchor.  That's not 

a concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  The Ex Post 

Facto Clause doesn't guarantee defendants a right to a 

judge who has a particular sentencing philosophy --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think I'm saying more than 

it's all in your head.  I think I'm saying you start in 

a particular place, you have to get the particular place 

right.  The appellate court looks at the particular 

place that you've started and, if you -- if you've ended 

up there, has to grant a presumption of reasonableness. 

But the rules are all geared towards saying,

yes, you can deviate, but you have to understand that 

there's -- that deviation requires some kind of thought 

process and some kind of reason.  Otherwise, this is 

where you should be. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, the Court 

made clear in Pepper, two terms ago, that the district 

court's overarching legal duty is to impose a sentence 

sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to meet the 

statutory purposes of sentencing in Section 3553(a)(2). 

The guidelines are one of several factors 

that inform the district court's exercise of discretion. 

If a district court treats the guidelines as some sort 

of legal constraint this Court's decisions say it 

can't be treated as, that would be statutory error --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it isn't, but that, I 

think, is an undecided question at best.  If you won the 

case on that ground, I would say that what the 

guidelines and the Sentencing Commission are best at, 

gathering information from across the country, and 

saying a typical person who commits this crime in a 

typical way should be sentenced to the typical range 

that applies -- let's say 18 to 24 months. 

That would be down the drain.  And I think 

that Rita, in fact, and the other cases have, at the 

very most, left open and maybe decided against you the

question of when a court of appeals gets the sentence 

from a judge who does not apply the guideline because he 

doesn't like the policy judgment. 

That's a different matter from when he 

applies it then when he thinks he shouldn't apply it 

because the person in front of him doesn't meet the --

the policy conditions.  Those are different.  The 

Commission has the expertise in the first, the judge in 

the second.  And so there is at least a question as to 

whether the court of appeals should give more leeway to 

the guidelines in the first and more leeway to the judge 

in the second. 

Now, I think Rita is consistent with that, 

and I think every opinion we have written is consistent 

with that.  And I'd hate to see that suddenly decided 

and changed in a way I think is inappropriate in this 

case.  So have you all thought that through? 

And is the position of the government, now, 

that we think the guidelines, even if it's a policy 

matter that they have gathered evidence on, are entitled 

to nothing, if they run across a district judge who 

happens to think, though he was an outlier, that the 

outliers were right as a matter of policy, which, of 

course, will always be true.  Every judge who is an 

outlier thinks the outliers are right.  Otherwise, why

would he do it?  You see? 

Official 

Now, I didn't know that issue was in this 

case and that changes the case dramatically for me.  And 

I thought we could decide this just on the ground that 

this is a law that changes punishment.  It's a law. 

It's a regulation. 

And Justice Scalia, I thought, was 

completely right.  The question is whether it inflicts 

greater punishment.  And there is a test on that, and 

the controlling inquiry is whether retroactive 

application of a change in a law that affects punishment 

created a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of 

punishment attached.  All right?  And that's -- that's 

what I thought the -- the framework of law was in this 

case. 

Now, this is sort of tough for you on oral 

argument because I'm just, perhaps, bringing it all up 

to get it all out there and see what you think. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Let me start at the end there, 

Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I disagree with all that, 

by the way. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor,

there, I think it's -- it would be inappropriate to 

untether the significant risk test from the requirement 

that there be an ex post facto law; that is, there has 

to be a significant legal risk, a risk that is traceable 

to some sort of change in the decision maker's authority 

with respect to sentencing, and we don't have that here. 

A district court has the same authority and 

the same obligation to impose an appropriate sentence 

the day after the guidelines are amended as the judge 

had the day before the guidelines are amended.  And any 

judge who forgets that is going to be committing 

statutory error, and the sentence could be reversed on 

appeal for violating the Booker remedy. 

And that's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But when -- when it comes 

to the court of appeals, that's different.  The court of 

appeals begins with a framework of whether or not it's 

within the guidelines.  That's how it begins to measure 

the exercise of discretion. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, as I -- as 

I've explained, the reason why courts -- the only way in 

which courts of appeals can apply a different standard 

of review to a sentence, depending on where it falls in 

the guidelines range, is the presumption of 

reasonableness the Court recognized in Rita.

And I think Rita makes quite clear that that 

is a practical presumption.  That is, it simply 

acknowledges the common-sense proposition that when a 

district court, exercising its discretion, reaches a 

judgment that accords with the Commission's expertise, 

it's likely that sentence is reasonable. 

I don't think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know, there is a lot 

of dispute, now, about the child pornography sentences. 

Let's assume -- and this goes back to Justice Breyer's 

question -- a judge comes in and says, I know child 

pornography is criminal, but I don't think what the 

guidelines are imposing are fair, to any defendant, so 

10 days in jail. 

Why would that be substantively 

unreasonable? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, it would depend on 

the individual circumstances of the particular case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I'm giving you 

exactly what the judge says.  You don't think that the 

appellate court would say that's substantively 

unreasonable because it's not giving due deference to 

the Commission's assessment of the seriousness of this 

crime?

might say that it's substantively unreasonable because 

it's a very, very low sentence, even in comparison to 

the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume that the statute 

is one that permits 10 days, right? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's sort of an unusual 

statute, but, if the hypothetical is in the real world, 

the statute provides -- you know, 10 days to life, okay? 

And the judge thinks 10 days is okay.  I think that's 

the hypothetical. 

MR. FEIGIN:  And, Your Honor, in that case, 

it is possible a court of appeals would decide that that 

is substantively unreasonable.  It's possible a court of 

appeals might reference the guidelines.  But the reason 

why the court of appeals would find it substantively 

unreasonable is because, as a whole, it is substantively 

unreasonable and not because it varies too far from the 

guidelines. 

I also want to emphasize --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you disagree with --

getting back to what this case is about, the D.C. 

Circuit, in opposition to the Seventh Circuit said, it 

is enough that using the new guideline created a 

substantial risk that the defendant's sentence was more

severe than it would have been if the guidelines in 

effect at the time of the crime were used. 

And is it -- there is no doubt that this 

case fits that description.  There was quite a 

substantial risk that the elevated guidelines would 

result in a more severe sentence. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, there are two 

complaints that Petitioner could be making about his 

particular sentencing.  One could be that he thinks the 

judge treated the guidelines too deferentially as a 

legal matter.  And, if that's what he believes, his 

remedy is a claim of statutory error under Booker.  He's 

never made that claim. 

The other claim --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He's saying that -- the 

question is which guidelines in this case?  And he's 

saying it's the guidelines in effect at the time he 

committed the crime.  We are not dealing with other -- I 

mean, it's quite a simple choice. 

Is it -- does the court start with the 

guidelines in effect at the time the crime was 

committed?  Or does it start with the guidelines in 

effect at the time of sentencing? 

MR. FEIGIN:  And whichever set of guidelines 

the district court started with, it had discretion and,

in fact, the obligation to impose the appropriate 

sentence under 3553(a).  Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We know that this 

district judge, he didn't want to get into any 

philosophical things about what was better or what was 

worse.  He said, I want to follow the guidelines.  So 

the question for him was only which guideline. 

He got his answer from the Seventh Circuit. 

They said the guidelines at the time of sentencing.  A 

judge in the D.C. District Court will get the other 

answer, the guidelines in effect at the time the crime 

was committed. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, Petitioner argued 

in this case that the former guidelines range suggested 

a more appropriate sentence than the 2009 guidelines 

range.  The district court considered that argument, and 

it rejected it.  And defendants are always free to raise 

that argument. 

If I could go back to Justice Sotomayor's 

child pornography hypothetical --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's not -- it's not 

a question of whether the judge thought that the one 

guideline was better than the other.  He specifically 

said he wasn't interested in that question.  The 

question was which guideline does he follow?  Which -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, I agree with Justice 

Ginsburg's follow-up question.  It seems to me you 

avoided the question.  You said, oh, well, the judge 

looked at all this and selected the sentence he did. 

But he did so because he referred to the later 

guidelines, and I think that you have to recognize that. 

Unless -- unless I'm --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you are saying 

it doesn't matter if they are advisory --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'd like to finish. 

Unless I am wrong under the record. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, on the 

record, I think, if you look at the full sentencing 

transcript, which is in the Joint Appendix, you will see 

that one of the questions the judge had to answer was 

which set of guidelines were provided -- were the set of 

guidelines that he had to calculate under 

3553(A)(4)(a)(2). 

And then there was a separate section in 

which he considered the argument that the 2009 

guidelines were too harsh.  If you look at the 

sentencing memorandum that Petitioner filed in this 

case, it argued that the increase of loss amounts in the

fraud guidelines was too harsh, that judges often 

imposed sentences that are under the guidelines, and the 

district court should do so here. 

The district court considered that 

argument and rejected that. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the district court 

was following orders.  He was following the Seventh 

Circuit.  The Seventh Circuit had said, you start with 

the higher guidelines. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Justice Ginsburg, it's --

the Court considers these as two separate questions, one 

is which is the set of guidelines I'm required to 

calculate under Section 3553(a), and, second, having 

calculated those guidelines, what sentence should I 

impose, with the guidelines as one of the factors that 

the Court considers. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Feigin, you're sounding 

awfully like according deference to the guidelines 

counts as reversible error. 

MR. FEIGIN:  No, Your Honor, that's not what 

I'm trying to say.  I'm saying treating the guidelines 

as some sort of legal constraint on the district court's 

sentencing discretion is reversible error.  Now, if the 

district court chooses, in its own discretion, to give 

weight to the guidelines, that's within the realm of

choice that 3553(a) provides. 

Official 

There are many circumstances --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is reversible error, is 

it not, simply to blindly apply the guidelines without 

considering the factors in 3553?  That's reversible, 

isn't it? 

MR. FEIGIN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

And, Justice Kagan --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, surely, you do not want 

judges living in a world where they think that they 

cannot give deference to the guidelines, isn't that 

right?  You want them to give appropriate deference to 

the guidelines, isn't that correct? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, we want them to 

find the guidelines persuasive and influential.  We 

recognize that, under this Court's decisions, they 

cannot treat the guidelines as a legal constraint on 

their sentencing discretion.  If a judge follows the 

guidelines, that's because the judge is exercising its 

discretion to decide that a guideline's range sentence 

is appropriate in that particular case. 

Now, there are many instances in which 

judges choose not to do that.  So if I -- for example, 

Justice Sotomayor brought up child pornography.  In 

fiscal year 2012, a defendant for a non-production child

pornography offense, that is, receipt or possession of 

child pornography, was substantially more likely to get 

a nongovernment-sponsored below-range sentence than to 

get a within-range sentence; 48.4 percent 

nongovernment-sponsored below-range, 32.7 percent within 

range. 

If we want to talk about fraud for a minute, 

which is what the Petitioner in this case was charged 

with, if you look at page 67 of the Commission's 

post-Booker report -- and I'd encourage the Court to 

read that report in full -- because it makes very clear 

the variations in sentencing practices among --

depending on the crime, depending on the particular 

circuit, depending on the particular district, and even 

depending on the particular judge. 

I believe --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was Judge Randolph wrong 

when he said -- quoting the Sentencing Commission --

that within-guidelines range, even after Booker, is the 

standard?  Indeed, the actual impact of Booker on 

sentencing has been minor, and, for that minor, he cites 

the Sentencing Commission. 

MR. FEIGIN:  So, Your Honor, I think the 

post-Booker report refutes that in the respect I just 

suggested.  It says that there are actually very

different sentencing practices, depending on the 

particular crime, depending on the particular judge. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this statement comes 

from Final Report on the Impact of the United 

States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, the Commission says 

many things in its report.  One of the things it says is 

that, in the aggregate, guidelines do -- actual 

sentences do tend to track the guidelines. 

But, if you look beyond that one aggregate 

statistic and you start to look at the variations in 

sentencing practices in courts across the nation that 

vary, not only by judge, but by guideline, you see that 

the system is actually operating the way you'd 

expect to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see -- I see, now, where 

you're going.  What I think you're saying is, whatever 

the sentence is, I am the judge, I read the guidelines. 

Now, I may think that I am more likely to get reversed 

if I -- I substitute a different view than the 

Commission had on a matter of policy.  That's all true. 

But, still, I don't have to do it.  No 

matter what it is, I can not use the guidelines.  And, 

if I get reversed on other grounds, or the sentence is 

not reasonable, da, da, da, da, da.  But there's no

legal binding nature there.  That's your point, I think. 

MR. FEIGIN:  That's exactly my point, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If that's 

exactly your point --

MR. FEIGIN:  I'd like to add two -- two 

observations to that, first of which is, as an empirical 

matter, it is extremely unlikely for a sentence to get 

reversed on substantive reasonableness grounds. 

The Commission's post-Booker report -- and 

I'm talking about the one that they just issued a few 

weeks ago that's cited in the reply brief -- states that 

substantive unreasonableness reversals are very rare. 

Petitioner, on page 30 of his brief, cites a database 

that contains 38 such reversals post-Gall. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But, now, I can 

narrow what the question I think is. 

MR. FEIGIN:  And the second point I'd like 

to make, Your Honor, with respect to that, is that I 

don't think this Court should assume that district 

courts are actually going to change what sentences they 

impose and not impose the sentence they believe is 

sufficient, but no greater than necessary, to meet the 

purposes of sentencing, just because they --

gets back to -- to your argument.  You're -- I sense 

that you want me to leave the bench saying the 

guidelines just don't make any difference.  Suppose 

the -- suppose the district judge said, you know, if it 

were just up to me, I would give this lower sentence, 

but the guidelines are an important institutional part 

of our system. 

Uniformity in sentencing is desirable.  For 

us to take into account the experience of other -- of 

other courts and what the Sentencing Commission does is 

very important.  Therefore, my discretion is guided by 

these guidelines. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I absolutely --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You don't want me -- you 

don't want me to say that. 

MR. FEIGIN:  I absolutely do not want you to 

leave the bench with the impression that the guidelines 

are unimportant.  I want you to leave the bench with the 

impression that the guidelines don't impose any legal 

constraint on a judge's exercise of discretion. 

Different judges -- not only does it vary by guideline, 

but --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Feigin, take -- take 

this example:  Let's suppose that there's a crime and 

the punishment for crime is 5 years to life, all right?

Now, Congress passes a statute, and it says, 

no, we think this crime, now, is much more important 

than we used to; now, it's 25 years to life, right?  A 

person commits the offense prior to that change. 

Absolutely obvious case, right, that you have to apply 

the -- the 5 years to life, right? 

Obvious, correct? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Now, the Sentencing 

Commission does what the Sentencing Commission always 

does when there is a legislative change like this.  It 

says, well, we have this guidelines that assumes 5 years 

to life.  We have to change our guidelines because, now, 

it's 25 years to life.  And it passes a guideline 

amendment which completely conforms to the legislative 

amendment. 

But you're saying, no, the 25-year-to-life 

guideline is the appropriate one to implement, even 

though the 5-year statute is the appropriate one to 

implement -- is the appropriate one to give effect to. 

Is that -- can that possibly be right? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I think I'm saying 

something slightly different.  I think, under 3553(a), 

the Court would calculate the current guidelines.  Now, 

the defendant would have a very good argument in that

case, that the current guidelines range would simply not 

be appropriate for him, and I think a district court 

would do well to listen to that argument in that 

particular case, if it thought that the sentences that 

the new guidelines range was suggesting were out of 

whack with the statute at the time the offense was 

committed. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Feigin, I'm under the 

impression -- more than the impression I know -- that 

the Sentencing Commission can make a revision of the 

guidelines retroactive. 

Can it only do that for revisions that --

that lower the -- the suggested penalty?  Or can it do 

that for revisions that increase it as well? 

MR. FEIGIN:  I believe it's only for 

revisions that lower --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Only for lower, okay. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because, if it could 

increase it, then it would be violating, according to 

your -- your friend, the Ex Post Facto Clause. 

MR. FEIGIN:  And, Your Honor, getting back 

to how the -- the advisory guidelines are working in 

practice for a minute -- which, again, is I don't think 

what this -- what the focus should be.  The focus should

be on whether there's actually been a change in the law 

that either increases or decreases a sentencer's 

discretion. 

If you imagine two States, for example, each 

of which had exactly the same advisory guidelines system 

that the Federal government has and, in one of them, 

judges are -- you know, tend to find the guidelines very 

persuasive, they sentence within the guidelines 70 

percent of the time.  In the other one, judges 

exercising their discretion don't find the guidelines 

very persuasive, and they sentence within the guidelines 

10 percent of the time. 

I don't think it makes sense that, under the 

exact same legal regime, an amendment to the guidelines 

in one State would be an Ex Post Facto Law and an 

amendment to the guidelines in the other State wouldn't 

be an Ex Post Facto Law. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your -- your statement 

to me was -- and to us earlier -- was that the -- there 

is no legal constraint on the exercise of discretion. 

I 

agree, the judge -- everybody knows the judge can go 

lower, but that overlooks the fact that discretion is 

defined by legal standards.  That's how we begin to 

think about discretion. 

That's how appellate courts weigh

discretion.  And, again, you want to give the guidelines 

no effect in determining how that discretion is shaped, 

guided and exercised. 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, they are a factor. 

They're a factor under 3553(a).  They're a factor that 

the district court has to consider.  But they don't 

themselves in any way, shape, or form constrain the 

district court's exercise of discretion.  A district 

court can decide that -- not to impose a guidelines 

sentence. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you accept the fact 

that they define the discretion, even though they don't 

constrain it? 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I wouldn't say they

discretion is?  In other words, only in the case of 

manifest injustice or however dramatic you want to limit 

the available discretion. 

MR. FEIGIN:  The reason I -- the reason I 

said "might well" is I think, at that point, the Court 

would have to look at the significance of the increase 

or decrease in the sentencer's authority and decide 

whether that was a significant enough increase or 

decrease to trigger the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How would -- how 

would a court --

MR. FEIGIN:  -- the Ex Post Facto Clause.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  How would a 

court go about answering that question? 

MR. FEIGIN:  I think that's where the 

significant risk test comes in.  And, under the 

significant risk test, you can either see whether it 

facially has that effect -- we know that's not true of 

the Federal Sentencing Guidelines because the Court's 

made clear they don't impose any legal constraints.  Or 

you could see whether it has that effect as applied 

under Garner. 

But We know that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's a 

statistical evaluation of the kind we were talking 

about.  You look, and you say, well, it's only once in a 

blue moon that a judge invokes the manifest injustice 

provision, so it's not increasing the risk. 

On the other hand, well, every four out of 

five judges do, and, therefore, it is an increase.  Is 

that how you --

MR. FEIGIN:  I think it's fundamental -- the 

decision in Garner doesn't precisely describe exactly 

how the significant risk inquiry works.  I think it is, 

fundamentally, a legal inquiry because the bottom-line 

question the Court's always trying to answer is whether 

there has been an ex post facto law.

And I think, to the extent it's okay to look 

at empirical data -- and I don't think the Court in 

Garner expressly says that that's the kind of data it 

was contemplating -- it would be to inform how the legal 

framework actually operates in practice. 

And, if the Court found it necessary to look 

at that here, in the -- the post-Booker report makes 

clear that sentencing practices vary over the districts, 

over the circuits, and with respect to particular 

guidelines. 

So Justice Alito brought up the example of 

the Eastern District of New York.  We don't have to look 

any further than the Northern District of Illinois, 

where Petitioner was sentenced here, where the latest 

2012 statistics that came out on Friday show that the 

defendant actually has a slightly higher probability --

very slightly higher probability -- of getting a 

non-government-sponsored below-range sentence than of 

getting a sentence within the guidelines range. 

I think all these variances show two things. 

One, they show that the system is working exactly as 

you'd expect an advisory system to work; and, two, I 

think they show that some sort of narrow focus on 

empirical data, which is what you are left with, once 

you divorce the ex post facto inquiry from a change in

law, is inherently unworkable. 

You have to --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Feigin, I think 

more goes into it than empirics.  But there's this 

unbelievable chart, really, in one of the green briefs 

about -- you know, where there's one line, which is what 

happens to the guidelines, and there's this other line, 

which is what happens to the sentence, and they follow 

each other identically, exactly. 

You can't get a chart that looks better 

from this than -- from Mr. Kinnaird's point of view. 

MR. FEIGIN:  So let me say two things in 

response to that, Your Honor.  If you look in the 

post-Booker report, they have charts like that, that are 

broken down by offense --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish your 

sentence. 

MR. FEIGIN:  If you look at fraud and you 

look at child pornography, they deviate when they go --

when the guidelines' suggestion goes up, the sentences 

don't go up in accordance with that, at the same level 

of the chart you are looking at. 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Kinnaird, you have 3 minutes left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. KINNAIRD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Five quick points.  First, the government 

says this must be an overt legal restraint to be within 

the Ex Post Facto Clause.  This Court has repeatedly, in 

Weaver and other cases, said it's the effect of the 

change of law, not its form, that matters for ex post 

facto purposes, the effect on punishment. 

And what this revision and amendment of the 

mandatory benchmark did was to alter the legal framework 

in a way that channeled and redefined the exercise of 

discretion in the direction of greater punishment. 

Secondly, what range is the -- is the 

mandatory benchmark under the statute matters greatly, 

as Justice Kennedy alluded to, to appellate review for 

substantive reasonableness.  You have -- it's the key 

factor in determining whether a sentence is reasonable, 

and it's the standard to which a presumption of 

reasonableness may attach. 

Third, as far as the record, there's --

there's no analysis in the record of the 1998 

guidelines, other than to -- to set them aside.  And --

and what you have to have, under the Constitution, is he 

has to actually apply those as the statute required at

the time of the offense, as the mandatory benchmark. 

Instead, he's quite clear, he's applying the 

'98 guidelines.  He's deferring to the -- to the policy 

judgments there and to the loss calculations.  So it had 

a clear substantive effect on his risk of greater 

punishment. 

The post-Booker report does have those --

those charts that show that, for all offenses and for 

fraud offenses, when the guidelines' minimum goes up, 

the average sentences go up, and that's a very 

compelling point of evidence. 

And, finally, I would point out here that 

one of the amendments here was actually a response of 

the Commission to a congressional directive in the wake 

of the Enron scandal and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, where 

there was great public and legislative outrage over 

light fraud sentences, to reconsider the fraud -- fraud 

guidelines. 

And that puts this in the core of the Ex 

Post Facto Clause, that it violates fundamental notions 

of retroactivity for a legislature to be able to alter 

the law of punishment after the offense. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
