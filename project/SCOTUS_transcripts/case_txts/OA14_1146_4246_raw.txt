CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­1146,  Tyson  Foods  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bouaphakeo. 

            

Mr.  Phillips. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CARTER  C.  PHILLIPS 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  has  made  clear  that  class  actions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  only  appropriate  when  the  plaintiff's  proof  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tailored  to  their  specific  theory  of  liability  in  a  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  allows  class­wide  injury  to  be  determined  in  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stroke,  and  that  the  lower  courts  must  engage  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rigorous  analysis  in  order  to  demonstrate  that  fact. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  this  Federal  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plaintiffs  were  allowed  to  pursue  a  class  of  more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  3300  employees  who  occupied  job  ­­ more  than  400 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jobs  which  required  widely  differing  amounts  of  time  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perform  their  donning,  doffing,  and  washing  tasks. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  is  that  so? 

  

 

 

 

 

Because  as  far  as  I  understand  this,  there  was  some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

donning  and  doffing  that  was  common,  that  is,  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  sanitation  and  some  protective  gear  that  they  all

had  to  wear.  And  then  there  was  a  difference  between 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  night  ­­ knife  wielders  and  the  others,  but  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't  all  that  different.  So  in  one  case,  one  wore 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mesh  aprons,  and  in  the  other  case,  rubber  aprons.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  seem  to  be  that  wide  disparity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  there  ­­ there  are  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  answers  to  that,  Justice  Ginsburg. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  if  you  ­­ if  you  just  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  activities  that  Dr.  Mericle  specifically  testified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about,  for  certain  activities,  he  found  some  employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  take  30  seconds  to  get  dressed  and  others  who  took 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  10  minutes  to  get  dressed  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

in  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  but  you  didn't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  PHILLIPS:  ­­ in  certain  circumstances 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ the  statistical 

  

 

 

 

mechanism  of  your  own,  you  didn't  have  a  Daubert 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection  to  the  testimony,  and  you  suggest  in  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  that  uninjured  plaintiffs  are  included  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggregate  damages,  but  you  were  the  one  that  objected  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  bifurcated  trial.  And  so  far  as  uninjured  plaintiffs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recovering,  that  has  to  be  determined  on  remand  anyway. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  just  don't  understand  your  arguments. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  There  are  a  number  of 

   

  

 

 

 

questions  embedded  in  there,  Justice  Kennedy.

The  ­­ the  first  one  is  ­­ and  we  objected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  along  to  having  this  class  certified  on  the  basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  were  a  wide  range  of  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Yeah,  but  once  you  lose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that,  you  have  also  other  defenses:  Your  own  expert,  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Daubert  objection,  et  cetera. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  But  Justice  Kennedy,  we  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  bring  forward  an  expert.  What  we  did  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  is  we  ­­ we  cross­examined  both  their  ­­ the  named 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs,  the  four  named  plaintiffs  who  testified,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrated  two  things  about  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

One,  that  in  general,  they  way  overestimated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  own  time;  and  two,  none  of  their  times  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remotely  the  same  as  Dr.  Mericle's  time.  So  we  proved 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

Second,  we  cross­examined  Dr.  Mericle  about 

 

 

 

 

 

his  testimony  and  demonstrated  again  that  his  methods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  completely  haphazard  and  scattered,  and  therefore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  demonstrate. 

 

            

And  this  notion  that  you  patch  over  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirety  of  these  problems  simply  by  averaging  all  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  times  of  all  of  these  employees  is  simply  the  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  shortcut  this  Court  has  ­­ has  rejected  in  the  past 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  both  Comcast  and  Wal­Mart. 

 

 

 

 

            

I'm  sorry,  Justice.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Phillips,  I'm 

  

 

 

 

completely  at  a  loss  as  to  what  you're  complaining 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about.  That's  exactly  what  you  did. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And  what  this  expert  did  ­­ I  mean,  as  far 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  I  could  tell,  between  your  expert  that  you  used  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculate  "gang  time"  and  "K­time"  did  exactly  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  this  expert  did.  You  came  out  with  a  lower 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

number,  but  you  used  fewer  people.  At  least  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert  used  hundreds  of  people  instead  of  the  few  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  did.  I'm  ­­ I'm  just  completely  at  a  loss. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Would  you  suggest  that  if  one  plaintiff  came 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  court,  that  he  could  not  use  the  ­­ this  expert  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove  his  case  circumstantially  to  show  that  in  fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  average  is  this,  and  he  doesn't  really  know  how  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  he  took?  When  he  does  it  now,  it  may  be  12  minutes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead  of  10? 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Justice  Sotomayor,  I  would  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

I  would  ­­ yes.  I  would  categorically  reject  that, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that's  no  more  different  than  Employee  A  coming 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  court  and  saying  I  don't  know  what  I  worked,  but 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Employee  B,  who  does  vastly  different  activities  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Oh,  no,  no.  But  they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

know  what  they  worked.  They  know  that  people  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working  over  40  hours  because  there  were  time  records 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  that.

What  you're  basically  saying  is  that  Mt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clemens  is  completely  wrong.  You  can't  estimate  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  when  the  employer  doesn't  keep  records. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  We  ­­ we  don't  have  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

quarrel  with  Mt.  Clemens  the  way  it  was  written.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mt.  Clemens  made  ­­ makes  a  very  clear  divide  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  needs  to  be  proven,  what  the  plaintiff's  burden  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  demonstrate  that  he  or  she  has  worked  beyond  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40­hour  work  week,  and  then  what  happens  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  proof  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  There  were  time  records 

  

 

 

 

 

to  that  effect  here. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right.  But  there  were  a  lot 

   

  

  

 

 

 

of  people  who  didn't  work  beyond  the  40  hours. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No.  There  were 

  

  

 

 

200­and­something­odd  people  that  their  expert  showed 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  work  above  40  hours.  The  jury  knew  about  those. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  And  ­­ and  the  jury  rejected 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr.  Mericle's  averaging  of  ­­ of  18  ­­ 18  and  20  ­­ 18 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  a  half  and  21  minutes,  and  we  don't  know  what  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact  of  that  is. 

 

 

 

            

What  we  do  know  is  that  Fox  calculated  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  mere  three  minutes'  departure  from  Mericle's  numbers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dropped  the  damages  award  by  $1.41  million,  and  dropped 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  number  of  plaintiffs  out  by  close  to  125.

So  Justice  Kennedy,  the  small  differences 

 

 

 

 

 

make  a  big  difference  in  ­­ in  this  particular  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  we  go  back  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor's  basic  question,  that  is,  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  sued  Tyson  or  Tyson's  predecessor  and  got  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunction  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ what  Tyson's  did,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

had  its  own  industrial  engineer  observe  the  workers  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  donning  and  doffing  their  gear,  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert  averaged  the  times  that  they  spent.  And  it  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me  that  the  plaintiff's  expert  here  is  doing  exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  thing  that  Tyson's  expert  did  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  was  bringing  ­­

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  And  in  some  ways, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg,  that  explains  why  we  didn't  bring  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Daubert  motion  that  Justice  Kennedy  asked  about  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  methodology  isn't  inherently  flawed.  The  problem 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  methodology  is  it's  applied  to  the  theory  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

It's  one  thing  for  an  employer  to  say,  look, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  entitled  under  the  Department  of  Labor  regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  average,  as  a  mechanism  for  trying  to  avoid  the  kind 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  picayune  details  and  discrepancies  that  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  in  Mt.  Clemens  and  said  those  can  be

disregarded  as  mere  trifles,  we're  allowed  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  effect  of  what  we,  in  fact,  did  hear  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

round  up  in  order  to  provide  more  time  to  people  than

given  four  minutes  of  K­time  when  they  ­­ it  took  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  about  30  seconds  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  idea  that  we  could  overcompensate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  using  those  kinds  of  data  is  one  thing,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  vast  difference  from  saying  that  in  order  to  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  maintain  as  ­­ under  a  rigorous  analysis  the  idea 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  can  proceed  as  a  class  when  all  you've  got  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

averaging  across  the  widest  imaginable  range  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  performing  different  tasks  with  different 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements,  and  indeed,  although  I  don't  think  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Phillips,  you  say  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  whether  it  can  proceed  as  a  class.  But  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  as  though  that's  really  not  the  question  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  because  of  Mt.  Clemens;  and  what  Mt.  Clemens  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  suggest  that  certain  kinds  of  statistical  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  completely  appropriate  in  FLSA  cases  generally,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they're  brought  by  the  government,  or  even  if  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  by  a  single  person.

And  so  the  question  that  you  really  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putting  before  us  is  not  a  Rule  23  question,  it's  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  whether  this  sort  of  evidence  complies  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Mt.  Clemens  standard;  isn't  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  No.  I  would  go  ­­ I  would 

    

   

  

 

 

 

actually  go  at  it  the  other  way.  I  would  say  that  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  question  is:  Can  you  use  this  kind  of  averaging 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  ­­ in  a  run  mine­case  period  under  Rule  23?  And  it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  me  the  answer  to  that  has  to  be  no,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ this  simply  papers  over  the  problems  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  the  Rule  23  inquiry, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Phillips,  is  always  dependent  on  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  law  is. 

 

 

            

is  ­­

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right.  And  then  the  question 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  was  true  in  Halliburton 

  

 

 

 

 

 

where  we  said,  look,  if  we  didn't  have  the  basic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption,  we  would  think  of  this  as  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individualized. 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  we  have  the  basic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

presumption,  so  the  proof  is  not  individualized. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  same  thing,  it  seems  to  me,  is  true 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  because  of  the  Mt.  Clemens  inquiry.

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Where  it  says  if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

employer  hasn't  kept  the  appropriate  records,  even  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single  plaintiff  can  prove  the  amount  of  work  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  use  of  statistical  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  That's  not  what  Mt.  Clemens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

says,  Justice  Kagan.  Mt.  Clemens  says  that  it's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  on  the  employee  to  demonstrate  that  he  or  she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worked  the  requisite  hours  in  order  to  get  past  40. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Once  you  got  past  40  in  determining  exactly  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages  would  be,  at  that  point  it  was  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  hadn't  ­­ because  ­­ because  Mt.  Clemens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hadn't  maintained  records  to  go  ahead  and  give  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  a  pass.  It's  the  same  ­­ it's  the  Story 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

parchments  test  all  over  again. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  can't  see  how  that  account 

    

 

 

 

 

 

of  Mt.  Clemens  would  make  most  ­­ much  sense.  You're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting  that  a  person  past  40  can  produce  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statistical  evidence,  but  if  I  worked  39  1/2  hours  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  this  overtime  is  going  to  push  me  over  40,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mt.  Clemens  presumption  wouldn't  be  available  to  me? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  I  think  that's  exactly  the 

    

 

 

 

 

line  the  Court  drew  in  Mt.  Clemens.  It's  the  line  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  has  consistently  drawn  in  antitrust  cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  parchment.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  you've  changed  your 

  

 

 

 

 

theory.  Question  2,  as  you  presented  in  the  petition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  certiorari,  whether  the  class  may  be  certified  if  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  members  who  were  not  injured.  Then  you  changed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  Page  49  of  your  brief,  you  say  that  the  plaintiff 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must  demonstrate  a  mechanism  to  show  that.  So  now 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're  talking  about  ­­ about  the  mechanism. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  ­­ so  the  case  has  been  argued  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  theories  at  ­­ at  many  points,  and  it  seems  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  Justice  Kagan  is  precisely  right.  You  said,  well,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  start  first  with  class  action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

She  said,  no,  no.  The  point  is  we  start 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  Mt.  Clemens.  That's  the  substantive  law  for  FSLA. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  To  be  sure.  I  mean,  you  can 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

go  at  it  either  way.  But  at  the  end  of  the  day, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously,  what  ­­ as  I  started  ­­ as  I  started  my 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

remarks,  is  ­­ is  that  the  Court  ­­ is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  are  obliged  to  demonstrate  that  a  class  works 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  basis  of  the  substantive  liability  that  they  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ burden  that  they  have  to  assume  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Right.  So  Mt.  Clemens  says 

  

  

 

 

 

 

exactly  this.  I'll  read  it.  I  think  it's  correct. 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

"Where"  ­­ "Where  an  employee's  records  of  time  worked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are,"  quote,  "'inaccurate  or  inadequate'"  ­­ that's  your

That's  what  it  says  to  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  then  it  says  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

employer  can't  complain  that  the  damages  lack  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactness  and  precision  of  measurement  that  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible  had  he  kept  records.  But  he  didn't.  So  they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  some  statistics  to  show  it.  What's  wrong  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  There  are  two  answers  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there.  The  premise  ­­ the  first  part  of  that  sentence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  if  he  proves  that  he  has,  in  fact,  performed  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  which  he  was  improperly  compensated. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MR.  PHILLIPS:  None  of  these  employee  ­­ a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

huge  number  of  these  employees  have  not  made  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

showing. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  they  did  through 

  

 

 

 

 

statistics.  I  mean  ­­

    

 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  No.  They  ­­

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  mean,  you  say  an 

    

 

 

 

 

antitrust  case.  Okay.  Let's  imagine  an  antitrust  case.

shoddy  material.  And  large  customers,  distributors  buy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

these  shoddy  materials.  They're  hurt.  How  much  are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  hurt?  It  depends  on  how  many  sneakers  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  used  and  when  and  so  forth. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  no  way  people  don't  keep  sneaker 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

records,  so  what  we  do  is  we  hire  a  statistician  to  use 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sampling.  And  if  he's  a  good  statistician  and  uses 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

sampling  correctly,  we  have  probably  a  better  measure 

   

 

 

 

 

 

than  if  we  asked  the  employees  to  go  back  and  remember 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  many  sneakers  they  wore  and  what  days  and  what  hours 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  years  ago. 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  But  Justice  Breyer,  your  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

your  entire  hypothetical  is  premised  on  the  fact  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  already  shown  that  they  were  injured  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  some  of  them,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

might  turn  out,  actually  did  not  wear  sneakers  during 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  period  of  time  that  the  conspiracy  has  been  shown  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist.  But  we  didn't  know  that  at  the  beginning  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  thought  we  could  prove  a  conspiracy  from  January  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

December,  but  we  only  ended  up  proving  it  from  January 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until  June.  Now,  there  we  have  it.  We  put  them  in  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  to  begin  with  because  we  thought  we  could  prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury.  As  it  turns  out,  we  can't.

problem  ­­ is  my  guess  is  your  expert  testified  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  conspiracy  that  lasted  through  the  entire  period. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  for  whatever  reason  the  jury  rejected  it,  just  as  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected  Mericle  in  this  case.  And  now  you're  stuck  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  situation  where  you've  got  this  huge  judgment  where  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knew  there  were  200  and  some  people  who  ­­ but  now  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  there  are  more  than  a  thousand  plaintiffs. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  Justice  Kennedy,  we  didn't  shift 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  answer.  Our  answer  was  this  is  invalid

are  ­­


 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.
 

  

 

 

  

I'm  having 

 

difficulty  understanding  your  point.  There
 
 

  

 

 

 

are  records, 

 

aren't  there,  of  how  many  hours  they  worked
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without 

donning  and  doffing  the  equipment  at  issue,
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct? 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Yes,  there  are.
 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.
 

  

 

 

  

So  I  thought 

   

that  Dr.  Mericle's  using  those  actual  records  figured 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  how  many  people  worked  over  40  hours.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  you  didn't  have  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

expert  to  say  that? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  We  didn't  need  an  expert  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that.  We  had  our  industrial  engineer  who  said  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  ­­ and  the  Federal  government's  industrial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engineer  said  the  same  thing  for  four  minutes.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Is  there  any  way  at  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  to  determine  which  employees  were  actually  injured 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  which  ones  were  not?  Because  I  ­­ I  gathered 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

because  the  jury  rejected  the  full  verdict  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requested  by  the  plaintiffs,  they  did  not  accept 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr.  Mericle's  testimony  regarding  the  amount  of  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed  to  don  and  doff  for  employees  in  various 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories.  And  without  knowing  that,  I  don't  see  how 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  at  this  point  ­­ I'll  ­­ I'll  ask  Mr.  Frederick 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  question  ­­ how  you  can  separate  the  employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  were  injured  from  the  employees  who  were  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injured. 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  It  ­­ it's  impossible  to  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And  ­­ and  Fox,  who  was  their  expert  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testified  on  the  damages,  was  very  clear  about  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it's  not  linear.  So  that  if  ­­ if  it  turns  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  some  period  of  time  drops,  the  number  of  employees

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  the  briefs  are  like

MR.  PHILLIPS:  I  would  be  shocked  if  he's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

prepared  to  accept  a  remand.  I  mean,  I'm  delighted  if

MR.  PHILLIPS:  It  was  a  lump  sum  judgment,

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  understand.  You  ­­

    

  

 

 

 

you  can  get  a  class  certified,  some  of  whom  have  not

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  you  can't  do  that.  And

conceded  that.  Obviously,  we  ­­ we  filed  an  opposition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  their  motion  to  certify,  and  we  brought  forth  dozens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  supervisors  who  testified  about  the  ­­ the  myriad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jobs  and  the  ­­ and  the  wide  range  of  donning  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doffing  requirements  for  them,  and  said  that  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances,  this  is  not  an  appropriate  case  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed  as  a  class. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  didn't  you  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  general,  a  class  could  be  certified  going  in,  even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  at  that  point,  we  don't  know? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  No.  No.  We  ­­ I  mean,  we  ­­

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

in  general,  we  say  classes  can  be  certified.  I  mean,  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  you  could  have  certified  a  walking  time  class  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  still  having  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  When  I  heard  Justice  Scalia's  question,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

thought  the  answer  is  of  course  you  can  put  in  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  people  whom,  it  will  turn  out,  are  not  hurt.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  class  of  people  who  were  hurt  by  a  price­fixing 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  that  lasted  from  January  to  December.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  I  said.  I  have  good  reason  to  think  it.  But  I 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove  it  only  lasted  until  June.  That's  a  failure  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proof.  Half  of  them  were  not  hurt,  okay?  So  we  don't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay  them.

MR.  PHILLIPS:  But  the  problem  is  ­­ yes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  are,  Justice  Breyer,  because  the  problem  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  expert  who  testified  to  the  conspiracy  would  have

the  damages  number  that  that  expert  will  put  forward

But,  finally,  how  do  you  have  standing  ­­

that  ­­ I  thought  that  was  the  whole  purpose  of  not

MR.  PHILLIPS:  If  it's  a  class  judgment  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ and  you  didn't  opt  out  ­­ I  mean,  there  are  two

class,  and  there's  the  FSLA  collective  action,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  now  been  merged  in  on  the  judgment.  So  there's  no

under  those  circumstances,  what  this  Court  said  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Phillips  Petroleum  is  that  the  defendant  has  a  right  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  sure  that  the  mechanism  by  which  the  judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately  is  entered  across  the  entire  class  is  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  ­­ that  it  protects  us  as  a  collateral 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estoppel  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Mr.  Phillips,  do 

  

 

 

 

 

you  have  ­­ do  you  have  a  theory  as  to  why  the  jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awarded  less  than  half  of  the  damages  that  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requested?  Did  they  ­­ I  take  it  they  didn't  identify 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  workers.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Did  they  ­­ did  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree  with  the  18  minutes,  21  minutes? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  They  had  to  have  disagreed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  it,  and  there  was  good  reason  to  do  that  because  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ if  you  take  the  testimony  of  the  four  named 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs,  they  ­­ they  were  significantly  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  the  ­­ than  the  18  and  21  minute  times.  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  best  evidence  was,  is  that  Mericle,  by  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

method  of  sort  of  ­­ of  nonrandom  observations  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­selected  employees,  came  up  with  widely  ­­ wildly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extravagant  numbers,  and  the  jury  rejected  them.  And  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  plaintiffs'  decision  to  go  for  the  ­­ for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirety  of  the  claim  rather  than  take  a  more  narrow 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  of  maybe  seeking  walking  time  where  the  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  individual  plaintiffs  is  much  more  homogenous. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  problem  with  this  is  that  it's  very  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  vast  ­­ I'm  sorry. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  I  could  go  back  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy's  question  at  the  start,  because  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  was  your  decision  not  to  have  a  bifurcated 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding,  where  it  would  have  been  clear  ­­ it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  proved  separately  in  a  highly  ministerial  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  employees  worked  over  40  hours. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  having  made  that  decision,  you're  in  a

position  now  where  you're  saying,  oh,  there's  one  sum  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  one  lump  judgment;  we  don't  know  what  to  do  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  But,  in  ­­ in  essence,  what's  going  to  happen  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  going  to  go  back  in  remand,  and  the  judge  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  do  something  that  looks  an  awful  like  ­­ lot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  bifurcation  that  you  rejected,  which  is,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  will  say,  now  we  figure  out  in  this  highly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ministerial  way  who  worked  more  than  40  hours,  and  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  is  entitled  to  share  in  the  judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  The  ­­ the  bifurcation  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  plaintiffs  proposed,  two  things  to  say  about  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  they  took  it  off  the  table 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves,  not  us.  We  did  object,  but  that  wasn't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  wasn't  rejected  because  we  ­­ we  objected  to  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  ­­ they  pulled  bifurcation  off  the  table.  So  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  you  can  put  the  burden  on  us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But,  second  of  all,  the  ­­ the  bifurcation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  proposed  was  that  first  you  were  going  to  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  Mericle  is  right  or  not,  and  that  means  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  and  a  half  and  21  can  be  averaged  across  your  class. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  then  the  second  part  was  going  to  be  Fox  testifying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  how  to  slot  that  in. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well,  that's  not  ­­ that's  not  going  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  may  help  with  respect  to  the  ­­ to  the  uninjured  ­­

remotely  helped  with  the  more  fundamental  question  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  inadequacy  of  this  as  a  class  action  device  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  patch  over  the  problems  of  this  ­­ of  this  class  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  averaging  everything  together. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  it  ­­ it  absolutely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

helps  with  the  question,  your  second  question  presented, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  this  point  that  you  are  making  that  there  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  some  people  who  didn't  work  40  hours,  who  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonetheless  get  money.  And  it  absolutely  helps  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  It  takes  care  of  the  entire  problem.

question  presented  ­­

 

 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ which  is  this  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about  was  the  class  too  varied.  And  on  that,  I  have  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  back  to  this  ­­ to  this  issue  of,  it's  not  a  class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue.  It's  an  FLSA  issue  under  Mt.  Clemens  as  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  this  kind  of  statistical  evidence  could  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  presented. 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  And  ­­ and  my  answer  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mt.  Clemens  one,  which,  obviously,  I'm  not  persuading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  on,  is  that  if  ­­ the  way  I  read  Mt.  Clemens,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  you  don't  go  to  fair  and  reasonable  inference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ on  the  liability  phase.  You  only  do  that  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages  phase.  And  I  would  still  argue  here  that  even

if  you  use  Mt.  ­­ the  fair  and  reasonable  inference

here,  because  it's  one  thing  to  ­­ to  do  some  kind  of

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  DAVID  C.  FREDERICK

MR.  FREDERICK:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief

spreadsheet  that  Dr.  Fox  compiled  in  conjunction  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr.  Mericle's  analysis. 

 

 

            

And  so  you're  right,  Justice  Kagan,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  pot  of  money  based  on  the  jury  verdict  that

will  be  allocated,  assuming  that  the  Court  affirms  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  certification  judgment. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  there  is  no  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  money  can  be  divided  up.  The  question  is  whether  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  be  divided  up  between  those  who  were  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injured  and  those  who  were  not  actually  injured. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  suppose  you  have  ­­ if  you  have  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees,  one  worked  ­­ one  was  ­­ one  was  given  credit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  working  39  hours  a  week,  one  was  given  credit  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working  38  hours  a  week,  one  was  given  credit  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working  37  hours  a  week.  Without  knowing  how  much 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

additional  time  the  ­­ each  employee  is  entitled  to,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  tell  which  one  of  those,  which,  if  any,  of  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  injured,  and  you  can't  tell  how  much  additional  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employees  were  entitled  to  without  knowing  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  did  with  Dr.  Mericle's  statistics. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  that's  why  I  ­­ I  don't  see  how  this  can 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  done  in  other  than  a  very  slap­dash  fashion. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  there  are  two  ways, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  would  submit  that  they  ­­ neither  is  slap­dash. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ordinarily,  we  would  defer  to  jury  verdicts,  and  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say  that  if  the  jury  evaluated  the  evidence  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  realm  of  what  was  presented  at  trial,  that  is  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  special  deference  in  our  legal  system. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  when  those  monies  get  allocated,

ordinarily  a  district  judge  is  going  to  do  so  on  a  basis 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  of  pro  rata  for  all  of  those  ­­ all  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  who  were  found  to  be  injured,  and  the  212  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  identified  by  name,  by  Dr.  Fox,  Tyson  knew  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  before  trial,  did  not  move  for  summary  judgment  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  those  212,  could  have  easily  severed  them  right  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  this  case  went  to  the  jury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  way  is  that  Dr.  Fox  did  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  using  Mericle's  averages  and  then  added  them  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  number  of  minutes  worked  by  the  particular  employee, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  based  on  that,  a  vast  number  got  above  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40­hour  threshold. 

 

            

Now,  the  evidence  at  trial  that  it  came  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  Tyson's  own  witnesses  was  that  the  average  worker 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worked  48  hours  per  week  before  you  even  got  to  any  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  counting  of  the  donning  and  doffing,  and  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plant  ran  on  Saturdays  60  percent  of  the  time,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  a  6­day  work  week. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  so  the  evidence  as  the  jury  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering  it  found  the  vast  majority  of  the  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  were  already  going  to  be  in  overtime  status,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why  the  fulcrum  of  the  case  came  down  to  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putting  on  this  gear,  which  was  standard  sanitary  gear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  every  single  worker  in  the  class,  was  compensable  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not.  We're  ­­

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Counsel,  we  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

know  why  the  jury  reduced  the  requested  damages  by  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave  less  than  half.  I  mean,  it  could  have  been  because 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  thought  the  evidence  on  the  ones  who  just  put  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

smocks  or  whatever  as  opposed  to  the  ones  who  had  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mesh  Armour  ­­ you  see,  I  don't  believe  what  you  said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  ones  who  don't  put  on  the  mesh  Armour,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  give  zero  dollars  on  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  believe  the  ­­ the  validity  of  your  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  experts'  testimony  on  the  ones  who  put  on  the  mesh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Armour,  so  we're  going  to  award  that.  Or  maybe  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought,  you  know,  they  would  just  discount  the  whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing,  or  ­­ you  know,  we  don't  know  why. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  because  they  used  average  statistics  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

varying  jobs  with  ­­ even  your  expert  admitted  varying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times,  depending  upon  the  classes,  there's  no  way  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  whether  everybody  who's  going  to  get  money  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injured  or  not. 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  and  Tyson  had  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity  to  ask  for  more  specific  instructions.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  their  instructions  were  the  ones  that  ended  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governing  the  trial.  So  to  the  extent  that  they  had  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  ­­

substantive  answer?  Because  it's  one  thing  for  us  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

write  an  opinion  saying  this  is  a  horrible  problem,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  didn't  ask  for  instructions,  so  don't  worry  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  I  don't  ­­

   

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It's  another  thing. 

  

 

 

 

 

We  need  to  know  whether  we  should  address  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism  by  which  this  was  presented  to  the  jury,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  we  can  deal  separately  with  a  waiver  issue. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Yeah.  Well,  on  the 

  

  

 

 

 

substantive  part,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  let  me  say  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  in  all  these  instances  where  there  is  a  challenge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  an  aggregation  or  something  where  you  could  ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  for  a  more  particularized  decision,  there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

always  a  tactical  and  a  strategic  decision  that  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

counsel  on  both  sides  are  making  and  the  parties  on  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sides. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That  sounds  like  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

same  answer  you  gave  before. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  No,  but  ­­ but  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  there  a 

  

 

 

 

 

substantive?  Yes.  We  could  say,  okay,  the  problem  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  didn't  ask  for  a  special  verdict.  They  didn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

divide  it  between  the  people  who  were  engaged  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  functions  than  the  killers,  stunners.

MR.  FREDERICK:  Substantively,  the  way  this 

  

 

 

 

 

is  handled  typically  is  that  you  would  do  a  pro  rata 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribution  of  the  jury  proceeds  to  the  members  who  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  to  have  been  injured.  That's  the  substantive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer.  We  have  it  the  way  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  I'm  actually  puzzled  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  thing.  So  put  yourself  in  my  puzzlement. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  ­­ there  is  a  green  room,  a  yellow  room,  and  a  blue 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

room,  all  right?  Now,  we  discover  with  our  statistical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experts  that  in  the  green  room,  doffing  and  donning, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  people  on  average  ­­ some  more,  some  less  ­­ but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sampling  shows  it's  half  an  hour.  In  the  blue  room, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  20  minutes.  In  the  yellow  room,  it's  10  minutes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So,  we  add  those  three  numbers  on  to  green  room,  yellow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

room,  and  blue  room  people.  And  we  get  a  number. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that  number  in  individual  cases  will  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong,  but  that's  what  averaging  is  about.  And  if  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  no  other  proof  in  the  case,  well,  is  that  good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough? 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  let  me  ­­ let  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  that  question  in  this  way  because  I  do  want 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­

 

            

issue? 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  that  the  substantive 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  FREDERICK:  I  ­­ I  think  it  is  not.

MR.  FREDERICK:  Because  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Then  skip  it. 

  

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Because  we  had  additional 

  

 

 

 

 

information  testimony. 

 

            

And  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  on  the  variations,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  important  to  take  into  account  what  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  going  on  with  these  Dr.  Mericle  observations  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  30  seconds  versus  the  10  minutes.  What  Dr.  Mericle 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

observed  using  the  videotape  in  the  men's  locker  room 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  that  some  of  the  men  put  their  gear  on  in  the  locker 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

room,  and  then  they  went  down  to  the  line.  That  might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  them  10  minutes  to  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Some  of  the  men  put  on  part  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equipment,  and  then  they  carried  the  rest.  And  they  put 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  on  while  they  were  walking  to  the  production  line  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while  they  were  on  the  production  line  itself.  And  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  not  counted. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  I  suppose  some 

   

  

 

 

 

of  them  like  to  chat  while  they're  putting  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equipment,  and  others  are  more  down  to,  you  know,  let's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  this  on  as  quickly  as  possible.  And  ­­ and  some  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  have  different  sorts  of  jobs  that  require  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorts  of  equipment.

MR.  FREDERICK:  And  that's  what  the  district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court  rejected.  The  district  court  said  there  was  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  to  support  that,  that  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  there  was  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  to  support  that  they'd  have  different  equipment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  put  on? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  It  was  minimal.  What  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

district  court  and  what  the  court  of  appeals  found  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  differences  in  equipment  were  ­­ were  minimal, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  they  would  not  drive  the  difference.  And  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr.  Mericle  testified  ­­ and  this  is  at  340­ ­­ 346  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

350  of  the  Joint  Appendix  ­­ he  explained  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

donning  and  doffing  was  occurring  in  different  places 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  what  they  argued  about  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30­second­to­10­minute  difference  was,  in  fact,  not  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accurate  depiction  of  the  actual  time  that  it  took. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  the  time  clustered  around  the  average;  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  testimony.  And  that  if  you  took  into  account  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  they  might  be  doing  it  in  different  places, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  then  see  why  averaging  works. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  reason  averaging  works  is  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  workers  were  rotating  among  different  assignments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Some  of  them  might  start  the  day  in  a  non­knife 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity,  and  so  putting  on  all  the  protective  gear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  they  started  their  shift  didn't  make  sense.  They

would  carry  it  to  the  production  line.  They  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pulled  off  the  production  line,  told  you're  going  to  be

their  gear  on  at  that  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  when  Dr.  Mericle  is  observing  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

locker  room  how  long  it  takes  for  people  to  put  their

he's  not  counting  ­­ he's  not  taking  into  account  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variations  in  the  work  style  mandated  by  the  company.

your  submission  is  that,  in  fact  ­­ well,  what  ­­ what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  18  and  21?  You  must  have  thought  there  was  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference. 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  they  were  walking  to  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  part,  and  they  were  divided  into  ­­ they  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  additional  equipment  in  that  one.  But  we  divided 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  by  departments,  and  we  can  identify  the  employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  two  different  departments. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­ so  the

the  clean­up  people  are  going  to  slaughter  the  hogs  at

MR.  FREDERICK:  There  was  rotation  among  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  their  own  witness  testified  to  that  effect.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  JA  236.  He  said  they  rotated  quite  frequently.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  he  was  explaining  was  that  you  might  start  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  assignment  ­­ and  ­­ and  Dr.  Mericle  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking  a  two­day  snapshot,  right?  He's  looking  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

video.  And  the  ­­ the  workers  themselves  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

testifying  that  the  actual  donning  and  doffing  basically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clustered  around  the  average.  That's  what  Dr.  Mericle 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

observed. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­ so  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

should  ­­ again,  there's  a  ­­ a  basic  issue  that's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

presented,  but  you're  saying  in  addition  to  avoiding  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  the  objection  is  their  lack  of  objections  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all,  we  should  not  be  reaching  the  substantive  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because,  in  fact,  there  was  no  variation  in  the  time?

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  it  an  argument  that  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employer  wants  to  be  quite  conscientious  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complying  with  FLSA,  the  employer  has  to  take  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

averages.  It  has  to  say,  we're  going  to  give  X  minutes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  donning  and  doffing  on  this  line,  X  minutes  ­­ and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  second  part  of  that  question  is,  how  much  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  turns  on  the  fact  that  the  employer  did  not  keep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate  records? 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  had  this  ­­ had  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  kept  records,  this  would  be  a  completely  easy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  for  class  certification  purposes  because  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single  issue  would  be  done  by  common  proof. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Can  the  employer  be 

  

 

 

 

 

charged  with  not  keeping  adequate  records  by  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  every  single  person  every  part  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person's  day?  You  spend  four  hours  on  this  line,  four 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hours  on  that  line.  You  have  to  ­­ you  have  to  put  on  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  kind  of  doffing. 

 

 

 

            

Can  the  employer  really  keep  records  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  single  employee? 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  It's  actually  simpler  than 

  

 

 

 

 

that,  Justice  Kennedy.  It's  where  you  place  the  time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clock.  Had  they  put  the  punch  clock  right  outside  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

locker  room  so  that  the  workers,  as  soon  as  they  went  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  locker  room,  punched  in,  this  problem  would  have

in  the  locker  room,  if  they  punched  in,  the  company  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied  the  FLSA  and  this  problem  goes  away.  And  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  is,  is  the  walking  and  donning  and  doffing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work?  And  that's  what  the  trial  was  all  about. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Many  workers  put  on  gear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

other  than  sanitary  gear.  What  you  say  is  true:  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanitary  gear  is  the  same  for  all  workers.  But  some  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  wear,  what,  chain  mail  to  protect  them  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knives,  right?  And  ­­ and  some  of  them  wear  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protective  gear.  And  that's  what  is  claimed  to  create 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  discrepancy. 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Right.  But  if  you  take  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

sanitary  ­­ I'm  just  saying,  if  you  ­­ for  the  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  commonality  and  predominance,  which  I'm  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  the  first  question  ­­ the  sanitary  gear  is  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  for  everybody.  The  walking  is  all  the  same  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody. 

            

And  then  the  question  is,  can  you  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

averaging  because  of  the  peculiarities  of  the  fact  that

the  doffing  of  this  ­­ basically,  the  same  gear  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurring  in  three  different  places:  in  the  locker 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

room,  walking  down  to  the  production  line,  and  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

production  line  itself. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  think 

    

   

 

 

 

your  ­­ your  friend  will  agree  that  it's  basically  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  gear. 

 

            

that. 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  I  wouldn't  expect 

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  think  that's  his  ­­ his 

    

 

 

 

 

 

point,  that  it's  quite  different  gear. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  But  the  ­­ what  the  district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  found,  and  they  didn't  show  ­­ look,  we're  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  a  difference  between  a  Kevlar  belly  guard  and  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Plexiglas  belly  guard  or  a  mesh,  metal  mesh  belly  guard. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  talking  about  the  same  basic  kinds  of  gear.  We're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  different  kinds  of  gloves. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  those  variations  were  presented  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury,  found  to  be  minor.  And  the  district  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded  that  they  were  minor  differences. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  the  difference  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  not  whether  they're  ­­ whether  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protective  gear  is  different  from  another,  but  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  protective  gear  is  different  from  sanitary  gear. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  question.

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  the  question  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Wasn't  there  ­­ wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

there  ­­ for  all  of  the  workers,  there  was  certain  basic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equipment.  There  was  basic  sanitary  gear,  but  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  basic  protective  gear.  So  the  only  difference 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  up  with  the  protective  gear  for  the  knife  weld. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  ­­ that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  basic  protective  gear 

  

 

 

 

 

was  the  same  for  everybody. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  correct.  And  the 

  

  

 

 

 

knife  issue  was  solved  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  was  that?  What  was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  basic  protective  gear  that  everybody  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Hard  hats,  ear  plugs  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ear  muffs,  and  boots. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Thank  you,  Justice  Ginsburg.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  ­­ but  the  knife 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wielders  had  a  lot  more  than  that. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Right.  But  the  point  was, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  that  if  you  were  on  knife  duty  at  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  point  in  time,  you  were  going  to  rotate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frequently  during  the  course  of  a  day  or  from  one  day  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  next,  and  so  you  were  charged  always  to  have  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gear  ready  to  be  put  on  if  you  were  put  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knife­wielding  capacity. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  seems  ­­ it  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  might  concede  that  if  this  were  simply  a  class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  under  23,  that  these  problems  might  be  a  barrier 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  certification,  but  that  under  Mt.  Clemens  you  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  rule;  is  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  We  certainly  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  that  correct? 

  

 

 

 

Do  you  ­­ do  you  concede  that  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong  possibility  you  might  not  be  ­­ have  this  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certified  under  section  ­­ under  Rule  23,  absent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mt.  Clemens?

think  Mt.  Clemens  answers  the  question  in  this  case.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that,  given  the  way  the  evidence  came  in,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

averages  here  are  reasonable  ones.  So  even  if  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  special  Mt.  Clemens  rule  where  there's  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden­shifting  framework,  the  answer  should  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  So  that's  exactly, 

  

  

 

 

 

perhaps,  what  I  ­­ I  read  the  question,  the  first 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

question.  I'm  taking  it  literally.  It  said,  "Whether 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

differences  among  individual  class  members  may  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignored,  liability  and  damages  will  be  determined  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statistical  techniques  that  assume  everyone  is  like  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

average." 

            

Now,  I  thought  the  answer  to  that  question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  yes,  and  it  depends,  of  course;  you  have  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable.  I  mean,  that's  why  you  use  the  four  rooms. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  don't  know  everybody  in  the  room.  What  we  do  is  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  an  average  in  the  room.  If  it's  a  good  statistical 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

average,  why  not? 

 

 

            

Now,  I  want  ­­ I  don't  want  you  to  agree 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

with  that  if  that  isn't  the  law,  but  I  don't  see  why  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't. 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  Justice  Breyer,  we  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

agree  with  that  position,  but  we  also  agree  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy  that,  because  of  the  Mt.  Clemens

framework  overlay  for  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act,  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  easier  case  than  a  case  in  which  there  was  not  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  law  difference.  Because  if  you  were  to  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  individual  and  you  were  to  use  the  same  evidence,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  representative  proof;  you'd  have  the  same

arguments  about  Dr.  Mericle  really  are  merits  questions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  not  class­certifying  questions. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Frederick,  I  ­­ I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

not  sure  that  you've  answered  the  ­­ the  two  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  that  I  see  my  colleagues  asking,  okay? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  whether  you're  a  knife 

   

 

 

 

 

wielder  or  not,  if  you  are  assigned  to  ­­ to  bear  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knife  during  the  day,  you're  going  to  be  paid  for  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  anyway  because  you're  on  the  start­to­end  day, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay?  So  you're  not  going  to  get  FSLA  for  that.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  only  the  people  who  start  out  the  day  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  to  don  those  outfits. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  actually,

MR.  FREDERICK:  ­­ if  ­­ if  the  worker,

account  the  walking  time.  So  he's  not  going  to  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit  for  the  fact  that  he's  doing  work  by  putting  on

clarify  something  before  your  time  runs  out,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ it's  unclear  to  me  from  what  you've  said  in  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.

for  employees  on  the  processing  floor  and  another  figure

you  to  have  said  this  morning,  all  of  the  employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically  do  both  of  those  tasks  and  spend  an  equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount  of  time  on  them,  so  they  can  all  be  considered

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  that  was  the

require  knife  and  some  which  didn't.  And  it  was  within 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  department  that  the  averages  that  were  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

observed  we  believe  are  fair  averages,  in  light  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  we're  looking  back  in  time,  and  we're  trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  recreate  what  happened  in  a  ­­ in  a  three­year  period 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  you  know,  was  ­­ where  there  are  no  records. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  within  the  department,  what  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  was  that  there  was  consistency,  and  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differences  were  minimal.  The  reason  why  there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­minute  difference  is  because  one  is  longer.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  longer  distance  for  walking  to  get  to  it,  and  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  you  know,  more  to  be  done.  But  I  want  to  make  clear 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  ­­ we  broke  this  down  into  the  two  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

departments  because  we  could  discern  those.  But  I  would

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Let  me  ask  you  this:  If 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  is  writing  an  opinion  of  reaching  the  result 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  want,  what  is  the  standard  we  put?  Representative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence?  Average  evidence  of  injury  is  sufficient  if? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  ­­ what  do  we  write? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  I  think  what  you  write, 

    

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy,  is  that  in  this  context,  where  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  an  expert  who  said  that  the  averages  ­­ they

doffing  that  is  contested  here  is  occurring  in  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  places,  it's  fair  to  treat  the  employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  FLSA  is  a  remedial  statute  that  is  designed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  protect  workers  who  can't  keep  these  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

records.  That's  why  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  ­­ that's  a  little 

   

  

 

 

 

bit  too  specific  for  the  broad  standard  that  I'm  looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for.  An  average  is  possible  if  what,  there's  no  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  do  it?  If  it's  an  FSLA  case  and  has  a  special 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy?  Neither  of  those  seem  quite  satisfactory  to  me. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  I  think  every  case  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  different,  as  we  would  all  candidly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize,  and  an  antitrust  case  is  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  a  labor  case.  And  that  will  be  different 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  ­­ I  think  you  do  have  to  look  at  the  substantive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  in  which  the  averaging  is  going  to  occur  so  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  deviations  at  least  are  explicable.  Here  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Don't  you  also  have  to  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  jury  accepted  the  averaging?  And  that  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem  to  have  happened  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  When  the  jury  comes  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  ­­ with  less  than  half  of  ­­ of  what  the  averaging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  produced,  how  can  we  say  that  there  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

averaging?

MR.  FREDERICK:  The  averaging,  I  think  you 

   

  

 

 

 

should  infer  from  the  jury's  award  of  damages  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injured  ­­ and  it  was  instructed  not  to  give  damages  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  uninjured  workers,  and  was  faithfully  charged  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  The  fact  that  it  awards  a  lesser  amount  may  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  its  own  doubts  about  the  number  of  minutes  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  quantity. 

 

            

But  those  kinds  of  calculations,  I  submit, 

   

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia,  we  have  always  deferred  to  juries  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  these  kinds  of  damages  are  calculated.

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                 

SUPPORTING  RESPONDENTS 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Justice  Kennedy,  I'd  like  to  begin  with  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  the  proper  standard  to  apply  here.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  thinks  it's  the  standard  that  the  jury  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed  on,  and  this  appears  at  JA  471 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  472. 

 

            

The  jury  was  told  in  this  case 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  only  rely  on  representative  evidence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they 

 

if  all  of  the 

 

 

 

employees  performed  substantially  similar 
 

 

 

 

activities, 

and  that  substantial  similarity  is  what  we 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  is  the

proper  standard  to  determine  whether  an  inference  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  just  and  reasonable. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Do  you  think  ­­ how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  you  know  they  relied  on  the  representative  evidence? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  number  was  ­­ was  more  than  50  percent  of  what  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked.  The  expert  was  cross­examined.  We  don't  know, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  example  ­­ they  rejected  the  18  minutes  but  accepted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  21  minutes.  The  fact  that  the  jury  did  not  give  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  damages  sought  seems  to  me  to  call  into  question  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significance  of  the  statistics. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Well,  I  think  it  calls  into 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question  whether  the  jury  agreed  with  the  actual  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estimates,  but  I  don't  think  it  undermines  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  that  they  found  that  there  was  proper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representative  evidence  here  because  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed  that  they  couldn't  award  a  recovery  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  until  all  of  the  nontestifying  employees,  unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  convinced  that  they  all  performed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantially  similar  activities. 

 

 

            

So  I  think  we  have  to  infer  that  the  jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  that  all  of  these  activities  were  similar,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  not  material  differences  of  the  kind  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Phillips  has  referred  to  today,  because  the  jury  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed  that  that  was  the  only  way  they  could  award

liability. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  they  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  saw  the  evidence  on  which  the  calculations  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based,  right? 

 

            

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  They  saw  the  donning 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  doffing  of  the  sanitary  gear  and  the  protective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gear.  Couldn't  they  have  made  judgments  based  on  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  differences  to  reject  some  of  the  representative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statistics? 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  I  don't  think  they  would  have 

    

 

 

 

 

 

had  any  basis  to  do  so.  And  at  the  end  of  the  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction  on  representative  evidence,  which  was  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction  that  Tyson  requested,  the  jury  was  told, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote,  "The  representative  evidence,  as  a  whole,  must 

   

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrate  that  the  class  is  entitled  to  recover.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  that  there  was  an  ample  evidentiary  basis  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  jury  to  conclude  that  there  weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  ­­ substantial  dissimilarity  among  the  tasks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  being  performed  in  these  donning  and  doffing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activities. 

            

It's  useful,  I  think,  to  review  that  record 

   

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  For  example,  Dr.  Mericle  testified  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  clustered  around  the  averages.  He  had  744 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

videotaped  observations.  As  well,  there  was  the

testimony  that  employees  frequently  rotated  between 

 

 

 

 

 

positions,  including  between  those  jobs  that  used  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knife  and  those  that  didn't.  The  employees  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

testified  at  trial  had  times  that  came  in  very  close  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr.  Mericle's  averages. 

 

 

            

And  I'll  just  refer  you  to  Mr.  Logan,  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testified  at  JA  260  and  265,  17  to  19  minutes.  Mr. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bulbaris  said  18  to  22  minutes.  Mr.  Montes  said  around 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  minutes.  As  well,  Tyson  itself  didn't  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  these  material  variations  when  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculating  the  K­Code  time  using  a  study  that  was  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar  to  the  study  that  Dr.  Mericle  employed  here  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  essentially  the  same  methodology. 

 

 

 

 

            

In  that  circumstance,  Tyson  thought  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  appropriate  to  treat  all  employees  in  a  uniform 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way. 

            

So  I  think  it's  critical  here  that  we  have  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  determination  upon  a  proper  instruction  about 

   

 

 

 

 

representative  evidence  that  there  weren't  these  kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  dissimilarities  that  would  warrant  ­­

MS.  PRELOGAR:  No.  My  understanding  is  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

there  were  differences  in  what  you  were  paid  depending 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  your  position. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  yet,  your  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

both  you  and  your  ­­ your  friend  are  telling  me  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  we  shouldn't  treat  those  jobs  differently  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  often  switched  back  and  forth. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Well,  the  jury  concluded  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  those  jobs  didn't  require  materially  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gear.  So  I  think  that  the  pay  rate,  which  was  evident 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  Tyson's  own  records  here  and  could  be  calculated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  these  kind  of  mechanical  damages  calculations, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  signal  that  there  was  different  gear.  It  might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signal  that  the  work  being  performed  on  the  job  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat  different  and  required  different  levels  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

skill. 

            

But  I  think  it's  clear,  based  on  the  jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict  in  this  case,  the  plaintiffs  were  able  to  prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  claim  with  class­wide  evidence.  And  at  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

juncture,  it's  something  of  the  reverse  of  what  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  confronted  in  other  cases,  where  the  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  that  sometimes  the  certification  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

overlaps  with  the  merits  of  the  claim,  and  you  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider  at  the  outset  whether  the  plaintiffs  will  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  prove  their  claim  with  class­wide  proof.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Do  you  concede  that  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  were  a  Rule  23  action  and  the  FSLA  were  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  that  it  would  be  a  much  closer,  much  more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  case? 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Yes.  I  think  it  would  be 

    

  

 

 

 

 

much  closer.  And  ­­ and  here,  I  think  that  this  really 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets  to  the  point  that  the  dispute  here  doesn't  turn  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  freestanding  Rule  23  requirement.  It  stands  on  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ it  turns  on  the  Mt.  Clemens  standard.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mt.  Clemens  does  adopt  a  special  rule  tailored  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  there  is  a  recordkeeping  violation  in  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  that  prevents  the  employees  from  being  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove  their  claims  with  more  precise  evidence.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  ­­ you  agree  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  an  extension  of  Mt.  Clemens  to  apply  it  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability  stage  as  opposed  to  the  damages  stage,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  I  think  there's  a  way  to  read 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Mt.  Clemens  where  the  ­­ this  ­­ where  it  would  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  extension.  But  to  the  extent  that  you  think  it  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be,  we  think  it's  a  perfectly  logical  one  and  one  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  rationale  in  Mt.  Clemens. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mt.  Clemens  said  that  when  the  recordkeeping 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  prevents  a  determination  of  the  amount  of  time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

spent  on  these  activities,  then  you  should  be  able  to

come  forward  with  a  just  and  reasonable  inference  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  put  the  burden  on  the  employees  to  prove  that  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  precision. 

 

            

And  when  that  exact  same  fact  is  relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability  insofar  as  it's  necessary  to  prove  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  is  pushed  over  the  40­hour­per­week  threshold, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  we  think  that  all  of  the  rationales  that  animated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mt.  Clemens  would  equally  apply  to  the  determination  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  particular  fact  in  that  context. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  we  think  the  Mt.  Clemens  itself  signaled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  might  be  an  appropriate  determination  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability  phase  because  it  recognized  at  the  outset  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  burden  of  proving  that  you  have  performed  work  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  you  were  not  properly  compensated  shouldn't  be  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible  burden.  That  was  the  language  that  was  used 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  opinion.  And  so  I  think  that  whether  or  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mt.  Clemens  decided  it,  certainly  it  ­­ it's  true  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  should  be  applied  in  this  context  to  the  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  was  relevant  there.

I'm  using  a  hypothetical  ­­ there's  10  minutes  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

overtime.  And  the  figure  that  comes  out  with  10  minutes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  overtime  is  a  million  dollars.  Now  the  jury  comes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  with  half  a  million  dollars. 

   

 

 

 

            

How  do  you  know  that  what  they  said  is  ­­ I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half  the  time  ­­ five  minutes,  or  the  jury  said,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  eight  minutes  or  ­­ for  slaughterhouse  and  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  production  line  people.  So  it  averages  out  to  five 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now,  okay? 

 

            

How  do  we  know  what  ­­ how  the  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculated  that  half  million? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  The  answer  is  that  we  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  for  sure,  Justice  Sotomayor. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  what  my 

  

 

 

 

colleagues  are  saying.  So  the  question  is,  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

adversary  is  claiming  that  there  might  be  some  people  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  three­minute  side  who  are  going  to  come  and  collect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  pro  rata  share  who  really  weren't  injured  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  worked  39  hours  and  57  ­­ 56  minutes,  something  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  So  why  is  it  that  it's  fair  to  distribute  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  award  pro  rata? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Well,  I  think  that  it's  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

clear  yet  exactly  how  the  award  will  be  allocated,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  will  be  left  to  the  district  court's  discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  case  returns  for  allocation.

At  that  point,  Tyson  can  come  in  and  it  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  these  arguments  if  it  thinks  it's  unfair.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  will  be  well­positioned  to  determine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  Tyson  waived  the  claims  by  actually  asking  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lump  sum  verdict  here  and  whether  Tyson  even  has  a  stake 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  issue  given  that  its  own  liability  won't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increase. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why  would  ­­ why  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Tyson's  care?  They  have  to  pay  the  same  amount  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars. 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Exactly,  Justice  Ginsburg, 

  

 

 

 

and  I  think  that  that  shows  that  Tyson  might  not  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  requisite  stake  here  to  be  able  to  challenge  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allocation. 

            

But  I  think  the  overarching  point  to  keep  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind  is  that  the  ­­ the  issues  with  allocating  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award  were  not  the  inevitable  result  of  the  class  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism.  They  don't  reveal  some  defect  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism. 

            

There  were  any  number  of  ways  to  account  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  problem.  The  trial  could  have  been  bifurcated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  liability  and  damages,  as  Justice  Kagan  noted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  would  have  solved  this  problem  entirely,  but  Tyson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed  it.  Or  Tyson  could  have  sought  judgment  against 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  212  class  members  who  had  no  right  to  recover  under

the  plaintiffs'  evidence.  It  didn't  do  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Tyson  could  have  asked  for  a  special  verdict 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  have  allocated  the  damages  by  the  jury;  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead,  it  asked  for  a  lump  sum  verdict.  Or  it  could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  asked  for  the  class  definition  to  be  altered  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  to  exclude  those  individuals  who  weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working  the  requisite  number  of  times. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Ultimately,  there  are  any  number  of 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanisms  that  could  account  for  this  issue,  and  none 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  them  demonstrate  that  this  class  action  was  improper. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  went  unutilized  only  because  of  Tyson's  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  strategy  here. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  happened  to  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  action?  I  mean,  the  government  started 

    

 

 

 

 

 

this  against  Tyson's  or  its  predecessor  and  got  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunction.  And  then  the  government  said  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

solution  that  the  ­­ the  K  ­­ whatever  it  was  ­­ that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tyson's  came  up  with  wasn't  good  enough.  And  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing.  What  happened  to  the  government's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Well,  ultimately,  the 

  

 

 

 

government  ended  up  settling  the  claims  in  that  prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  action.  But  then  the  ­­ the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued  an  opinion  letter  to  the  industry,  saying  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  clear  that  you  had  to  pay  for  actual  time  worked.

But  it  is  the  Department  of  Labor's  position 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  that  Tyson  was  in  violation  of  the  FLSA,  both  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  keeping  the  actual  records  and  by  not  fully

believes  that  certain  activities  need  not  be  counted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  FLSA?  So  is  the  employer  ­­ it  may  be  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employer  is  stuck  with  the  choice  that  it  makes,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  judgment  it  makes. 

 

 

 

            

But  is  it  supposed  to  keep  two  sets  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

records  so  the  amount  of  time  that  it  thinks  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  is  entitled  to  compensation  for,  and  then  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  amount  of  time,  that  it  might  be  argued  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employee  is  entitled  to  compensation  for? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  PRELOGAR:  Well,  Mt.  Clemens  does  make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  the  employer  is  stuck  with  its  mistake 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  said  even  when  the  failure  to  keep  records

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CARTER  G.  PHILLIPS 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Let  me  answer  Justice  Alito's  point  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ and  the  observation  where  ­­ I  mean,  the  reality 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  is  that  in  the  Reich  litigation,  we  were  told  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  ordinary  sanitary  equipment  was  not  ­­ was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  within  the  donning  and  doffing  requirements,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  a  problem.  And  so  as  a  consequence  of  that, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

frankly,  we  didn't  monitor  this. 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  not  a  complete  defense,  but  it  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

least  explains  the  sort  of  the  equities  of  the  ­­ of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation. 

            

Second,  my  good  friend  tells  you  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  here  found  that  all  of  these  things  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  similar.  The  reality  is,  is  that  at  Pet.  App.  87A,

very  big  factual  differences  among  all  these  employees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  basic  ­­ and  the  only  reason  the  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  agree  to  certify  it  at  that  time  was  because  he

in  this  litigation,  and  the  reality  is  he  made  a  mistake

class,  based  on  more  and  more  information  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inadequacies  of  Mericle's  evidence  as  applied  by  Fox,

Justice  Kennedy,  to  answer  your  question 

 

 

 

 

 

about  how  do  you  write  an  opinion,  and  when  is  it  close 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough?  Averaging  is  a  permissible  way  of  going  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  when  the  evidence  is  clear  that  the  ­­ that  the  basic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  is  homogenous,  and  that  would  have  been  true 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  walking  time.  There  was  ­­ there  was  literally  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  ­­

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Basic  activity  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Homogenous. 

  

 

And  here  when  you're  talking  about  30 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seconds  and  10  minutes,  and  we're  talking  about  wildly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  activities,  what  you  can't  do  is  just  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  okay,  we're  just  going  to  patch  over  all  that  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

average  it. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Didn't  they  standardize 

  

 

 

 

walking  time?  That's  what  I  thought  they  used. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Yes,  and  that's  why  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  There's  a  standardized 

   

  

 

walking  time  because  some  people  are  faster  than  others, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct? 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right.  But  my  point  here  is, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  in  general,  everybody  agrees  that's  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  proceed.  That's  my  point.  Here  we're  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  homogenized  because  there  are  vast 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differences,  and  the  evidence  is  absolutely  unsalable  on

that. 

            

And  with  respect  to  Mt.  Clemens,  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  place,  I  ­­ I  don't  think  Mt.  Clemens  should  be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

extended  to  ­­ to  make  the  fair  and  reasonable  inference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  of  the  presumption  apply  at  the  liability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phase,  and  I  think  the  court  was  extremely  clear  in  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanting  to  go  down  that  path. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  second,  even  if  you  thought  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption  should  be  applied  here,  I  would  argue  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Mericle's  evidence,  as  ­­ as,  you  know,  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross­examination  and  examination  of  others, 

 

 

 

 

demonstrates  that  this  is  not  a  fair  and  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

inference.  And  on  that  score,  it  seems  to  me  that  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  two  quotations  I  would  offer  up. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

One  comes  from  this  Court's  decision  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wal­Mart,  "when  an  expert's  testimony  does  nothing  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advance  a  party's  case,  the  Court  can  safely  disregard 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  he  says." 

 

 

            

And  then  what  Judge  Posner  said  in  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar  FLSA  case,  "What  cannot  support  an  inference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  work  time  of  thousands  of  employees  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  a  small,  unrepresentative  sample  of  them," 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  is  precisely  what  we  have  in  this  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

With  respect  to  remand,  we  would  be  happy

for  a  remand  to  ­­ for  allocation  if  that's  permissible, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  as  I  read,  the  final  judgment  of  the  district  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  judgment  of  about  $6  million  to  these  named 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs,  and  that  was  affirmed.  There  is  nothing  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  about  how  this  is  going  to  be  allocated  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  circumstances.  So  if  the  Court  believes  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  to  be  a  separate  proceeding  of  allocation,  the  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hopefully  would  order  that,  although  I  think  there  is  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  fundamental  decision  the  Court  would  have  to  reach. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  finally,  with  respect  to  who  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  burden  of  dealing  with  this  problem,  it  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs'  burden  to  sustain  the  justification  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  all  throughout  the  proceedings  until  a  final 

   

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  is  entered.  And  we  came  to  the  court  four 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  asking  them  not  to  certify  this.  So  to  come  back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  at  the  end  and  say,  well,  since  we  were  able  to  try 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  without  any  ability  to  put  forward  any  of  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  defenses  with  respect  to  any  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  employees,  except  for  the  four  who  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testified,  is  exactly  what  this  Court  said  in  Wal­Mart 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Comcast  is  an  impermissible  way  to  define  the  class. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Court  should  reverse  in  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declare  the  class  decertified. 

 

 

 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  thank  you.
