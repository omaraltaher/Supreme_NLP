CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, counsel, we're 

(11:18 a.m.) 

still here. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I'm very glad, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And we’ll hear 

argument in Case 08-1529, Hui v. Castaneda. 

Ms. Goldenberg. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

In section 233(a), Congress extended an 

absolute immunity to officers and employees of the 

Public Health Service.  That provision, reflecting 

Congress's policy judgment that the immunity was 

necessary to revitalize the Public Health Service, makes 

a claim against the United States under the Federal Tort 

Claims Act the exclusive remedy for injury or death 

resulting from the performance of medical or related 

functions and precludes any other civil action or 

proceeding against the individuals by reason of the same 

subject matter. 

Without grappling with the language of 

3

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

section 233(a), Respondents have tried in a number of 

different ways to imply a limitation into the test for 

constitutional claims, but none of those arguments 

creates any ambiguity in the statute, for three reasons. 

First, the Bivens exception, found in the 

Westfall Act itself, applies only to the immunity set 

forth in the Westfall Act and says nothing about the 

scope of the entirely separate and distinct immunity set 

forth in section 233. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What are the immunities 

set forth in the Westfall Act?  I thought that they 

were -- they applied to all Federal employees? 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor, that's 

correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Including the Public 

Health Service. 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, that's correct. 

Public Health Service employees can take advantage both 

of the immunities set forth in the Westfall Act and also 

of the separate, preexisting, more specific immunity that’s 

afforded to them by section 233(a). 

And this Court's decision in Smith, I think, 

made clear that those two immunities can coexist.  There’s 

no conflict between them.  And what this Court said in 

Smith is that the Westfall Act immunity adds to the

prior immunity, and employees can take advantage of both 

of them. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, our job is to 

determine Congress's intent when it passed 233(a).  What 

we do know is that there was no Bivens immunity at the 

time; the FTCA had only a limited application under 

certain driver-related accidents.  So we really don't 

have anything to tell us, because they didn't even know 

that there was a constitutional claim that could be 

raised, what they would have intended or not intended. 

And I thought that Justice Ginsburg's point 

would be that the Westfall Act tells us what they 

intended, because by its nature it applied to all 

employees and didn't differentiate among them, and 

copied 233's immunity, so that one can look at it and 

say, ah, that speaks of Congress's intent. 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, certainly it's true 

that when Congress enacted the Westfall Act it could 

have broadly said, for instance, notwithstanding any 

other provision of law, no Federal employee shall assert 

a statutory immunity to constitutional claims.  But it 

didn't do that.  It did something much more narrow than 

that, which is that what it said was in section 

2679(b)(2), paragraph (1) -- the immunity for Federal 

employees that was just set forth shall not apply to

constitutional claims.  And that’s --

Official 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any other Act 

besides 233(a) that is similar --

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that gives separate 

immunity?  Which are those? 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  There are a number of them, 

Your Honor.  Most of them apply to Federal medical 

workers, although not all of them.  There is 10 U.S.C. 

section 1089, the Gonzalez Act, which is discussed in 

our brief and in the government's brief, which applies 

to Army doctors.  There are statutes applying to NASA 

doctors, to Veterans Administration doctors, to certain 

medical volunteers. 

So there are a number of these statutes 

passed over a period of several decades.  But in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it seems to me that, 

quite apart from the Westfall Act, there’s a more --

more basic answer that you would make to Justice 

Sotomayor's question.  And that is, because the nature 

of immunity clauses are to make the employees secure 

against unforeseen causes of action as well as foreseen. 

I think that's a principled answer you could make. 

If I made that answer, do you have authority 

I could cite for that proposition?

Official 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think that this 

Court has, you know, broadly speaking, in talking about 

judicially created immunities -- that immunity is for 

hard cases as well as easy cases.  And the Van de Kamp 

decision that this Court recently issued with respect to 

judicial immunity I think says --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay. 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- something along those 

lines. 

But I think it's true, certainly, that --

it's true that Congress, when it passed section 233, 

didn't know for sure that there was going to be a Bivens 

cause of action that was going to be allowed.  But it 

spoke very broadly.  It said "any other civil action or 

proceeding."  And when it did that, it surely meant 

civil actions or proceedings that were created by the 

courts at some later point in time as well as those that 

existed at the time. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If we limit it, then 

Congress would have to reenact a statute every time 

there was some new cause of action? 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Exactly, Your Honor.  And I 

think the problem with the interpretation that makes the 

interpretation of the statute depend on the timing of 

the Bivens decision is pointed up by two different 

7

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

statutory provisions and the odd results that you would 

have. 

One is that the Gonzalez Act, which I 

referred to earlier -- it’s 10 U.S.C. section 1089 --

was enacted in 1976, it has immunity-conferring language 

that’s extremely similar to the immunity-conferring 

language of section 233(a).  In fact, we know that when 

Congress enacted the Gonzalez Act, it looked at and 

thought about section 233(a), and yet if it mattered 

whether Bivens had yet been decided, the Gonzalez Act 

would bar Bivens claims, but 233(a) wouldn't, even though 

you can't make that kind of distinction based on their text. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, I don't look to 

see what Congress intended.  I look to see what the 

statute says.  I don't know that we -- we -- we 

psychoanalyze the text of a statute on the basis of what 

the Congress at that time knew.  The text says what it 

says. 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor, I agree. 

And the text here is very broad and very clear that it's 

any other civil action or proceeding that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That’s what it says. 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- that results from the same 

subject matter.  And I think one thing that's important 

is that "subject matter" here clearly means the same set

of facts or the same set of circumstances. 

So that, it -- it's not the case that you 

only get immunity where your cause of action is somehow 

similar to the cause of action you have under the FTCA. 

If you -- you get immunity if you have any claim against 

the individuals that comes out of the -- the same set of 

facts, even if it were true that there was some 

requirement of an FTCA remedy, which we don't believe 

there is. 

And what’s absolutely clear here as well is 

that Respondents do have an FTCA remedy against the 

United States.  They have brought an FTCA claim against 

the United States.  The United States has admitted 

liability on that claim.  That’s found at page 328 of 

the Joint Appendix.  And so the question now is, what 

damages will the Respondents recover from the United 

States?  And -- and in that setting, most certainly the 

claim against the individuals is barred by section 

233(a). 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would you comment on --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that's a -- there’s 

a ceiling, because the Tort Claims Act refers to the law 

of the place where the act or omission occurred.  In 

this case it's California?

California law is what's been discussed in the briefs. 

I understand that it's possible that Respondents might 

argue that some of the acts or omissions here took place 

in the District of Columbia, because that's the place 

where some of the decisions were made about the 

treatment authorization requests.  But California law is 

what has been asserted so far in the case.  That's true. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Which would put a lid 

on the damages, since this is a death case, of 250,000? 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Not exactly, Your Honor. 

There is no limit whatsoever on the economic damages in 

a case arising out of professional negligence.  There is, 

under California law, a $250,000 cap on noneconomic 

damages.  As we have said in our briefs, we think that 

in this case, where Respondents have argued intentional 

wrongdoing by the United States, for which they can 

recover under the FTCA, if they can prove that something 

more than negligence was at issue, then it's possible 

under California law, although California law is not 

entirely clear, that they could actually exceed that 

$250,000 cap for noneconomic damages. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you to comment 

on the fact that, in the Carlson case, apparently the 

assistant surgeon general was, in fact, a defendant, and 

the government failed to make this defense?

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Your Honor, I'm not certain 

why the defense wasn't raised in the case. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But if you’re right, 

they should have. 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, not necessarily, 

because there may be factual issues that -- that we're 

not now aware of.  In other words, it may be that the 

government concluded that, despite what was alleged in 

the complaint, that when that particular individual took 

the acts complained of, he wasn't somehow wearing his 

PHS hat, he was operating in some other capacity.  So --

but that’s obviously just speculation. 

And it’s -- it is not clear why that defense 

wasn't raised.  What is clear is that it was not raised 

and, not only that, but in the court of appeals and in 

this Court, there is no reference made to the fact that he's 

in the Public Health Service. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Now, that’s kind of 

interesting that apparently the government was not 

aware of the breadth of the position they’re --

you’re now taking. 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I'm not sure that’s 

necessarily the conclusion I would draw.  As I say, 

there may be factual reasons why it wasn't raised. 

There may be strategic reasons why it wasn't raised.

It's hard to speculate on that so long after the --

after the fact. 

But what is clear from Carlson is that the 

way that section 233(a) did arise in that case is that 

the Court used it as a specific example to contrast with 

the FTCA itself, and said that section 233 was a place 

where Congress had made known explicitly its intent that 

the FTCA be the exclusive remedy and that other remedies 

be precluded. 

That's the way that 233(a) was argued in 

the briefs in that case, and that's how the Court used 

it.  And that’s obviously extremely supportive of the 

Petitioners’ plea for immunity here. 

This Court has already essentially 

recognized in Carlson, in reasoning in support of its 

holding, that that is the role that 233(a) plays, and the 

Court must have been talking about barring Bivens claims 

because that's what Carlson was about.  So that’s the 

significance of 233(a) in that case. 

The Respondents also -- on a subject we 

haven't touched on yet, I think, look at the title of 

section 233(a) and some of its other subsections, and 

there I think it's clear that the title can't vary the 

clear statutory text in any way.  Even if the title were 

relevant here, it talks about negligence and

malpractice.  And we've cited in our reply brief, at pages 

18 to 19, the authorities showing that when the statute 

was enacted in 1970, malpractice was thought to sweep 

very broadly to cover any bad acts, any malpractice, and 

so it doesn't operate -- the title here can't operate as 

a limitation on the scope of this provision. 

With respect to the history, the one 

other thing that I wanted to point out that I didn't get 

to in my answer before is another odd result that you 

would have, if you looked at when Bivens was decided and 

made that your deciding factor, is that the FTCA's 

judgment bar, at 28 U.S.C. section 2676, which was enacted 

in 1948, which says that when you take a claim against 

the United States under the FTCA all the way to judgment, 

you are barred from raising any other civil action or 

proceeding by reason of the same subject matter.  So 

very similar language to what we have here.  That 

wouldn't bar Bivens claims, even though every court of 

appeals to have looked at the issue has said that it 

does cover Bivens claims in a different sense. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that would bar a 

later Bivens claim.  I assume you could bring a Bivens 

action first, and the bar provision would not apply, 

assuming you can bring the Bivens claim. 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, I think that's right.

But the -- all I'm trying to say is that it's the "any 

other civil action or --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes. 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- proceedings" language in 

the judgment bar.  If you looked at whether Bivens had 

been decided yet, it wouldn't cover Bivens because the 

statute was enacted prior to the time that Bivens was 

decided.  It was enacted in 1948. 

So it's not -- it doesn't make sense to make 

your statutory interpretation, your interpretation of 

those words, hinge on the fact that Bivens had or hadn't 

been decided yet. 

If there are no further questions, I’d 

like to reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 

MR. SHAH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

By its plain terms, section 233(a) precludes 

any civil action against officers and employees of the 

Public Health Service arising out of performance of 

their medical duties.  Instead, it makes an action

against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims 

Act the exclusive remedy for injury arising out of 

PHS-provided care.  Unlike the Westfall Act, section 233 

contains no carve-out for constitutional claims, nor is 

there any textual basis for which to imply one. 

Accordingly, this Court should reverse the 

Ninth Circuit's decision allowing Respondents’ Bivens 

claims against the individual Petitioners on top of 

their FTCA claims against the United States. 

Now, even assuming Congress did not 

specifically have Bivens claims in mind at the time that 

they enacted this statute, that's no reason to limit the 

plain terms of section 233(a).  First, Justice Kennedy, 

going to your question about whether there's authority 

for that proposition that when Congress doesn't 

specifically anticipate a certain set of facts yet the 

plain terms control, that that is the correct result, 

this Court has stated both in the RICO context as well 

as in other contexts that the fact that Congress doesn't 

specifically contemplate application of the statute to 

particular circumstances simply demonstrates the breadth 

of the statute and not any ambiguity.  Those statements 

are set forth on page 15 of our brief, Sedima, Yeskey, 

and others. 

The second point I would make is the best

indication of Congress's broad intent is simply the 

plain terms of the statute.  Congress could have enacted 

a statute that only provided immunity for, say, 

negligent performance of medical duties.  It included no 

such limitation in 233(a).  It could have made the FTCA 

remedy exclusive of, say, only common law causes of 

action or State law causes of action, or even existing 

causes of action.  It did not do that.  It said it is 

the exclusive remedy for any other civil action by 

reason of the same subject matter.  Congress could --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Shah, is that -- is 

that the same -- in all the statutes that Carlson cites 

on page 20, when they say that Congress follows the 

practice of explicitly stating what it means to make the 

FTCA an exclusive remedy, there's this -- the Gonzalez 

Act and there’s 233(a), and then there is the swine flu. 

Are they all -- are all those 

provisions, provisions like 233(a), that say "any civil 

action"? 

MR. SHAH:  Yes, Your Honor, in terms of that 

latter phrasing "exclusive of any other civil action or 

proceeding."  For example, the Gonzalez Act, which is 

reproduced in the gray brief on page 1a of our -- of the 

government's appendix, it uses very similar language. 

It says:  The FTCA remedy shall be exclusive of any

other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same 

subject matter.  That’s identical language to that used 

in 233(a). 

Now, there is a way in which 233(a) is even 

broader than any of those other statutes in its 

description of what type of performance of medical 

duties is covered.  There, there is no modifier of 

negligence or wrongful act or omission.  It simply says: 

Any performance of medical duties is covered. 

In the Gonzalez Act, which we would submit 

has as quite broad language and should have the same 

effect, they at least have a qualifier of negligent or 

wrongful act or omission.  Not that that should create a 

change in result, but it just goes to show the 

incredibly broad language that Congress used to show --

that Congress used in 233(a). 

And I think on the Gonzalez Act point -- and 

Justice Sotomayor, I think this goes to your question 

about whether there are other statutes -- even though 

that Congress may not have contemplated Bivens at the 

time, the Gonzalez Act was passed in 1976, 5 years after 

Bivens had decided, and yet Congress used the identical 

language or nearly identical language as present in 

233(a) in enacting the Gonzalez Act.  Presumably, 

Congress was aware of the potential for Bivens liability

at the time, yet they chose to use the same categorical 

text. 

And in the legislative history of the 

Gonzalez Act, they say they used that text for the 

specific purpose of ensuring total financial immunity --

immunity from total financial liability for DOD and 

armed forces medical personnel. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me how many 

PHS personnel work in settings outside custodial 

settings? 

MR. SHAH:  Outside which? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Custodial settings. 

MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, there's 6,000 

-- approximately 6,000 commissioned officers.  Of those, 

slightly more than 1,000 of the commissioned PHS 

officers work in either the Bureau of Prisons or in ICE 

detention facilities. 

So the remaining 5,000 of the commissioned 

officers may not work in what you would call a strictly 

custodial context.  A bulk -- the majority of them work 

for the Indian Health Service, and that’s true for both 

employees and the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  For the 

Indian --

MR. SHAH:  For the Indian Health Service.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And is there a reason 

Congress would want to immunize PHS personnel against 

Bivens claims in a custodial setting, but not immunize 

Bureau of Prison personnel? 

MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, I think they 

would want to immunize Bureau of Prison personnel.  And, 

in fact, that's where a majority of these types of 

claims come up.  That, of course, is another custodial 

setting, and -- and I think Congress would have been 

aware --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But not every doctor --

if they come under the FTCA, they -- their --

constitutional claims are not immunized against them --

MR. SHAH:  Oh, I see. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- unless they are PHS 

personnel. 

MR. SHAH:  Right.  Right.  You’re right. 

If they were -- if they were a BOP employee --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right. 

MR. SHAH:  -- as opposed to PHS personnel, 

then you’re right, they would fall under the Westfall 

Act, and there would be the carve-out for constitutional 

claim. 

Now, what we do know is that Congress 

enacted this special protection for Public Health

Service personnel and singled them out at the Surgeon 

General's request in 1970.  And I think it's important 

to remember, in 1970 -- this is pre-Westfall Act -- it was 

not at all clear that Federal medical personnel were 

immune even from common law negligence, for example. 

And so even from that point, putting Bivens 

liability aside, Congress chose to accord special 

protection to PHS personnel above and beyond that 

entitled to those who they were working with side by 

side, say in the Bureau of Prisons or in detention --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Are they paid less than 

other -- than other Federal employees who perform 

similar functions?  And what do -- what do physicians 

who are not -- were not employees of the Public Health 

Service do about liability for Bivens actions?  Are 

they responsible for getting their own malpractice 

insurance? 

MR. SHAH:  Well -- well, Your Honor, in 

terms of the -- in terms of the ordinary claims, the 

common law claims, of course, that would be covered by 

the Westfall Act.  In terms of Bivens, in terms of 

insurance against Bivens claims in particular, my 

understanding -- and this is anecdotal -- is that most --

most of the medical personnel in the Bureau of Prisons 

do not have any other protection beyond that that’s

provided by the Westfall Act.  That is, they don't have 

separate policies. 

There is -- at least according to the 

citation in Respondents’ brief about a Web site that 

shows that you can get Bivens insurance.  It's not clear 

to me whether that's available to Federal -- Federal 

medical personnel, at least in the amounts of insurance 

that might be necessary to adequately protect them --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, we're -- you 

know, we’re talking here as though Congress is a 

perpetual unchanging institution.  Why would it have 

done this for Public Health Service employees and not 

have done this for Bureau?  It wasn't the same Congress 

that passed those two Acts.  The one may have been a 

stingier Congress than the other, or there -- there may 

have been more lobbying by one of the other groups in 

one case. 

I don't see any reason why we have to 

philosophically reconcile the -- the granting of -- of 

greater immunity to Public Health Service employees. 

MR. SHAH:  Justice Scalia, I completely 

agree.  I think it's correct that the important fact is 

the fact that Congress accorded them special protection. 

Again, this was -- this was at the request, the specific 

request of the Surgeon General, and they did this to

help revitalize the Public Health Service. 

Now, I don't think that it’s -- that the 

Public Health Service -- it’s anomalous that they get 

this protection.  I think they’re in many ways similarly 

situated to medical personnel who have served for DOD in 

the armed forces.  Like DOD medical personnel, PHS 

officers can be assigned to very difficult situations 

and settings, sometimes in armed conflict, other custodial 

settings, and they can be ordered to perform certain 

medical conditions. 

In the Gonzalez Act legislative history, 

Congress says that that was a reason -- an additional 

reason as to why they wanted to accord immunity.  And I 

think PHS personnel are similarly situated.  If this 

Court were looking for a reason, the fact is they were 

accorded the same immunity, and that’s the dispositive 

factor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just as a matter of 

curiosity, do all of these immunity provisions come out 

of the same committee?  Or can one assume that the 

Public Health Service may have come out of one committee 

of Congress, the Bureau of Prisons may have come out of 

another committee of Congress, the DOD may have come out 

of a third committee of Congress? 

MR. SHAH:  Right.  I don't know if they all

came out of the same committee, but these certainly span 

a wide spectrum of years, all the way from the 1960s 

to -- to the late 1970s, in terms of when these various 

immunity provisions were enacted.  Some of them happened 

at the same time, like, I believe, the provision for NASA 

personnel was added at the same time the Gonzalez Act 

was passed. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If section 2679(b)(2), 

instead of saying paragraph (1) does not extend nor 

apply, had said the remedy against the United States 

provided by sections 1346(b), et cetera, and repeated 

that language from (b)(1), and then said:  "Is not the 

exclusive remedy in any civil action against an employee 

of the government," and continued with subsection (2), 

then the result here would be different, wouldn't it? 

MR. SHAH:  Your Honor, it may be a closer 

case but I don't think that the result would be 

different, and here's why:  If you look at the text of 

233(a) -- and this is on the very last page of the -- of 

the government's brief -- it does refer to the FTCA in 

terms of the remedy that a -- that a plaintiff should 

seek, but it's not -- it does not look to the FTCA to 

make that remedy exclusive. 

Instead, it provides independent language, 

independent of the FTCA, to make the remedy exclusive.

It says, “The remedy against the United States” under the 

FTCA -- that's what it references -- “for damage for 

personal injury including death resulting from” medical 

performance -- and then it has its own language -- "shall be 

exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by 

reason of the same subject matter."  It does not 

reference the FTCA in that latter clause, and it's that 

latter clause that makes the remedy exclusive. 

So, regardless of the language of the 

Westfall Act, I think -- I don't think it would make a 

difference to the result if Congress had used the 

wording that you suggest, Justice Alito. 

The one -- the one final point I’d like 

to make is I think it bears emphasizing that this is not 

a case where there is no other relief than a Bivens 

remedy available.  The FTCA remedy is not only available 

generally, but the United States has already admitted 

liability on Respondents' medical negligence claim in 

this case.  The only difference from Respondents' 

amount -- from Respondents' perspective now is the 

amount of damages that are recoverable, and we would 

submit --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could the -- could the 

plaintiff contest the certification that this was within the 

scope -- and say it was so egregious, it was outside the

233(a) or anything else, and so we have a straight claim 

against the defendants? 

MR. SHAH:  To my knowledge, plaintiffs have 

not made that argument in this case, that they were not 

acting within the scope. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Or they would lose their 

argument against the -- I mean, they would lose their 

claim against the government if they were taking that 

position? 

MR. SHAH:  They would lose their FTCA claim 

against the government, then, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CONAL DOYLE 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. DOYLE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Section 233 does not bar Bivens claims here 

for two principal reasons.  First, 233 does not abrogate 

a constitutional cause of action because it cannot 

satisfy Carlson's explicit declaration test, which is a 

type of clear statement rule. 

25 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now, that's quite a surprising 

statement for you to make, when the very first statute 

that Carlson mentions is 233(a). 

MR. DOYLE:  Your Honor, I believe you’re 

referring to the dicta in Carlson on page 20. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 

MR. DOYLE:  And it's interesting 

to note how that issue was raised.  In the briefs, it wasn't 

raised arguing that 233(a) bars Bivens claims; the government 

didn't make that argument.  And, in fact, it was raised in 

the Respondents' cert petition or brief in opposition for 

the proposition that -- that the language of that 

statute actually allowed a Bivens claim because it 

didn't preclude it.  And in -- in response the 

government actually argued that because Bivens hadn't 

been decided in -- in 1970, that it could not have 

possibly preserved Bivens claims.  So it was actually 

the opposite issue that was -- that was addressed in 

Carlson --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it certainly 

doesn't get that out of the way.  It's put on page 20, 

because one of the reasons why Carlson enables – allows the Bivens Act 

is that it doesn't contain language and the -- and it --

it seems to me that this -- that this paragraph is 

contrasting statutes with Carlson, because in Carlson

there is no -- there is no other statute. 

MR. DOYLE:  Justice Ginsburg, if I may 

reply, I believe that that's not the proper way to read 

that dicta for two reasons.  First, I think Justice 

Stevens mentioned the Assistant Surgeon General of the 

United States was actually a defendant in the case, and 

so although this 233(a) immunity wasn't -- wasn’t 

decided in Carlson, certainly the Court was aware that a 

-- that a Public Health Service defendant was in the 

case, and they wouldn't have permitted an action to move 

forward against that defendant had they believed that 

233 barred Bivens. 

And, second, it -- it specially characterizes 

the explicit declaration as applying to malpractice, not 

Bivens claims.  And other -- for example, another 

statute in the category there was the Federal Drivers 

Act, and certainly it's hard to imagine how a Federal 

driver could be liable under -- under Bivens. 

And so I think a better reading of that 

dicta is that the Court is just saying:  Here's an 

example; these statutes show that when Congress makes an 

explicit declaration, but the issue is explicit as to 

what?  And it's clear I think from reading that dicta 

based on the existence of the Surgeon General in the 

case and the fact that the dicta was qualified, that it

didn't apply to Bivens. 

Official 

But moving back to the Carlson test, 233 

can't satisfy the test because Carlson never even -- or 

Congress never considered whether the FTCA was a 

substitute for Bivens in 1970.  And this point is 

underscored by the fact that the statute was enacted 

before Bivens and that the cause of action at issue here 

wasn't recognized until 10 years later in Carlson. 

And, second, when Congress did finally 

consider for the first time whether the FTCA was an 

adequate substitute for Bivens in 1988, it expressly 

preserved, rather than barred, Bivens claims in the 

Westfall Act. 

And the Westfall Act was a comprehensive 

statute that was intended to provide an overhaul of 

personal immunity at the request of this Court in 

Westfall v. Erwin, and it applied to all Federal 

employees, including members of the Public Health 

Service.  And that was the holding of this Court in 

Smith. 

And Petitioners’ reading here would actually 

require this Court to write in an implied exception to 

the Westfall Act that doesn't exist, that would exempt 

out Public Health Service personnel from the explicit 

carve-out of Bivens.  Moreover, the Petitioners’ reading

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You claim the Westfall Act 

implicitly repealed 233(a)?  Is that what you say? 

MR. DOYLE:  No, Your Honor, there’s no 

implicit repeal here, although we can --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that provision says 

that it's exclusive, and you’re saying the Westfall Act 

says it’s not exclusive. 

MR. DOYLE:  Your Honor, there’s no implicit 

repeal here for the -- because 233(a) still has 

independent work to do.  But we do concede that under 

our reading, there would be no -- it wouldn't really do 

any more work for Public Health Service employees, 

because they have a broader protection under the 

Westfall Act, because it applies to any wrongful act or 

omission. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it isn't just made 

superfluous.  It is repealed.  The provision of it that 

says "it shall be exclusive" is repealed. 

MR. DOYLE:  The provision --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Implicitly, because it's 

not specifically referred to. 

MR. DOYLE:  Well, there were no -- there 

would be no repeal because there are a number of other

to.  And so the Public Health Service Act --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's just (a).  We’re 

just talking about (a). 

MR. DOYLE:  Yes, but these other provisions 

refer back to (a).  And if I could --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't understand your 

Westfall Act argument.  I must be missing something.  My 

understanding is, many years ago, Congress passes a 

statute and says:  Give absolute immunity from Bivens 

actions. Sue the government;  don't sue the employee. 

It says that, basically.  A long time ago. 

Then, sometime after, Congress passes 

another statute, and in paragraph (a) of that statute, 

it says:  An even larger group of people, just sue the 

government.  And then it says:  As to this larger group 

of people, paragraph (1) of this statute doesn't apply to 

Bivens actions. 

So, what does that got to do with this 

earlier statute?  Doesn’t it refer to it.  I don’t --

in other words, I understand your Carlson argument. 

I got that one, but I don't understand this argument if 

I have the statutes right. 

MR. DOYLE:  Well, Your Honor, I think that 

-- and I don't mean to repeat myself, but to answer that 

question --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, is there an answer to 

the question?  Because that would be important. 

MR. DOYLE:  I believe there is.  But I think 

that the fundamental issue you have to look at, Your 

Honor, is whether, in 1970, Congress intended to abrogate 

a constitutional cause of action.  And in this Court's 

line of clear statements --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's your Carlson 

argument.  I got that one. 

MR. DOYLE:  Okay. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand that one. 

The one I don't understand is what's the relation of the 

Westfall Act to this argument? 

MR. DOYLE:  There’s -- there’s two 

relationships between the Westfall Act and the Public 

Health Service Act.  First, the Westfall Act simply 

applies on its face to all government employees.  This 

Court has held that, and so --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, right.  They give the 

government employees the same kind of immunity that -- a 

little more limited, and that's in paragraph (1).  And 

then paragraph (2) says:  Paragraph (1) doesn't apply to 

Bivens actions. 

It doesn't say anything about the earlier 

statute.  It applies to a different group of people.  It 

31

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

has all kinds of requirements, nothing involved with 

233.  Okay.  So, what is it to do with this case? 

Now, what I'm thinking now from your 

hesitation is it has nothing to do with the case; it's 

the Carlson thing that is the important thing.  Now, you 

tell me why I'm wrong. 

MR. DOYLE:  Justice Breyer, if I could 

answer.  This Court, in Smith, held that the immunity 

conferred by section (1) applies to all Federal employees. 

And you have to read (1) and (2) together.  I mean, you can't 

divorce them, because section (1) grants immunity, but 

subsection (2) affects it and -- and helps define it by 

saying that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You’re talking about the 

Westfall Act.  Absolutely right. 

MR. DOYLE:  Yes.  And that said --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I just say, what does the 

Act have to do with this older Act? 

MR. DOYLE:  Well, it isn't -- the older Act 

refers to the Federal Tort Claims Act as providing the 

exclusive remedy in this case.  And the FTCA is the only 

remedial scheme in the case.  So, in other words, 233 

doesn't set forth within it different remedies that 

prospective plaintiffs can get against the Public Health 

Services.  It decided to define it by referring to the

Official 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Westfall -- Westfall Act is 

not -- is not the FTCA, is it? 

MR. DOYLE:  It is.  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, it is the -- in other 

words, you think -- I thought the FTCA Act is an Act 

that gives you action against the government. 

MR. DOYLE:  The Westfall Act is just simply 

an amendment to the FTCA. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So it says:  This Act is 

the exclusive remedy -- the FTCA is an exclusive remedy 

for all employees, but this provision which gives us an 

exception does not give you the exception, does not make 

it exclusive for Bivens actions. 

Okay.  You go ahead.  You explain it to me. 

I don't want to keep repeating my skepticism, I want to listen. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. DOYLE:  Okay.  Well, the first clause 

of section 233(a) states that -- that the remedy against 

the United States provided by 1346(b) is remedy 

available.  And so you go to 1346(b), and Congress 

defined the 1346(b) -- I believe it's on page 5a of the --

of our appendix -- and says that -- that the remedy is 

subject to the entire provisions of the FTCA.  And so you 

have to look to the entire provisions of the FTCA

to determine what the remedy is, because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What -- what says "entire 

subject" -- 233(a), where does that say anything other 

than -- I mean, it reads like it's immunity from any 

civil action.  That's -- those are the words I think 

that you have to overcome.  It says:  Plaintiff has a 

substitute remedy against the United States under the 

Federal Tort Claims Act, and the employee is immune from 

any civil action.  And then you say, but any civil 

action doesn't include Bivens actions.  And you must be 

saying that the later Act shrinks the former Act. 

MR. DOYLE:  The later Act amended the former 

Act; that's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It amended 233(a) --

MR. DOYLE:  It -- it did, in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- without mentioning it? 

MR. DOYLE:  -- effect, because it's 

incorporated by reference through the Act.  So 1346(b), 

the first sentence says “subject to the provisions of 

chapter 171,” which is the entire FTCA.  And within that 

chapter, there's a provision entitled "Exclusiveness of 

Remedy."  And that defines -- and that really addresses 

the precise issue before the Court, whether the FTCA is 

the exclusive remedy here for a Bivens action.  And it 

specifically says in that section that Bivens actions

And so if you want to find out what remedy 

is available to a prospective plaintiff, you have to 

look at how Congress defined the remedy, and it 

specifically defined it by limiting it under its 

Exclusiveness Clause to common law torts, not Bivens 

claims. 

But I think one of the key principles here 

that we have to acknowledge is that you defer -- the 

Court defers to Congress in policy considerations like 

this because presumably Congress is in a better position 

than the Court to -- to weigh policy decisions like 

providing immunity to certain government employees.  But 

the deference there is only appropriate where Congress 

has actually faced the issue and balanced the policy 

considerations.  And it could not have done so in 1970, 

because Bivens hadn't been decided; Estelle v. Gamble 

hadn't been decided until 1976, which -- which 

established the deliberate indifference standard; and 

then Carlson wasn't decided until 1980.  And when 

Congress, for the first time, actually looked at the 

issue --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you say any -- any 

other civil action that -- that did not exist prior to 

the enactment of 233(a) would not be covered by its

exclusion because Congress couldn't have known that this 

civil action existed, so that it only covered those 

causes of action that existed at the time the statute 

was passed? 

MR. DOYLE:  Only -- only as to 

constitutional causes of action, Justice Scalia. 

And I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  Why?  I mean, if your 

theory is it doesn't preclude anything they didn't know 

about, if they didn't know about something, whether it's 

constitutional or not, what -- what reason is there to 

say it's precluded? 

MR. DOYLE:  Well, I think that the issue 

here is, is that when Congress is going to -- was going 

to abrogate a constitutional right or recognize a 

constitutional remedy, it has to do so in a clear way. 

And in, for example, Webster v. Doe or, in effect, the 

Blatchfield -- Blatchford case, has very similar language. 

It's all civil actions, and that's in a context of whether 

Indians can bring an action against the State under the 

Eleventh Amendment.  In that case, the Court held that 

all civil actions did not include the right to bring an 

action against the Eleventh Amendment -- a State under 

the Eleventh Amendment, because you’re dealing with a 

constitutional issue.

And in this case -- I think that goes to 

Justice Kennedy's point -- we’re not saying that, you know, 

any cause of action that perhaps was created after 1970 

wouldn't be barred, but when you’re talking about a 

constitutional cause of action, there is a difference. 

And you -- Congress has to at least consider the issue, 

balance the policy considerations, and make an informed 

decision in order for this Court to abrogate a 

constitutional right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And Carlson is your best 

authority for that?  Even though I don't think Carlson 

is directly on point, Carlson is still your best 

authority? 

MR. DOYLE:  Well, Carlson sets forth the 

clear statement rule here, the explicit declaration 

test, and then --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In a different context, 

but that -- but Carlson is still your best authority for 

that proposition? 

MR. DOYLE:  I think Webster v. Doe is 

another example of a case where this Court would not 

abrogate a constitutional right based on fairly clear 

language that said the director of the CIA had 

discretion to terminate anybody.  And in that case, he 

terminated a CIA employee because he was homosexual, and

he brought a variety of different constitutional causes 

of action.  And then, you know, the Court held that to 

abrogate a constitutional cause of action, there has to 

be -- there has to be a clear statement.  And so we don't 

believe there has been that clear statement, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do think your clear 

statement argument would apply even if Carlson had been 

decided before the statute was enacted? 

MR. DOYLE:  Well, that's true, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Okay. 

MR. DOYLE:  And so, it's not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I would have 

thought it wouldn't apply as strongly because they would 

have been saying any action at a time when they knew that 

particular action existed. 

MR. DOYLE:  It wouldn't -- it wouldn't apply 

as -- as strongly, but I -- I don't think that the 

sequence of enactment is dispositive, I think is the 

point. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, so you’re 

saying -- your response to Justice Stevens follows 

because you say they -- unless they say a Bivens action 

is excluded, it's not. 

MR. DOYLE:  Or constitutional, but it has to

that's what the cases are clear about.  And so --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the Gonzalez Act is 

after Bivens. 

MR. DOYLE:  It is. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you say the same 

thing -- even though Bivens was before Congress -- and 

even though the Gonzalez Act doesn't have an exception for 

Bivens claims, you read one into the Gonzalez Act? 

MR. DOYLE:  Your Honor, I -- I would say the 

Gonzalez Act also wouldn't bar Bivens claims, because 

it’s just the sequence of enactment -- but I mean, if 

it was -- if it had shown in some way that Congress 

considered the constitutional issue -- and the legislative 

history of the Gonzalez Act shows that it did not at 

that time -- if there was some indication in the 

language of the statute or anywhere that a

I meant to imply that, I misspoke. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what you said.  I 

thought you said if -- if it was clear from the 

legislative history that Congress considered Bivens 

actions and nonetheless enacted language similar to 

233(a), that wouldn't be enough. 

MR. DOYLE:  It -- it -- I think that in the 

statute, in the -- in the text of the statute itself, 

there has to be some evidence from Congress that it 

considered it.  I think that you can look at other 

factors to try to figure out what -- what Congress was 

thinking, of course.  However, in this case, I think the 

point is clear that whether you look at the legislative 

history, whether you look at the alternative remedial 

scheme --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now you’re confusing me 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is -- is -- is important 

what Congress was thinking or what Congress said?  I

is that --

MR. DOYLE:  Your Honor, all I'm saying 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You’re not 

abandoning it; you’re taking it further.  You’re 

taking Carlson further.  It doesn't have to be -- no? 

MR. DOYLE:  All I'm saying is, I believe, is 

that -- is that in this case, if you look at the actual 

statute that's at issue, no matter what test you use, 

whether you -- whether you -- whether you like 

legislative history, whether you -- whether you only 

look at plain text, or whether you want to look at 

what's the alternative remedy, is it equivalent to a 

constitutional claim, this statute doesn't pass muster. 

It is clear that Congress never considered whether or 

not to abrogate a constitutional cause of action in 

1970. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I think his point is it doesn't 

matter whether they did or didn't consider it; the 

question is the statute was decided by Justice Brennan 

as an example of a statute where Congress did explicitly 

say whatever it thought that this particular remedy was 

a remedy exclusive, an exclusive remedy, and that 

satisfied the second requirement of Carlson.  That was

Justice Ginsburg's first question.  And -- and there --

that's, I think, the problem for you in this case. 

MR. DOYLE:  Your Honor, again, I don't want 

to repeat my answer to that question, but just to 

emphasize that -- that the Court in Carlson did not 

specifically say that Bivens claims were barred by 

reference to 233.  It mentioned malpractice.  And 

there is a distinct difference between malpractice and 

deliberate indifference in 1980, because Estelle had 

been decided 4 years earlier. 

So, one of the other anomalies here is that 

looking at -- at -- at the practical effect, going to 

your implied repeal question, Justice Scalia, the only 

work that -- that 233(a) would have left to do under the 

Petitioners’ reading is -- is to bar Bivens claims.  And 

when Congress enacted the statute in 1970, Bivens didn't 

even exist. 

And so, the protection that -- the -- the 

position that we are advocating protects doctors because 

the Westfall Act extends much broader immunity to common 

law torts, to any wrongful act or omission, not just 

actions performing medical functions.  And so, this is 

completely consistent with Congress's intent in 1970 

when constitutional claims didn't even exist. 

And so, when Congress looked at the issue,

examined it and decided whether -- whether there’s a 

difference between Bivens and the common law and whether 

the FTCA was adequate to substitute for Bivens, it made 

a decision to expressly preserve Bivens actions in this 

case.  And even if, Your Honors, you believe that 

233 bars Bivens claims here, you have to reconcile it 

with the Westfall Act, because the Westfall Act 

expressly preserves Bivens claims. 

And it is a comprehensive statute; it is 

a later passed statute; and it is specific to the issue before 

the Court, which is can -- can a Bivens claim be brought 

against a Public Health Service doctor? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Westfall Act could be 

read to say we’re now covering all these people who did 

not have, who were not sheltered by immunity before, but 

this amendment saves out Bivens claims.  One could read 

that as self-contained and not touching other statutes 

that existed independently before. 

MR. DOYLE:  Your Honor, I -- I -- I don't 

think that's a reasonable reading, because at the time 

of the Westfall Act's passage in 1988, no court had held 

that Bivens claims were barred by section 233 or any 

other pre-Act immunity statute like the Gonzalez Act or 

and the VA Act. 

And the legislative history of the Westfall

Act shows that, in 1988, Congress believed that the 

Westfall Act would simply extend the protections 

available to -- to government employees before Westfall 

v. Erwin, and that -- and that people would still be 

able to bring constitutional claims against members of 

the Federal government. 

And so, Congress had no reason in 1988 to 

go back and amend the -- the earlier passed 233, 

because there was no indication -- judicial construction 

or the legislative history -- that 233 ever barred Bivens 

claims in the first place. 

And so, adopting the Petitioners’ position 

in this case would -- would subvert congressional 

intent, because it would say that, you know, when 

Congress finally weighed all of the considerations in 

the case, decided whether Bivens and the FTCA were 

adequate, it decided to -- it decided to preserve Bivens 

claims rather than bar them. 

And -- and -- and so, accepting the 

Petitioners’ position would just subvert 

that intent based on an Act that was passed prior to 

Bivens existing, prior to a constitutional cause of 

action being accepted for this type of action, and it --

and it would just be completely inconsistent with what 

Congress has -- has done to protect Federal employees.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I just be sure I 

understand your argument?  Is the Westfall Act -- would 

it have covered every immunity that the Public Health 

Act previously provided?  So, is it correct that the --

the prior statute is now totally unnecessary and does 

nothing except preserve the Bivens -- preserve the 

immunity for Bivens actions? 

MR. DOYLE:  No, Your Honor, I don't think I 

got to finish that answer before.  But if you look at --

at the appendix to our -- our brief from page 28 

to 62, there’s two pages in there, page 29 and page 55, 

that show that section (a) still has meaning, because 

there’s a host of non-Federal employees, people that --

that are government contractors that provide services to 

free health clinics and the like that can be deemed 

employees of the Public Health Service and then take 

advantage of their immunity.  But otherwise, they 

wouldn't be able to take advantage of the immunity 

under FTCA, because they aren't Federal employees. 

So 233(a) still has work to do, even under 

our construction.  And so, surely, it would not protect 

Public Health Service employees any more because they 

have greater protections in the Westfall Act, and, again, 

the Petitioners’ reading here would -- the only work it 

would have left to do would be to bar Bivens claims, but

Bivens didn't even exist in 1970, when -- that the Act 

was passed.  That doesn't -- that doesn't make much 

common sense. 

And before I -- I conclude, I just want to 

speak for a moment about, you know, the importance of 

this case under the -- the Bivens jurisprudence.  I 

mean, the purpose of Bivens -- this Court has acknowledged 

recently in Meyer and Malesko is to provide deterrence 

to -- to Federal officers.  And this is exactly the type 

of case that -- that -- where deterrence is important, 

because government employees should not feel that they 

can -- they can --

Government and collect money? 

MR. DOYLE:  Not for the -- not for a Bivens 

claim, and --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I mean, can't your 

clients -- anybody who has a case like yours -- can't they 

sue the Federal Government and collect damages for their 

claim? 

MR. DOYLE:  It depends.  Sometimes they can’t.

Federal Government? 

MR. DOYLE:  Yes.

they? 

MR. DOYLE:  On one claim, but one of our 

claims, the most important claim here, is -- is -- will 

be extinguished under California law, which highlights 

why, you know, Congress would not want to -- why this 

Court in Carlson, first of all, said that the FTCA is not 

an effective substitute for Bivens, and Congress 

ratified that decision 8 years later in the Westfall 

Act by finding the same thing, that -- that Bivens 

claims and the FTCA are complementary and parallel 

causes of action, because for the very reason that, under 

California law in this case, a survival claim for 

pre-death pain and suffering for -- for Mr. Castaneda, 

who endured an incredible ordeal for 2 years at the hands 

of a government medical provider, that that -- that claim 

would be barred. 

And so I would urge this Court to follow its 

-- its precedent in Carlson and recognize that Congress, 

8 years later in the Westfall Act, actually ratified 

that holding that said that the FTCA is not an adequate 

substitute for a Bivens action for the reasons I’ve set 

forth.  Thank you, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Ms. Goldenberg, you have 3 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Just two quick points, if 

I may.  One is that I think you can't read this Court's 

Bivens jurisprudence to set forth any kind of clear 

statement rule in this context.  In many cases after 

Carlson was decided, this Court has looked for 

indications that Congress thought the judiciary should 

stay its hands, and it has found those indications in 

the mere existence of some kind of statutory scheme, 

even where Congress has said nothing express about 

whether that scheme should be exclusive or not. 

If it can be the case that, simply by setting 

forth an elaborate scheme, Congress can indicate its 

intent that this particular implied cause of action 

shouldn't go forward, then it must be true also that 

where Congress expressly says that it shouldn't go 

forward, that that can be given effect. 

And I point out that there is not a cutting off 

of a constitutional right here.  It's just that there is 

a specific cause of action that isn't going to be 

allowed to go forward because it's one that this Court 

would imply.

Secondly, just to go back to my answer to 

Justice Kennedy's question before, the case that I meant 

to cite to you was Van de Kamp v. Goldstein, 129 Supreme 

Court 855, and that talked about absolute immunity 

reflecting a balance of evils.  Here, I think Congress 

has done that balancing.  Congress has decided that it 

would rather protect the PHS, make sure that causes of 

action and liability aren't hanging over the heads of 

PHS officers, even if that means that some individuals 

don't get recovery against certain specific PHS 

personnel on their claims, when they can of course 

recover from the United States. 

If there are no further questions, we’d 

ask that the decision of the Ninth Circuit be reversed. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Counsel. 

The case is submitted.
