ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

please the Court: 

 

 

11 

            

The False Claims Act asks very little of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

private qui tam relator who would step into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's shoes, file under seal, serve only on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government, and maintain the seal until it is lifted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents here violated that requirement. 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

They leaked the content and existence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

their suit to the Associated Press, ABC, and the New 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

York Times.  And yet, under this rule adopted by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court of appeals, they suffered no consequence whatever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for that violation.  This Court should reverse or vacate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and hold that such bad-faith, willful, and severe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations warrant dismissal under either -- any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

appropriate test. 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did you seek any sanction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

of -- for the seal violations other than dismissal? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

1 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  We did not, Your Honor.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

sought dismissal repeatedly. 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why not? 

  

 

 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, we think 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

dismissal was the appropriate sanction and that any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative sanction would be toothless here for --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for -- just to begin --

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  From -- from --

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

perhaps from the defendant's point of view, but I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought the whole purpose of sealing the materials was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not to tip off the defendant.  And if that's so, then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant would benefit from being tipped off, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government -- who I think you agree is the primary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern of Congress to be protected -- the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then would be left with the choice of either drop --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dropping the suit or expending its own resources on it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

So the one that was really penalized, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

addition to the qui tam plaintiffs, is the government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, we think that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

Congress intended a statutory bargain that does not give 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government absolute discretion to decide whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seal has been violated. 

 

 

 

23 

            

And let me explain first what the statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

bargain is.  The statutory bargain set forth in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3730(b)(2) is, the relator gets the litigating authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

of the government.  It gets to see -- share in any award 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government might obtain, but on condition -- on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory condition that it abide by the simple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements I mentioned, of keeping the -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

complaint under seal. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And if it's a condition 

   

  

 

 

 

for the government's benefit, the government can waive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3

it.

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, we don't agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with that.  We don't -- we think that Congress could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have said that the seal should be maintained at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Attorney General's discretion.  It did not say that; it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said the seal's --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, just under 

  

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg's question, why -- why don't the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants have a stronger interest in having the seal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement followed than the government does? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Respectfully, I disagree, 

   

  

 

19 

Your Honor. 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's the point of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question right now. 

 

 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, but let me go back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question.  The government does have an interest in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having the seal maintained.  The seal is, under the '86 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amendments, it -- it's required, in order that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

government may investigate the claims, decide whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- to intervene, and also pursue any criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigations that might have already commenced or be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commenced in light of the complaint. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But that doesn't just protect the 

 

 

 

 

 

government's discretion; it protects the operation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute.  And the way it does that is it gives the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government a period of time in which it may decide to do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of three things:  Intervene and conduct the qui tam 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, decline to intervene, or, as in happen -- as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens in very many cases, settle the case with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants before the seal is lifted.  And as the Second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit said in Pilon, which we think gives the best 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

version of a discretionary test, the incentives for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

settlement which benefits the taxpayers and the treasury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will often disappear if a potentially meritorious 

   

 

 

 

 

complaint is filed and a defendant is willing to reach 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- a -- a speedy and valuable settlement with the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government in order to avoid unsealing.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're arguing --

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

you're arguing the government's interests, but it -- it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rings a little hollow when we see that the government is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the other side. 

 

 

 

24 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

25 

in a difficult position, arguing that we serve the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

1 

2 

3 

4 

government's interests better than the government 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests.  But let me say why I think it's very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

important not to see this as something that is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's seal to be maintained at the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

discretion. 

6 

            

When Congress sets a mandatory precondition 

   

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

to suit, this Court has always held that the requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits dismissal -- Hallstrom is the case most clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on point -- because --

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in Hallstrom --

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

Hallstrom, the plaintiff could re-file.  It wasn't -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- it required notice.  So the plaintiff could then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give the notice and bring the suit again.  But on your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view, these plaintiffs are out irretrievably. 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, if I make no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

point clearer today, let me make this point clear:  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit does not go away on our rule; the relators go away 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on our rule.  The government --

  

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but that puts the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

government to the choice of not having the relator to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward for it, and it has to either take up the reins 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself or say, well, we have too many other things on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our plate; we have to let it go. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, the government 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

here is free to intervene even after the relators are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

dismissed, no matter how late it is in the suit.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision of 3730 -- the provisions of 3730 allow the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government to intervene for good cause later.  And 3731 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows the government to have its late-intervened suit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relate back to the time of the relator's complaint.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is no statute of limitations problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the government 

  

 

 

 

8 

starts again. 

 

9 

            

10 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  It does, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The judgment that was 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

entered here would be nullified. 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

But the same thing happened in Hallstrom.  Hallstrom 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered and rejected the argument that wiping out the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment in that case would waste the resources expended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

and --

 

17 

            

18 

            

19 

            

20 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- please.  Sorry. 

    

  

 

 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Sorry, Justice Kagan. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, please. 

  

 

 

MS. SULLIVAN:  I just want to make the point 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

that if the government has already intervened, which it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't do in this case because three years of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigations found no fraud, if the government has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already intervened, then Justice Ginsburg's dilemma will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never occur.  The government is already conducting the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

1 

suit. 

2 

            

So the only cases we're talking about in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

small universe of cases that involve seal violations in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first place are non-intervened cases in which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government might not have intervened but want to do so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later.  And my point is there is no prejudice to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government or the treasury, because the government can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come in later, relate back, and re-conduct the suit if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it finds it's a meritorious case. 

   

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You mentioned Hallstrom a 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

couple of times --

 

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- and rely on it heavily in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

the briefs.  But Hallstrom has very different statutory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

language.  Hallstrom says no action may be commenced 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless a condition is met. 

   

 

 

17 

            

And, similarly, in 3730, the statute uses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

language that makes it clear that dismissal is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate when a mandatory requirement is not met.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

says, "the Court shall dismiss an action or claim."  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, "in no event may a person bring an action."  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says the court -- "no court shall have jurisdiction." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All of that way of -- all of those phrasings indicate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what happens when a requirement isn't satisfied. 

   

 

 

 

 

25 

            

But there is no such language with respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

10 

to this requirement.  I mean, it's a mandatory 

    

   

 

 

 

requirement, but it doesn't say what happens if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement isn't satisfied.  And that makes it very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different from Hallstrom and from the other language in

Section 3730.

12 

13 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  That is correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

We do not have an express statement of what the remedial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanction is for a violation of the seal.  But RCRA was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

silent, too, on the remedial sanction for a violation of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the pre-filing notice requirement, and yet this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonetheless held the mandatory precondition not being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

met, dismissal was the appropriate sanction, and also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stated expressly that the requirement was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

jurisdictional. 

15 

16 

            

So, Your Honor, Hallstrom really was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same exact case, functionally, as our case.  Here's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

difference --

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what about the point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that I made before with respect to Hallstrom?  Hallstrom 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't put the plaintiffs out of court.  It said they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to give the required notice.  They have to give the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice to the government, the alleged violator.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought the purpose of that was to give the violator a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance to clean things up so there wouldn't be any suit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So those plaintiffs, if I understand Hallstrom right, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

11 

just give the notice, wait the necessary number of days, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and go forward with their suit again. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  And as I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

said before, the government can come in under 3730(c)(3) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and have its complaint relate back to the relator.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's similar to the plaintiffs in Hallstrom. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

But to answer Justice Kagan's question, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

only difference between our case and the Hallstrom-type 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre-filing waiting period comes from the peculiarities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the qui tam statute, and in particular from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peculiarities of the qui tam statute that benefit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

relators. 

13 

            

And what I mean by that is, what was the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

1986 bargain?  Congress wanted to encourage relators to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

come forward, and so it said, we're going to give you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new, larger bounties and financial incentives.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're worried that if we encourage you to come forward, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you might impair government investigations.  But we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

worry if we make you wait first before you file, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might lose your right to sue.  You might have some other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relator beat you to the post and file first, or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government might file and then you'd be out of luck. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

So in order to protect the relators, the qui 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

tam statute does it backwards from Hallstrom.  It says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file -- sorry -- file first, wait second.  Whereas in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

Hallstrom, it accomplished the exact same purpose under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RCRA:  Wait first, file second.  It was in order to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protect relators that this statute, the '86 amendments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the qui tam statute, say relator file first, but keep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it under seal to protect the government's right of first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

refusal. 

7 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you have two 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

arguments:  One is that dismissal is mandatory; the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other is that the district court and the court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals applied the wrong standard in determining not to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

dismiss here. 

 

12 

            

As to the first, what would you say about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

the case where the disclosure is very limited, seen by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only one person, let's say; it was inadvertent, it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not done in bad faith, and it causes no harm?  You would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say dismissal is required even under those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

circumstances? 

18 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Not necessarily, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

We think that dismissal is required where a disclosure 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rises to the level of a violation.  But as some district 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts in per se dismissal jurisdictions have held -- we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cite the Omnicare-Gale case that's in the Sixth Circuit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which follows a per se dismissal rule -- the Court found 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a mere private disclosure to a spouse may not -- a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trivial disclosure may not rise to the level of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

violation.  And, Your Honor, we think that the district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts can find safety valves in a per se dismissal rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by finding that such trivial disclosures don't rise to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the level of --

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

6 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But that doesn't --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's not this 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

question.  I had the same question. 

    

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  That doesn't sound like a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

per se rule, then. 

 

 

 

10 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  A per se rule with de minimis 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

exceptions, Your Honor.  But under our alternative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument -- and, Justice Breyer, I definitely want to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

get to your question. 

 

 

 

14 

            

Well, so let me try -- let me just answer --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

finish the answer by saying, we argue in the alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if there's going to be a discretionary standard 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

akin to equitable discretion, then bad faith should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the primary factor and harm should be measured by --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry -- the severity of the violation should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measured by what the relator did or the relator's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel did at the time of the disclosure, not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences; its character, not its consequences; 

 

 

 

 

 

ex-ante, not ex-post.  And that actual harm to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government should not be a requirement. 

   

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Once you're there -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

mean, my thought was the same as Justice Alito's:  Vast 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

range of violations.  Some don't hurt really at all. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Some are sort of accidental.  Some are certainly not bad 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith and they didn't cause much trouble.  Really, why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismiss the case? 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

And once you begin to agree with that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

you're into argument 2.  And once you're into argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2, what do you think of the Lujan factors? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, we don't think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

that the Lujan factors were properly articulated or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied in this case.  So what we think is the better 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule is the one that comes from the Second Circuit, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ninth and Fifth Circuits.  And that rule would look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to bad faith as an important factor, sometimes a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispositive one, and there is no question that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct here was in the utmost bad faith.  You had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers deliberately leaking to national news outlets in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haec verba the contents of the complaint and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

evidentiary --

 

20 

            

21 

know that. 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But the clients did not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, that's not -- not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

correct on this record.  The fifth --

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  On the record, does it show 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

that they did know it or they didn't know it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

            

2 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Correct, Your Honor.  And --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Not correct.  It was a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

question.  Either they did know it or they didn't know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  What does the record say about that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  The record -- the Fifth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

Circuit assumed that the lawyer's conduct could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imputed to the relators. 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But on the question of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

whether they knew it or not. 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

no --

 

12 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, we think that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why did you never ask them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

or the lawyer? 

 

 

14 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, Your Honor, we did ask 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

them whether they authorized the conduct.  They said no. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So there's no --

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So here we have ambiguity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

as respect to that.  Could I write an opinion that said 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Lujan factors are some factors?  Life is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated.  There are all kinds of factors, and these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors affect the basic fairness of the situation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is something that judges should look to as well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Like many, many, many decisions, this is conferred upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Supreme -- upon the district court to make a fair 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision in say -- in terms of sanction, in light of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

circumstance, to be reviewed by abuse of discretion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, in this case, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

was an abuse of discretion not to dismiss on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

underlying facts. 

 

5 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't have to worry about 

    

 

 

 

 

 

6 

this case; you do. 

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  You are correct. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And I -- I have to worry 

   

   

  

 

 

 

9 

about the right standard to write an opinion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

And let me suggest, respectfully, why you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

should, at a minimum, vacate and remand for resolution 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of any remaining fact questions about imputation or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like, and that is because the articulation of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard by Lujan, the court below, and courts following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this toothless test basically have invited open season 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on deliberate, bad-faith leaks to the press. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If you affirm and say this was good enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for abuse of discretion, then further -- Mr. Chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

Justice? 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was just going to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

ask:  I thought your very -- the very first question was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you didn't -- that your answer was that you didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seek any sanction other than dismissal.  So I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite sure your fallback argument is before us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

1 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  It is, Your Honor, because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

dismissal should have been granted under a proper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary test, if you reject our per se rule.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we think with respect --

 

 

 

 

5 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Did you ask 

  

  

 

 

 

 

6 

for the application of any rule other than dismissal? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  We -- we asked for dismissal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

And we asked for dismissal urging, at a minimum, a test 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would take bad faith into account.  If -- the most 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important feature of the decision below is it gave the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back of its hand to deliberate, bad faith conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if we go back --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

and I haven't done this -- and look at the way the case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was litigated, is there an argument from you that says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay, if you're not going to automatically dismiss this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case as we argue, you should do this as a second 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

alternative. 

18 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, there is, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

We preserved at every stage the argument that if there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is no per se dismissal, there should be dismissal based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on a proper balancing test.  We urge that a balancing 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

test should, number one, make bad faith primary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But again, you didn't ask 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

for any sanction other than dismissal. 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  That is correct, Your Honor.

Attorney discipline would do no good in a case where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Scruggs had already been indicted and disbarred for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons having nothing to do with his deliberate seal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations here.  And monetary sanctions, with respect, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which are touted by the Respondents and the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the solution, are not going to have any deterrent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect in a case --

2

6

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So then I do have one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

9 

fundamental, factual question. 

 

 

10 

            

11 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As I'm reading the 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

record below, the circuit, the Fifth Circuit, took the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position that the only disclosure that would violate the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seal requirement is the disclosure of the existence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lawsuit.  It basically said that disclosing the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying facts is not a violation of the sealing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement.  So how did the mere disclosure of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit hurt you as opposed to what I think hurts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reputation is the nature of the allegations? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

If the allegations were going to come out no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24

matter what, how and why and when was there an actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosure of the existence of the lawsuit as opposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just sharing with others what I understood to be the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidentiary affidavit which just sets forth allegations? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  So Your Honor, there is no

Official - Subject to Final Review

question here that the existence of the complaint under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the False Claims Act was literally revealed.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidentiary disclosures supporting the complaint which 

 

 

 

 

 

mirrors the allegations of the complaint itself was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

e-mailed to three national news media; to the AP with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the caption on the front, but in all instances with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signature block saying, attorney for relators in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

False Claims Act, and with the certificate of service on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Attorney General on the U.S. Attorney. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So this is the rare case where you do not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to consider any factual ambiguity about whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint itself was distributed to the public.  ABC, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the AP, and The New York Times are the public. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second, Your Honor, there may be other cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlike this one in which it's a harder case, in which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe someone just talked about fraud in the air. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I thought the 

   

  

 

 

question was suppose these plaintiffs didn't reveal the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint at all, but they described on a radio show, on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a TV show, what they understood to be State Farm's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice.  So the information came out, but not that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they had filed the complaint. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, that would be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different case.  You haven't reached it.  You don't need 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reach it here.  A divided panel of the Fourth 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

Circuit, with a very strong dissent by Judge Gregory, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

said maybe there -- maybe there is a First Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to --

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's assume for the 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

moment that there is a First Amendment right to discuss 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the actions that took place.  How, then, do you answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor's and Justice Ginsburg's question? 

 

 

 

 

 

The harm here that you're talking about could have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- occurred with First Amendment protection. 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

Let's assume there is a First Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

11 

protection.  How then would you answer the question? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Then, Your Honor, if fraud 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

was discussed without revealing the existence and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

content of the complaint itself, then there would not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a violation and the per se rule would apply, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why our per se rule is narrower and less absolute than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- than my friends on the other side have portrayed it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But Your Honor, there may be times when a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revelation of fraud and not the words "here is our False 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Claims Act complaint," which was the case in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record, in which the revelation of the fraud was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functional equivalent of revealing the complaint. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If a lawyer goes up on the courthouse steps, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes out on the courthouse steps and talks about fraud 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then points to his briefcase and says, well, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

can't, if somebody says, well, did you file a complaint, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no, I can't talk about, there might be instances in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the exercise of First Amendment rights becomes the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functional equivalent of fraud, and the district courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can work that out in deciding whether a disclosure rises 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the level of a violation. 

   

 

 

 

            

But you don't have to face that here.  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you need to face here is a case where lawyers violating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every possible obligation under the statute, as well as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their ethical obligations, and whose conduct should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imputed to the relators, as the Fifth Circuit assumed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaked the actual complaint in its legal content to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three national news media. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You said your test would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

put -- would make bad faith primary.  What exactly does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that mean?  I mean, take a case where there was bad 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith, but in fact there was also a pretty minor breach 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was not likely to cause any harm, and in fact did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not cause any harm, and the government comes in to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court and says, it's not in our interests for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case to be dismissed.  Why should the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonetheless dismiss the case?

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, under our 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

balancing test, it might not on those facts.  Bad faith 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't be dispositive if the other factors overwhelm it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

But here --

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, then, what does it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

mean for bad -- why do you say -- is it -- how is it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first among equals?  Why isn't it just something that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court should take into account as this district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court took it into account? 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, we don't think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

the district court or the court of appeals did take bad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith into account.  And if you look at the government's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief at page 28, you'll see that the United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't seem to take bad faith seriously here either. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is an -- is an error that -- as a matter of law in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the application of the balancing test, and we think bad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith plus severe harm makes an easy case for dismissal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

here. 

16 

            

Let me see why the severe harm should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

assessed differently less than the Fifth Circuit here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

The Fifth Circuit here took an ex-post 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

rather than an ex-ante approach.  It said, as you just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested in your hypo, let's look at the consequences. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Did anything bad happen?  The statute asks you to take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an ex-ante perspective.  It says, don't violate the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

seal.  Let's deter you. 

  

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but it did both.  When 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

-- when one factor is the seriousness of the violation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

presumably one measures the seriousness of the violation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by asking whether the violation is likely to cause harm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

ex-ante. 

4 

            

So it's really looking to both.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

calling them different things, but it's saying, we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to check out the seriousness of the violation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's likely to produce harm, what the risk of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm is, and we're going to ask in ways we ask in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law all the time, did it in fact cause that harm? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, we don't tend to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

let drug dealers off if the thing they think is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana that they are selling turns out to be oregano. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We do care about state of mind at the time, and we don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just look to the accident or happenstance that it didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause harm in fact. 

 

 

 

16 

            

Here, the courts, by looking to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

consequences, failed to describe as severe -- and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government actually calls this a minor violation -- to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

leak the contents of the complaint to national news 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

media.  If you affirm, you are sending a message to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

every relator in the country in qui tam suits, and their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel, leak away with no consequence. 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

And Justice Sotomayor, monetary sanctions, 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

to complete the answer before, are not going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective.  The Bibby case, touted by the government at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

pages 23 to 24 of the government's brief, was a case in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the relator's share was reduced from $43 million 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to $41.5 million as the monetary sanction.  That will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be an effective deterrent.  So dismissal --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you -- can you tell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

me, just clarify what 3730(b) means when it says the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action may be dismissed only if the Court and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and their reasons for consenting. 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  I can, Your Honor.  That 

    

  

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

applies to voluntary dismissals, as has been settled by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an unbroken line of Court of Appeals decision.  It does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not apply to dismissals ordered by a court.  And we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that if you adopt our per se rule under Hallstrom, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or a better version of the discretionary rule than the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

toothless one adopted by the Court of Appeals below, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court-ordered dismissal is the appropriate sanction for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a bad-faith leak to national news media. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

question --

 

21 

            

And, Justice Kagan, to go back to your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If there is a primary 

   

  

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

factor, why shouldn't the primary factor just be what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government wants?  In other words, why shouldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this be -- given that the government is the beneficiary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this provision, why shouldn't we give very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

25 

1 

significant discretion to the government? 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, this is a case of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

pure statutory construction.  There is no need to defer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the government. 

 

 

            

Second, actual harm is very hard to prove. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How can the government know if an unscrupulous defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has destroyed evidence or sent witnesses out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

country?

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

And last and most important, Your Honor, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government never says it has been harmed.  It has no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive to do so.  There is only one case that we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found in 30 years of qui tam cases in which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government admitted there was actual harm, and that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a basis on which you should police this requirement. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief justice. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

MR. SINGH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The question in this case is, as the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half-hour illustrates, not really whether the courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will punish and deter violations of the False Claims Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

seal requirement, but whether they will do so in a way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is counterproductive to the government's interest, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or whether they will instead impose other sanctions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would benefit the government, allow cases to go forward, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and simultaneously create an effective deterrent.

The message that you're hearing from State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

Farm is that no other sanction will be effective; but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the rule will be toothless, it will be open season, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history belies this claim.  Since 1986, when the False 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Claims Act amendments were enacted, there have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10,593 qui tam actions filed.  State Farm gave you an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix with their petition where they list all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases that they found that talk about the seal.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix has 48 cases in them.  Only 35 actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved seal violations.  And of those, you know, an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even smaller fraction, only six, involved findings of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

bad faith. 

 

18 

            

Our rule has been the rule in this country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

since 1995.  And in that time, we're talking about a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

handful of violations.  In fact, strangely enough, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit that has the most seal violations in State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Farm's appendix is the Sixth Circuit.  It had six cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving seal violations, four of which came up after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the per se rule that the other side wants you to focus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in on --

the type -- the greatest degree of bad faith in this --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in violating the seal requirement that is really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible to imagine, that will stand for the principal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in future cases, that even if an instance in which there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was complete bad faith, dismissal is not appropriate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Or a dismissal is -- can -- can properly be rejected. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SINGH:  Sure.  So there are -- there are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

two ways I'd like to answer the question.  You know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first I want to answer just directly on its own terms, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then I do have some questions -- issues about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

premise. 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

You know, directly on its own terms, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would be very easy for you to write an opinion to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing in this opinion condones what Mr. Scruggs did in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case.  We think it would have been entirely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate for him to have been referred to bar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel, for him to have been disqualified as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relators' attorney, for a substantial monetary sanction 

   

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

28 

to be levied against him.  In this case, there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual findings, right?  It's not just us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothesizing.  There's no ambiguity on this.  Factual 

  

  

 

 

 

 

findings that are not clearly erroneous, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relators themselves were not culpable, did not know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about these actions. 

 

 

            

And the ordinary rule in cases where a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer engages -- I'm sorry. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you have, just on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

top of your head somewhere -- I -- I because I want to 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

read this. 

 

12 

13 

            

MR. SINGH:  Petition Appendix 67A is where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you'll find the district court's finding on this, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

believe. 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

            

MR. SINGH:  You know, that the relators did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not know, and then that was affirmed on appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Okay. 

  

  

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But parties are usually held 

  

 

 

 

 

 

accountable for the actions of their attorneys. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SINGH:  To be sure, they are, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ordinarily, when the attorney is acting within the scope 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of representation.  So if an attorney shows up and --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't show up to a hearing, if an attorney files or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't file a document on the client's behalf, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

client has to live with what's in those documents or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that nonappearance.  But when attorneys engage in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this sort of extrajudicial chicanery, you know, without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their client's knowledge, the ordinary rule is you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismiss a case with prejudice.  That's true in the vast 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority of circuits, and this Court really hasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gotten into that.  But that -- that is the ordinary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule, and that makes sense. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

            

And that condition is heightened, here, 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

right?  Because as -- as the statute makes clear, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress made clear in 1986, the government is also an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interested party in this case, and an innocent one that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will suffer if dismissal is done.  So I think you can 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

check, you know, the potential that it will be open 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

season with some well works -- well-worded and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strongly-worded dictum in this opinion, no problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You see, I -- I think this 

   

   

  

 

 

 

is going to protect the government's investigations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But the consequence of this is that there is a document 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhere in the court that says Joe Smith is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant in what could be a very harmful case to Joe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Smith.  If Joe Smith is innocent, for example, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unjustified.  Where does he read about that?  In a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint?  No.  He reads about it in the national 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

press. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

1 

            

Now, that's a harmful thing.  And -- and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

seals are not just this case.  They are national 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

security cases, privacy cases, trademark cases, all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of business cases.  So it is a serious thing when 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone deliberately breaks a court seal and reveals the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

contents to the national press.  Well, it's not just the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

department that has an interest in this.  It's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States judicial system that has an interest in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  And that's what poses the problem.  And your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

opponent here is saying when you get to the bottom of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, given the seriousness of what went on, this is too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

light a sanction.  At least that's how I'm seeing it. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

that. 

15 

            

And I would appreciate your comments on 

   

 

 

 

 

MR. SINGH:  Absolutely.  So, you know, we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

don't diminish the seriousness of seal violations at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all.  But I think all the examples you gave, Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer, really illustrate that what we are talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here is a regime where district courts, for ages, have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied discretionary inherent powers-type rules or 

 

 

 

 

 

administrated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come up with case-specific appropriate circumstances --

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate sanctions based on the circumstances of each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, which is exactly what the district court did in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

this case. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

1 

            

The district court was not blind to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

Mr. Scruggs' bad faith.  Took it into account 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely, but understood that there were intervening 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

facts here. 

 

5 

            

And, you know, I think also, as we talk 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

about how to proceed forward with this case, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's worth just pausing for a moment on -- on what's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened since, you know.  This case now --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And before you -- I want to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

get a thorough answer of this because --

   

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

MR. SINGH:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- however this case got 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

here, it's here.  And so viewed in your legal framework 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's most favorable, I can read to you.  I can read 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your opponent as saying, look, say something and do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something, like remand it, that realize -- that makes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people realize this is a very serious thing.  Though, of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, I think you are right in saying this is the kind 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of thing that district courts do as part of their job, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weighing various factors.  But what would you want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

add to say to me, no, he was not overly lenient here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. SINGH:  Sure.  So -- so let me actually 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

go back to what would have been the second half of my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer to Justice Alito.  There are some issues with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise that this was consummate bad-faith conduct.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

think in 1986 Congress made it clear that what it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to do is stop defendants from being tipped off 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about False Claims Act lawsuits.  That was the goal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Consummate bad faith conduct would be a relator's lawyer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaching out to the defendant. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

Here, what Scruggs did was a little bit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

different.  Although he sent the evidentiary disclosure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to the press, he sent it as background for their pieces. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He informed them that it was under seal, and that's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characterization that State Farm has used, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background characterization, page 8 of their brief, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in all their briefs below. 

 

 

 

 

            

And so I think he was intimating to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

folks he sent it to that it was not for further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

disclosure. 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Now, those folks happened to be journalists, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and State Farm from this reads, oh, isn't it so bad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because journalists have a very large platform?  Yes. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

But journalists also have ethics, and the ethical rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of journalism wouldn't allow them to quote or attribute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material that's given to them as background.  And so I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think there is a real sense in which the disclosures 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here were not intended to, you know, achieve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectives that Congress was trying to prohibit in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seal requirement.  So in that sense, I think this is not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

1 

the archetypical bad-faith conduct that Congress was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

talking about. 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

            

Now, I am sensitive to your point about what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about defendants' reputations.  We don't think Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cared about that in 1986, but even if it did, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know -- and of course, that is important in cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving trade secrets and other kinds of seal orders. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You know, the right remedy in all of those cases is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages to the defendant, right?  It's not allow the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant to get away with fraud against the government, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so that's why I started this part of the argument by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, you know, the question is really not do we deter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and punish; it's how.  Are we going to do it in a way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that makes sense or are we going to do it in a way that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

is counterproductive? 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Now, State Farm is upset because there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really not a great way to punish Mr. Scruggs anymore. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He's been disbarred.  He went to jail for a while, and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he is no longer a part of the case.  In fact, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Scruggs has not been part of this case for 3,148 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

days.  That's how long ago he withdrew. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

In the intervening periods, we have had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mountains of discovery, dozens of depositions, a jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

trial showing that State Farm defrauded the government, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a verdict affirmed on appeal, and now we are here.  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

you know, a lot of water has gone under the bridge since 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then, and so, you know, to the extent, Justice Breyer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that what you're really asking is what can we do about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this particular case, I think we ought to take that into 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

account, too. 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

            

You know, there has been no misconduct now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and no one accused of misconduct in this case for more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than 3,000 days, and State Farm, in the interim, has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been proven guilty. 

 

 

            

Now, State Farm says consider it all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ex-ante, right, just ignore all of that, but that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really, I think, the proper application of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary test.  You know, when you think about how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to apply discretion in a particular case, I think we can 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

be sensitive to reality.  You know, we don't have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blind ourselves to what's happening, and I think that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way that courts have always conducted these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

inquiries. 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

The last thing that I want to -- I want to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

point out, and then, you know, if there are no further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions I'll rest, is that, you know, State Farm says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the statute asks very little of relators.  That is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just patently false. 

 

 

            

My clients spent a decade in these careers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

before they spotted a grievous fraud against the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

1 

2 

government.  They blew the whistle.  They lost their 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

careers.  They lost their jobs. 

  

 

 

 

3 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think that it 

    

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

honestly asks very little of them when it comes to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seal requirement.  Just don't disclose it. 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

8 

lot. 

9 

            

MR. SINGH:  So --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's not asking a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SINGH:  So State Farm's position on this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

has morphed a little bit over time.  In the lower courts 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they -- they were arguing that the disclosure of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations or the substance of the fraud is itself, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, a violation of the seal.  Now, they've come to --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they kept that in footnote 10 of their opening brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now they have sort of pared it back, and I think now 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finally it's clear that they are not taking that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position, and I think that that's true. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

I think also, though, the fact that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very easy to comply with the seal takes a lot of wind 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out of the sails of their deterrence argument, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As they understand the seal now, Mr. Scruggs or any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney can avoid violating the seal by, like, editing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the document for 20 minutes.  Right?  The evidentiary 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

disclosure that he sent to journalists, very easy to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just include the allegations and strip out the details 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

that reveal the existence of the lawsuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

And so you don't need a particularly -- and, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

you know, he doesn't get a lot of benefit in this case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out of disclosing the allegations -- the existence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lawsuit, because, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the harm to the reputation, if your goal is to tar and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

feather the defendant in the press, the way you do is by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosing the committed fraud, which --

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But I mean, 

   

  

  

 

 

10 

11 

12 

if -- if Mr. Scruggs stands on the courthouse steps and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discloses the underlying facts, I think people can put 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

two and two together and realize that he just might be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

filing a lawsuit. 

   

14 

            

MR. SINGH:  I think that's possible, Your 

    

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Honor, and so, you know, that gets back to the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of what is and isn't a violation. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

I don't understand them to be taking that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position in this case, and those kind of closed-case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations, you know, they aren't really before you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And, you know, as the summary of the history of False 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Claims Act seal violations tells you, that kind of stuff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really is not happening.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

              

I think that we are talking about a handful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of cases, less than .3 percent of all False Claims Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases have ever involved an arguable seal violation, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

37 

a vanishingly small fraction of those involve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations of bad faith, right? 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

To the extent that State Farm wants you to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

adopt either a blanket rule of dismissal or even a rule 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is geared toward dismissal through application of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary factors, you -- they are really trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throw the baby out with the bath water here.  It is a --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, a dramatic overreaction, especially when, you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

know, as here, the government, whose interests are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principally affected, is telling you that you don't need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do that. 

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

If there are no further questions --

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what do you make of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

the -- how much weight do you think should be given to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that the government doesn't think that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal is appropriate in this situation? 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

What -- what -- does the statute say that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

the complaint shall be filed under seal and shall be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

main -- maintained under seal unless the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

waives that? 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. SINGH:  -- not exactly.  So for the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

first 60 days, the government definitely can't waive the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seal.  The seal can only be extended past 60 days of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's motion, so there is a certain amount of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion involved on whether the seal will continue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

1 

            

We think it kind of makes sense to afford 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

the government more weight after that 60-day period. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here, the first seal violation didn't happen until day 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

103, and so, you know, we are kind of in that zone.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think the government's -- should -- say should account 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a lot, especially in this case. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

As a general proposition, you know, we are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

not urging like blind deference to the government or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference on the issue of statutory interpretation, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are saying it's very clear that Congress is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principally concerned with protecting the government. 

 

 

 

 

 

And when the government tells you -- and, yeah, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will always be a balance here, right?  The government's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

interest may have been harmed by a seal violation, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they weren't in this case. 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

By the way, that's an important point.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

know, there is a finding about that.  State Farm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

admitted -- you'll find it at Joint Appendix page 67 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they didn't learn about the lawsuit before the seal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was lifted.  And so, you know, there is no harm to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government here, but there would be harm from -- for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal, right?  They all have to pick up the laboring 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oar in a massive discovery effort to carry the case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward.  It will cost a lot of money; it will prevent 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them from pursuing other frauds. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

1 

            

And those are the types of interest that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

Congress was trying to deal with in 1986, because in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1986 it was clear that there was a tidal wave of fraud 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against the government, more than the government could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibly hope to address using its own resources.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relators were marshaled as force multipliers to help 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that effort.  And every time the government has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take over for a relator, those resources come from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhere.  Even if the government gets a bigger 

   

  

 

 

 

 

recovery on the back end, those resources come from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhere.  And they take attention away from other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

frauds that the government could be pursuing, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermine Congress's objectives. 

 

 

14 

            

And so when -- in the rare case where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

government steps in and says, dismiss this case, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they have already intervened or some other innocent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit factors where they decide it's important to send 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a message, we think courts should really listen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In this case, where the government has done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the opposite, we think they should listen, too. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank you.

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

2 

            

MR. BASH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

please the Court: 

 

 

4 

            

Given the focus of the earlier portion of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

the argument, I will -- I'm happy to answer questions 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about why the automatic dismissal rule is wrong, but I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will jump right to what we think the standard should be, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how we think the Court ought to write the opinion, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then how we think the Court ought to dispose of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

case. 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

We think the standard for how to remedy a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seal violation incorporates the basic background 

 

 

 

 

 

flexibility that district courts have always had to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy violations of protective orders and sealing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orders as informed by the basic purpose of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision, which I think, as everyone has acknowledged 

   

 

 

 

 

 

now, is to protect the government by making sure that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential targets of criminal and civil investigations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not tipped off. 

 

 

 

            

And the reason you need that in the FCA is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the filing of the complaint does something very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special.  It triggers the duty of the government to come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in and say whether it's going to intervene. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So that's why, Justice Sotomayor, it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the factual allegations of fraud.  It's actually the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

filing of the complaint because that is what triggers a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty on behalf of the government to investigate and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell the Court whether it's going to intervene. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

5 

Court --

 

6 

            

As far as the standard in the way this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and -- and why does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

the government need that latitude? 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. BASH:  It needs that latitude because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

defendants could potentially take steps to stymie an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation if they know that there's an actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government attorney looking at this right now because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they have to look at it under the statute.  That was, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, Congress's thinking in 1986, and I don't even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

really take Petitioner to disagree with that at this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

point. 

16 

            

In -- in terms of how to write the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

opinion --

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So -- well, let's get to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, okay, because do we look at the situation as it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existed at the time of the violation and the risk it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created?  Or do we look at it ex post facto and decide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it didn't, in fact, happen, so there is no harm? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shouldn't the severity be determined at the time it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

occurred? 

25 

            

Giving a complaint to a news media is 

   

   

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

probably the best way to tip off a defendant.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually more likely to do it than failing to serve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government on time for which many circuits automatically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismiss the complaint, even though that could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered harmless if the government is served late and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes in and asks for an extension.

7 

            

8 

            

MR. BASH:  Well, let me take --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is a disparity on 

   

  

 

 

 

9 

10 

how courts are treating those situations, but that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily at issue here. 

 

 

 

11 

            

But what is at issue is, what do we measure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

the appropriate sanction to be and based on what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

evaluation? 

14 

            

MR. BASH:  Well, let me take the general 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

question and bring it to the facts here, and then talk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about that question of the disparity about how courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are treating the different kinds of violations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

The answer on the general question is they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

are both relevant.  Under the standard articulated below 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the standard we've advocated, you look at both the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual harm to the government, just like often attempt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes are not punished as strongly as crimes that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually result in harm, but you also look at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

severity of the violation, and we think there's a direct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correlation between the severity and the potential harm. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

If you actually give the complaint to the defendant, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm -- the potential harm is enormous.  If you tell one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person who is not affiliated with the defendant, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential harm is less.  So it's relevant in that way. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And, of course, there is intent and bad faith. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And we don't discount that other factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be relevant in idiosyncratic cases.  We think in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mine run cases, those are the key factors.  Let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just take it to the facts here.

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

            

11 

            

It's true --

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Before you get to the facts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

here, I have this thought in my mind, which is that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a court order.  People don't normally take it on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves to decide whether to follow it or not.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't like it, lift it.  But while it's there, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

follow it. 

 

17 

            

And this court order does have a possible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

consequence in some case that if it is violated, it will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause harm to a defendant who learns for the first time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he is being sued by reading The New York Times. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

Okay? 

22 

            

Now, that may or may not hurt some.  It may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

hurt some a lot.  Now, can that be taken into account? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I would say in an appropriate case, absolutely.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has to be concerned in working out a sanction, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

1 

overall fairness of the situation, and that's part of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

it. 

3 

            

4 

            

What do you think of that? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BASH:  I didn't disagree with anything 

    

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

you said.  I think the Court could take that into 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account.  It couldn't have made a difference here 

   

  

 

 

 

 

because those three journalists did not leak the suit to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the public.  So the -- State Farm couldn't have read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it in The New York Times. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

And what we think -- while these violations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

were certainly in bad faith, what we think mitigates it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and at least makes the district court -- means that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court did not abuse its discretion here is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't appear -- as Mr. Singh was saying earlier, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't appear this was designed to publicize this suit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

Scruggs was representing a lot of clients 

   

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

bringing non-FCA suits.  He did not, for example, leak 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this complaint to the media members.  He leaked the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidentiary disclosures.  And to be sure, they said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was a lawsuit.  But it seems designed to have been 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background for the general allegations of fraud for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those three journalists.  So if it was intentional, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was in bad faith. 

 

 

 

24 

            

But if the question was, did this District 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

Court abuse its discretion in declining to dismiss these

relators with prejudice who had already secured new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel because the counsel would respond to this --

3 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When would the government 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

be hurt by a sealing violation? 

   

 

 

 

5 

            

MR. BASH:  I think what Congress had in mind 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

is defendants taking steps to thwart the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation; for example, destroying evidence, 

 

 

 

 

declining to cooperate once they know that there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formal investigation of them.  I think that's what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Congress had in mind. 

 

 

 

11 

            

I'll note, though, that the Senate Report, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

for those who look at that kind of thing, said that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expected -- that the Senate expected that there would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be many instances where a seal violation would harm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government.  So I don't think it's surprising that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this hasn't happened often. 

 

 

 

            

And Mr. Singh referred to the appendix in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the petition that lists 48 cases that supposedly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved seal violations.  Petitioner put that together 

  

 

 

 

 

 

obviously at the cert stage.  Some of those don't even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve seal violations.  I think they said they relate 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the seal requirement. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In your brief, you did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say -- on page 27 of your brief, you said that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reputational harm to the defendant could be relevant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

46 

1 

determining a sanction for seal violation. 

   

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. BASH:  That's right, Justice Ginsburg, 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

in an idiosyncratic case.  And the reason I say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

idiosyncratic is, as we discussed, lower courts have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held and we agree that merely disclosing the allegations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of fraud does not violate the seal.  So the sort of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reputational harm you'd be talking about is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incremental harm from the disclosure that a suit has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

been filed. 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You were going to tell us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

how to write the ideal platonic opinion? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. BASH:  I wouldn't presume to say the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

platonic opinion.  But to the extent the Court seeks our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recommendation in how to write the opinion, we think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the overall focus should be courts should remedy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these seal orders like they always remedy protective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orders and seal orders, with a healthy dose of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion, but, in light of the purpose of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision, to protect the government. 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

More specifically, the three factors 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

identified by the courts below:  actual harm to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government; severity of the violation, which I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

correlates with potential harm; and intent or bad faith 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the three key factors in a mine run case.  But we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think the Court should exclude that in an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

1 

2 

idiosyncratic case.  Defendant's reputation or other 

  

 

 

 

 

factors could be relevant. 

 

 

 

3 

            

We also think -- Justice Alito, I think this

22

24 

responds to your questions about making sure to send a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong message that these violations will not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolerated.  We think the Court could have dismissed this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case here.  We don't say that it would have been an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse of discretion to dismiss the case here.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think if the Court's worried about sending the signal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that intentional violations don't matter, it could say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court would have been perfectly within its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion to dismiss here.  If State Farm had sought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional sanctions, the Court would have been in its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion to refer counsel to the bar or to impose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other sanctions, but they didn't seek that here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the abuse of discretion standard, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, should be particularly robust in this context 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the government relies on the relator.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit's not dismissed.  The government doesn't intervene. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

There is a trial of however many days, as Mr. Singh 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said.  And to unwind that all after the fact, I mean, I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it shows why the abuse of discretion standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be particularly robust in this context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Chief Justice, I just wanted to raise a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

response --

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

1 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think deference ought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

to be given to the government?  And if so, as to what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parts of the test? 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. BASH:  Well, what we say in the brief is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

deference ought to be given to the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement that it's been harmed.  So we use the phrase 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"substantial weight," and we're not weighted to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phraseology.  But if the government comes in and says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes or no on harm, we think that should be given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

deferential --

 

11 

            

12 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  On actual harm? 

  

 

 

 

MR. BASH:  Yeah.  Well, we didn't come in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

here and say either that or whether the suit should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed.  We just didn't say anything.  And we think, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as I said, that the Court would have been within its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion to dismiss this case.  We just think this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court ought to say, this is a classic area for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

discretion. 

19 

            

Mr. Chief Justice, Ms. Sullivan said she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

raised the question of the application -- her client 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised the question of misapplication all the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through.  We sure don't read the petition to raise that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  It wouldn't be out of the ordinary for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court to go on and say, this is how the abuse of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion standard ought to be applied. 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

through 28 of the petition.  We don't read those to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preserve an application argument.  Those are making 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguments like the multifactor standard is difficult to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply.  I think there is one sentence on page 28 that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe you could read that way.  We don't read that to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have fairly preserved the application argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

And then just to -- and the waiver question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is a whole other set of arguments they've made in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their briefs that haven't come up in argument today 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about other violations that they think occurred that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower courts held not to be violations.  That is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extremely far outside the scope of the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented, and they haven't raised it at oral argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I just -- that point is clearly waived, I think. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  On the issue of harm to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government, did I understand you to say that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is actual harm and not likelihood of harm at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time of the disclosure? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BASH:  We think on that factor, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual harm, but we think the second factor, severity, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correlates with potential harm.  So if you issue a press 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

release saying we brought a suit, the potential for harm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is enormous. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And do you think it might be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

helpful for this Court to clarify that when we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about the severity of the violation, part of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we are talking about is the likelihood that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation might cause harm? 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

MR. BASH:  I think it would be helpful for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

the opinion to say that.  I don't think the courts below 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were under a misapprehension about that.  I mean, they 

    

   

 

 

 

 

talked about the most severe violation being, like I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, just a blatant -- oh, I'm sorry.  I see my red 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

light is on. 

 

 

11 

            

12 

sentence. 

13 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BASH:  They talked about the most severe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

violation being just a blatant filing of the complaint 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

publicly.  And that is what correlates with potential 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm versus selective disclosures to people that are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affiliated with the defendant. 

 

 

 

18

23 

24 

reversing or vacating, we trust that you will clarify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that actual harm to the government is not a requirement

your question, Justice Ginsburg, when will the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government concede actual harm, it's not dispositive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's dispositive if the government says there's actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm, yes, or heavily weighted and possibly dispositive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they say it. 

 

 

 

            

But to remind you, as we point out on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 20 of our reply brief, the government hasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted it was actually harmed, except in one case, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Le Blanc-ITT case, in 30 years.  So you should not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require actual harm.  We agree with the government that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential harm, which is important, is captured by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

severity factor, but that the lower courts misapplied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the severity factor by looking to what risk transpired 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather than what risk occurred at the time of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

disclosure.

24 

25 

            

As to whether that was a serious risk, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

must respectfully disagree that there was no possible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tip-off here from the news statements.  Mr. Singh 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred you to page JA67, and he suggested that State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Farm wasn't tipped off at all.  With respect, you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look for yourself and see State Farm's lawyers saying, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't say that we didn't have suspicion.  We heard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congressman Taylor talking about his meeting with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rigsbys.  So there was a potential for tip-off here. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

8 

9 

10

12 

judicial system, as Justice Breyer pointed out, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addition to harm to the government, this is a case where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Gulfport jury found fraud against an insurer in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wake of horrible losses from Hurricane Katrina, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government, whose delegated power the relators are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking to assert, found after three years of copious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation -- you can look for yourself on JA214 --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government found that there -- in the words of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at JA14, we find no indication that wind damage was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributed to flooding, or that flood insurance paid for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

wind damages. 

 

14 

            

If you're concerned nonetheless about any 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

windfall to the defendants, it won't happen, because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government can come in and pick this case and relate the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint back to the time of the relator's filing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

And finally, as to the Rigsbys involvement, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

if you have any factual questions about imputation, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course that can be handled on remand for the application 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a proper test that makes willfulness primary, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

severity assessed, ex-anti not ex-post, and that does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider, as the government conceded it should, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's reputational harm.  The government concedes 

  

 

 

 

 

that on page 27, and you should adopt that in your test

as the Second Circuit did in Pilon.

But as to the Rigsbys' involvement, first we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3

5 

6 

think, as a matter of law, there should be imputation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for lawyers' conduct to their clients in most cases, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly in qui tam cases where the relators cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represent themselves pro se. 

 

 

 

7 

            

No one can represent the government; that --

you can't be a pro se lawyer representing the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government.  The lower courts are clear.  You must have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

a lawyer. 

 

11 

            

Hallstrom said a trained lawyer who made an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

inadvertent mistake still bound his client to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure of the pre-filing notice requirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

And we think imputation here is easy as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19

matter of law, but if you think it's a question of fact, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then if you look to Mr. Singh's cite to Justice Breyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Petition Appendix 67A, it's actually Petition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix 68A where you'll find the key evidence about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the relator's relationship to Scruggs.  And I commend 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that page to you because it did not find them not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

culpable. 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

At 68A of the Petition Appendix, it didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find the relators not culpable; it found them to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not approved, authorized, or initiated the disclosures. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's not the same as not being intimately involved

with those disclosures.

findings here in disqualifying prior plaintiff's counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at JA16 and 20 that there was a suite -- there was a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sham contract.  I don't know many lawyers who pay their 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clients, but this time Scruggs paid the Rigsbys to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their material witnesses, their employees, their joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

venturers.

You can look either to the Northern District 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Alabama docket where Judge Acker found them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conjoined, Scruggs and the Rigsbys, and to be joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venturers, or you can look to Judge Senter's decisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this docket where he finds that the relationship was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a sham.  And you can say that it would be inappropriate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and abuse of discretion not to find imputation here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With respect, we ask that you reverse or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand for decision on a proper balancing test that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't give carte blanche to these kinds of bad faith 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations, which harm not just the government in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long run, but our system of justice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank you. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the
