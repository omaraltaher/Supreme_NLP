CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next this morning in Case 16-405, BNSF Railway v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tyrrell. 

            

Mr. Tulumello. 

 

          

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. TULUMELLO 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

            

The Montana Supreme Court concluded that 

 

 

 

 

 

BNSF is subject to general personal jurisdiction in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana for two reasons: 

 

 

 

            

First, it held that Montana State courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise general all-purpose jurisdiction over BNSF 

 

 

 

 

 

because BNSF does systematic and continuous business 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity in the State. 

 

 

 

            

Second, it held that Section 56 of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Employers' Liability Act confers personal 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction on State courts. 

 

 

 

            

Both conclusions were wrong. 

 

 

 

            

First, under this Court's decision in 

 

 

 

 

 

Daimler, BNSF is not subject to general personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction in Montana because it is not at home in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana.  Montana is not BNSF's principal place of

business, nor its place of incorporation, and there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing exceptional about BNSF's activities --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Didn't it 

  

  

 

 

 

register in Montana? 

 

 

            

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  It did --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  To do business, doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

it -- isn't it required to register? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  It -- it is required and it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has registered to --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, I thought the --

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  -- to do business. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- Court below didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

reach that question, but does the registration in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana change this discussion? 

 

 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  It -- it doesn't, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  It -- it doesn't. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then if I, as an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

individual, establish residency in multiple places, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be sued for all of my activities there, correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So why can't a corporation? 

   

 

 

MR. TULUMELLO:  Your Honor, so the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding in Daimler was that even doing systematic, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuous, sizable business would not be sufficient to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confer general personal jurisdiction.  I understand --

    

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if you treat a

corporation like a person, which we seem to be doing, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why isn't their registration of an agent for purposes of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

accepting service enough? 

 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  Well, if you treat the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

corporation as a person, I think what this Court's due 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

process cases say is that you look for where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation could be fairly regarded as at home.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be equivalent to the personal domicile. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in Daimler and Goodyear, this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested that the paradigmatic places would be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal place of business and the place of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporation.  Registering to do business is simply one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of a company's business activities, but it does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not, in and of itself, come anywhere close to subjecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a corporation to general personal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, there's an 

  

 

 

 

argument -- there was an argument in the case we just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heard that -- that by registering, you effectively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent to jurisdiction and consent is always a good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis for. 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  It is -- it -- Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I think as -- I think with respect to consent, the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument especially in this case that by registering to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business -- to do business in Montana law, BNSF 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consented to any kind of jurisdiction is expressly

negated by the text of the Montana statute, which says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registering to do business in and of itself does not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confer personal jurisdiction in this State. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course, the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

the issue, I guess, was not addressed below and is not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before us. 

 

            

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  Correct. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm looking at 

  

 

 

 

 

footnote 1 in the government's brief. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  Your Honor, so I -- I would 

   

   

  

 

 

 

draw -- I would draw a distinction about how the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

registration issue can play in this case.  One is, is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration as part of the overall level of activity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged in by the company, is that enough to make it at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home.  Clearly we think it cannot.  Registration, you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

know, running trains through the State, that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough to make it at home in Montana. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's a separate issue of whether 

   

 

 

 

registration in and -- in and of itself is some sort of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implied consent to -- to be subject to general personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, and the Montana Supreme Court didn't reach 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that issue.  So with respect to Section 56, the Montana 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme Court reached the truly unique and unprecedented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion that Congress, in confirming the concurrent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject matter of the State courts, meant for the first

time to confer personal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

As this Court held in the Second Employers' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Liability Act cases, decided just two years after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 56 was enacted, Section 56 was designed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abrogate Supreme Court of Connecticut's decision in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hoxie, which had held that -- that -- that Congress in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FELA had tried to establish exclusive Federal court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction over FELA claims.  So Congress, in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrent jurisdiction clause in FELA, confirmed that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State courts retained concurrent subject matter 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

Concurrent subject matter jurisdiction is 

 

 

 

 

also a term of art that has for 200 years, since the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judiciary Act, and it's in the Judiciary Act, has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood to refer to subject matter jurisdiction and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not personal jurisdiction.  Respondents don't say a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

single historical example of where subject matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction has been deemed to include --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It was related somewhat in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the last case.  Could Congress pass a statute conferring 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction on -- in Montana State courts under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances of this case? 

 

 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  Well, we don't -- we --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, let me -- I'll take that in parts because the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one -- one part of it raises a significant --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The thing is I don't know 

   

  

 

 

 

 

8 

it was that essential for your argument.  I'm just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curious what your view is. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  I would -- I would --

    

   

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy, I would take it in two parts. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress, we believe, could constitutionally provide for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide service-of-process provisions in Federal 

 

 

 

 

courts.  I think where the issue gets very difficult is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether Congress could prescribe the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction of the State courts.  It's not something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress has ever done.  There is no historical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example of that and it would raise some serious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

federalism constraints and we also argue serious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourteenth Amendment constraints. 

 

 

            

In any event, FELA does not attempt to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  Again, as the Court in the -- almost 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemporaneous decision in the Second Employers' 

 

 

 

 

 

Liability Act made clear that Congress was not trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enlarge or regulate the jurisdiction of the State courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or to control their modes of procedure.  And I think the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences of trying to read a special venue statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as containing a grant of personal jurisdiction would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

really call into question what the 200 or odd-so special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue statutes in the Federal code are doing, whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they have some heretofore unknown grant of personal

jurisdiction.  The may-have language is simply not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

way that Congress traditionally has spoken to the issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of personal jurisdiction.  The may-have language is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

currently in the general venue statute.  Nobody thinks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 1391 provides for personal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The general venue statute from 1948 to 1988 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used the may-have language as suit may -- may be brought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wherever a corporation is doing business.  Again, nobody 

   

  

 

 

 

 

thought that the general venue statute at that time was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an independent source of personal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

Instead, the way that Congress speaks to Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal jurisdiction is through changing the options 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for service of process, and that was established in 1838 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Tollen v. Sprodd case.  It was reiterated in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Robertson in 1925 when the Court actually explored the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference between venue-type language and 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional-type language and cited specific 

 

 

 

 

statutory examples of where Congress had expanded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court jurisdictions. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are -- are you saying that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

service-of-process language is an absolute necessity? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  I don't think it's an 

    

 

 

 

 

absolutely necessity.  The Court -- Congress could say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something about personal jurisdiction itself like in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current Rule 4.  But I do think there must be some

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Aren't there some statutes 

  

 

 

 

 

that look like the first sentence of this statute that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been read as personal jurisdiction requirements? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  It -- I -- I -- Respondents

process provisions from statutes that set up -- you

authority, the agency just, you know, won't be able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get out -- get out the door or do its job. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But, by and large, as this Court said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Omni -- I mean, this Court has never inferred a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service-of-process provision, and the Court in Omni 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave, you know, three very good reasons for why that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be a bad idea.  Congress knows how to do it and so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't want to presume that Congress doesn't know how to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do it.  Second, that legislative rule making has the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit of, you know, better predictability.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and third, that in light of the long tradition of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how Congress has spoken to -- to these issues, it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be unwise for courts to get into the business of common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law rule making for establishing personal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  One of the amici supporting

Respondents says that adopting your position would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

create chaos in the industry.  What is your response to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  I -- I think just the 

    

   

 

 

 

opposite is true, Justice Alito.  Adopting our rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would bring some predictability and some order to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

industry.  Right now, it is a true wild west of FELA 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims being filed in forums like Montana, and like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these cases where the plaintiffs are not from Montana, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

none of the alleged negligence occurred in Montana, none 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the alleged injury occurred in Montana, and yet we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still subject to suit there. 

 

 

 

 

            

So FELA plaintiffs using specific 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction or general jurisdiction, but going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forums that have a reasonable connection to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

litigation will, in fact, you know, bring order to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area of the justice system. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what about someone 

  

 

 

 

 

who's working very far -- routinely they work very far 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from their home, they're injured very far from home, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what would your rule do to them? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  The -- that -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

individual would have specific jurisdiction in the place 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where they were injured.  If they were regularly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

employed in a particular State, let's say Montana, and

they were sent out of State, I think there would be --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there may well be specific jurisdiction depending on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the analysis of the episode-in-suit.  Did the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervisor send the person there?  Was equipment from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

Montana sent out with that person that, you know, caused 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an injury?  But specific jurisdiction would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

available.  And, of course, the -- the safety valve of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all-purpose jurisdiction would be available as well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY 

 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

MS. SAHARSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

So there are two questions before the Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Court said in Omni that in order to assert personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, you have to have a statute or a rule 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

making the defendant amenable to service of process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's a question of, here, is it Section 56 or Montana 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  We've explained why we think it's Montana law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then the second question is if they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercising service of process on Montana law, does -- is

that general jurisdiction consistent with the standards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

the Court set out in Daimler and Goodyear, and we don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it is. 

 

 

            

So on -- particularly on the Section 56 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, because that's one where there's a strong 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Federal interest in not having words that don't say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything about service of process being interpreted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in fact say something about service of process, we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a first sentence that refers to venue only in Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts, and then a second sentence referring to State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts.  But all it does is to clarify that there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrent jurisdiction in the State courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And we just don't see how you can get to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conferral of personal jurisdiction in the State courts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially when we know, very clearly from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative record, that Congress was trying to solve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two particular problems, the first in the first sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with venue in Federal courts, and then the second in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence -- second sentence with making sure that State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts understood that they could hear these claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think it is also noticeable, as 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's counsel suggested, that we have not -- we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not aware of any example in which Congress has used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language of this type to confer personal -- or even more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicit language to confer personal jurisdiction in the

14 

State courts, and also, that even at the time, back in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1910, Congress knew how to confer personal jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it wanted to. 

 

 

 

            

We gave examples in -- of the Clayton Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from 1914 in our brief, the Credit Mobilier Act in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's brief, and then these were also discussed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Robertson case from 1925.  In that, Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knows how to do venue versus service of process.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has continued up through the Court's decision in Omni. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So we just don't think that Section 56 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be interpreted to be the first statute -- statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do it, especially where the implication with respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the second question would be to say that a company 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like BNSF is subject to general personal jurisdiction in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 or more States. 

 

 

 

            

If the Court's decisions in Goodyear and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Daimler mean anything, it's that that just can't be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Respondents note 

  

 

 

 

 

what we said in Daimler that, in addition to the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of incorporation and the principal place of business, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there may be particular circumstances where another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State could be considered their home as well.  And given 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the volume of activity in the State in terms of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical plant, it's a railroad, goes through -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

15 

forget the number of employees -- why doesn't that fit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that additional criteria? 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, the Court described 

  

 

 

 

 

that category very narrowly as a place where the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

contacts are not just that they are continuous and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

systematic business contacts, but where they are so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant that you consider the company at home there, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's like the company's domicile. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the only court -- example that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's given of that to this point is the Perkins case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you have the company that actually relocated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during the war from the Philippines to Ohio.  And there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they said that --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What does that do in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical 50/50?  Let's say a State has a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

headquarters in Delaware.  It sells 51 percent of its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goods in New York and 51 percent -- and 49 percent in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California.  Almost equal number of employees, a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

difference of 10 percent, let's say.  Same amount of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property, whatever.  And I'm assuming this railroad 

  

 

 

 

 

 

could fit that description in a number of States. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why isn't it at home where a substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

amount of its business is going on? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, because that would make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the railroad at home in so many places for purposes of

general jurisdiction.  And the Court said that where the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

focus should be going forward, and we think that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes sense, is in specific jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In the situation that you posited where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are these two States where a lot of things are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happening, that's where you would expect a lot of causes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of action to arise.  And so there would be personal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction over the defendant there.  It would just be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on a specific jurisdiction. 

   

 

            

The Court conceived of general jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

as a fallback, a place where you couldn't just subject 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant to suit there for a claim arising out of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

related-to its contacts with the State --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the logic of --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. SAHARSKY:  -- just any type of claim. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the logic of --

  

 

 

 

 

 

what's the logic of that? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  It's --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's -- what's --

  

 

 

 

 

other than we said it. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It certainly was very 

  

 

 

 

 

different than what International Shoe ever considered. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What's -- what's the unfairness?  We go back a little 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bit to the question that -- to the predecessor case.  If

you're present in both States in an almost equal amount, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

and you are doing the bulk of your business equally, why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't you feel that you're going to be hauled into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both places? 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, the difference between 

  

 

 

 

 

being hauled into court for claims that arise out of or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are related to the context with the State, as opposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims that are just any kind of possible claims.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the reason that the Court talked about you being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at home is because it's the equivalent of like domicile 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a person.  It said what's the equivalent of a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation?  A place where it voluntarily chooses to go 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do its business.  It gets the benefits of that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's law, and then it means that it also has to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the burdens.  And the burdens are not just that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be subject to any claim -- or to the claims that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are related to the State, but to any kind of claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So in somewhere where there is that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship that the corporation has in terms of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporation or principal place of business, it's fair 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the corporation, like a person, where they're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

domiciled, to have to answer for any type of claim.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we're talking about somewhere that you -- that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation is just doing business where it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered at home, it's fair, the Court said, for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

corporation in that circumstance to have to answer for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims that are related to the forum.  But here, we have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

these claims that have just no relationship to the forum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all.  We don't have the plaintiffs from the forum, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have any injury in the forum, the defendants are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not at home or incorporated in the forum. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So we do think it makes sense for general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, as the Court conceived of it in Goodyear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Daimler, to be this kind of safety valve going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward, and that where the bulk of the action would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is in the specific jurisdiction context.  Because after 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all, those are the places where things happened that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

related to the litigation.  There's people there; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's evidence there.  Those States have an interest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in having those claims adjudicated, spending their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juries and their resources on claims that were related 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to and happened in the State. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If the Court has no further questions, we'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

urge that the judgment of the court below be reversed.

For more than a century, injured rail 

   

 

 

 

 

workers have been able to sue their negligent employers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a court of -- in any State where the railroads are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing business.  Congress gave workers the substantial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right so that they, in Justice Jackson's words, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the dice loaded in their favor.  BNSF's view of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 56 would turn this substantial right into an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illusory one. 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why isn't it that we were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

told -- and I think it's correct -- that the language 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's used in Section 56, the wording, "Civil action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may be brought in," is found in some 200-odd venue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes?  So the -- the way this statute is written, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sounds like a venue description, not a personal 

   

   

 

 

 

jurisdiction description. 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Certainly, Justice Ginsburg, we 

  

 

 

 

 

recognize that the -- the language, you know, "where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit may be brought" appears in other statutes and has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been interpreted in that way.  But I think this Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should look at Section 56 as a whole.  We are not aware 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of another statute that, in a single paragraph, has the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- the same language that FELA does, where it has a --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it talks about where suits may be brought, it then goes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on to say that the jurisdiction of the State and Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

courts would be concurrent, and then has some very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

unusual --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  "Concurrent" usually 

  

 

 

means that it's not -- it's a Federal claim, but it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be adjudicated in State as well as Federal court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what concurrent jurisdiction means. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, I -- we think, Your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Honor, in this context it is ambiguous, given -- if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at the statute as a package where it has the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"may" -- "may be brought" language, the "concurrent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction" language, and then the very unusual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision that actually prohibits removal of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State -- of these Federal causes of action into Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  And I would say, you know, to the extent that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court is -- is troubled by the -- our reading of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrent jurisdiction as perhaps an unusual one, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think I should be equally troubled by the -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illusory reading of Section 56 that BNSF would give it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Because the -- at the time that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amended FELA in 1910, it intended for workers not to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to go to the place of incorporation of the company, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or to leave far from their homes in order to bring suit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regardless of where they were injured.  And the reality 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, I -- I think you can't think about this case if you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't accept our reading of FELA as being fair because

workers could still get specific jurisdiction over the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

railroads in a place close to their home.  That's simply 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not going to be the case for many of these workers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

that? 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is -- why is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS. MURRAY:  Well, I think Congress 

   

  

 

 

recognized in 1910 the railroad industry is unique.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have, in many cases, workers traveling five, six, seven 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hours, even to get to their starting work point where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they then travel farther away.  So if you look, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, at Mr. Nelson, he is a resident of the State of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana.  He was injured in the State of Washington. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And under BNSF's view, he would either have to go to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Washington, he'd have to go to Tarrant County, Texas, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he could go to Delaware.  That's simply not the outcome 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress ever would have predicted, given the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language that it adopted in 1910.  And what we know it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was trying to do when it adopted that language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why didn't it say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the action could be brought at plaintiff's residence? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, it considered that, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  And, in fact, it -- the reason it didn't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff's residence language is because industry said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we don't want to have to defend suit in the plaintiff's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residence if we're not doing business there.  So the

doing business planning language, I think, was actually 

   

 

 

 

 

 

22 

seen as being more fair to defendants than just a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff's residence standard. 

 

 

            

And the other thing that I would point out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on that -- that issue, is that in 1947, Congress, again, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered adopting a different standard for Section 56. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

It considered a plaintiff's residence standard, and it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

rejected it, because it actually would have been used at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that point to narrow the scope of places in which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs could have brought their suit. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress was presented with evidence that 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs were bringing suits similar to what our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clients have done here, where the only connection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the suits and the State was the fact that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant was doing business there --

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I -- I haven't 

   

   

  

 

 

looked at a route map, but BNSF, I assume, is doing 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

business in a lot of States.  And this would allow 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs, wherever they reside, wherever they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injured, to sue in any one of those States, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

And we think that that is what Congress intended, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's -- Congress knew that that was, in fact, happening 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 1947 --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even though the

injury -- even though the injury occurred somewhere 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else. 

            

MS. MURRAY:  That's correct.  And I think it 

   

  

  

 

 

 

is because of the unique nature of the railroad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

industry.  You have --

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not the unique 

  

 

 

 

 

 

nature of particular forums?  I mean, the -- the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion in the briefs is that there is a reason that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone, not a resident of Montana, injured in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Washington, would want to sue in Montana.  Is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something we ought to take into consideration? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, I -- I think you can take 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

it into consideration, but I actually think it, in many 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways, favors us.  I -- there are good reasons why 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone would want to bring suit in Montana, even if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they weren't injured there, even if they're not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resident.  I mean, I think as BNSF concedes, there are a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of these cases brought in Montana.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's -- what's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

good reason they would want to sue in Montana? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, from a litigant's 

   

  

 

 

perspective, if you want predictability, you want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know that the court that you're going to knows the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specialized area of law like the back of their hand, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is Montana.  These judges know FELA cases because

they see a lot of them. 

   

 

 

 

24 

            

some --

 

            

So I -- I think there is good reason for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That seems -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

seems a little circular. 

   

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, but it is the practical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reality, in terms of -- of where people are bringing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suits.  I would say it's not the case that all of these 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases are being brought in the State of Montana.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, I think BNSF and its amici certainly try to make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that portrayal, but we don't have any hard data about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And certainly in speaking with attorneys who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

represent FELA plaintiffs, they bring them lots of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different locations, including, you know, other 

 

 

 

 

 

locations where people are not injured.  And the fact of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the matter is the railroad is just doing business there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The other thing I would say is that, you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, whether you're concerned about people bringing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit in the State of Montana, if you were to say that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our clients could not bring suit here, it would also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean that those clients who want to bring suit in their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home State, again, in many instances, are not going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be able to do that. 

 

 

 

 

            

As to the specific jurisdiction question, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, you know, we are in agreement that people could

bring suit in the State where they were injured, but I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually think that the analysis of specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction beyond that State gets quite complicated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

pretty quickly.  You know, it would depend on, is this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person, for example, primarily working in their home 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State.  And the nature of this industry is many of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these -- these workers do not primarily work in their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home States.  They may rarely, if ever, work there. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So in -- under those circumstances, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it is -- you know, it's certainly not what Congress had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in mind when it adopted the statute and said, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by -- by adopting this statute, we are going to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure that people can find the defendant at any point or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place or State along the railroad's tracks and there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring their actions. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And I could understand why 

   

  

 

 

 

Congress -- I could understand why they might have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to allow the injured worker to sue where the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the injury occurred, or where the worker resides, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or where the company is headquartered, but why they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would want to allow a -- a suit in -- in a State that 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfies none of those, really, is hard to understand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

it is actually easier to understand if you sort of set 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it in the context of what was going on at that time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

The railroads -- there were thousands of these injuries. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

And I think Congress recognized, you know, these are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

highly sophisticated interstate transportation 

 

 

 

companies.  They can get to these places of litigation a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot more easily than injured workers who may have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

travel three States over to get to the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I know.  And that 

   

  

  

 

 

would -- you could say that would justify saying --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide a reason for saying you could sue where you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

live, you could limit it to those -- to only those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States where they're doing business.  But why you would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say you can sue anywhere has nothing to do with either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- either the person who's injured or the company 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or -- or the -- or where the injury occurs, really, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hard to understand going forward. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, I -- I do think it is the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

language that Congress chose.  And I -- I would say, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

too, with respect to the --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  With respect to that, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean, we did have -- we say different things in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different cases, but I think Kepner -- Kepner typed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 56, a venue provision, didn't it? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Certainly this -- this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has referred to the provision as a venue provision.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think that's inconsistent with our position

because, as we concede, we think the first sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does, in fact, confer both venue and personal

support for our position, are the Pope and the Boyd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  So Pope, you had a situation very similar to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this where someone brought suit in a State court that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the injury had not occurred.  The only connection 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the railroad was doing business there.  And in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, this Court said this, Section 56, quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"establishes Petitioner's right to sue in Alabama.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides that the employee may bring his suit wherever

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What year is the Pope 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. MURRAY:  It was 1953.  So it's post 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

International Shoe.  And this is a case -- we just -- we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talked about it at page 29 of our response, where the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court has clearly staked out a position that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

doing-business language in the first sentence of Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

56 applies to State courts.  And I think the only way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you can make sense of that is to read Section 56 in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way that we do, that takes the personal jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conferred by sentence --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you have any -- any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

example of any other statute that does what you claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this one does, that is, that -- that determines State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court jurisdiction, that has a provision, which you say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is conferred, that alters the personal jurisdiction of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State court from what it would be without the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal statute? 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  So the -- as I said, we don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a statute that we think mirrors FELA.  We do think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's an unusual statute that was called for by unusual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances.  Probably the closest example is 15 

  

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.C. 77b, it's part of the Securities Act, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute does actually have an express service-of-process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision with respect to Federal courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It also has a concurrent jurisdiction 

   

 

 

 

language in it.  And it has, in fact, in at least some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower courts, been interpreted -- or there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagreement among the lower courts as to whether that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language actually provides or permits State courts to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise personal jurisdiction to the same extent as

29 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The -- the Court in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pope didn't mention personal jurisdiction at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  That's right, Your Honor.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

don't think -- we're not arguing --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that's your 

  

 

 

 

 

strongest authority? 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, I think it is one.  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

certainly think the Boyd case, again, another -- this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one is -- we talk about at pages 31 to 31 -- 32 of our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  The Boyd case is another example where, again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not arguing it's a personal jurisdiction case, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was a case in which this Court read Section 56, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including sentence 2 of Section 56, to confer what it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called a substantial right, but under another provision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of FELA which prohibits any contract, the intent of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is to exempt the carrier from liability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The right that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

the right, I think, they're referring to, is the right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to proceed in State court, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MS. MURRAY:  That's correct, yes. 

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which --

  

 

 

 

MS. MURRAY:  That's --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- which, of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you'd expect that to deal with the second sentence,

because it talks about the concurrent jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

There's a difference between, you can proceed in State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

court and the question of whether there's personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction in a particular State court. 

   

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, I -- I take your point, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Your Honor, but, I think, we don't typically think of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision that just says there's concurrent jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between State and Federal courts and is referring only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to subject-matter jurisdiction.  Certainly in the 

  

 

 

 

 

circumstances like this, where Congress, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought that there was this jurisdiction before and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just wanted to -- to be extra sure to confirm it --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

don't -- we don't typically think of concurrent State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Federal jurisdiction to refer to subject-matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction? 

            

MS. MURRAY:  No.  What I was going to say is 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

we don't typically think of provisions like that as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conferring a substantial, non-waivable right.  And so I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think the -- the Boyd case certainly in terms of looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at what is Section 56 doing, if all it is doing is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that you can bring a -- a cause of action in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court in certain venues and just reconfirming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that State courts have subject-matter jurisdiction, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't normally think of that.  Or it seems

difficult --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wasn't there -- wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

31 

there a decision that suggested that State courts didn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have concurrent -- concurrent jurisdiction and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why Congress made the change? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  There was, Your Honor.  And we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't take issue with the -- the proposition from BNSF 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that is one thing that Congress was doing with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrent jurisdiction language.  It was -- it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

confirming that State and Federal courts both had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject-matter jurisdiction.  But we think given --

  

 

 

 

 

 

given the precedent, given Boyd and Pope, you're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

writing on a blank slate in terms of how you interpret 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 56. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Pope didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

mention personal jurisdiction.  Did Boyd? 

  

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  No.  These are not personal 

  

  

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction cases, but I do think the rationale that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they used in interpreting Section 56 necessarily -- when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you look at what Section 56 is doing, I -- I think you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do have to recognize it is doing something more than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what BNSF says it is doing.  And -- and through Pope, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the language of doing business in sentence 1 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies to sentence 2 somehow, or applies to State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts somehow, and we think that sentence 2 provides

that necessary link. 

 

 

32 

            

If I -- if I could talk briefly about our 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

alternative argument, you know, if this Court were to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read FELA not to permit State courts here to exercise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal jurisdiction, we do think that under this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's determination in Daimler and the preceding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent that there could be general jurisdiction here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well, given the nature of BNSF's contacts with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State of Montana. 

 

 

            

And I think one key in that analysis -- or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one way to frame that analysis is to really look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

railroads as being unique.  This is not -- in -- in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance of BNSF and Montana, you have, again, a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sophisticated interstate commerce company that has, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, been in Montana, through its predecessors, has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been engaged there before Montana was even a State, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

helped to populate the State by bringing in farmers and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ranchers.  There's some of the history of this in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maintenance of Way amicus brief. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, is your argument that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

railroad companies are so unique that they should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to general jurisdiction everywhere? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  I don't think that that would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily have to follow, but I think it is a key 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ingredient as to why BNSF is at home in the State of

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, I mean, at home in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

33 

State of Montana and at home in everyplace else that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operates? 

            

MS. MURRAY:  I -- Your Honor, I think it 

    

   

 

 

 

 

would depend on the other States in which it operates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and its history in -- in those States, the level of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contacts.  I mean, I think in addition to the -- the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

history, if you look at present day, BNSF has a gigantic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footprint in Montana.  That's not true in all of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States in which it operates.  It has over 2100 miles, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

roughly 2100 miles of track, 2200 employees in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State, more than 40 facilities in the State, a permanent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence that crisscrosses the State --

 

 

 

 

 

            

something --

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And there is 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. MURRAY:  -- and has for decades. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand the 

    

 

 

 

notion that railroads -- for those reasons, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously have to have a lot of physical plant, they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to have a lot of workers, they, you know, traverse 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State.  I understand how that might look like 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're at home.  But there are a lot of other 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

industries that have a significant impact.  I don't 

    

   

 

 

 

know, there are interstate banks, airlines.  I suspect 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

that there are agricultural companies that do a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business and cover a lot of land and territory. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

              

I mean, is your -- your test just that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a railroad, or -- or how do you decide what other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

companies and industries are at home in Montana? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, sir, we are not arguing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a standard that would sweep beyond railroads here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think there could be aspects of other industries that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would lend themselves to the same types of analysis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I -- I think that railroads actually are in a pretty 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

unique segment of interest -- industry in the sense of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlike interstate or international banks, you know, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depend on railroads to have a permanent physical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

presence in the State, because, otherwise, you cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually, you know, guarantee that you can carry goods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from one point of the country to another. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So trucking 

  

 

 

 

companies?  Trucking companies, they carry a lot of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

goods, too. 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  And they can go in many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different routes, Your Honor.  I think here where you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

have --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

they're going to take -- what is it? -- 95 across -- not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

95.  90?

They're going to, just like the railroad, is going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow the railroad tracks.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The truckers are 

  

 

 

 

 

going to follow I-80. 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, they're -- they're still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not going to have that same sort of permanent physical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence in the State of laying down 2100 miles of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

track. 

            

The other thing that I would point out with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to BNSF's role in the State of Montana, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Justice Sotomayor's question about the registration, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we do have an alternative argument with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent, but we have all along also argued that the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the registration, the longtime doing of business in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana should -- should play a role and is distinct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from some of the -- the cases that this Court -- Court

And, you know, one other thing to note, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

which, I think, is, again, distinct from -- including 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Daimler, what we know here about BNSF is that it is so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integrated into Montana's economic and political life, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it set up its own government relations shop in the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Montana.  It's got lobbyists there to advocate for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its interests. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, I'm sure a lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of other companies have government relations offices in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State. 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, that may be true, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  And, certainly, I think in this analysis, when 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you are looking at various factors that could lead you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to conclude that BNSF is at home in the State of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana, I think that is one factor that plays a role

cases, for example, with, you know, foreign companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are being dragged into court because their products 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen to -- to land in that State.  Here you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company that has a permanent physical presence and it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

got lobbyists there who are looking out for its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests if it doesn't like what is happening in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts of Montana or the substantive law to which it is

right to bring a Federal action in Montana -- no? --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

under the Section 56, which permits an action to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought in a district in which the defendant shall be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing business? 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  No, Your Honor.  If I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

understand your hypothetical, if we were to bring -- if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court decided that FELA did not address personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction at all, what would happen if we tried to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring our suits in Montana Federal court is that that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court would say, great, you have venue, but I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look to Rule 4 for personal jurisdiction --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's assuming we reach 

  

 

 

 

 

that issue. 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Right.  I suppose if this --

    

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We could just say 

  

 

 

 

 

it's -- we could just say it doesn't apply to State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts, it only applies to Federal courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS. MURRAY:  You could. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Whatever it does. 

  

 

 

 

MS. MURRAY:  You could, Your Honor.  I think 

    

  

 

 

 

 

that that would be, you know, certainly preferable for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us if there is still some availability of Federal court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One thing that I would note, however, is that would sort 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of create a topsy-turvy scheme.  I think when Congress 

    

   

 

 

 

 

enacted FELA, it assumed that most of these suits would

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it would take care 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the question of the -- of where a plaintiff lives. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  It would take care of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of where a plaintiff lives.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And, counsel, I -- I must 

   

   

  

 

 

It's 90 across Montana. 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  80 across Wyoming.  I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

very sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Didn't I say 90? 

   

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Anyway, your problem, I 

  

 

 

 

 

guess, that you're trying to get around is that Daimler 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had about 2.4 percent of its world sales in California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and was the largest seller of luxury goods in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California, luxury cars.  And I suspect when you sell 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

luxury cars in California, it's really something. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, certainly --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  They had a very big market. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

And the problem is how do you get around that?  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I know you're trying, and it's a -- making a valiant 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

effort and so forth, but -- but I don't really see the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

difference. 

            

MS. MURRAY:  Well, Your Honor, we hope it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

more than a valiant effort in the sense that we do think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there are key distinctions not just in the numbers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here in terms of the track and employees and business, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but in terms of the nature of the industry --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What percent -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

percent of their total operation is in Montana? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  We know that they get up to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 percent of their revenue in the State of Montana, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which, given that they operate in 28 States and a couple 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Canadian provinces, it has to be the case that that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disproportionately large compared to the other States in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which they operate. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Good point. 

  

 

 

MS. MURRAY:  And -- and if -- if I could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

come back to -- to your question, Justice Sotomayor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about if -- if plaintiffs were able to bring these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims in Federal court versus State, that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly be preferable.  Then they -- they couldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring it --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that would -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would depend on it being it's a personal jurisdiction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision, not just a venue provision. 

   

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  That's -- that's correct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If it's a venue


   

  

 

 

provision, which this Court said it was, then you -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy the venue requirement, but not personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

MS. MURRAY:  That's right, your -- Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, and I -- what would happen in that case is that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Nelson, for example, living in North Dakota, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be headed to Washington, Texas, or Delaware to bring his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  That would be the reality, despite what Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended when it adopted and it -- or amended FELA in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1910.  But in --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what is -- what is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

his state of residence? 

 

 

 

            

MS. MURRAY:  He is a North Dakota resident. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

And -- and was injured, you know, in -- in the State of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Washington.  Again, I think an example of how far these 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

workers frequently travel in order to bring their -- or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frequently travel in the course of their -- their work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for BNSF, it, in many ways, is simply a coincidence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether they're injured at home versus injured somewhere 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else, and of course, they would have no way of knowing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in advance. 

 

 

            

But I -- I would say with respect to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

bringing suit in Federal court, I don't think it would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely solve the problem in this sense.  You know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

	
Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

when Congress thought these cases would be brought in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

State court, it didn't want them removed -- or, at least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where plaintiffs chose to file them in State court, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not want them to be removable.  And I think part of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is because these are personal injury cases.  Some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of them are low -- low-dollar claims.  Congress wanted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the plaintiffs to have their choice of forum too, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to, you know, if you want to take this kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of claim to a State court judge for whom this is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bread and butter of their docket, you can do that.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think if you were to -- to limit these types of claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Federal court in Montana, for example, or on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing-business rationale, one, plaintiffs would still be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very limited in terms of where they could choose State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts, but it also wouldn't be as easily accessible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  I mean, most of the time, Federal courts you only 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have one or two in a State, and so it's not going to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as readily available of a forum for injured workers who, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, certainly as compared to the railroads, are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be far more burdened by a rule like that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Ms. Murray, one of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rationales that Montana relied on was that Daimler 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied only to foreign corporations, and I didn't see 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the briefs really grapple or attempt to defend that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Do you -- do you concede that that's

erroneous? 

            

MS. MURRAY:  We don't -- we think the way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

that the Montana Court framed it, I think, is not a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

helpful one to think about it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What -- what I would say is this:  I don't 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

think that you can simply say Daimler doesn't apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it was a foreign corporation. 

   

 

 

 

            

But I do think Daimler, as earlier general 

   

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction cases had recognized, continued to 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize the nature of context matters.  And so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly, I think once you start moving up the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate chain, once you start hopping into other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continents and having to impute -- to the extent that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is actually appropriate -- having to impute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contacts of a subsidiary, I think the nature of the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

contacts becomes so attenuated, that at that point that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transnational element of Daimler actually does play a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

role; it's just not a dispositive one. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

questions.

Justice. 

            

MR. TULUMELLO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

43 

Just a couple points.  First, the Montana 

   

  

 

 

 

Supreme Court held that it did not need to apply this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's decision in Daimler based on Daimler's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transnational facts and because BNSF is a domestic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

railroad.  We think neither rationale is persuasive. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And at least with respect to railroads being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unique, we don't read these -- this Court's due process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases as saying due process protection depends on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular line of business that you're in. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There are -- you know, as to movement and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ownership of property, there are many industries, cable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

companies, agriculture businesses, and so forth, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have physical plants and that transport people across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the country. 

 

            

And then with respect to FELA, we don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it would be helpful or faithful to the text or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative history to interpret Section 56 in a way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that grants personal jurisdiction when no other special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue statute or general venue statute has ever done so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So we respectfully ask that the Montana 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme Court judgment be reversed. 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank you.
