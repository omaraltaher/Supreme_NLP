CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument

Mr.  Waxman. 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  SETH  P.  WAXMAN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Under  Florida  law,  Timothy  Hurst  will  go  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  death  despite  the  fact  that  a  judge,  not  a  jury, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  the  factual  finding  that  rendered  ­­ rendered  him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible  for  death.  That  violates  the  Sixth  Amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Ring.  In  Florida,  and  Florida  alone,  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorizes  imposition  of  the  death  penalty  is  a  finding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  fact  by  the  Court  of  an  aggravating  factor,  a  finding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  trial  judge  makes  independently,  and,  quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"notwithstanding  the  jury's  recommendation  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence." 

            

Now,  the  State  here  contends  that  capital 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  juries  make  implicit  findings  that  satisfy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Sixth  Amendment  under  Ring,  which  the  trial  judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  simply  ratifies.  That  is  wrong. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Whatever  the  jury's  recommendation  might 

 

 

 

 

imply  about  the  specified  aggravating  factors,  the

Florida  Supreme  Court  has  repeatedly  rejected  the  notion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  jury's  verdict  is  anything  other  than  advisory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Florida  law  entrusts  the  factual  findings  of  aggravators 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  judge  alone,  who  may  do  so  on  the  basis  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  the  jury  never  heard,  and  aggravators  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  was  never  presented  with. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Is  there  ever  a  case  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

which  the  jury  found  aggravators  and  recommended  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

death  sentence,  and  the  judge  reversed  that  finding? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  There  may  well  be.  This  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

principally  a  case  about  the  finding  of  death 

   

 

 

 

 

 

eligibility,  not  sentence  selection.  I  ­­

    

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  I  mean,  either  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

either  way,  is  ­­ is  there  ­­ is  there  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ is  there  ever  a  case  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  jury  did  not  find  an  aggravating  circumstance, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  judge  did? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  Well,  we  don't  ever  know  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  found  about  any  of  the  specified  aggravating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances.  The  only  thing  that  the  jury  tells  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  is,  we  recommend  life­slash­death  by  a  vote  of  X 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

versus  Y. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Right.  But  they  can't 

  

  

 

 

 

recommend  death  unless  they  find  the  aggravator,  right?

MR.  WAXMAN:  Well,  no.  No.  As  a  matter  of 

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

State  law,  that's  not  correct.  They  can't  recommend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

death  unless  seven  of  them  each  believe  that  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravator  is  satisfied. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  All  right. 

  

 

 

MR.  WAXMAN:  But  the  Florida  Supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

Court  ­­ and  this  is  a  ­­ this  is  a  ­­ another  Ring 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  here.  The  Florida  Supreme  Court  has  recognized 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  where  two  aggravators  are  presented,  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible  to  know,  even  if  a  simple  majority  agreed  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  single  aggravator. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

common  feature,  though,  of  jury  deliberations.  Let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say  an  aggravator  is  whether  the  murder  is  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  heinous.  And  it  can  be  for  ­­ for  a  number 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  factors:  One,  the  victim  is  a  ­­ a  ­­ a  juvenile,  so 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  three  jurors  find  that.  Or  an  officer  was  also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

killed,  or  it  was  in  the  commission  ­­ in  the  course  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  felony. 

 

            

In  a  typical  case,  a  finding  that  the  murder 

   

   

 

 

 

 

was  heinous,  you  have  no  idea  whether  the  juror  ­­ jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  whole  made  that  determination,  or  if  there  were  12 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  reasons. 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  Florida,

aggravating  factors. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  isn't  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

true  ­­ I  mean,  taking  it  even  out  of  the  death  penalty

Justice,  about  elements  of  the  crime.  And  as  this  Court

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Are  you  sure  that  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  have  a  crime  that  can  be  satisfied  by  various 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements,  the  jury  has  to  agree  upon  the  specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  that  satisfies  it? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  The  jury  ­­ if  they  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinct  elements,  and  this  ­­ this  implies  the  Schad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  that  the  State  is  raising:  If  the  State, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  a  long  historical  tradition  and  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

finding  of  equal  culpability,  chooses  to  permit  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  element  in  Schad,  it  was  premeditation,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  mental  state  to  be  satisfied  either  by  premeditation

Court  has  said  this  over  and  over  again  ­­ that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  is  eligible  for  death  only  if  the  trial  judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finds  as  fact,  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  that  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  statutory  aggravator  exists. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  submit,  even  if  that  were  not  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  extending  Schad,  which  held  that  in  light  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundred­and­fifty­year  history  of  States  including  in 

 

 

 

 

 

the  mental  element  for  first  degree  murder,  either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony  murder  or  premeditation,  that  combining  those  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements  didn't  satisfy  the  death  penalty.  None  of  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  here. 

 

            

This  is  a  question  of  the  Sixth  Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  Eighth  Amendment.  No  State  ever  has  said  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  can  just  decide  some  model  of  aggravation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  just  ­­ they  don't  agree  on  the  specific  element, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  would  violate,  I  think,  the  Sixth  and  Eighth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  precedents.

all  the  way  back  into  the  mists  of  history. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  this  necessity  of  finding  an 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravator  ­­ aggravating  factor,  we  made  it  up,  right?

them  should  be  satisfiable  by  simply  finding  the  generic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  rather  than  agreeing  upon  the  ­­ the

MR.  WAXMAN:  Justice  Scalia,  I'm  reminded  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your  separate  opinion  ­­ I  think  it  was  in  Walton  v. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Arizona  ­­ where  you  were  choosing  between  two  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  didn't  particularly  like,  and  one  of  them  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  the  Court  had  made,  recently  or  not,  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  a  finding  of  a  ­­ beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  a 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

factual  finding  of  a  specified  aggravating  factor  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

element  of  the  crime.  And  whether  it's  recent,  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  should  or  shouldn't  have  done  it,  it  has.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ under  Ring,  it  is  just  like  any  other  element  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  crime. 

 

            

And  on  the  Schad  point,  I  think  the  other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  I  would  have  said  is,  the  Florida  Supreme  Court  ­­

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Could  I  ask  you  this  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Ring?  I  wasn't  on  the  Court  at  the  time  of  Ring,  so 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  you  tell  me  if  Ring  is  entitled  to  greater  weight 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  precedent  than,  let's  say,  Gregg  v.  Georgia  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  cases  upholding  the  constitutionality  of  the  death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty? 

            

 

MR.  WAXMAN:  Oh,  I'm  not  ­­ I  ­­ I  wouldn't 

   

   

  

 

 

 

be  prepared  to  say  ­­ to  assign  weight  to  either  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them. 

              

I  think  Ring  is  certainly  predicated  on 

 

 

 

 

 

Gregg,  to  Justice  Scalia's  point.  If  Gregg  hadn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  that  ­­ that  there  has  to  be  a  determinate, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  appellate  reviewable  narrowing  of  trial  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  jury's  discretion,  Ring  wouldn't  come  up, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  an  aggravating  factor  wouldn't  be  an  element. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Do  you  think  this 

  

 

 

 

 

scheme,  assuming  we  agree  with  Justice  Scalia,  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  really  need  unanimity,  would  this  still  be  good

MR.  WAXMAN:  I  hope  it  was  clear  from  our 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  that  we  think  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's  not. 

  

 

 

MR.  WAXMAN:  ­­ nine  out  of  five  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay.  It  doesn't  require  this  Court  to  overrule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Apodaca,  which  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  We're  not  required  to  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything.  We  could  just  say  it's  not  the  functional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equivalent.  But  is  ­­

  

 

 

            

            

law? 

            

            

it? 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  is  it  still  good 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  WAXMAN:  Well,  six  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Shouldn't  we  overrule 

  

 

 

 

MR.  WAXMAN:  I  ­­ we  think,  for  the  reasons 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

stated  in  our  brief,  you  should  overrule  it.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  in  the  Eighth  Amendment  context  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  death,  the  jury  should  be  unanimous. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  there  is  no  other  State  that  permits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyone  to  be  sentenced  for  death  other  than  a  unanimous 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  by  the  jury.  And  the  State  of  Florida 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  unanimity  for  shoplifting,  just  not  for  death. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  requires  unanimity  on  all  the  other  elements  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime.

And,  Justice  Scalia,  leaving  aside  our  Eighth  Amendment

It  is  an  element  of  capital  murder,  and  it  is,  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  and  Florida  Supreme  Court  decision,  an  element 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  capital  murder  in  Florida. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  Apodaca  itself,  which,  as  ­­ as

I  mean,  we  need  to  ­­ once  a  ­­ at  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  ­­ when  an  assignment  is  made  to  a  jury  in  a  case 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  decide  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  the  existence  of  an

substantial  reliability  that  the  jury  actually  performs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  functions. 

 

            

And  in  this  case  ­­ and,  again,  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  if  it  were  true  that  the  sentencing  jury  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  determining  death  eligibility,  which  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plainly  not,  as  we  point  out,  the  Eighth  Amendment  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  be  violated  under  Caldwell,  because  this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Florida  juries  are  told  that  they  do  not  determine  death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligibility.  And  the  State  simply  can't  have  it  both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways.  Either  the  jury  is  correctly  told  that  its  role 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  merely  advisory,  in  which  case  there  is  a  Ring 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation,  or  the  instruction  that  it's  given  violates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Eighth  Amendment  under  Caldwell,  because,  as  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Caldwell,  it  misleadingly,  quote,  "minimizes  the  jury's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  of  responsibility  for  determining  the 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriateness  of  death." 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Waxman,  do  we  ­­ do

the  brutality  of  the  murder,  and  that  it  occurred  during 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  robbery?  Those  were  obvious  that  they  existed.  Is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  not  so? 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  I  think  it's  not  so.  It's 

    

  

 

 

 

 

probably  a  reason  why  ­­ for  ­­ I  mean,  the  heinous, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

atrocious,  and  cruel  aggravator  can  never  be  obvious. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  State  isn't  even  arguing  harmlessness  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  that. 

 

 

            

And  as  to  robbery,  I  think  it's  important 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  recognize  the  following:  The  State  made  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice.  They  didn't  even  indite  Timothy  Hurst  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

robbery.  The  sentencing  jury  was  not  even  instructed  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  elements  of  robbery.  This  argument  of  harmlessness 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  never  raised  in  these  proceedings  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  proceeding  onward,  including  in  the  brief  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposition  in  this  case,  until  the  Red  brief,  and  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  the  Red  brief  is  simply  arguing  that  there  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fatal  concession. 

 

            

But  in  any  event,  Justice  Ginsburg,  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  in  the  record  from  which  a  jury  could  certainly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  that  Timothy  Hurst,  although  he  was  found  guilty  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first­degree  murder,  did  not,  in  fact,  actually  commit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  robbery.  The  jury  was  told  that  to  find  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existence  of  the  felony  murder  aggravator,  it  had  to

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  the  defendant 

  

 

 

 

claimed,  however,  that  this  informant  was  the  one  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  the  crime.

MR.  WAXMAN:  Certainly. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  that's  why  it's

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Because  what  makes  it  an

So  my  system  is  that  a  jury,  whether  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty  phase  or  in  the  guilt  phase,  has  to  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  of  an  aggravating  factor.  Okay?  But  once 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  done,  once  the  jury  decides  on  an  aggravating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor,  the  judge  can  do  whatever  she  wants.  The  judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  add  aggravating  factors.  The  judge  can  reweigh  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  factors  as  compared  with  the  mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  The  judge  can  do  any  of  that  stuff. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  judge  has  to  leave  alone  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  factor  that  the  jury  finds.  So,  in  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words,  the  judge  can't  give  death  when  the  jury  finds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life,  and  the  judge  can't  throw  out  the  jury's  factor.

But  ­­ but  as  long  as  that  jury  makes  that  aggravating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor  determination,  the  judge  can  do  anything.  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  consistent  with  the  Sixth  Amendment? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  Okay.  You're  ­­ you're  asking 

  

  

 

 

 

 

only  about  the  Sixth  Amendment  and  not  the  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  WAXMAN:  ­­ point.  Okay.  So  the  ­­ so 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

just  to  be  sure  that  I'm  specifically  answering  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  if  the  jury  is  told,  you  must  find  ­­ for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  to  be  eligible  for  death,  you  must  find  beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  reasonable  doubt  the  existence  of  at  least  one  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  aggravating  factors.  And  I  would  also  say  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Amendment  purposes,  you  must  either  be  unanimous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  the  vote  must  be  at  least  ten  to  two.  And  then  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  does  so  find.  And  then  you  have  the  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belt­and­suspenders  legal  system  that  the  State  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

positing  that  Florida  has  here  where  the  judge  can  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay,  I'm  the  one  who  does  the  sentence,  so  I  can  weigh 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ags  and  the  mits.  I  can't  ­­ he  is  death  eligible 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  jury  found  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  aggravator  exists.  But  the  judge  can  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonetheless,  I'm  giving  life.  There's  nothing  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  violation  of  the  Sixth  Amendment  in  ­­ when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  happens.

The  question  is,  in  this  case,  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  jury  has  concluded  its  work  ­­ I  mean  ­­ and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  assuming  in  a  case  where  there's  not  a  conviction 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  prior  aggravated  felony.  When  the  sentencing  jury 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  concluded  its  work,  is  the  defendant  eligible  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  death  penalty  under  State  law?  Yes  or  no.  And  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Florida,  the  answer  is  unquestionably  no. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Even  if  we  knew  that  12  of  the  jurors  found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  robbery  aggravator  here,  there  would  be  a  Ring 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation,  just  as  if  we  knew  that  12  of  the  jurors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  that  he  had  killed  the  defendant  in  this  case,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  been  told,  I  just  want  your  input  on  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  I,  the  judge,  will  decide  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  is  that  what  ­­ is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  what  makes  a  difference,  then,  in  the  end,  that  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  you're  saying  that  the  jury  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  told  that  that's  what  it's  doing?  That  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you're  saying  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  The  jury,  no. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ the  necessary  part  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  system  for  the  jury  to  be  instructed  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  has  the  responsibility  to  find  the  aggravating  factor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  serves  as  a  precondition  to  death. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  At  a  minimum,  if,  in  fact,  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

jury  is  performing  that  function,  it  cannot,  at  least  in

and  the  judge  has  the  power  to  sentence  to  life. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  If  the  ­­ I  mean,  there  is  no

be  ­­ has  been  and,  as  a  matter  of  constitutional  law, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  done  by  a  jury.  We're  not  arguing  that  other 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences  have  to  be  jury  sentencing.  And  so  if  a

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  I'm  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

understand  the  limits  of  your  argument  that  what  is  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  Florida  statute  diminishes  the  jury's  sense  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsibility.  The  jury's  sense  of  responsibility  will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  diminished  to  some  degree  if  they  know  that  their

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Would  that  be  the  case  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  that  case  whether  they  ­­ whether  they're  told, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ you  make  a  recommendation  and  the  judge  decides, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  you  impose  a  sentence,  but  the  judge  can  impose  a

of  making  the  absolutely  final  decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  So,  Justice  ­­ Justice  Alito, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

let  me  separate  out  what  I'm  calling  the  selection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision,  that  is,  life  or  death  and  the  weighing  of  ags 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  mits  and  the  eligibility  decision,  which  is  all  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  elements  of  capital  murder  have  been  found  by  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  by  the  jury  with  either 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unanimously  or  a  sufficient  majority,  and,  therefore, 

   

 

 

 

 

when  the  sentencing  jury  is  done,  you  are  eligible  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  death  penalty. 

 

 

            

Leaving  aside  the  Eighth  Amendment  question 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  Constitution  then  require  ­­ requires  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  to  make  the  intensely  moral  judgment  about  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  penalty  should  be  life  without  parole  or  death, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming  that  a  judge  can  do  that,  so  long  as  the  jury

which  includes  the  following  elements,  including  one  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  two  specifying  aggravators,  the  Constitution  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied. 

            

The  ­­ the  Caldwell  problem  is  an  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  problem.  Caldwell  was  an  Eighth  Amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case.  And  in  Caldwell  what  ­­ I  mean  what  the  jury  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told  here  ­­ if  the  system  exists  as  the  State  posits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  what  the  jury  is  told  here  is  far  more  misleading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  what  was  told  in  Caldwell. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  Caldwell,  the  jury  was  simply  told  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closing  argument  that  your  decision  is  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewable  by  the  Mississippi  Supreme  Court.  And  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority  of  this  Court  held  that  that  unconstitutionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminished  the  jury's  responsibility. 

 

 

 

            

Here  the  jury  was  told  over  and  over  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  again,  and  consistent  with  Florida  law,  that  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  is  merely  advisory;  I  will  be  the  one  to  make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  determination.  And  either  ­­ if  that  isn't  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  appear  to  be  the  system,  that  violates  Ring.  If  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  the  system  and  if  somehow  it  can  be  argued  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  is  making  implicit  findings  of  aggravation  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

large,  that  renders  somebody  eligible  for  death,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  plain  Caldwell  problem.  And  that  ­­ that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  position.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ALLEN  WINSOR 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Florida's  capital  sentencing  system  was 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  before  Ring  v.  Arizona,  and  it  remains 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  in  light  of  Ring  v.  Arizona.  What  Ring 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  was  a  jury  determination  on  those  facts  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  State  legislature  conditions  the  imposition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  death  penalty. 

 

 

            

In  this  instance  Mr.  Hurst  got  that.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  has  determined  that  the  elements  necessary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  a  defendant  eligible  for  the  death  penalty  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  existence  of  a  murder  and  one  or  more  aggravating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances. 

            

And  what  the  other  side  calls  the  advisory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  included  within  it  a  finding,  as  this  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  in  the  United  States  v.  Jones,  that  the  jury

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  How  ­­ how 

  

  

 

 

 

 

is  that,  when  Florida  law  says  that  the  judge  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  an  aggravator  to  make  someone  eligibility  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

death  penalty? 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Well,  I  agree  with  the  other 

   

  

 

 

 

 

side  that  there  is  a  difference  between  the  sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

selection  and  the  sentence  eligibility.  And  so  once  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  is  eligible  because  a  jury  has  found  all  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  necessary  elements,  then  what  happens  after  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  does  not  implicate  Ring  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  you  tell  me  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  different  than  Arizona?  I  mean,  in  terms  of  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system,  just  like  in  the  Arizona  case,  there  had  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent  by  this  Court  that  Arizona  law  had  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional.  Unlike  Arizona,  every  Florida  ­­ every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court  that  has  looked  ­­ every  judge  who's  looked  at  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  one  of  them  has  said  that  they  believe  personally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  constitutional.  Even  the  courts  affirming  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

affirm  on  the  basis  of  the  prior  precedent,  and  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  little  less  than  half  the  Court  directly  saying  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violates  Ring.  So  what's  the  jury  finding  when  it  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seven  to  five? 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Well,  if  I  could  back  up  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Even  when  it  says  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

murder  has  been  committed,  felony  murder  wasn't.  Felony

murder  was  charged,  but  we  don't  know  if  they  found  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

robbery,  right? 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  We  ­­ at  the  guilt  phase  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  of  first  degree  murder,  which  could  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  been  felony  murder  with  the  predicate  underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony  being  robbery  or  premeditated  murder.  But  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  your  earlier  question  about  the  actual  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  how  do  we  know  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  they  picked? 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WINSOR:  I'm  sorry? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Which  ­­ how  do  we  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  one  they  picked?  Which  makes  them  eligible  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  death  penalty? 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Well,  our  position  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ that  he  became  eligible  at  the  ­­ at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  phase  when  the  jury  made  its  advisory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision,  because  the  jury  at  that  phase  was  instructed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  you  determine  that  no  aggravating  circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  found  to  exist,  you  must  recommend  life. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you  do  agree  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ it  doesn't  require  a  unanimous  jury? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  It  does  not  require  a  unanimous 

   

  

 

 

 

 

jury. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  ­­ and  ­­ a  simple 

   

  

 

 

 

 

majority  is  all  you  need?

MR.  WINSOR:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  we  don't  have  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  WINSOR:  That's  right,  but  that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

that's  a  jury  finding. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ a  unanimous  jury, 

   

  

 

 

even  a  functionally  equivalent  unanimous  jury,  finding 

   

 

 

 

 

those  aggravators. 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  I'm  sorry? 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  We  don't  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

unanimous  or  functionally  unanimous  jury  finding  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravators. 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Our  reliance  for  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  eligibility  determination  is  that  seven  to  five. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  would  make  this  point:  The  seven  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

five  ­­ there  are  two  things  that  go  on  when  the  ­­ when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  determines  whether  someone  should  be  sentenced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  death  or  not. 

 

 

 

            

First,  the  jury  looks  and  determines  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  has  proven  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  circumstance.  That's  the  eligibility  piece 

  

 

 

 

 

of  it. 

 

            

Then  they  get  into  the  sentence  selection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  where  they  weigh  the  aggravators  that  they  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find,  assuming  they  find  some,  against  the  mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances.  And  of  course  the  defendant  under  this

Page  20,  where  it  cites  about  six  Florida  cases,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested  to  me  that  they  thought  the  answer  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  as  a  matter  of  Florida  law  was,  yes,  the  judge

acknowledge  that  under  Ring  it  would  not  be  permitted  in

recommendation  to  satisfy  the  eligibility. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

part.

doesn't,  that  the  reason  that  they  did  that  is  no  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  an  aggravator. 

 

 

            

My  simple  question  is:  As  a  matter  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Florida  law,  can  the  judge  impose  the  death  sentence? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yes  or  no. 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  As  a  matter  of  Florida 

   

  

 

 

 

statutory  law,  yes.  As  a  matter  of  Ring,  no.  With  ­­

MR.  WINSOR:  With  this  caveat,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ because  of  Ring. 

  

 

 

 

 

Because  you  agree  that  this  case  is  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ring,  and  therefore  Ring  would  apply,  and  therefore  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  this  case,  but  any  case  in  which  they  recommend

MR.  WINSOR:  Not  any  case,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  God,  I'd  like  to  know  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

caveat.  What  is  the  caveat?  I'm  ­­ I'm  on  pins  and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needles  here. 

 

            

            

MR.  WINSOR:  The  caveat  is  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  am,  too,  actually. 

    

 

 

 

            

Sorry. 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  There  are  multiple  ways  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  in  Florida  can  become  eligible  for  death. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One  is,  in  this  case,  where  it's  determined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  sentencing  phase  because  of  the  finding  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury's  recommendation. 

 

 

            

In  other  instances  it  can  be  ­­ a  person  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

become  eligible  before  the  sentencing  phase  either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  have  a  prior  violent  felony  conviction  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  have  a  contemporaneous  conviction. 

   

 

 

 

            

For  example,  if  someone  murdered  two  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  were  convicted  of  double  murder,  that  person  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilt  phase,  by  virtue  of  that  guilt  jury's  verdict,  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  found  to  be  eligible  for  the  death  penalty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  at  that  stage,  then  in  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical,  Justice  Breyer,  if  that  sentencing­phase 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  recommended  life,  the  judge  could  override  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  violating  Ring. 

 

 

            

Now,  I  will  tell  you  that,  as  a  matter  of

Florida  State  law,  the  judge  in  that  circumstance  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face  an  exacting  standard;  and,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  has  overwritten  a  jury's  life  recommendation  since 

   

 

 

 

 

 

before  Ring. 

 

            

So  as  a  matter  of  function,  it  is  just  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  happens  in  Florida. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  to  answer  your  question,  we  do  believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  be  constitutional  in  the  situation  that  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described. 

            

hung.

MR.  WINSOR:  If  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Could  the  judge  then 

  

 

 

 

 

impose  the  death  penalty? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Not  in  this  situation,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  because  that  would  result  in  a  life 

   

 

 

 

 

 

recommendation.  A  six­six  vote  is  tantamount  to  a  life 

    

   

 

 

 

 

recommendation.  And  the  judge  could  not  override  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  he  were  relying  on  the  jury  sentencing  finding  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy  Ring.

And  even  if  he  weren't,  he  or  she  weren't, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  I  said,  it's  an  exacting  Florida  State  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  The  judge  would  be  reversed  for  overturning

those  circumstances  could  have  imposed  or  recommended  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life  sentence. 

 

            

And  as  I  indicated,  it's  been  since  1999 

   

 

 

 

 

 

since  any  judge  actually  overrode  a  life  recommendation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Just  so  I  ­­ I  understand 

   

   

  

 

 

it:  So  you're  saying  that  it  ­­ it  is  possible,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Florida  law  the  jury  would  not  find  the  existence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  an  aggravated  ­­ aggravating  factor  but  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ and  then  there  are  different  ways  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  come  out  ­­ the  hypothetical  was  a  hung  jury  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  judge  could  then  proceed  to  find  an  aggravating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor  and  impose  the  death  penalty. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  you  say,  now,  this  hasn't  happened. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He'd  probably  be  reversed.  But  theoretically  this  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen. 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Only  ­­ that  could  not  happen 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  Ring,  Your  Honor,  unless  there  were  some

adjudge  that  there  has  been  unconstitutionality  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case? 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  That's  correct,  Justice  Scalia. 

  

 

 

 

 

And  in  this  case  there  was  a  ­­ a  jury  recommendation, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  two  jury  recommendations  ­­

in  judgment  of  hypothetical  schemes? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Suppose  that  the  ­­ the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  finds  an  aggravating  fact,  but  then,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  has  this  whole  separate  hearing  ­­ right?  ­­

judge  says,  you  know,  I  don't  actually  agree  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  fact  that  the  jury  found,  but  I  have  my  own 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  facts,  and  now  I'm  ­­ I'm  doing  all  the

I  ­­ I  assume  that  you  would  say  that  also 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  an  unconstitutional  application. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  No,  Your  Honor.  That  would  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  Ring  because,  again,  once  death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligibility  ­­ and  ­­ and  there  is  a  substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  that  this  Court  has  recognized  over  the  years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  the  determination  of  who  is  eligible  for  death, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then,  of  that  universe  of  people  eligible  for  death, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  whom  is  it  appropriate? 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes.  Quite  ­­ quite  right. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

But  I'm  ­­ I'm  hypothesizing  a  case  in  which  the  jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finds  that  death­eligibility  marker  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ right?  If  ­­ but  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

judge  throws  that  one  out  and  substitutes  his  own.

MR.  WINSOR:  Well,  the  judge  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instance  wouldn't  be  throwing  it  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  he  does  throw  it  out.

substituting  my  own. 

 

 

            

            

Would  that  be  all  right? 

 

 

 

 

MR.  WINSOR:  That  would  be  okay  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

eligibility  would  have  been  determined.  Just  like  if, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  my  double  murder  example,  the  judge  believed  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  if  he  were  sitting  on  the  jury,  maybe  he  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  acquitted  that  person  of  the  ­­ of  the  double 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

murder. 

            

And  of  course  he  can't  just  override  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury's  verdict  based  on  a  mere  disagreement.  In  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

instance,  the  death  eligibility  was  determined,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

withstanding  that  he  had  ­­ he'd  been  the  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maker,  maybe  would  have  decided  differently.  The  person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  eligible  for  death.  And  then  it's  up  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencer. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  I  have  to  say  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

answer  surprises  me  because  the  death  sentence  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  at  all  a  function  of  the  jury's  eligibility  finding. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  judge  has  tossed  out  that  eligibility  finding  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substituted  his  own,  which  then  leads  to  the  death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence. 

            

So  how  can  we  say  that  that's  possibly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  under  Ring? 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Because  the  point  in  Ring  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  sure  that  no  person  was  subject  to  a  greater

penalty  than  they  bargained  for  when  they  did  the  crime 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  a  jury  finding.  And  in  your  hypothetical,  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

jury  finds  that  there  is  an  aggravator.  So  there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  finding  that  that  person  is  entitled  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment  based  on  the  crime  that  he  or  she  committed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  judge  has  said  that  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  finding  is  utterly  irrelevant  to  his  decision  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  to  impose  death.  That  he's  imposing  death  based 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  something  that  the  jury  has  not  found. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  But  at  that  point  the  judge's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  is  separate  from  the  ­­ the  selection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point.  The  judge  is  exercising  the  discretion  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  within  ­­ a  person  who  is  determined  by  a  jury 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  eligible  for  the  death  penalty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

did  it? 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  didn't  happen  here, 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  WINSOR:  No,  your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Good,  I  thought  so  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  the  thing  is  you  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  tell  whether  that  happens  in  a  wide  variety  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  And  this  is  actually  ­­ this  goes  to  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  because  the  jury  doesn't  actually  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  specific  things,  only  the  judge  has  to  find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  things,  you  often  are  not  going  to  be  able  to

aggravating  facts  that  the  jury  has  found. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  But  it  doesn't  need  to  be  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ring,  because  once  the  jury  has  determined  that  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  aggravating  factor  or  if  it's  been  admitted,  then  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  is  death  eligible  and  Ring  is  completely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finished.  There's  nothing  more  to  do  under  Ring. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  then  we  move  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Even  though  the  jury  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

told,  now,  whatever  you  say,  it's  advisory.  It's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

binding.  So  you  have  made  a  finding  of  an  aggravator, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  it's  not  a  binding  finder  of  an  aggravator.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  is  told  that  whatever  they  say  is  advisory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Doesn't  that  make  a  difference? 

   

 

 

MR.  WINSOR:  No.  What  the  jury  is  told  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  its  ultimate  recommendation  is  ­­ is  not  binding  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court. 

 

            

And  that's  true.  And  that's  one  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

great  benefits  of  Florida's  system.  I  mean,  Florida's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

system  was  developed  in  response  to  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  in  Ferment,  and  this  Court  has  said  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Florida's  system  provides  additional  benefits  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant. 

            

matter  ­­

 

            

So  you  have  a  judicial  backstop.  The

before  Ring. 

 

            

            

MR.  WINSOR:  That  was  before  Ring. 

  

 

 

 

 

And  we're  not  contesting  that  Ring  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  a  jury  finding  or  an  admission  of  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements. 

            

But  once  the  jury  makes  its  recommendation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  it  recommends  death,  the  judge  can  override  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  ­­ for  any  reason,  just  based  on  disagreement  alone, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  makes  it  unlike,  you  know,  in  a  usual  capital  ­­

want  ­­ I'm  ­­ I'm  sorry. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice  Scalia. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Is  it  clear  to  the  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  are  the  last  word  on  whether  an  aggravator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists  or  not? 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  What  it  ­­ what  the  jury  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told  is  that  they  cannot  return  a  death  recommendation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  finding  a  ­­ an  aggravating  circumstance. 

   

 

 

 

 

That's  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  then  they're  also  told 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  judge  is  ultimately  going  to  decide  whether

to  the  jury  that  ­­ that  their  determination  of  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  aggravator  exists  or  not  is  final?  Shouldn't  that  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear? 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Well,  I  ­­ I  don't  think  so, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  because  the  determination  of  the  aggravator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  yield  a  death  sentence  unless  the  judge,  in  his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  her  own  opinion,  believes  the  death  is  appropriate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  a  benefit. 

   

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  I'm  ­­ I'm  talking  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  talking  about  what  responsibility  the  jury  feels. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  the  jury  knows  that  if  ­­ if  ­­ if  we  don't  ­­ if  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  we  don't  find  it  an  aggravator,  it  can't  be  found;  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  we  do  find  an  aggravator,  it  must  be  accepted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  a  lot  more  responsibility  than  just,  you  know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  you  know,  if  you  find  an  aggravator  and  you  ­­ you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weigh  it  and  provide  for  the  death  penalty,  the  judge  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  review  it  anyway. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  I'm  not  sure  that's  an  accurate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

characterization  of  what  goes  on  because  it's  not  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  must  accept  ­­ the  aggravator  determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  no  purpose  or  no  point  other  than  determining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligibility  and  then  the  weighing.

And  if  the  judge  determines  that  the  death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  is  not  appropriate  for  whatever  reason,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  the  jury  found  an  aggravating  circumstance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  no  difference. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Suppose  then  in  your 

  

 

 

 

 

earlier  hypothetical,  the  judge  ­­ the  jury  finds  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravator  occurred  in  the  course  of  the  robbery,  and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  there  is  death  eligibility.  Then  it  goes  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge.  And  the  judge  says,  there  is  simply  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  to  support  that  aggravating  factor,  but  I  find 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  aggravating  factor.  Under  your  view,  the  judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  go  ahead  and  impose  the  death  penalty? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Well,  in  that  instance,  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  little  bit  different,  as  I  understand  it,  than  Justice

MR.  WINSOR:  Which  is  the  minority  of  cases, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  we  ­­ as  we  said  in  the  brief.  If  the  jury  made  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  finding  as  to  a  specific  aggravator  ­­ and, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  they  wouldn't  be  instructed  on  that  aggravator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless  there  was  sufficient  evidence  of  it  at  the  ­­ at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  threshold  stage.  But  if  the  judge  concluded  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  insufficient  evidence  ­­ again,  he  never  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  submitted  it  to  the  jury  ­­ then  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  would  not  be  permissible. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Go  for  a  second  to  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

analogy. 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  I'm  sorry? 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  There's  ­­ there  are  two

good  other  analogies  in  other  areas  of  the  law.  The  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  supports  you  is  robbery,  force  or  threat  of  force. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No  one  ever  asks  or  needn't  ask  whether  six  members  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  thought  there  was  a  threat  but  no  actual,  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seven  members  thought  there  was  actual  but  no  threat. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Threat  or  threat  of  force.  I  don't  think  we  have  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say.  I  don't  think  so.  So  that  supports  you. 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

On  the  other  hand,  imagine  a  normal 

   

 

 

 

 

sentencing  case.  The  statute  says,  you  ­­ you  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  punishment  if  you  had  50  grams  of  cocaine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  jury  finds  he  had  50  grams  of  cocaine  ­­ no.  Sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  statute  says  aggravated  sentence  if 

 

 

 

 

 

50  grams  of  cocaine  or  meth.  The  jury  finds  he  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  grams  of  cocaine.  I  don't  think  under  Apprendi, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  I  didn't  agree  with  ­­ but  I  don't  think  the  judge 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  say,  I'm  going  to  give  you  the  aggravated  sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  I  don't  believe  there  was  any  cocaine,  but  I  do 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  there  was  meth. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  That  may  well  be  right.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  one  of  the  reasons  the  jury  is  not  asked  to  find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  aggravating  factors. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  we  do  know  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  here  ­­ now  still  you're  having  conceded  Ring, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  jury  says  no  aggravating  factor.  We  know  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  can,  if  the  jury  finds  aggravating  factor  X,

but  the  jury  never  thought  of,  namely  why. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  we  know  that.  And  now  compare  that  to

Court  would  look,  as  they  did  in  Jones,  to  say,  well,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legislature  setting  this  up  as  distinctive  offenses, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  are  they  setting  this  up  as  one  offense  that  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied  either  by  possession  of  cocaine  or  meth.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  it  were  the  latter,  then  the  jury  would  just  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed  to  find  one  or  the  other  without  any  ­­ any

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  want  to  clarify.  You

element  of  the  crime  that  makes  you  eligible  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

death  penalty  by  a  unanimous  or  functionally  equivalent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unanimous  jury? 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  We  do,  Your  Honor.  And  let  me

do  with  the  statement  in  our  case  law  that  says  a  simple 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority  is  not  a  unanimous  jury?

the  ­­ the  seven­to­five  vote,  by  the  way,  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  five  votes  that  there  was  no  aggravating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance,  because,  again,  it's  ­­ there's  two  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  go  on  in  the  jury  room.  One,  they  decide  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  aggravating  circumstances.  And,  two,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just  ­­ they  do  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  they  don't  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

with  which  one? 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Sorry? 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  we  don't  know  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  premeditation  or  robbery.  It  could  be  four  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  or  two  to  five.  It  could  be  anything. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  I'm  talking  about  the  jury  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  sentencing  phase  now. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Right. 

  

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  So  a  seven  to  five  could  well 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean  that  all  12  jurors  found  a  robbery  and  all  12 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors  found  heinous,  atrociousness,  and  cruel  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  We  don't  know.  What 

  

  

 

 

 

does  the  seven  to  five  tell  us  the  jury  found? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  The  seven  to  five  tells  us  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  a  minimum,  a  majority  of  the  jury  at  a  minimum,  found 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  State  had  proven  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existence  of  one  or  more  aggravating  circumstances.  And

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Not  the  same  one? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  WINSOR:  I'm  sorry? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Not  the  same? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  WINSOR:  Not  the  same  one. 

  

 

 

 

 

And  again,  getting  back  to  Justice  Breyer's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  about  the  cocaine  and  the  meth,  the  courts  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  situations  look  at  what  the  ­­ what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature's  ­­ its  definitions  of  the  element.  And  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  as  a  matter  of  Florida  State  law,  that  the  element 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  issue  here,  to  take  someone  who  is  not  eligible  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  death  penalty  and  to  make  him  or  her  eligible  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  death  penalty  is  the  existence  of  one  or  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  circumstances,  not  ­­ not  a  specific  one. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  it  is  like  Schad  v.  Arizona,  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ you  can't  say  whether  the  jury  agreed  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  premeditation  or  whether  there  was  felony  murder. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And,  in  fact,  that  was  the  case  at  this  defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilt  phase  back  in  1998.  He  was  convicted  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first­degree  murder.  And  the  guilt  phase  jury  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed  that  they  could  return  that  verdict  either  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding  premeditation  or  by  finding  felony  murder.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  no  jury  finding  as  to  which  one  ­­ which  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was. 

 

            

And  so  as  a  matter  of  ­­ I  think  to  answer

your  question  about  whether  they  all  need  to  be  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not,  it  would  depend  on  what  the  ­­ how  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you  believe  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

simple  majority  is  a  jury  unanimously  or  functionally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unanimously  finding  that  element  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

doubt? 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Well,  we  ­­ they're  certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

finding  it  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  And  we're  relying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  Court's  decision  in  Apodaca,  but  ­­ but  also  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That  was  ten  to  two. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  WINSOR:  I'm  sorry? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Does  ten  to  two 

  

 

 

 

 

automatically  mean  that  seven  to  five  is  okay? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Not  automatically,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

But  I  think  if  you  look  at  Apodaca,  what  they  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejecting  was  the  same  arguments  that  the  petitioner  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  this  Court  to  accept,  which  is  that  this  long 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history  of  the  unanimity  and  the  12­person  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  means  it's  ­­ it's  brought  in  to  ­­ to  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system. 

            

But  I'll  say  this  too,  the  seven  to  five  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  same  kind  of  jury  verdict  that  you'd  have  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ at  a  guilt  phase  because  of  this  judicial  backstop, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  the  other  protections  that  Florida  has  put  in

in  place. 

 

            

And  so  even  if  it's  a  seven­to­five  vote, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you  still  have  the  judge  coming  behind  that  jury,  who  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlike  at  the  guilt  phase  where  he  must  accept  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury's  findings,  unless  they're  not  supported  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence,  he  or  she  can  disagree  for  any  reason.  He  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she  can  give  mercy  for  any  reason.  And  that  happens  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot. 

            

And  so  we've  cited  the  ­­ some  cases  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  where  a  man  was  convicted  of  murder  in  a  horrible 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  assault,  and  by  virtue  of  those  two  convictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  necessarily  eligible  for  the  death  penalty.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  heard  all  of  the  evidence,  made  a  recommendation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  receive  the  death  penalty,  and  the  judge  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no,  I'm  going  to  sentence  him  to  life. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  this  Court  ­­ you  know,  this  gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  into  the  jury  versus  judge  sentencing.  But  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  some  real  benefits  associated  with  judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences.  And  if  you  go  back  to  Proffitt,  when  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  first  upheld  Florida's  capital  sentencing  system, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  recognized  the  advantages  of  judicial  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you're  not  going  to  have  someone's  life  or  death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  determined  exclusively  on  the  ­­ perhaps  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  emotions  of  a  jury.

kinds  of  hypotheticals  that  Justice  Kennedy  and  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  ­­ were  proposing? 

 

 

 

            

So  let's  say  that  there  is  a  jury,  and  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it's  been  presented  with  evidence  that  the  murder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  for  pecuniary  gain,  which  is  one  of  the  aggravating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors.  And  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  jury  comes  out  with  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recommendation  of  death.  So  you  ­­ and  that  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  thing  that  was  presented  to  it.  So  you  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ the  jury  has  made  a  death  eligibility 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  on  pecuniary  gain. 

 

 

 

            

Then  it  goes  to  the  judge.  The  judge  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know  what,  I  don't  really  think  that  there's  enough 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  pecuniary  gain,  but  I've  had  this  whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing,  and  I  find  that  the  thing  was  ­­ that  the  crime 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  heinous  and  whatnot.  And  now  I'm  going  to  sentence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  to  death. 

 

 

 

            

right? 

            

Now,  you  say  that  that's  fine;  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  WINSOR:  Well,  let  me  ­­ let  me  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

realize  it's  a  hypothetical,  but  let  me  tell  you  why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  couldn't  happen  in  Florida.  A  judge  would  not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruct  a  jury  on  an  aggravating  circumstance  for  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  not  sufficient  evidence  to  find  that.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  you  know  ­­ no  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  ­­ well  ­­ he's  heard  more  evidence  because,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  there's  a  whole  new  hearing  that  he  has.  And  now 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  considered  it  more  thoroughly,  and  he  thinks,  no,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  agree  with  that  anymore,  but  I  think  it  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heinous.  So  that  would  be  fine. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Again,  that's  not  this  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  was  no  additional  evidence  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

case. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes,  yes,  yes,  it's  not  this

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I'm  throwing  out  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  WINSOR:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ the  jury's  aggravating 

  

 

 

 

 

factor,  but  I'm  substituting  my  own.  I  thought  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  what  you  told  me  that  that  was  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Ring. 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Well,  I  think  it  depends  on  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

on  why  you're  throwing  it  out.  If  there  ­­ if  ­­ if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  with  any  jury  finding,  if  a  judge  finds  at  the  guilt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phase  that  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to  find  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element,  then  ­­ then  he  would  not  rely  on  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury's  determination  there.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  This  wasn't  at  the  guilt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

phase;  this  was  just  as  a  matter  of  sentencing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Let  me  get  on  with  my  questioning  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  WINSOR:  Yeah.  Sure. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ because  I  think  you 

   

  

 

 

 

answered  this  one  already. 

 

 

 

            

Then  the  appeal  that's  taken,  right  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal  is  focusing  now  only  on  what  the  judge  has  found, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  that  right,  under  Florida  law?  The  appeal  ­­ if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  came  in  and  said  that  there  was  insufficient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence,  the  appeal  would  only  be  as  to  the  judge's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding  and  not  at  all  to  the  jury's. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Well,  the  ­­ if  I  understand 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  hypothetical  correctly,  someone's  convicted,  has  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

death  recommendation,  a  death  sentence,  and  is  appealing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Florida  Supreme  Court. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  ­­ and  he  says  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  not  enough  evidence  of  all  these  aggravating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors,  so  ­­ but  that  was  ­­ would  only  be  as  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge's  aggravating  factors.  It  couldn't  possibly  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  would  challenge  the  jury's. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Well,  the  judge's  aggravating 

  

 

 

 

 

factors  would  be  detailed  in  a  written  order.  But  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ if  there  were  ­­ if  ­­ if  ­­

a  ­­ a  real  dispute  here  about  the  presence  of  the  two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  factors? 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  There  is  none,  Justice  Alito, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  my  view.  And  I  know  that  there  was  some  argument  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moment  ago  about  the  ­­ about  the  evidence  suggesting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  someone  else  may  have  committed  the  crime.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited  in  our  brief  from  their  ­­ initial  brief  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Florida  Supreme  Court  where  they  said,  "Without  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contention,  this  is  a  two­aggravator  case.  Hurst  does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

not  challenge  the  trial  court's  findings  that  the  murder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  committed  during  the  course  of  a  robbery,  and  it  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially  heinous,  atrocious,  or  cruel." 

 

 

 

 

            

He  doesn't  question  the  seriousness  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravators  either.  His  focus  instead,  acknowledging 

  

 

 

 

 

all  that,  was  on  proportionality  review,  which  is  not  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  here,  but  which,  by  the  way,  is  another  benefit  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Florida  system,  that  the  Florida  Supreme  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviews  everything  for  ­­ for  proportionality. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can  I  ask  you  two 

   

  

 

 

 

separate  questions  on  this?

have  we  said  that  a  jury  waiver  on  an  issue  is  based  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lack  of  a  challenge  by  a  defense  attorney?  Don't  we 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

require  waivers  of  jury  trials  to  be  explicit  and  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  him  or  herself? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  When  someone's  waiving  the  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

trial  altogether,  absolutely.  And,  of  course,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  structural  error  even  if  there  were  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection.  But  this  is  ­­ this  is  ­­ goes  to  more  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  element  of  offense.  And  the  Court  held  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Washington  v.  Recuenco  that  the  Apprendi  error  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  harmless  error  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  where  have  we  ever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  not  challenging  something  is  an  admission  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  something? 

 

            

MR.  WINSOR:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  We  take  plenty  of 

  

 

 

 

 

appeals  where  people  are  saying,  assuming  the  state  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts,  I'm  entitled  to  X.  And  then  when  they  go  back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down,  they  argue  that  that  goes  ­­ that  assumption  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong.  Why  isn't  this  the  same?

Justice  Alito,  about  whether  there  is  an  existence  of

both  of  these  clearly  existed  at  the  post­conviction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion,  which  led  to  the  resentencing  that's  now  on

Court's  judgment. 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Waxman,  six  minutes. 

 

 

 

           

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  SETH  P.  WAXMAN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  Notwithstanding  this  flurry  of 

  

 

 

 

 

papers,  I'm  aspiring  not  to  use  the  six  minutes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let  me  first  ­­ let  me  go  right  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia's  question,  which  is  not  a  hypothetical, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

although  I'm  happy  to  answer  hypotheticals. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Your  question  was:  Was  the  jury  told  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  a  jury  have  to  be  told  that  as  to  death 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligibility,  the  element  of  the  crime  of  capital  murder, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  makes  the  decision? 

 

 

 

 

            

The  answer  is:  It  does  have  to  be  told 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  It  certainly  can't  be  told  the  opposite,  and  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely  was  not  told  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

It  was  told  over  and  over  again,  consistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  statute,  that  its  decision  was  purely  advisory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  want  to  refer  the  Court  to  the  Florida  Supreme 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  decision  in  State  v.  Steele,  which  is  at  921  So. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Florida  Supreme  Court  in  Steele  said,  first  of  all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Nothing  in  the  statute,  the  standard  jury  instructions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  the  standard  verdict  form  requires  a  majority  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  to  agree  on  which  aggravating  circumstances  exist.

Under  current  law,  the  jury  may  recommend  a  sentence  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

death  where  four  jurors  believe  only  that  one  aggravator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies,  while  three  others  believe  that  only  another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravator  applies,  because  seven  jurors  believe  that  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  one  aggravator  applies." 

 

 

 

            

Florida  goes  beyond  that.  It  ­­ it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful  ­­ and  the  Supreme  Court  of  Florida  has  said  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  require  ­­ to  ask  the  jury,  the  sentencing  jury,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  a  special  verdict  that  in  any  way  indicates  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their,  quote,  input  is  on  the  sentencing  factors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Again,  Steele,  at  page  546.  "Specific  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

findings  on  aggravators,  without  guidance  about  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  on  the  imposition  of  a  sentence,  could  unduly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

influence  the  trial  judge's  own  determination  of  how  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  the  defendant.  The  trial  court  alone  must  make

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  that  a  ­­ post  Ring? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

What's  the  date  of  that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  Yes,  this  is  post  Ring.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  also  held  that  Ring  didn't  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

It  has  no  jury  findings  on  which  to  rely. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And,  in  fact,  the  Court  also  explained  in  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later  in  the  decision  ­­ in  the  same  decision  and  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  its  decision  in  Franklin,  that  Florida  bar  ­­ quote,

"Florida  bars  a  special  verdict  precisely  because 

   

 

 

 

 

requiring  specific  jury  findings  on  aggravators,  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance  about  their  effect,  would  harm  the  jury's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent"  ­­ "the  trial  court's  independent 

 

 

 

 

 

determination." 

            

 

Now,  counsel  ­­ my  ­­ my  colleague  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  side  here  says  that,  well,  there  ­­ there  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  a  statutory  problem,  but  there  would  be  a  Ring 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  if  we  knew  that  the  jury  found  that  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravators  existed.  So  how  can  Ring  be  satisfied  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  no  earthly  idea  what  the  jury  found?  It  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be,  as  in  this  case,  as  Steele  acknowledges,  three  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  and  four  for  the  other. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  to  the,  I  think,  hypothetical  question 

   

 

 

 

 

that  Justice  Kagan  was  asking  ­­ so,  you  know,  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance,  how  much  leeway  does  the  judge  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  his  own  ­­ his  or  her  own  decisions  on  the  death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty,  the  Florida  Supreme  Court  has  specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  the  death  penalty  to  be  imposed  and  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  of  death  eligibility  to  be  made  based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  was  never  presented  to  the  sentencing  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  based  on  an  aggravating  factor  on  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  jury  was  not  applied. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  notion  that  there  hasn't  been  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life­override  since  Ring  is  ­­ is  an  interesting  fact,

but  this  Court,  in  this  Court's  Sposiano  decision,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  Daubert  decision,  that's  exactly  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened:  The  jury  said,  we  want  life.  The  judge  said, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  hearing  ­­ I'm  hearing  independent  evidence,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  getting  death. 

 

 

            

Now,  as  to  the  supposed  concessions  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  I  think  I'll  rely  largely  on  our  brief.  But  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notion  that  somebody  ­­ that  the  lawyers  said  this  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two­aggravator  case  is  certainly  true.  There  were  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravators  charged.  And  maybe  the  jury  ­­ we  know  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  trial  judge  found  that  two  aggravators  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied. 

            

This  defendant  has  been  making  the  Ring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  since  before  Ring  was  decided.  He  raised  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  an  Apprendi  issue  at  the  very  first  trial.  He  asked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  bill  of  particulars  for  the  ­­ the  State  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicate  which  aggravators  it  was  going  to  rely  on,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  was  denied  on  the  grounds  that  Apprendi  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply. 

            

Even  the  ­­ again,  the  central  Ring  problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case,  the  central  Sixth  Amendment  problem  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  leaving  aside  the  indeterminacy  of  seven  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five  ­­ and  maybe  it's  three  for  one  and  four  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  ­­ is  that,  when  a  Florida  sentencing  jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

finishes  its  work,  there  is  simply  no  question:  The
