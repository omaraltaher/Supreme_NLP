CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-626, the South Florida Water Management


District v. the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians.


Mr. Bishop.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BISHOP:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Congress in the Clean Water Act provided that a


section 402 permit is required for an addition of


pollutants from a point source to navigable waters.


Now, the South Florida Water Management District 

concedes that the S-9 pump, through which it conveys


navigable waters from a canal to a water conservation


area, is a confined, discrete, discernible conveyance, and


we agree that the water in the C-11 canal contains


pollution which enters that water from a wide variety of


point and non-point sources. 


What we do say is that our pumps do not add


pollutants to navigable waters.  There is no addition of


pollutants to navigable waters when navigable waters are


simply moved around, which occurs all the time every day


all around the country as public water management agencies

allocate and transfer the navigable waters to serve


beneficial public purposes.


QUESTION:  The obvious question on your thing is


you have one of these rivers that's so filthy that you can


set fire to it, and next to it is the most pristine,


beautiful trout lake ever.  And so what we build is a


little pipe and the pipe takes these filthy, absolutely


disgusting water and pours it into this beautiful,


pristine trout pond.  All right?


Now, you're saying that that doesn't fall within


the statute, and --


MR. BISHOP:  No.  It does fall within the


statute.


QUESTION: 


I mean it doesn't require a permit. 

MR. BISHOP:  It -- it would not require a


section 402 permit.  There are all sorts of layers of


protection from that occurring.  That would never --


QUESTION:  Well, as far as this statute is


concerned, EPA, it wouldn't.  And -- and, of course, the


obvious thing is that --


MR. BISHOP:  No.  That -- that's not true


either, Justice Breyer. 


QUESTION:  I mean, EPA through the permit. 


Through the permit.


MR. BISHOP:  Through the 402, but this -- this

is a complex statute with many, many layers of protections


for the Nation's waters.


QUESTION:  And it would protect --


MR. BISHOP:  To begin with, there is always a


layer of State protection.  The statute requires that


water quality standards be established for portions of the


navigable waters.  Those water quality standards are


implemented through total maximum daily load requirements


that the States are -- are required under the statute to


-- to design.  The States implement the TMDL's and the


water quality standards through non-point source pollution


programs that include land use restrictions, that include


advice to and requirements on landowners as to best


management practices.


QUESTION:  I -- I suppose it's beyond the


purview of this case.  Do we know whether or not the


transfer of waters in this case would violate those other


regulations? 


MR. BISHOP:  No, it does not.  The -- the --


there are exceedances.  Understand that the S-9 pump,


while not permitted under 402, is permitted by the State


under The Everglades Forever Act.  But there are water


quality standards for the canal and for the water


conservation area.  The -- there is compliance with both


of those.  There are exceedances, phosphorus exceedances,

from time to time, but those are built into the permit.


The -- the cleaning up of the Everglades, which


is something that everyone is committed to and the


district is deeply committed to, is not an overnight


process.  And so there are plans through the Comprehensive


Everglades Restoration statute and also under The


Everglades Forever Act to address these exceedances in the


long term, but --


QUESTION:  Mr. Bishop, the Eleventh Circuit said


that moving water within a single, distinct body of water


could never result in the addition of pollutants to that


body of water.  Now, I assume you agree with that


statement? 


MR. BISHOP: 


Well, I agree with that, but we and 

the United States go further here in arguing that the


statute -- what the statute prohibits is the addition of


pollutants to navigable waters.  Navigable waters are


defined in the statute as the waters of the United States. 


It's our position and the position of the United States,


if I read their brief correctly, that an addition of


pollutants from a point source occurs when the pollutant


is introduced to the navigable waters for the first time. 


And that is what the --


QUESTION:  So in -- in Justice Breyer's example,


if the pristine trout pond is waters of the United States,

then there would not be an addition of the pollutant to


waters of the United States when the filthy river was


pumped into the pond.


MR. BISHOP:  No.  That would violate State water


quality standards which are --


QUESTION:  No.  I -- maybe it would violate the


standards, but I'm -- I'm just talking about the provision


required here.


MR. BISHOP:  It would not require a section 402


permit, Justice Souter. 


QUESTION:  And -- and it would not do so because


it would not be the addition of a pollutant to waters of


the United States. 


MR. BISHOP:  That is right.


QUESTION:  Assuming the river is navigable, the


filthy river.  Right?


MR. BISHOP:  Assuming that it's a navigable


water under the Clean Water Act --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. BISHOP:  -- and that -- which is a broader


concept than waters that one can run --


QUESTION:  Well, what I'm driving at here is --


is the following.  You have ambiguous language.  I think


it's a very difficult question.  If I accept your side of


it, it seems to me I live -- leave the EPA without any

power to deal with what I just called the filthy river


problem, or at least not the -- I'm not trying to be


tricky in my words.  I -- I understand they have other


authority and so forth.  But there is a filthy river


problem if I take your side of it.


And if I take their -- if I take your side of


it, that is some kind of a problem.  You can explain to me


in 1 second why it's no problem whatsoever.  I'd like to


hear that.  I want to say the opposite thing.


Your problem that you raise, if I take their


side, is suddenly everybody in the California water


project, which is huge, central valley irrigation, has to


run off and get permits, and that too is a big problem. 


So it sounds to me that that second problem 

could be dealt with by EPA through rules that would, in


effect, not make them come in because they'd automatically


get permits in certain circumstances.  But if I take your


side of it, the opposite filthy river problem, there's


nothing to be done. 


MR. BISHOP:  Your premise --


QUESTION:  So that's what I say moves me at the


second for hypothetical purposes towards their side, but


I'm asking you to move me back.


MR. BISHOP:  Your premise is incorrect, Justice


Breyer.  Of course, moving filthy water to a pristine

water is a problem.  I've already explained that it's


addressed and addressed comprehensively and rigorously at


the State level, as Congress contemplated in the statute


through the water quality standards and TMDL's. 


But beyond that, it is simply wrong to say that


the Federal Government lacks power in these cases.


First of all, it has broad power under section


10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act to protect navigability,


and that -- that provision also includes power for the


Corps to engage in a broad public interest review whenever


the course of a waterway is changed. 


Second, there are other provisions that deal


with emergency type situations.  If public health or


welfare, for example, is implicated, then section 504 of 

the statute gives EPA broad powers to go into court and


get a restraining order not just for the discharge of


pollutants, but much more broadly than that.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bishop, can we see -- take this


concrete case?  I mean, this is a case about phosphorus


being dumped into a relatively unpolluted body of water. 


What is the State of Florida or anybody doing to reduce


the level of phosphorus that comes from this pump and gets


dumped into the pure water?


MR. BISHOP:  Well, this has -- this has been the


focus of not only our attention but of the Corps and EPA's

attention for a long time through the -- the Comprehensive


Everglades Restoration Project.  If I can -- and there are


a lot of things that are happening to -- to reduce the


phosphorus level, some of which are sort of purely State


water quality standard implementation projects, such as


prohibiting the sale of certain types of fertilizers,


restricting the use of fertilizers that contain


phosphorus.  But the long-term CERP plans here have


essentially two components. 


The first one is that much of the water in the


C-11 basin, in the canal, actually comes from the


conservation area through seepage.  There's an enormous


amount of --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


May I ask you a question right 

-- I know some seeps through, but what is the principal


source of the water in the C-11 basin?


MR. BISHOP:  Well, my understanding is that it


is seepage.  I mean, obviously there are --


QUESTION:  You think that's the principal


source?  It seeps in.  You're just pumping it back into


the Everglades?


MR. BISHOP:  That is my -- that is my


understanding.  There is an enormous amount of seepage,


and the seepage involved --


QUESTION:  But where does the water that the

people in the western part of Broward County use to water


their lawns and bathe and so -- where does that water come


from?


MR. BISHOP:  From -- from the aquifer.  I mean,


obviously, in -- in --


QUESTION:  There's an aquifer to the east of the


-- of the levees?


MR. BISHOP:  There is an aquifer that -- an


unconfined aquifer that is really indistinguishable from


the surface water that underlies the levee.  But it's --


it is not divided by the levee.  It underlies the water,


the surface water, on both sides --


QUESTION:  Are you telling me there's an aquifer


to the east of the levee?


MR. BISHOP:  To the east of the levees and to


the -- it's --


QUESTION:  Which is a separate source of water


than the source that feeds the large -- the WCA-3 --


MR. BISHOP:  No, no.  This is an aquifer that


underlies both sides of the levee, the WCA and the basin.


But if I can get back to -- I mean, your -- your


question.  Obviously, the seepage is an enormous source. 


What I am told is that seepage alone will be enough to


flood out towns like --


QUESTION:  But the seepage can't --

 MR. BISHOP:  There is other --


QUESTION:  But the seepage can't contain any of


the pollution --


MR. BISHOP:  No. 


QUESTION:  -- because the water on the west side


of the levee is -- is clean.


MR. BISHOP:  Well, it's not clean.  I mean, it


does contain pollutants under the definition of the Clean


Water Act because that's a broad definition.


QUESTION:  Well, it's certainly cleaner than the


water on the east side or you wouldn't have a lawsuit.


MR. BISHOP:  There is a substantial amount of


water in the C-11 canal that comes from a -- a wide array


of sources within the basin.


QUESTION:  But the water -- the seepage clearly


is not what causes the problem. 


MR. BISHOP:  And that is -- just to go back to


Justice Ginsburg's question, one way that we are


addressing the phosphorus here is with the Corps.  The


Corps has built a new set of pumps right next to the S-9


that is intended to intercept that cleaner seepage water,


and it will pump that seepage water right back into the


WCA before it is mixed with the more polluted waters from


the C-11 basin.  So that is one part of the effort.  It is


to get the seepage water back into the water conservation

area before it mixes with more polluted water.


QUESTION:  Which -- which means --


MR. BISHOP:  Those pumps are --


QUESTION:  Which means that the water to the


east will be even more polluted and when you pump that


back in, you'll be pumping more polluted water back in.


MR. BISHOP:  And the solution to that problem is


that with the Corps and the task force and the EPA, a


number of huge storage basins are being built.  These


require, obviously, buying a lot of land, putting together


the land necessary for these STA's.  But the -- the


purpose of the plans under CERP is to stop as much water


as possible getting from the C-11 to the water


conservation area. 


And so storing as much water as 

possible in these basins will allow the phosphorus and


other pollutants to settle out, and so water that is --


and will also reduce the total amount of water that needs


to be sent back into the conservation area.


The combination of these new pumps getting the


-- the cleaner water back into the -- into the


conservation area and the storage basins, which will


reduce the amount of flow and allow the pollutants to --


to seep down, is -- is the essential way in which under


CERP the problem of the phosphorus will be addressed. 


No one disputes -- and the district least of all

disputes -- that cleaning up the Everglades and reducing


the amount of phosphorus that gets into the water


conservation area which, in turn, feeds the Everglades is


a very important consideration.


But you also have to understand that our


purposes -- we are not -- we are not just dumping this


water in -- in the water conservation area.  This water


could be sent to the ocean.  In fact, on the eastern


portion of the canal, the water is sent to the ocean.  But


the -- there are other functions, important functions,


that are served by the water conservation area,


maintaining water in there.  One is the ability to --


QUESTION:  This is all very important, but on


the legal question that we have, do you take the position 

that it's a single body of water --


MR. BISHOP:  We take --


QUESTION:  -- and therefore no permit is


required?


MR. BISHOP:  We take the position, first of all,


that all of the navigable waters of the United States are


unitary for purposes of determining whether they are --


QUESTION:  That's an extreme position, and you


probably have a fall-back position. 


MR. BISHOP:  And the alternative --

 QUESTION:  You -- you go --


MR. BISHOP:  We do argue --


QUESTION:  What -- what's the fall-back?


MR. BISHOP:  The fall-back is precisely the one


that you have described, Justice O'Connor, which is that


these were -- these were unitary waters.  They are divided


solely by manmade structures that are changeable and are


changing.


QUESTION:  Well, they have been altered by


manmade structures so that they perhaps are no longer a


single body.  Is that what the Eleventh Circuit concluded


in effect? 


MR. BISHOP:  Yes, I think the --


QUESTION:  That the manmade structures have


separated them and they're no longer unitary.


MR. BISHOP:  It -- it did, but in doing that, it


ignored a number of important considerations.  One is the


unitary aquifer that I have talked about.  The second is


the constant circulation --


QUESTION:  Does the record describe that


aquifer?  Does the record describe that aquifer? 


MR. BISHOP:  The -- yes.  I -- I believe it's


J.A. 177.


QUESTION:  While you're looking for that, I -- I


find it hard to understand how you can interpret -- I can

understand how you can interpret the phrase, navigable


waters, to mean all navigable waters.  I can't understand


how you can interpret the phrase, navigable waters, to


mean only those navigable waters that are within a single


aquifer or within a single drainage district.  How -- how


can you possibly derive that interpretation from the text?


MR. BISHOP:  No, I agree, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  Which is -- which is why you took the


extreme position, that is really textually not very


extreme at all.


MR. BISHOP:  No.  I agree with that, Justice


Scalia, obviously.  But I -- but I do think that if there


were a level of discomfort with that argument, which I


think is -- you know, it's fully justified by the statute. 

And I'd like to come back to that, Justice O'Connor, and


explain the other textual basis for -- for that argument. 


Nevertheless --


QUESTION:  Mr. Bishop, as I --


MR. BISHOP:  -- the concept of an addition --


QUESTION:  -- as I understand, that was the


Government's brief and it was spelled out very clearly.  I


didn't understand your brief to be taking the position


that all we have to worry about is the term, navigable


water, then that's the end of it.


MR. BISHOP:  Well, we think that there is more

to it than just the term, navigable water.  We think that


-- that we do -- we have argued throughout this case,


including in the lower courts, that the navigable waters


are a unitary concept for purposes of section 402.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bishop, isn't the problem with


the unitary concept idea that given the purposes of the


Clean Water Act, it makes great sense if there is a way of


distinguishing between bodies of water to distinguish them


in terms of their -- their pollution?  And the -- in -- in


effect, the -- the function of the kind of unitary


definition is a function that -- that works against the


protection of clean water as against to dirty water that


can be added to it.  And -- and shouldn't the -- shouldn't


the purposes of the act be taken into consideration in 

defining what is a body or a unified body of water?


MR. BISHOP:  The act does distinguish.  Congress


distinguished, when it wanted to, between the waters of


the United States and specific portions of the navigable


water.  And there's an example of that at the bottom of 7a


in the addendum.


QUESTION:  Are -- are you talking about a -- a


distinction based on the -- the quality of the water as


polluted or clean or relatively polluted/relatively clean?


MR. BISHOP:  The statute specifies that water


quality standards which identify what the goal is for the

level of pollutants in the water and the TMDL's, the total


maximum daily loads, that are used to achieve those water


quality standards are set for specific portions or parts


of the navigable water.  That is, the State -- a State


role is to identify, implement, and to enforce those water


quality standards which do apply to separate bodies of


water.  The regulations talk about bodies of water.


QUESTION:  So you're saying -- you're saying


that the problem that I'm raising is a problem that is


dealt with solely by water quality standards and cannot be


dealt with by -- by point source emission regulation. 


MR. BISHOP:  Well, I mean, that's -- that's -- I


mean, because of the complexities of the act, that's not


quite right. 


As a definitional matter, the Congress 

clearly distinguished between the navigable waters and


those portions as to which water quality standards were to


be set.  In implementing water quality standards, a State


may take account of the -- of effluence reaching the water


through point sources.  And in fact, there is a separate


provision of the statute --


QUESTION:  All right, but assuming a State may


do that, why does it follow that in defining bodies of


water for point source purposes, we may not do that?


MR. BISHOP:  Well, just let me run through, if I


may.  I mean, first of all, there --

 QUESTION:  No, but answer my question before you


run through because I -- I tend to lose the answers in the


-- in the run-throughs.


You're -- you're saying, look, when we're


talking about water quality standards, there are


distinctions made within a given body of water or within


navigable water.  And I think you're saying that for a


point source emission issues, we don't make that kind of


distinction.  My question was, if the distinction can be


made and in fact is made, with respect to water quality


standards, why should it follow that the same distinction


cannot be made for purposes of definition in point source


problems? 


MR. BISHOP: 


Because Congress recognized that 

this is a cooperative federalism statute where the Federal


Government and the State government has their role --


QUESTION:  As I understood you --


MR. BISHOP:  -- and in the plain language --


QUESTION:  -- you didn't say it cannot be made. 


You said it has not been made --


MR. BISHOP:  Well, it hasn't --


QUESTION:  -- in the statute.


MR. BISHOP:  It has been made in the statute.


QUESTION:  It has not been made and you're


saying it would be illegitimate to make it as a matter of

interpretation.  And my question is, why would it be


illegitimate as a matter of interpretation?


MR. BISHOP:  Well, that's my run-through.  The


plain language of the statute is navigable waters defined


as the waters of the United States.  That is backed up by


the use of the broad term discharge in section 401(a)


where Congress meant to reach much more and which isn't


limited by this language of an addition to the navigable


waters.


It is backed up by 304(f)(2)(F) where Congress


described as non-point source pollution pollution


resulting from the changes in the flow and circulation of


navigable waters or ground waters caused by flow diversion


devices like the pump.


And it's backed up by the fact that neither


Congress nor EPA has ever at any time since 1972 suggested


that these sorts of movements of water should be governed


by section 402.


If I may reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Then what did -- what did the tribe


mean when it said that there are, I think -- major


components of the Everglades construction project are


already under NPDES programs? 


MR. BISHOP:  Those are the STA's.  The


regulation 122.2, the definitional regulation, defines

treatment areas as not being navigable waters.  So when


you move water from a treatment area to a navigable water,


that requires 402 permitting.

Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, before you start, if I


may just -- could you tell me if you think the record


explains where the water in the eastern -- east of the


C-11 basin originates?


MR. MINEAR:  I'm not sure the record is clear on


this, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Because the part that Mr. Bishop


brought my attention to does not answer the question. 


MR. MINEAR:  I'm -- I cannot give you assurance.


QUESTION:  You don't -- you don't know the


answer.


MR. MINEAR:  I do not know the answer to that,


Your Honor. 


Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:


The United States submits that the Clean Water


Act does not require the South Florida Water Management

District to obtain a section 402 permit for the operation


of water control facilities like the S-9 pump which simply


move water from one location to another.  We believe that


position is correct on the basis of both the text of the


statute, the overarching purposes of the statute and its


structure, and also EPA's actual practices.


I'd like to turn first to the text of the


statute.  Section 402 states that a NPDES permit is


required when there is an addition of a pollutant to


navigable waters from a point source, and section 5027


goes on to state that a -- the waters -- the navigable


waters are the waters of the United States.


Under that definition and those statutory


provisions, when an industrial out-fall introduces 

pollutants for the first time into the waters of the


United States, an NPDES permit is required.  However, when


a water control facility like the S-9 pump simply moves


water from one place to another, together with any


pollutants that might be contained therein, that


regulatory regime is not called into play.


QUESTION:  But if in fact an industrialist adds


quite -- something quite filthy out of a pipe into a clean


body of water, there is no addition if, at the same time,


in some other body of water, he's taking out an equivalent


amount.

 MR. MINEAR:  I think that the -- the text


precludes that understanding because it states any


addition of any pollutant.  And we think the use -- these


definitions are written quite carefully, and we think that


those -- the term any --


QUESTION:  So a single body of water is --


MR. MINEAR:  -- indicates you can't rule it out.


QUESTION:  A single body of water, which seems


to have been a concept that the EPA has used for years and


years -- that's irrelevant.


MR. MINEAR:  That is -- that's not the case that


EPA has used a single body of water.


QUESTION:  They haven't.  They've never said --


MR. MINEAR:  No.  I think that in fact the --


the approach that EPA has taken in this is -- can be seen


from a number of sources.  First of all, EPA has never


attempted to regulate water control facilities like the


S-9 pump in the 30 years that the NPDES program has been


in place.  And what's more, in cases, the closely


analogous cases, of dams where water is simply being


passed through a dam, EPA has taken the position that an


NPDES permit is not required. 


Part of the reason for this is there are other


regulatory programs that deal with these problems. 


Justice Breyer mentioned the problem of taking a polluted

river and combining it with a pristine river.  That


actually implicates a number of different programs.  First


of all, in the case of the polluted river, that river is


subject to 402 requirements, and so there will be steps


taken to prevent the discharge of pollutants into the


polluted river.


The States also are required, or at least


strongly urged by the Government and with strong carrot


and stick type incentives, to adopt non-point source


pollution programs to reduce any non-point pollution that


might be going into that polluted river. 


If there's an attempt to connect that river to


another river, it does implicate, as Mr. Bishop indicated,


the section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act which deals


with regulations that result in the change in the flow


of --


QUESTION:  What about -- C-11 doesn't come


within that because it's not polluted enough?


MR. MINEAR:  C-11, when it was first constructed


at that -- at the time that the C-11 canal was built back


in the 1950's, most likely -- well, it was in fact


constructed by the Corps of Engineers.  So it was subject


to the public interest review provisions that the Rivers


and Harbors Act envisions.  When the -- the Corps


investigates private connections of this type, it conducts

what's called a public interest review, and this is


described in your case, United States v. Alaska at 503


U.S. 569.


QUESTION:  What about the other half of what I


said, that I'm thinking if you were to be wrong on that,


if I thought you were wrong on what you've said --


assumption -- then it's not so bad for you because EPA can


handle what I call the California central river valley


project by the Costle -- you know what I'm thinking of. 


Leventhal's opinion in Costle.  Does that ring a bell? 


NRDC v. Costle.  Does that ring a bell to you?


MR. MINEAR:  I'm afraid I'm not familiar with


that.  That's --


QUESTION: 


He lists -- in that opinion there, he 

lists -- he lists a set of things that EPA could do under


the permit requirement that would, in fact, alleviate the


administrative burden and would make sure that all these


pipes and things in California don't really have an


administrative problem or other problem by having to go to


EPA to get the permit. 


MR. MINEAR:  EPA has substantial discretion to


minimize the types of regulatory burdens that might be


imposed here.  Nevertheless, they're likely to be


substantial.  And what they amount to in this case is


really a belt and suspenders approach, and you know, the

additional haberdashery is fine except for the cost that


it does entail.  In this case it could be very substantial


for projects throughout the Nation.


QUESTION:  Don't you think there would be


another lawsuit quite promptly if -- if EPA simply said


you automatically get a permit for this type of operation?


MR. MINEAR:  I think that's correct.  And in


addition, I think we have to consider what would a permit


accomplish in this case that the CERP project that the


Corps of Engineers has -- is implementing is not already


doing.  That project is designed to deal with these


problems.


The permitting program is really designed to


deal with the specific problem of introducing pollutants 

into waterways for the first time.  It's really not


capable of dealing with this problem of water transfers


that move from one place to another.  Rather, there are


other programs that deal with this.  If it's a Federal


program, it would be subject to NEPA, for instance, and


there would be an environmental analysis before any action


was taken. 


In the case of the Rivers and Harbors Act that I


described before, that would also implicate section 401 of


the Clean Water Act, which requires a water quality


certification, a determination from the State that in fact

waters would be -- would not violate water quality


standards.


I'd like to make the point also that our


position is not an extreme one in saying that the -- the


text requires that we only look at the pollution when it


first enters the water.  Rather, it's a -- it's a approach


that recognizes that cleaning up polluted water requires a


number of different control strategies.  The NPDES


permitting program is only one.


QUESTION:  Well, what do we make of information


such as that provided by the State of Pennsylvania,


talking about the application of the permit system to


interbasin transfers in that State and saying how


beneficial it has been?


MR. MINEAR:  Well, the State of -- the


Commonwealth of Pennsylvania can, of course, adopt that


type of program on its own under its State law to deal


with those types of programs.  Any State can.


QUESTION:  It tells us that it's been getting


permits under this Federal scheme and that it's been


helpful.


MR. MINEAR:  That might very well be, and it is


allowed to supplement the Federal scheme with its own


State additions.  But other States, such as California,


have found --

 QUESTION:  I don't understand that.  You


conceded that in Pennsylvania EPA permits are obtained?


MR. MINEAR:  No.  These -- the -- EPA has


delegated authority to implement the permitting program to


a number of States, including Pennsylvania.  So


Pennsylvania is issuing the 402 permits in lieu of the


Federal Government.  My point is --


QUESTION:  It's done the same thing in Florida. 


EPA has delegated to the State agency, hasn't it?


MR. MINEAR:  That's true.  In fact, it has in


most States.  So in fact, in most States the States are


issuing these permits with substantial guidance from the


Federal Government.  The Federal Government is setting the


floor for what the permit requirements are, but the States 

are free to supplement their permitting programs with


additional State requirements and many do so.  Many States


like California actually operate with additional programs


apart from the Clean Water Act.  I think that Judge


Kennedy when he was -- or Justice Kennedy -- excuse me --


when he was a judge on the Ninth Circuit, wrote an opinion


concerning the New Malones project where he talked about


the imposition of water quality standards at -- at the


State level on Federal projects and indicated that the


States, in fact, do have that authority as well.


My -- my point here is that there are a number

of different mechanisms here in which these problems can


be addressed, and the important point is to choose the


right one.  In this context, the NPDES permitting program


is not the correct mechanism for dealing with the problems


that the Florida Everglades faces.  Instead, that problem


is being addressed comprehensively through Federal and


State programs. 


QUESTION:  Is that the view that EPA takes?


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, that is the view.  The brief


of the United States here is it reflects a consensus of a


number of agencies, not only EPA but the Department of the


Interior, the Corps of Engineers, and the Department of


Army. 


And I'd like to mention there's been some


suggestion that this Court should draw inferences from the


names that are on the cover of the brief, and those


inferences should not be drawn.  The names on the brief


have no relationship to whether or not -- the absence of


the names of an agency does not indicate the brief does --


does not represent the views of a particular agency.  That


can be seen in a number of briefs, including the Swank


brief from two terms ago in which Administrator Browner


was a party in that case, a party to the proceeding, and


yet there are no EPA counsel names on the brief.


QUESTION:  But I notice that there's a brief

filed by former administrators and general counsel which


says that the position of the EPA back in '75 was that of


your opponent.


MR. MINEAR:  They're relying on a 1975 general


counsel opinion that addressed the question of irrigation


return flows.  Congress repudiated the position that was


taken there 2 years later in the 1977 amendments.  It


mentions this point only tangentially.  It's not even


among the 17 questions presented that are listed in that


opinion. 


And I think what's more telling is the practice


of EPA since that time.  EPA has not required permits from


water control facilities to do no more than move water.


QUESTION:  Can I make one thing clear?  You do


not endorse the position of the petitioner that it has to


be the point source itself that -- that causes the


pollution.


MR. MINEAR:  That is correct.  We do not endorse


that addition.


Thank you, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Minear.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

please the Court:


The Miccosukee Tribe and Friends of the


Everglades contend that a pollutant is added to navigable


waters whenever it's put into navigable waters where it


would not otherwise be, whenever it's put somewhere where


it's not already there or would not naturally flow.


The receiving navigable water body is the point


of focus under the Clean Water Act because the act


specifically provides for designating different water


bodies with specific designated uses and with associated


water quality standards that will protect those uses.  And


the associated permitting system of the act 402 rests on


the assumption that the proprietary of the -­


proprietariness of the proposed addition of a pollutant 

will be measured against the receiving navigable water


body's designated use and against the receiving navigable


water body's water quality standards.


QUESTION:  What -- what says that?  I mean, the


-- the text we're dealing with here talks about adding


pollutants to the navigable waters of the United States if


you read the two definitions together.  And as I see


what's happened here, no pollutants have been added to the


navigable waters of the United States.  The total amount


of pollutants is the same.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Yes.  Justice Scalia, it says any

addition of any pollutant to -- to navigable waters.  The


reason navigable waters need not have and would be


confusing to have any adjective is because the location of


the point source inherently dictates the receiving


navigable water.


QUESTION:  You -- it could -- it could say to a


particular navigable water.  It could have said that very


easily.  It doesn't -- it doesn't say that.  It says to


navigable waters. 


MR. LEHTINEN:  It could, Your Honor, but since


the permitting system is from a point source, it would not


make sense to say to any other navigable water that the


point source is not discharging to.  The point source


itself makes the location of the navigable waters 

specified by the fact that the point source can only


discharge --


QUESTION:  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't -- it


doesn't do what you say the provision does, that -- that


is, to make it unlawful without a permit to add to a


particular navigable water a pollutant that is not already


there but that is elsewhere in the navigable waters.  As


it's written, all it says is you shall not add pollutants


to the navigable waters of the United States.  That's how


those definitions work out.  And that has not happened


here.

 MR. LEHTINEN:  Yes, Justice Scalia, but if that


were the meaning of that text and the lack of an


adjective, any navigable waters were to mean that once in


navigable waters, that pollutant could be spread to any


navigable water with any different designated use or any


different water quality --


QUESTION:  As far as this provision is


concerned.


MR. LEHTINEN:  That's correct, Your Honor.  And


this provision has been recognized as being the main


method by which the Clean Water Act cleans up water.


The -- the problem of the polluted river or


dirty river is one problem with the interpretation that


there's a singular navigable waters. 


An example -- a 

specific example is the Dubois case, in which the


Pemigewassett River was, in fact, so bad that the First


Circuit said it peeled paint off of the adjoining


buildings on the bank.  That river, under this


interpretation, would have been put into Loon Pond


strictly for the purpose of resupplying Loon Pond.  It


didn't always go through snow-making equipment.  The First


Circuit made it clear that sometimes it is directly from


the east branch to Loon Pond. 


Furthermore, it would make it impossible to


actually administer the permitting system because a permit

writer is told to evaluate the propriety of the proposed


addition of a pollutant based on the designated use and


the water quality standards of the receiving navigable


water.  It wouldn't be effective if thereafter that permit


were deemed, as a matter of law, to have authorized the


addition of that pollutant throughout the entire United


States to any navigable water no matter what its


designated use and no matter what its water quality


standard.


QUESTION:  Is it just the First Circuit case or


is there any history in the EPA over the years, I guess 30


years, where they did make clear that the navigable waters


of the United States -- the discharge is not just like one


big water where the Sacramento River and Hudson are part 

of the same big water?


MR. LEHTINEN:  Yes, the United States, Justice


Breyer, on many occasions -- starting in 1975 EPA general


counsel issued the opinion that surface water runoff and


return flows from irrigation, even when in navigable


waters, that is to say an agricultural canal, when then


discharged to other navigable waters, would require a


permit.  Congress did not repudiate that because what --


Congress, if it had repudiated it, would have said that


was not an addition.  In fact, Congress --


QUESTION:  Return flow from -- from irrigation

seems to me quite different.  I mean, that is taking


something out of the navigable waters, adding something to


it, and then returning it to the navigable waters.  It's


-- it's the fertilizer and -- and other pollutants that


are picked up in the irrigation process that -- that is


the problem. 


MR. LEHTINEN:  But the question --


QUESTION:  That's quite different from just


transferring from one navigable water to another.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Well, those elements of it are,


Justice Scalia, but what the EPA opinion --


QUESTION:  But why are they different?  They go


along and the water is pure and it sort of picks up some


drainage from Tallahassee or someplace, and now it's not 

quite the same, and by the time they get it next to the


big lake there, it's filled with stuff, just like the --


just like the stuff that drains off the land.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Well, it is not different when it


gets into the canal.  The C-11 canal, which is a drainage


canal that receives surface water runoff, like an -- a


agricultural canal that receives irrigation return flow,


is itself a jurisdictional navigable waters under this


Court's decisions in Riverside Bayview simply because it's


connected to, in this case, the Atlantic.  In other words,


it's not navigable in fact itself.

 QUESTION:  Well, apart from the -- what --


1972 --


MR. LEHTINEN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- general counsel opinion, which --


which applied to -- to return from -- from cultivated


land, do you -- do you deny that -- that the EPA has never


sought to require permitting of this kind of a facility


for 30 years?  Is -- is that inaccurate?


MR. LEHTINEN:  Yes.  Well, it is inaccurate in


the sense that in 1993 EPA told the South Florida Water


Management District, to its chagrin, that it would have to


have NPDES permits for all of these Everglades


construction project features that were motivated by the


United States v. South Florida Water --


QUESTION:  So that States have been violating


the Federal law for 30 years and nobody knew about it?


MR. LEHTINEN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor? 


QUESTION:  The States have been violating the


Federal law for 30 years.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Well, in most cases --


QUESTION:  That's kind of an extraordinary


interpretation.


MR. LEHTINEN:  In most cases, Your Honor, the


simple movement of water does not end up, even under


Miccosukee -- this case, requiring a permit.  Most of them

are -- are not covered.  They return to the same water


body.  The dam cases make it clear that that's a return to


the same water body.  If they're --


QUESTION:  You don't -- you think the dam cases


are correctly decided and you don't need to distinguish


them?


MR. LEHTINEN:  We distinguish them, Your Honor,


because the dam cases dealt with the condition -- the D.C.


Circuit made it clear in the Gorsuch case in '82 that dam-


induced changes in condition such as super-saturation and


so forth, and that that was not a pollutant.  They didn't


say dams weren't point sources.  They said that was not a


pollutant.


QUESTION: 


I thought same water body made no 

difference to you.  I thought neither side thought that


the answer to this case depended upon whether it was the


same water body or not.  If -- do you think that if it --


if -- if it is established that -- that this is the same


water body, these pumps would be okay without permitting.


MR. LEHTINEN:  No, Your Honor, because --


QUESTION:  I thought so.  Neither side takes


that position.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Neither side takes the position,


but it is true that the phrase, water body, because it's


used in so much of the EPA regulations, is a shorthand for

saying that the pollutant is added to a navigable water


that wouldn't otherwise receive it.  The fact is that as


the First Circuit said, the argument about whether Loon


Pond, well up here -- uphill from the Pemigewassett River,


east branch, was hydrologically connected or not was


irrelevant because Loon Pond would never receive water


from the Pemigewassett River, even though that Loon Pond


eventually flowed through the watershed to the river.


QUESTION:  The dam --


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question about --


QUESTION:  -- our problem, aren't they, that --


that the -- for you.  That is that it seems to me that


under your definition, it's going to be the same body of


water. 


And then if you say, well, it didn't add any 

pollutant that wouldn't have been there otherwise, I bet


that with most dams that isn't so, I mean, because there's


a lot of mud stirred up in that lake behind the, say,


Boulder, Hoover Dam and so forth.  A big problem. 


And if we think of California and the central


valley water project, my goodness, you're not going to say


that's all one body of water.  You have the Sacramento,


San Joaquin, Los Angeles.  You know, it goes all over the


place. 


And so that's their big problem.  They are


saying if you -- if you don't take a strong reading of the

dam cases, one that hurts you, we're suddenly going to


find ourselves with -- with water valley projects all over


the United States and 15 million permits required, and it


just won't work. 


All right.  So what's your response to that? 


MR. LEHTINEN:  Well, Your Honor, first with


respect to the same body of water, if you were referring


to the Everglades, this is a -- C-11 is a canal that has


gas stations, urban shopping malls, industrial parks


around it.  And the canal itself was dug out.  It's not as


though 99.99 percent of the Everglades were removed.  So


that canal has been dug deeper.  The Everglades' ecosystem


removed.  It's distinctly different. 


QUESTION: 


That's why I think we need a separate 

body of water requirement there.  But what about the other


part of what they say?


MR. LEHTINEN:  Well, with respect to these


larger water projects, Your Honor, first of all, if


they're withdrawing water, they're not going to come under


our condition, withdrawing and then being used for a


consumptive use and so forth.  That's already dealt with a


different way.  If they're returning the water through


irrigation return flow, that's already exempt.


Otherwise, if they're -- the State does


designate the use and does designate the water quality

standards.  So these large movements through canals and


water projects -- the State controls the designation of


those uses.


And even if they were found to be a movement


from one navigable water to another, they're likely to


qualify for a general permit.  As Colorado said on page 3


of its brief, none of their movements of water, through


any structures in Colorado, interbasin transfers, result


in a water quality standard violation.  Accordingly,


Colorado solves any problem it has with one general


permit.


As well, most of these big movements of water


move water that doesn't distinctly, as in this case, move


water that's four times higher in a certain content than 

the receiving water body's water quality standard.  The


State law for the Everglades and only the Everglades


protection area, not the C-11 canal, is now 10 parts per


billion.  That actual number was changed and became


effective January 1 of 2004, but it had a separate


designation and water quality standard throughout all of


the time of this case. 


QUESTION:  May I ask you two questions that I --


I think you may have answered, but I'm just not sure?  Do


you -- in your view is water conservation area 3 and the


C-11 basin the same body of water, or are they different

bodies?  That's my first question. 


My second question is in your view does the


record tell us where the water from the C-11 basin


primarily comes from?


MR. LEHTINEN:  Yes, Justice Stevens.  With


respect to the first, they're distinctly different bodies


of water.  The C-11 canal is a canal that has been dug


artificially deep, surrounded by gas stations, shopping


malls. 


QUESTION:  I understand that.


MR. LEHTINEN:  And it does not have the ecology


of the Everglades.  Nobody stands at a gas station and


says to their child, there, John, is the Everglades.  It


-- it has -- and it doesn't have Everglades water because 

Everglades water would naturally flow west to east, and


they have blocked that flow from the Everglades into the


sloughs and into the Atlantic Ocean.


QUESTION:  Then what about the second question? 


MR. LEHTINEN:  With respect to the second, the


record shows the trial court found that substantial


surface water runoff goes into the C-11, and --


QUESTION:  That's right, but why does the --


what is the source of the runoff?


MR. LEHTINEN:  Well, the source of the runoff is


sometimes rainfall.

 QUESTION:  I understand. 


MR. LEHTINEN:  And it is sometimes from the


aquifer --


QUESTION:  But surely it didn't get all their


water from -- from rain.


MR. LEHTINEN:  And it is sometimes from the


aquifer below the C-11 because the C-11 basin, as opposed


to the canal -- the C-11 basin is a -- has been drained


and substantial fill put in for the gas --


QUESTION:  But that -- that thing in the -- the


water in the aquifer in turn comes largely from the


Everglades, does it not?


MR. LEHTINEN:  Your Honor --


QUESTION: 


It filters down to the aquifer from 

the Everglades and then seeps through to the other side of


the levee.  I thought it was -- I thought it was


acknowledged on both sides that there's -- that there's


transfer of water from the west to the east below the


levee.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Yes, Your Honor, from west to


east, but not east to west, and when the water transfers


through the --


QUESTION:  Well, but that doesn't -- that


doesn't go to the point of whether it's the same body of


water or not.  I mean, whether it flows east to west or

west to east, the point is it's -- it's the same water.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Well, Your Honor, the fact that


waters will flow from the -- in that case, there would be


perhaps three bodies of water in the United States:  east


of the Appalachian Divide, west of it, and -- and then


separated by the Continental Divide in the west.  The fact


that one water will flow eventually into the other doesn't


make them the same water body.  That is to say, Loon Pond,


which was a substantially different ecology and water


quality standard and different classification by the


State, flowing eventually into the polluted Pemigewassett


River much further downstream, did not make them the same


water body. 


QUESTION: 


You say that subsurface flow doesn't 

count then in this question. 


MR. LEHTINEN:  That's correct.  In this case


subsurface flow -- that water is substantially changed in


the aquifer.  By the time it's underneath the C-11, it


doesn't have the biological or ecosystem characteristics


of the water that is in the Everglades protection area. 


It's been substantially changed by the -- by the aquifer.


QUESTION:  But you say this doesn't matter


anyway.  You wouldn't care if it was the same water body. 


That isn't -- that isn't what you're arguing.


MR. LEHTINEN:  We do argue that it is the same

water body and you pump it substantially upstream.  You


would also need a permit. 


QUESTION:  Right, right.


MR. LEHTINEN:  The downstream Pemigewassett


River --

could look for a definition of what is the same water


body?  Is -- is there some -- some -- can I -- you know,


I'm not sure.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Well, there is a -- there is a --


QUESTION:  We could try Genesis --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  -- or then the second --


(Laughter.) 


MR. LEHTINEN:  There is -- there is EPA


guidance, but the fact that 303 of the act itself mandates


that States designate different water bodies and the


phrase, water bodies, used in the EPA specification of


what water quality standards is means that, as a matter of


fact, it's done all of the time.  And in the State of


Florida, the State legislature has designated the


Everglades protection area quite distinct from the canal,


a different water quality standard and a -- and a


different use for that water.  And as a hydrological


matter, they are -- they are able to -- to deal with that.

They've given them different water body numbers in the


State of Florida.  The C-11 canal is a different water


body number from the Everglades -- various parts of the


Everglades protection area and -- and so forth.


The --


QUESTION:  Could you explain what's at stake


here practically?  We're told that there are other means


to deal with this phosphorus problem.  If the permit you


envision were required, what would that permit demand?


MR. LEHTINEN:  This permit would most likely


require simply that the plan that the district already has


-- has on the books and which they mentioned in their


brief would be implemented within a reasonable period of


time and under a reasonable compliance schedule. 

The Everglades restoration project was first


motivated, as -- as is admitted in all briefs, by


litigation against the district for discharging phosphorus


that caused an imbalance of natural populations of flora


and fauna, and furthermore, all of the congressional acts


that deal with the Everglades restoration projects --


that's -- and they're referred to in our brief called


WRDA, Water Resources Development Act '96 and Water


Resources Development Act 2000 -- both refer to the


pending litigation and make the statement that they don't


intend to interfere with pending litigation.  And WRDA

2000 specifically says that nothing in these Everglades


restoration -- this section shall be deemed to eliminate


any permitting requirements under law.


QUESTION:  What is -- what is then the -- the


reason for this litigation?  I mean, you -- you say you're


just trying to get them to do what they have already said


they are doing.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  You don't believe that they're doing


it.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  And you don't believe they're going


to do it, you know, in the foreseeable future.


MR. LEHTINEN: 


We -- we believe, as -- as 

Congress did, that the Clean Water Act -- that the


programs in place were not always implemented and that the


Clean Water Act was necessary as a backstop to stop the


backsliding.  The Federal Government's litigation in 1988


required the State to do no more than the State in press


releases was saying that it was doing and intended to do,


but the litigation, reinforced by Congress that


specifically said we don't intend to interfere with any of


that litigation, indicates why Federal enforcement is a --


is a useful and necessary tool to ensure that States under


different pressures don't backslide.

 Our brief appendix indicates that 2 years ago


they indicated they would meet water quality standards in


the S-9 by 2005, and then with the pendency of this


litigation, they have eliminated any commitment to reach


it by 2005, hoping that this litigation will first relieve


them of the oversight of the NPDES on S-9 and then they


will use this litigation to eliminate the NPDES's that


were required from 1993 forward on the other projects. 


The only thing that keeps those -- those other discharge


structures under the restoration project from not being


extended or otherwise modified by the State are the EPA-


placed NPDES permits that already exist on all of those


Everglades restoration projects.  We simply want the same


permitting backstop on the S-9 structure.


With respect to the question of singular waters,


the singular waters approach of the United States


eliminates the different designated uses and the ability


to actually determine the effects of a permit.  The


Minnesota amici brief is very useful in this sense because


it points out that St. Paul now, like the Commonwealth of


Pennsylvania and others, does get an NPDES to remove water


from the Mississippi to its lake and water reservoir. 


However, if the Solicitor General's position were correct,


St. Paul would no longer need that NPDES permit, and St.


Cloud, substantially up-river on the Mississippi, would --

would be under a -- a review for does its discharges to


the Mississippi, which have been found to meet the NPDES


requirements, not changing the designated use or violating


the Mississippi's water quality standard -- it -- its


discharges should be deemed to be somehow removable


artificially downstream in the Mississippi so that


anyplace anyone at any time might construct the pipe and


move them into a more pristine water body, you, St. Cloud


now have to anticipate that and will be put under that --


that mandate.


So the inability of a permit writer to construct


a 402 permit because he doesn't know that the evaluation


is now to the receiving navigable water, but instead I


have to evaluate where anyone with a pipe might move it, 

hundreds and hundreds of miles, without an NPDES permit,


that permit writer essentially has to permit only for the


highest designated use and the highest water quality


standard anywhere in the United States, notwithstanding


that where the discharge -- point source is discharging to


is a particular designated use.  That would make the act


either impossible to administer or place burdens on the


governments that the petitioner says should not be placed


on the governments.  Instead of placing it on the


government that for some purpose, some economic purpose,


is able to -- to determine the costs and to -- and to

clean the water or at least subject itself to review, when

navigable water, you place the burden instead on anyone


else who might discharge so -- and -- and whose -- whose


discharge, might, if removed anywhere downstream by anyone


for any reason, might end up causing a violation of a


water quality standard.


QUESTION:  Look -- look, when -- when the States


require permitting, as -- as they're allowed to do, they


can presumably limit the permitting to just the -- the


kind of difficult situations you're talking about, when it


is into a pristine body of water from a more polluted body


of water.  But if we agree with you on the meaning of the


act, permitting will be mandatory not just when -- when 

there are differences between the pollution levels of the


two bodies of water, but whenever there is a transfer from


one body of water to another.  Even when the two bodies of


water are equally polluted, you would need a permit


because you are adding -- you are adding pollutants.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Now, it may well be you're adding


pollutants to a body of water that already contains it,


but you will need a -- a permit in every case whenever any


State tries to do flood control projects or any project


that requires the transfer of water from one body to

another.


MR. LEHTINEN:  Well, in the so-called worst


case, Justice Scalia, they'd be qualifying because they


don't have a -- they're not impairing either water body --


qualifying for one general permit issued in the State. 


But under other circumstances --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Can you do that?  Can --


I mean, can EPA issue a general permit, say anybody


that --


MR. LEHTINEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  General permits


are authorized and they are often written to say under the


following conditions, you qualify for the general permit,


and -- and --

MR. LEHTINEN:  That's correct, Your Honor.  You


don't have to get it.


QUESTION:  You just go ahead.


MR. LEHTINEN:  The general permit might or might


not say to do certain monitoring to make sure that you


stay within the conditions of the general permit.  Those


general permits are very common, and even individual


permits are usually system-wide permits.  You have 80


structures --

that applies to a number of different people? 


MR. LEHTINEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  A general


permit can be statewide.  The permit looks almost like a


rule, but the permit says -- and in the case of the Corps,


they do nationwide permits, but 404 is not at issue here. 


The general permit statewide could say that under the


following circumstances, when you are an unimpaired water


body discharging to an unimpaired water body or


discharging at levels that have pollutants but don't


impair the receiving water body, you automatically qualify


for this permit.  Do some monitoring.  Let us know every


year.  That general permit is -- is frequently used and --


and is very close to rulemaking.


But it's also possible, under those 

circumstances -- and this is not our case.  Our case


discharges at almost four times the water quality


standard, 10 parts per billion, for the receiving water


body.  It clearly impairs the receiving water body.  But


if the standard for a water body were 20 of a substance,


its actual receiving level was 10 and you discharged at 5,


not to get too complex, but you're discharging at a lower


level than the receiving water body and the water bodies


are not impaired, it's possible mathematically, but not


our case here -- these hypotheticals should be left to


another time.  It's possible that the 1 gallon in the

receiving water body that had 10, with 1 gallon added to


it that had 5, the 2 gallons now have 15, or in fact,


7-and-a-half per receiving unit.  That may be determined


by rule or other appropriate analysis in the western


cases, if they ever come up, to not be an addition.  But


that's not our case here. 


The Court, in an abundance of caution, could


point out that our case here is an artificial canal that


receives substantial surface water runoff, itself probably


a conveyance under the Clean Water Act definition of


channels or discrete conveyances, that it discharges at


levels up to four times the receiving water body's water


quality standard, that it is itself an impaired water


body. 


So that the hypothetical situations or application 

to western States or elsewhere is -- are not being


addressed by the Court.


Now -- now, the -- the amici from the Tongue and


Yellowstone River Irrigation District point out actually


that in the west, they believe that ranchers and farmers


will suffer from the Federal Government's unitary water


theory because they will now be subject to water that is


not of sufficient quality for their irrigation district


and so forth. 


It's not simply a west -- and the State of


Washington also joined in our brief.  We, of course -- we

don't count States, but more States support the tribe in


their briefs saying this is essential than do support the


-- the district and the United States. 


The -- it's particularly important to recognize


the C-11 was itself dug, is not a residual part of the


Everglades, and that it's -- the C-11 basin is not simply


a -- a water body divided from the WCA or the Everglades


protection area by a levee.  Looking at pages 6a and 7a of


our brief, which are the appendix to our brief, are from


the district's own web site, which it cited in its brief,


and it shows the urban construction right to the boundary. 


So it's not that the C-11 basin is water just divided. 


It's an artificial canal.  It's no -- no more part of the


Everglades protection area than Fenway Park in Boston is 

part of the Charles River because it's built on the


landfill where the Charles River once was.  They're quite


distinct.


With respect to federalism issues, the Clean


Water Act itself is a federalism instrument because it


provides for the States to do the designation of uses.  It


provides for the States to -- to create the water quality


standards, and it does protect the ability of the States


to allocate quantities of water, but this is not a


quantity allocation.


The record shows clearly that the S-9 pump is

turned on when you get to 1 foot of -- turned off when --


when the C-11 basin is at 1 foot and turned on when it's


at 4 foot.  It is strictly a drainage mechanism to take


surface water runoff and other water out of the C-11. 


They're disposing of water.  They don't want the water. 


They're dumping the water wherever they can put it.


And actually the water is not our concern.  It


is the pollutants.  Whenever they say merely conveying


water, we would say conveyance is defined as a point


source and they convey pollutants.  If they didn't convey


this massive amount of pollutants, we would not be before


Your Honors.


The district, by pumping pollutants contained in


the water against the natural flow of that water into the 

specially designated Everglades protection area, added


that water to the Everglades protection area within the


plain meaning of -- of the Clean Water Act and within the


common usage of -- of language.  The district put those


pollutants in the Everglades and nobody but the district


put those pollutants in the Everglades.


An effort to reconstruct the term, addition to


navigable waters, to allow them to dispose of those


pollutants anywhere in the United States with a navigable


water of any designated use or of any water quality


standard would decimate the Clean Water Act's protection

not only of the Everglades, but of the case law that --


that Your Honors have had cited in the brief. 


Now, the circuit court cases are not


particularly precedent for your Court, but it does point


out that Loon Pond would have had water that peeled paint


off of the adjoining buildings put into it and not just


through snow-making devices.  The -- the court clearly


indicated that sometimes the Pemigewassett water was put


directly to Loon Pond to -- to increase the amount of


water in Loon Pond. 


Now, the -- the United States would try to save


its singular water theory in some cases by saying, well,


water might be removed.  They said on the Dubois case, the


First Circuit Loon Pond, that it was removed for snow-

making, but I point out that the court said in several


places that it also went directly, never through snow-


making devices. 


They would say that when you put it through


tunnels or so forth, perhaps it loses its navigable water


character.  The State of New York, of course, is strongly


in favor of the tribe because the 18-mile Shandaken Tunnel
