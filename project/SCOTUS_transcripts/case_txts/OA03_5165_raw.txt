 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument

 Mr. Dunham. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. DUNHAM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9  please the Court: 

10

 The central issue in this case is whether the 

11  Government, having failed to prove that the police 

12  initiated contact with Petitioner Thornton while he was an 

13  occupant of his automobile and having failed to prove that 

14  when Mr. Thornton was arrested, that he was even within 

15  reaching distance of his automobile, may rely on New York 

16  v. Belton to justify a warrantless, suspicionless search 

17  of Mr. Thornton's automobile incident to arrest. 

18

19

 Now, it's the Government's burden -­

 QUESTION:  Well, now, Belton did involve a car 

20  search after the suspects had left the car and were under 

21  arrest.  They weren't in a position to reach into the car. 

22

 MR. DUNHAM:  They were within reaching distance 

23  of the vehicle, Justice O'Connor. 

24

25

 QUESTION:  And arrested. 

 MR. DUNHAM:  They -- they were standing by the 

3


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  side of the car at the -- at the moment of arrest. 

2

 QUESTION:  Right, but then they were disabled by 

3  the arrest.  They couldn't reach into the car, and after 

4  that, the search occurred, and we -- we said, okay, that 

5  you could search if -- for a recent occupant of the 

6  vehicle.  I just -- I think the reasons articulated in 

7  Belton weren't all that clear, but it may cover this case. 

8

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe 

9  that when you focus on the word recent, it's not a very 

10  bright line test unless you flesh it out and give it some 

11  definition.  I believe I was a recent occupant of my 

12  automobile this morning.  Somebody could say I was 

13  recently in that, but that wouldn't mean that they could 

14  go search it. 

15

16

17

 Well, the facts show -­

 QUESTION:  Do we know from the facts here? 

 MR. DUNHAM:  -- a lot less -- the facts here 

18  show a lot less time, but recent doesn't give the kind of 

19  clear bright line that Belton said it was trying to draw 

20  because it -- it's open to a lot of interpretation. 

21

22

23

 Our -­

 QUESTION:  How about moments? 

 QUESTION:  You conceded -- the Fourth Circuit 

24  said that it was conceded in the -- that he was in close 

25  proximity to his vehicle when Officer Nichols approached 

4


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  him, and the record does conclusively show that Officer


2  Nichols observed Thornton park and exit his automobile and


3  then approached Thornton within moments.  You don't


4  dispute any of that I take it.


5

 MR. DUNHAM:  No.  Those -- those are the facts


6  of the case, Your Honor.


7

 But moments again -- is he -- is he 5 yards, 10


8  yards, 15 yards away from the vehicle?  We -- I think we


9  need to go back to what Belton was all about.  Belton said


10  that it concerns the proper -- quoting at page 459 of the


11  Belton opinion, it says the proper scope of a search of


12  the interior of an automobile, incident to a lawful


13  custodian -- custodial arrest of its occupants.  And the


14  Belton rule itself says, quote, at page 460, when a


15  policeman has made a lawful arrest of the occupants of an


16  automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that


17  arrest, search the passenger compartment of that


18  automobile. 


19

 Belton was focusing on that highly dangerous


20  situation when a police officer initiates contact with and


21  approaches a -- an occupied vehicle.  As this Court


22  recognized in Pennsylvania v. Mimms, that may be the most


23  highly dangerous situation an officer faces.


24

 QUESTION:  But there was no search until the -­


25  Belton was -- wasn't he in -- in the patrol car by the


5


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  time they started the search? 

2

 MR. DUNHAM:  So was Mr. Thornton, Your Honor, 

3  and I -­

4

 QUESTION:  But -- so I -- that's what I don't -­

5  it's quite different from search into -- incident to 

6  arrest.  The -- the area around the defendant, the 

7  defendant may still grab a gun.  But the one thing we know 

8  is that when the defendant -- when the suspect is sitting 

9  in the patrol car with handcuffs on, there isn't any 

10  danger that the police faces when they're doing the 

11  search.  When they arrested him, yes, but not when they 

12  search -- do the search. 

13

 MR. DUNHAM:  I would agree with that 100 

14  percent, Your Honor, but the converse of that position is 

15  that in order to do the search, the -- that he's allowed 

16  to do under the Fourth Amendment, that -- that right to 

17  search fixes at the moment he effects the custodial 

18  arrest.  You don't want to -- or it's not reasonable to 

19  require the officer to conduct that search with the 

20  suspect at his elbow. 

21

 So while I would agree with Your Honor as a -­

22  as a very practical matter, there is no danger to the 

23  officer in the situation where the man is arrested, 

24  stuffed in the back of the squad car, and then we go 

25  search, that's kind of a fiction.  But on the other hand, 

6


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  it may be a kind of a reasonable fiction because


2  otherwise, the converse is, if the officer is going to


3  search the car, he's got to do it with Mr. Thornton or Mr.


4  Belton standing right beside him.  And that's why -­


5

 QUESTION:  So you don't object to the search


6  taking place when there's no danger to the officer, but


7  you say in order to do that non-dangerous search, the


8  officer has to put himself in danger when he makes the


9  arrest.


10

 MR. DUNHAM:  That's -- that's right.  I -- and I


11  -- and I believe, Your Honor, that's why -- this case is


12  really presenting a situation where we're dealing with the


13  harm to the Fourth Amendment instead of really dealing


14  with potential danger to the officer.  Modern police


15  practices are going to have a Mr. Belton or a Mr. Thornton


16  in the back of the squad car at the time these searches


17  incident to the arrest under Belton or whether you're


18  operating -­


19

 QUESTION:  Was there -- were there reasonable


20  grounds here, do you concede that, for the Terry pat-down


21  of petitioner? 


22

23

24

 MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, there may or may not -­


 QUESTION:  Is that contested?


 MR. DUNHAM:  The -- that ground, that exception


25  to the warrant requirement was not advanced by the


7


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Government below. 

2

 QUESTION:  All right.  I mean, there was a Terry 

3  stop.  There was a pat-down.  Narcotics were found.  He 

4  was arrested.  Right?  Subsequently the search. 

5

6

7

8

 MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct.  We -­

 QUESTION:  Of the vehicle. 

 MR. DUNHAM:  We have not -­

 QUESTION:  Now, had -- had the officer not made 

9  an immediate search of the vehicle, presumably the police 

10  would have to have taken precautions to safeguard the car 

11  and make an inventory search of it.  So they're going to 

12  find the stuff anyway, aren't they? 

13

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, the -- the Fourth 

14  Circuit did not address -­

15

16

 QUESTION:  Isn't that right? 

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, not necessarily, Your Honor. 

17  We're not conceding that particularly in this case.  We're 

18  not saying that there -- this case involves a car that was 

19  parked in a -- in a shopping mall parking lot.  And the 

20  only motor vehicle violation didn't authorize a towing of 

21  the vehicle.  So that the -- the -- there is an inadequate 

22  record below with regard to whether or not there would 

23  have been an inevitable towing and inventory of this car. 

24

 QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me that Justice 

25  O'Connor's questions are -- are getting to your comment 

8


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that Belton is a -- is a fiction.  And maybe it's not a


2  fiction.  Maybe the officer, at the time he conducts the


3  search, is not in immediate danger, but if he left the


4  vehicle without conducting the search, a confederate can


5  come by.  There could be somebody with another key.  A


6  passer-by can come and get the gun if the car isn't


7  locked, and there's going to be an inventory search


8  anywhere -- anyway.  So Belton, rather than being a


9  fiction, makes a good deal of sense in terms of safety,


10  maybe not safety at the time the officer is making the


11  very search.  Maybe that's somewhat fictional.


12

 MR. DUNHAM:  You could make the same argument


13  with regard to the house in Chimel, that we limit the


14  search to the area within reaching distance in the room


15  that the man is in.  We don't let him go into the kitchen


16  or the bedroom.  But there could be accomplices there. 


17  There could be guns there.


18

 QUESTION:  Houses are -- houses are stationary


19  and cars are not.  So we have to draw the line there.


20

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, it -- the -- if the -- the


21  justification in Belton for allowing the vehicle search


22  says it's not a departure from Chimel, and it limits the


23  search to an area within the reaching distance.  It's


24  based on a generalization, Your Honor, that everything


25  within the narrow passenger compartment of the vehicle is


9


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  within reach of an occupant.  Now, when a man is no longer


2  an occupant and has become a pedestrian and is walking on


3  the street, that generalization that he can reach


4  everything in the narrow passenger compartment of an


5  automobile no longer makes any sense. 


6

 QUESTION:  Well, then -- then Belton should have


7  been -- if you're right, Belton should have -- not have


8  been decided the way it was. 


9

 MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, Belton was decided


10  absolutely correctly I believe.  The -- the -- Roger


11  Belton was approached by the officer while he was an


12  occupant of the vehicle.  The officer asked him to step


13  out of the car.  I do not believe that we want to have our


14  search incident to arrest doctrine turn on whether the


15  officer decides to have him step out before he places him


16  under arrest or arrest him, sit him in the -- sitting in


17  the vehicle.  Five other -­


18

 QUESTION:  Well, suppose this -- this officer


19  lets Mr. Thornton go to the shopping mall but is standing


20  guard next to the car and Mr. Thornton then comes back,


21  enters the car and just as he enters, the police officer


22  says, you're arrested.  Then he could do -­


23

 MR. DUNHAM:  In my view he would not be able to


24  do a Belton search.  He would be able to a Chimel search. 


25  He'd be able to arrest the individual under Chimel, which


10


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  is still the -- the law in this Court, and he would be


2  able to conduct a search of anything within Mr. Thornton's


3  reaching distance at the time.


4

5

 QUESTION:  So if -­


 QUESTION:  So if the car were -- the car door


6  were unlocked and his reach would have been long enough to


7  get inside the -- the car if the door were open, he could


8  search into the car?


9

 MR. DUNHAM:  If -- if the -- if the car was -­


10  if he could -- he could search for anything within


11  reaching distance of the person he's arresting.


12

13

 QUESTION:  What about the answer to my question?


 MR. DUNHAM:  If he could reach into the car, he


14  could -- he could get anything within the man's reach.


15

 QUESTION:  Why is that reasonable?  Why doesn't


16  he tell him, look it, move off, get -- get 10 yards away


17  from the car, get 20 yards away, however?  I -- I mean,


18  you -- you don't really suggest that there is a necessity


19  to conduct a Belton search in order to protect the


20  officer.  All he has to do is say, get away from the car.


21

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, I -- I agree with Your Honor


22  that if he hasn't arrested the man and he has an


23  opportunity to let the man move away from the car before


24  he conducts the arrest, he's certainly acting as a prudent


25  officer in protecting his own safety.  I would agree with


11


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that. 

2

3

 QUESTION:  It seems to me -­

 QUESTION:  Belton must then rest on some kind of 

4  bright line administrative consideration because you're 

5  attacking Belton in various ways which are logical.  But 

6  our problem I think in this case is to decide whether the 

7  particular limit that you propose makes sense, and that's 

8  where I'm having a problem because what you say is that 

9  the -- the line to be drawn around Belton is not just a 

10  line of -- in time and space, which I could understand. 

11  But you want to say it depends on whether the policeman 

12  initiated conduct with the individual before he exited the 

13  car.  And that seems to me that you're trying to 

14  distinguish between the case where the policeman notices a 

15  wanted suspect driving, pulls over to the side.  The 

16  police -- the -- the suspect takes off and runs over to a 

17  fence.  Now, that would be okay.  That's Belton. 

18

 But the car stops before the policeman 

19  recognizes him.  The driver gets out and then the 

20  policeman recognizes him, and then he takes off for the 

21  fence and it's exactly the same.  That you would say is 

22  not Belton. 

23

 Now -- now, that line that you're drawing there 

24  to me -- I -- I don't understand it at all in terms of the 

25  Belton rationale or administrative.  It would make it more 

12


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  complicated and it wouldn't achieve that much.  It seems


2  -- in other words, I want you to explain why that line is


3  a rational way of limiting Belton.


4

 MR. DUNHAM:  I would suggest, Your Honor, that


5  the man who exits the vehicle and runs to the fence, 15,


6  20, 30 yards from the vehicle, whether he did it because


7  the police pulled up behind him and turned the flashers on


8  or whether the policeman surprised him as he was coming


9  out of the car, neither one of those searches are good


10  under Belton because the man -- it's -- it's no longer


11  appropriate in my judgment to rely -­


12

 QUESTION:  That's not what the question


13  presented says.  It says, when the arrestee was not in the


14  car when the police initiated contact with him.


15

16

 MR. DUNHAM:  I understand. 


 QUESTION:  So what I thought you were advocating


17  is if the policeman was not in the car when the police


18  initiated contact with him, unless he's within reaching


19  distance, which he isn't -- if he's not in the car when


20  the police initiated contact with him, then don't apply


21  Belton.


22

 MR. DUNHAM:  That's -- that's correct, Your


23  Honor. 


24

 QUESTION:  And that was the line that I was


25  having trouble figuring out a justification for. 


13


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. DUNHAM:  That -- that's correct, Your Honor, 

2  and if I might respond. 

3

 The -- our -- our test under Belton has two 

4  prongs to it.  One is that he's in the car when the police 

5  initiate contact with him.  The second is that he's 

6  arrested within reaching distance of the car.  So your 

7  hypothetical that the man runs to the fence -­

8

 QUESTION:  You're saying that Belton never 

9  applies as within reaching -- if he's outside reaching 

10  distance of the car. 

11

 MR. DUNHAM:  If he's -- if he's outside reaching 

12  distance, it doesn't make any sense -­

13

 QUESTION:  Okay.  That's -- that's one possible 

14  rule.  That would -- that would invalidate what is 

15  ordinary police practice in almost every place, which is 

16  that they remove him, he's outside the police -- I take it 

17  it would. 

18

19

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, it's the moment -­

 QUESTION:  Can the policeman make him stay 

20  within reaching distance?  Wait.  Don't -- don't get any 

21  further than that.  I want you to stay right there. 

22

 MR. DUNHAM:  The policeman can arrest him and 

23  take control of him.  So I would argue yes, he can make 

24  him stay within reaching distance. 

25

 The -- the justification for the Belton search 

14


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  is to protect the officer.  It's not reasonable to think


2  that he's going to effect his arrest at a point that


3  increases the danger to himself just so that he can make a


4  search.


5

 QUESTION:  Okay.  I mean, I understand the


6  argument, and it's been made many times and there's a lot


7  of logic to it.  But it's been pretty consistently


8  rejected.  So -- but I got it.  At least I understand it


9  and -- and maybe it will be accepted or not.


10

 But let's put that one aside, the reaching


11  distance point.  Do you want to defend the other


12  distinction your making, which I take it is even if you


13  lose on reaching distance, still Belton does not apply if


14  the initial contact was made between the police and the -­


15  and the suspect outside the car?


16

17

18

19

20

21

22

 MR. DUNHAM:  We -- that is -­


 QUESTION:  You want to give up on that one.


 MR. DUNHAM:  No.


 QUESTION:  Or you want to defend it?


 MR. DUNHAM:  No, no.


 QUESTION:  Then defend it.


 MR. DUNHAM:  Our -- the initiation of contact we


23  believe is a -- is a very reasonable test, and we believe


24  it's called for by the Belton case itself.  When you read


25  -- when you read Belton, it says it is a narrow -- narrow


15


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  -- class of problematic recurring cases, and then it gives


2  seven cases as examples of cases that fall within its


3  class.  And in every single one of those cases, with the


4  possible -- a marginal exception of one, the police are


5  initiating contact with the man while he is an occupant of


6  a vehicle.  We -­


7

 QUESTION:  And that escalates the danger of the


8  situation.  I mean, why -- what sensible regime would say,


9  police officer, don't take the precaution of waiting to


10  make the arrest till the person stops and gets out of the


11  car?  That way, police officer, you won't be in danger of


12  the man grasping for a gun. 


13

 Or suppose it's a case where the police want to


14  follow that car and not signal because they want to find


15  out where the crack house is that he's going to.  So if


16  they signal, they make initial contact, they give away the


17  whole -- the whole thing.  They will not find the


18  destination they're looking for. 


19

 To -- to say that Belton is okay but -- in those


20  situations the -- the police would not have the


21  possibility of within moments after the suspect exits the


22  car arresting him and then doing a car search.  It just


23  doesn't seem to make any sense.


24

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, if you -- if you


25  think about it, that most -- the most dangerous situation


16


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  for the police officer is when he initiates contact with


2  the person while he's an -- an occupant in an -- of an


3  automobile, but has not yet gotten up to the point where


4  he can get him out and make an arrest.  It's during that


5  interval between the time that the officer initiates


6  contact with the vehicle and the time when he actually


7  makes a custodial arrest that the danger to the officer is


8  at its greatest point. 


9

 QUESTION:  Well, that's what -- why I asked


10  doesn't it make sense to say we're not going to initiate


11  contact while he's in the vehicle, but the minute he gets


12  out, we will arrest him.


13

 MR. DUNHAM:  Because in most cases, Your Honor,


14  the officer doesn't have a choice.  You look at the case


15  in New York v. Belton, I mean, he -- the officer was a -­


16  was a State trooper pulling the man over on the highway. 


17  The -- when -- when you -- and that's going to be the case


18  most of the time.  You're going to have a -- a State


19  trooper or somebody with lights on top of their car that


20  are pulling somebody over, and they don't really have a


21  choice.  Or you've got undercover agents watching for the


22  drug transaction to occur and then before the dealers


23  drive off, they want to rush the car and make the arrest


24  of the occupants.  It -- the -- the officer frequently has


25  no choice.

1

 And I like to think of it as when you turn on


2  the light to pull the man over, you turn on Belton. 


3  Belton comes on when you turn on the red light to signal


4  the man over. 


5

 And what does it do for the officer?  It


6  immediately defines, for purposes of a bright line rule,


7  who is an occupant.  It not only defines who is an


8  occupant, it defines who can become a recent occupant.


9

 QUESTION:  Why -- why don't we save ourselves a


10  lot of trouble and say that in almost all of these cases,


11  the police have an interest in what happens to the


12  vehicle, they're going to take it away anyway, so they


13  might as well do the inventory search right away?


14

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, the -- the Court has come


15  close to entirely extinguishing -- extinguishing any


16  Fourth Amendment protection in a vehicle, and that kind of


17  a decision would give it the final death knell.  There


18  would be no privacy left.


19

 QUESTION:  But, I mean, does it make a lot of


20  sense if in most cases, which I -- which I assume to be so


21  -- I may be wrong.  In most cases, especially when the car


22  is on a -- on a street or in -- in a -- in a parking lot


23  -- it's not at the residence -- they're going to have to


24  tow that car and -- and check it.  They probably should


25  make sure it's locked before they leave so that nothing


18


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  will be taken from the car, et cetera. 

2

 MR. DUNHAM:  What you end up with, Your Honor, 

3  is when you combine that view with the Court's decisions 

4  in Atwater and Whren, you end up with the police stopping 

5  somebody in -- in a parking lot, maybe a short distance 

6  away in a store because they've got a dead inspection 

7  sticker.  But it's a pretext because the officer wants to 

8  search the car. 

9

 QUESTION:  Well, no, my case -- my case says 

10  there's been an arrest. 

11

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, but the -- the Court's 

12  decisions allow the arrest to be made on a minor traffic 

13  violation that doesn't carry anything more than a $200 

14  fine on a pretext because the officer wants to search the 

15  car.  He then -- he makes the arrest on the -- on that 

16  under -- under Wren and Atwater.  He then has the right to 

17  go search the entire vehicle. 

18

 QUESTION:  Well, my point -- my point is I 

19  assume it happens anyway.  Now, empirically I may be 

20  wrong.  Then that's a different case. 

21

 QUESTION:  Well, it is clear, is it not -- I -­

22  if I remember Belton, it is clear that the Belton rule 

23  applies to any arrest.  It does not necessarily have to be 

24  an arrest in which they will impound the car.  You could 

25  be caught for speeding.  That's what they stopped him for 

19


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  in Belton.  They were speeding.  And so I think Justice 

2  Kennedy's hypothetical is not the facts of Belton. 

3

 MR. DUNHAM:  The -- the fact is that -- that 

4  Belton is an arrest.  It doesn't require a towing or 

5  inventorying of the car.  It is a -- a classic search 

6  incident to arrest. 

7

 QUESTION:  And it not only allows search of the 

8  vehicle but of every container in the vehicle.  So 

9  everybody who's caught speeding has his vehicle -­

10  everything in that vehicle is subject to search. 

11

 MR. DUNHAM:  If they're -- if they are arrested, 

12  Justice Stevens.  Many times -­

13

14

 QUESTION:  Correct. 

 MR. DUNHAM:  -- people are just issued a 

15  citation.  But if they're -- if they're stopped, even for 

16  a bad traffic signal or not wearing a seat belt, they can 

17  be subjected to a custodial arrest and have their entire 

18  vehicle searched.  And I think that's why it's -- in 

19  drawing the lines here with respect to Belton, recognizing 

20  that the -- that the arrestee is usually in the back of 

21  the squad car, and we're not here talking about officer 

22  safety issues -- that we try to remain -- retain some 

23  semblance of the Fourth Amendment with regard to 

24  automobiles. 

25

 QUESTION:  The arrestee here, though, wasn't -­

20


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  wasn't in the back of the car, the back of the police car.


2

 MR. DUNHAM:  Mr. Thornton was placed in the back


3  of the police car before the search occurred, Your Honor. 


4  He was arrested -­


5

 QUESTION:  Oh, after -- after he was arrested


6  you mean. 


7

 MR. DUNHAM:  Arrested, but before the search,


8  Your Honor.  And that's Justice Ginsburg's point.  Where


9  is the danger to the officer when the arrestee is in the


10  back of the squad car?  And that is a fiction and it is a


11  fiction that courts accept, that if the squad car drives


12  off with the man and takes him back to the station house,


13  then the right to search is gone, but as long as it's a


14  contemporaneous part of an unfolding scene -­


15

16

 QUESTION:  Who -- who -­


 QUESTION:  Unless the police have a practice of


17  trying to safeguard the vehicle since it -- it could be


18  claimed later by the person arrested, I had the Hope


19  diamond in the back seat and you people hauled me off to


20  jail, now you pay me for the Hope diamond.  So, obviously,


21  they want to inventory it.  And I suppose virtually every


22  police department has regular provisions to safeguard


23  vehicles in those circumstances and do inventory searches. 


24  Don't they?


25

 MR. DUNHAM:  I -- I assume most good police


21


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  departments do, but in this -­


2

 QUESTION:  So I don't see how we're furthered in


3  our concerns by your approach.


4

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, in this particular case, Your


5  Honor, those inventory concerns were -- were not addressed


6  in -- in the factual record.  We believe we would win on


7  the issue of inevitable discovery.  The Fourth Circuit


8  didn't address it. 


9

 And moreover, you -- frequently you're going to


10  have an occupant arrested but that doesn't mean the


11  vehicle is going to get towed.


12

 QUESTION:  Why -- why instead of complicating it


13  -- take Belton as a given.  Sorry.  Were you finished?


14

 MR. DUNHAM:  I -- I was just going to finish,


15  Your Honor, by saying that the -- that -- that you might


16  just arrest one occupant and you might let the other


17  occupants go on.  So you can't necessarily say that the


18  vehicle is always going to be towed and is always going to


19  be inventoried.


20

 QUESTION:  I mean, would it -- do you think it


21  would work -- or why wouldn't work -- to try to control


22  Belton by imposing limits on what's reasonable time and


23  reasonable space so that you keep it really to a -- an


24  arrest that took place really when he was just within the


25  car and not too far away unless it's his fault because he


22


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  took off? 


2

 All right.  Now, you'd do that through a common


3  law approach.  The lower courts would make their decisions


4  and occasionally we could review one to say it went too


5  far one way or the other.  That, it seems, is a -- is a


6  procedure for imposing limits on Belton that -- that might


7  work.  Why wouldn't it?


8

 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, as long as


9  they're -- they're more definite than words like recent or


10  close proximity -­


11

 QUESTION:  No, no.  You'd have to -- you can't


12  get -- unfortunately, language is what it is, and -- and


13  sometimes efforts to make it clearer make matters worse. 


14  So one way to control, in the presence of vague language,


15  is through example.


16

 MR. DUNHAM:  And I -- that's what I thought the


17  Court did in Belton was give examples.  And if you follow


18  the examples that were given in Belton, you don't approve


19  the search that occurred with regard to Mr. Thornton,


20  because if you're trying to draw a bright line, which is


21  what you were trying to do in Belton, you have -- some


22  things fall on one side of that line and some things fall


23  on the other.  And we would -- we would submit that once a


24  person, on his own without any prompting from the police,


25  becomes a pedestrian, he's no longer an occupant of a


23


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  vehicle.


2

 QUESTION:  How long after he got out of the car


3  did the arrest take place?


4

5

6

 MR. DUNHAM:  Moments. 


 QUESTION:  What are moments?


 MR. DUNHAM:  Well, the -- it seems like the


7  entire time I've been standing here is moments because my


8  life is going in front of my eyes. 


9

10

11

 (Laughter.) 


 QUESTION:  All right, and how far -­


 MR. DUNHAM:  But in -- in any event, we would


12  argue that the -- that the search here was outside of


13  Belton and we would also argue that you have a perfectly


14  good 35-year-old precedent in Chimel.  If Belton doesn't


15  apply and you're on the other side of the Belton line,


16  then you go to Chimel, and Chimel tells you what to do. 


17  Chimel wasn't limited to houses.  It is the rule that the


18  police use every single day when they effect a custodial


19  arrest.  No new rules.  No new guidance.  Just if Belton


20  doesn't apply, go to Chimel.


21

 I'd like to save the rest of my time for


22  rebuttal please. 


23

 Mr. Garre, we'll hear from you.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


 MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


3  may it please the Court:


4

 The sole contention advanced by petitioner on


5  appeal was that the search of his car was not lawful under


6  the rule of New York v. Belton because Officer Nichols did


7  not succeed in initiating contact with him while he was


8  still inside his car.  The court of appeals correctly


9  rejected that contention. 


10

 To begin with, petitioner's initiation of


11  contact rule has no foundation in the rationale of Belton. 


12  It is the fact of the arrest and not the reason that the


13  person exited the car that gives rise to the justification


14  for the Belton search. 


15

 The custodial arrest is an extremely dangerous


16  and volatile encounter for the officer in the field, and


17  that's particularly true in the case of the arrest of a


18  recent occupant of a vehicle.  In Belton, this Court drew


19  the generalization that when the recent occupant of a


20  vehicle is arrested, that the inside of the vehicle is


21  always within the area in which that occupant might try to


22  -- try to lunge in order to get a weapon to effect his


23  escape or to grab evidence to conceal it or destroy it in


24  the car. 


25

 Now, the application of that generalization -­

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  May I just point out that the 

2  question presented in Belton defined it as an occupant of 

3  the vehicle? 

4

 MR. GARRE:  That's correct, Justice Stevens, but 

5  the Court did use the term recent occupant at page 460 of 

6  its decision. 

7

 QUESTION:  It also used occupant several times 

8  in the opinion. 

9

 MR. GARRE:  That's true, and -- and in 

10  describing the category of -­

11

 QUESTION:  And -- and the examples that it gave, 

12  as your opponent indicated, all were -- except one 

13  possible exception, all were occupants, weren't they, in 

14  -- in the cases that Justice Stewart -­

15

 MR. GARRE:  No, Justice Stevens.  I -- I 

16  actually don't think that that's correct.  I think the 

17  Frick case, which is discussed, listed with the cases 

18  discussed at page 459 of the decision, involved the 

19  situation where the police came upon the person in a 

20  parking lot, and in that situation -- which was one of the 

21  cases that the Court identified as the disarray in the 

22  case law that existed before Belton.  And that's a 

23  critical point for the Court to understand in weighing the 

24  -- the petitioner's reaching distance argument here. 

25

 This Court knows what the world is like in a 

26


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  reaching distance regime under Chimel and the important


2  context in which the recent occupant of a car is arrested. 


3  As the Court mentioned in -- in Belton, it's a world in


4  which there's disarray and confusion in the case law, more


5  litigation and more confusion for the officer in the


6  field.  The Court noted on page 460 of its decision in


7  Belton that that kind of confusion was not helpful to the


8  police who need clear rules for the scope of their


9  authority in this context. 


10

 QUESTION:  Yes, but if you emphasize the clarity


11  -- and that's what Justice Stewart did.  He drafted what


12  he thought was a very clear rule.  If you limit it to


13  occupants, isn't that equally clear as the rule you


14  propose?


15

 MR. GARRE:  It's -- it's artificial, Justice


16  Stevens, and it's -­


17

 QUESTION:  Well, I agree it's artificial, but is


18  it not equally clear?


19

20

 MR. GARRE:  That is a clear -­


 QUESTION:  In fact, is it not more clear? 


21  Because I don't know when you stop being a recent


22  occupant.


23

 MR. GARRE:  Well, with respect, we think it's an


24  artificial rule, and -- and if I could -­


25

 QUESTION:  It is an artificial rule.  We all


27


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  agree with that, but what we're -- what we're looking for 

2  is a clear artificial rule.  That's the purpose of Belton. 

3

 MR. GARRE:  No.  I -- I think a rule which -­

4  which takes into account the justifications -­

5

 QUESTION:  Because the reason it's artificial is 

6  it explains that normally Chimel would control, and he 

7  said we want a special rule for -- for arrests of 

8  occupants of cars.  And that's what they did.  And we -­

9  and they made it so you can search the entire vehicle. 

10  That's the other important part of Belton. 

11

12

 MR. GARRE:  But -- but it -­

 QUESTION:  And the entire -- all -- all 

13  containers in the vehicle I mean. 

14

 MR. GARRE:  If I could respond in this way. 

15  First, the vast majority of arrests that take place in the 

16  Belton context, including in this case, including in 

17  Belton itself, take place after the person is already 

18  outside of the car. 

19

 QUESTION:  Yes, but the contact with the police 

20  is when they're occupants. 

21

 MR. GARRE:  Well, that's true.  And -- and let 

22  me talk, if I could, about the artificiality of that rule 

23  and why we think it's not a rule that the Court should 

24  adopt. 

25

 QUESTION:  Well, I'm trying to get an answer to 

28


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  this question.  I agree it's artificial.  It's described


2  in Belton as artificial.  But the search in Belton was for


3  the clearest rule available, and my suggestion to you is


4  the rule of Belton, as -- as described in Belton itself


5  applying to occupants of the cars at the time of contact,


6  is clearer than a rule defined by recent occupant because


7  what is a recent occupant.


8

 MR. GARRE:  Well, let me answer both questions. 


9  I -- I don't think that that is going to be a clearer rule


10  than the rule that we're asking for in this case. 


11

 And -- and to respond to your second question as


12  to what is a recent occupant, in our view it's someone


13  who's just occupied the car.  It's -- it's the person in


14  the vast majority of cases in which this question has


15  arisen.  In this case it was clear that Officer Nichols


16  met petitioner moments after he exited the car, and that's


17  going to be the situation in which this question has


18  arisen and it can arise in a number of ways. 


19

20

 In Michigan v. Long, the police -­


 QUESTION:  But would your rule apply to someone


21  who was out of the car for 5 minutes?


22

 MR. GARRE:  Well, the -- the recency test that


23  the Court -- that we think the adopted or described in


24  Belton is one that's tethered to the proximity of the


25  automobile.  And there are going to be line-drawing


29


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  problems at the outer -­


2

 QUESTION:  Well, I'm trying to understand what


3  your definition of recent is.


4

 MR. GARRE:  It's -- it's someone -- it's the


5  person who has gotten out of the car and who's in the same


6  proximity to the car that he would have occupied if he had


7  been ordered out.


8

 QUESTION:  But is -- in other words, geography


9  is part of the time dimension of recency.


10

 MR. GARRE:  Well, and it is in a typical Belton


11  case.  If I could give the Court an example.  The Federal


12  Law Enforcement Training Center trains its officers that


13  they should stop their police car within two to four


14  lengths of the vehicle that they're stopping and to pull


15  the person out of the car prior to the arrest. 
 And this


16  is -- this is the way officers are trained to bring them


17  back because of the inordinate risks that officers face in


18  that situation. 


19

 In this case, Officer Nichols intended to pull


20  petitioner over.  That's at page 16 of the J.A., but he


21  didn't succeed in doing so because the petitioner pulled


22  into a parking lot.  And that's not an uncommon practice


23  that -- that suspects do if they -- if they feel or sense


24  that they're under surveillance by the police.  And he got


25  out of his car, and the record shows at page 11 of the


30


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  J.A. that Officer Nichols got out at the same time and met


2  him within moments.  This is -- this case we think has the


3  hallmarks of the classic Belton encounter.


4

 Officer Nichols patted him down, found drugs on


5  his person, and at that moment, placed him under arrest. 


6  The -- the pat-down was a consensual search.  That's -­


7  that's indicated at page 19 of the joint appendix, and at


8  the moment that he placed petitioner under arrest who,


9  after all, was a convicted felon who just had drugs on his


10  person and who had a loaded semi-automatic gun --


11

 QUESTION:  Why -- why does that matter?  We


12  don't know that.  The police don't know that.  That


13  doesn't figure into any calculus.  Most people who get out


14  of cars are not convicted felons bearing drugs.


15

 MR. GARRE:  That's absolutely correct, Justice


16  Souter, and that's an important aspect of the


17  generalization that the Court drew in Belton and -- and


18  that underlies the search incident to arrest cases which


19  is --


20

 QUESTION:  No, but the -- the point of Justice


21  Stevens' question is why should we go beyond -- strictly


22  why should we go beyond the generalization in Belton?  And


23  the reason certainly cannot be that this particular guy


24  had a record and had drugs.


25

 MR. GARRE:  My -- my point, Justice Souter, was


31


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that the officer safety justification for Belton is going


2  to be squarely implicated regardless of the reason that


3  the person got -- got out of the car.


4

 QUESTION:  No, but it seems to me that you get


5  into -- into deeper water if you say that because the -­


6  to me the incoherence of Belton is that it -- it purports


7  to be an application of Chimel with a bright line, but at


8  the point at which the actual search is made, any danger


9  to the officer is over.  And so if -- if you're going to


10  try to justify a -- a more flexible approach to Belton on


11  grounds of the safety justification in Belton, I -- I


12  think you're -- you're out over your head. 


13

 And -- and the force of Justice Stevens'


14  question to me is this.  Belton is not coherent with


15  Chimel.  Belton does not stand up as an analysis of


16  anything other than we're going to have a simple bright


17  line rule for cars and stop all of this litigation.  But


18  if Belton gave a bright line rule for cars, why is there a


19  justification for making it less bright by going beyond


20  the specific kinds of facts in Belton itself?  That's the


21  force of the question. 


22

 MR. GARRE:  Sure.  And -- and we don't think


23  it's going to be any less bright in the most common


24  situation in which this question has arisen where police


25  come upon the person right as he's -- as he's exiting his


32


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  car.


2

 Michigan v. Long is another example.  That case


3  was decided two terms after Belton.  And in that case this


4  Court indicated in dictum that Belton would apply in the


5  situation where the police come upon the person after he's


6  outside of the car. 


7

 QUESTION:  But is -- is your criterion then


8  going to be a time criterion, the recency of his exit from


9  the car?


10

 MR. GARRE:  It's -- it's going to have both -­


11  and the court of appeals emphasized it in this case at


12  page 74 -­


13

14

 QUESTION:  Well, is it time or is it space?


 MR. GARRE:  It's both space and time and it's


15  going to encompass a situation where the person has just


16  gotten out of the car -­


17

 QUESTION:  So if -- if I get out of my car and I


18  run as fast as I can run for 15 seconds, and I get across


19  the parking lot, that is very recent in time.  Can -- can


20  you search my car then?


21

 MR. GARRE:  Well, under the position that


22  petitioner advances -­


23

 QUESTION:  No.  I want your position.  We want a


24  bright line rule.  If -- if I -- if I'm a sprinter and I


25  get across the parking lot and it's 15 seconds, can they


33


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  search the car?


2

 MR. GARRE:  Justice Souter, as in the case of


3  any Fourth Amendment case, there -- there are going to be


4  situations at the margin.  I think if -- if the person is


5  racing away from the -­


6

 QUESTION:  No, but bright line rules are -- are


7  there to -- to avoid marginal problems.  What -- what's


8  the answer to my -- my question? 


9

 MR. GARRE:  If the hypothetical is the person


10  sees the police officer and races away from the car, the


11  police officer arrests the person in the vicinity of the


12  car, then no, I don't think it matters if he got 15 feet


13  or 20 feet or 30 feet.  If he gets a block away, then


14  sure, it might matter.  These are cases at the outer


15  extreme or margin and aren't implicated by the commonly


16  recurring fact pattern in which this case arises where the


17  police meet the person in the same spot that he would have


18  been if he had been ordered out of the car. 


19

 And -- and let me talk about the problems with


20  line-drawing that the Court is going -­


21

 QUESTION:  What if he -- what if he didn't see


22  the police officer?  He drives into the parking lot, gets


23  out of his car, locks the car.  He's 5 feet away and -­


24  and the police say, that's the guy I saw speeding on Main


25  Street 10 minutes ago.  What's -- what's the answer there?

 MR. GARRE:  Well -­


 QUESTION:  He's -- he is in the spot he would


3  have been if the police had arrested him or had


4  apprehended him in the car and told him to get out.  Can


5  they search?


6

 MR. GARRE:  Of course, there's something absent


7  there which is the positive linkage.  The police don't


8  know that that person has just gotten out of the car. 


9  That -- that case is a lot like the Frick case that the


10  Court noted in Belton as one of the cases that it was


11  trying to deal with when it came up.


12

13

14

 QUESTION:  But if they see him -- if --


 MR. GARRE:  I think the police -­


 QUESTION:  -- if they see him get out of the


15  car, can they then search in my hypo?


16

 MR. GARRE:  I -- I think in that situation where


17  the person was arrested right by the car, we think that


18  Belton probably would apply.  But that's not the fact


19  pattern initiated here. 


20

 If -- if I could just talk about the line­


21  drawing problems that the Court is going to invite if it


22  adopts petitioner's initiation of contact rule.


23

 The -- the petitioner said today that -- that


24  the rule the Court ought to adopt if the light is on, then


25  Belton is -- is on.  Well -- well, that's going to create


35


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  line-drawing problems.  To take an example close to home,


2  the -- the police officers in the District of Columbia


3  often drive around with white flashing lights on.  Now,


4  I'm not sure how the existence of those white flashing


5  lights would come into play under petitioner's initiation


6  of contact rule. 


7

 Take the case that the Court had before it this


8  fall, Arizona v. Gant, which was a case that presented the


9  same issue, but the Court vacated and remanded it in light


10  of the Arizona Supreme Court's decision which rejected the


11  initiation of contact rule.  In that case, the officer


12  came upon the suspect and he shined a flight -- shined a


13  flashlight into the car which the suspect was still inside


14  the car.  The suspect got out of the car.  The officer met


15  him moments later, and yet the court of appeals in that


16  case said that the police officer hadn't sufficiently


17  initiated contact with the suspect while he was still in


18  the car.


19

20

 QUESTION:  The Arizona Court of Appeal.


 MR. GARRE:  The Arizona Court of Appeals held in


21  that case.  That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 


22

 And -- and in describing that, the Court listed


23  the number of different factors that would have to go into


24  the calculus both from the standpoint of the officer on


25  the scene and from a court later reviewing that


36


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  determination as to whether the officer initiated contact. 


2  He'd have to take into account the lighting in the


3  situation, how far the officer was the car when he -- away


4  from the car when he shined the flashlight into it,


5  whether the person saw the flashlight, whether the person


6  thought it was a police officer shining the flashlight or


7  someone else, whether the person was aware that there was


8  a police -­


9

 QUESTION:  Well, you said a little while ago


10  there are cases on the fringe.  Of course, you can always


11  find one or two cases that present these difficult


12  problems. 


13

 But are -- are you really contending that the


14  rule of initiating contact is less bright than the rule


15  you're proposing? 


16

 MR. GARRE:  Yes, we are.  If -- if the Court


17  focuses -­


18

 QUESTION:  What if, for example, the -- the


19  officer saw a person speeding, he pulls into a gas


20  station, he gets out, goes to the men's room and comes


21  back out.  Can he be -- can you search his car?


22

 MR. GARRE:  If -- of course, that's -- that's


23  not the fact pattern here.


24

 QUESTION:  No.  I'm just not -- I'm just


25  wondering -­

1

 MR. GARRE:  Yes, I think he probably would be


2  able -­


3

 QUESTION:  I'm wondering about the integrity of


4  your statement that there's a real bright line rule there. 


5  And what do you do with my case?


6

 MR. GARRE:  In -- in that case where the


7  person -­


8

 QUESTION:  He's -- this -- the officer saw him


9  speeding but he didn't turn the light on.  He followed


10  him.  The guy goes into a gas station, goes to the men's


11  room, comes out 2 minutes later.  Can you search his car?


12

 MR. GARRE:  If the person comes out and is right


13  next to the car in the place he would have been when he


14  had been ordered out, yes, we think that -- that Belton


15  would apply in that situation. 


16

 But -- but the rule that we're asking the Court


17  to adopt here is that on this fact pattern, which as the


18  court of appeals we think correctly recognized has


19  temporal and spatial limits, where the police see the


20  person exit the car, confront him moments later, the


21  application of the bright line rule in Belton shouldn't


22  depend on the fortuity of whether the police initiate


23  contact with that person beforehand.  And that's


24  particularly true in a case like this where Officer


25  Nichols intended to pull the car over and -- and yet


38


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  didn't do so because the suspect did what suspects


2  sometimes do, which is to pull over and get out in order


3  to try to blend in. 


4

 The -- now, going back to the officer safety


5  rationale, we think that is a justification for Belton and


6  that it is implicated in this situation and that the


7  initiation of contact rule would implicate officer safety


8  in a number of ways. 


9

 One is the surveillance situation that was


10  mentioned during petitioner's argument and that the court


11  of appeals mentioned in this case.  In -- in some cases,


12  officers are engaged in surveillance activities and maybe


13  determine that it's undesirable and unsafe to make contact


14  with a suspect while he's still inside the car and so take


15  the prudent step of waiting for the suspect to step out of


16  the car before confronting him.  The -- the case out of


17  Virginia, the Glasco case that's discussed in the brief,


18  is an example of that. 


19

 There's -- there's also the -- the possibility,


20  which is recognized in the case law, that an initiation of


21  the contact rule would have the effect of increasing the


22  volatility of Belton encounters by creating a dynamic in


23  which suspects had an incentive to race out of the car


24  before police could -- could initiate contact.


25

 QUESTION:  If the -- if the suspect is


39


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  handcuffed and is in the police cruiser, is there any


2  danger to the officer at that point that can't be equally


3  avoided by simply having an inventory search later?


4

 MR. GARRE:  There is danger, Justice Kennedy.  I


5  mean, first of all, on -- on the handcuff -­


6

7

 QUESTION:  Assume a single occupant.


 MR. GARRE:  Right.  There is danger.  And we -­


8  we -- and it's true in -- in a stop and arrest like this


9  case where there's a lone officer and a person who he


10  arrests.  And the -- the deeply ingrained practice in this


11  country is for the officer to put the -- the suspect,


12  arrestee, in the squad car and then go back and search the


13  car.  And -- and we cite cases on page 38 of our brief


14  where -- where suspects have escaped from handcuffs and


15  gotten out.  And -- and that danger is remote, but we


16  think that it's still real as long as the suspect is at


17  the scene of the arrest.  All of the courts of appeals


18  that we're aware of that -- that have considered this


19  question and Professor LaFave who's -- who's recognized


20  and have concluded that Belton applies when the person is


21  handcuffed in the back seat of the squad car. 


22

 And of course, Justice Brennan in his dissent in


23  Belton recognized -­


24

 QUESTION:  I know it applies, but it's just not


25  clear to me why an inventory search can never be, which -­


40


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  I have only one factual question here.


2

 Was this car locked before the police officer


3  searched it?  Did he need the key or do -- do we know?


4

 MR. GARRE:  The -- I believe the answer to that


5  is -- is no because the record doesn't -- what the record


6  shows -- and this is on page 50 of the J.A. I think -- is


7  that the officer arrested petitioner, put him in the car


8  and then went back and searched the car.  There's nothing


9  in the record that suggests that the officer needed keys.


10

 But -- but on the inventory search question,


11  although it may be true in some cases that the inventory


12  search inevitably would have led to the discovery of the


13  contraband, in that sense the privacy interests of the


14  person from a Belton search at the time are -- are further


15  diminished. 


16

 The inventory search I don't think is an answer


17  to the officer's safety concerns and justification for


18  Belton, which are real as long as the person is still at


19  the scene of the arrest.  There is the remote risk that


20  the person can escape and try to get back into the car. 


21  There's also the risk, as -- as you mentioned I think,


22  that there could be confederates in the area who might try


23  to get into the car, either for a weapon or to get drugs


24  out of the car or other contraband out of the car. 


25  Officers in -- in the Belton stop, it's not uncommon for


41


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  them to -- to have the person out of the car, to secure


2  him, and then it's only at that point that they -- that


3  they feel safe to go back to make sure that there's no one


4  else in the car who could be hidden in the car or other


5  things in the car. 


6

 So I -- so we don't think that the inventory


7  search is an answer to the very real concerns that the


8  officers face in conducting the Belton search and that


9  provide the rationale for the Belton search.


10

 I wanted to just go back briefly to the Court's


11  decision in Michigan v. Long.  And although it is dictum


12  in that case on the application of -- of Belton, we do


13  think that it's -- it's persuasive dictum.  In that case


14  the police officers saw a car swerve off the road, and


15  they -- they came around back to investigate.  The


16  petitioner -- or -- or the suspect in that case, the


17  individual who was driving the car, was already outside of


18  the car when the police came back.  And -- and the Court


19  in that case made quite clear in dictum that if the -- if


20  the suspect in that case had been arrested, that the


21  search of his car would have been perfectly lawful under


22  Belton.  And we think that that was -- that is a


23  persuasive and a correct understanding of Belton.


24

 If I could -- I wanted to make clear too that we


25  think that this case does bear the -- the hallmarks of a


42


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  classic Belton encounter.  The only difference is -- is 

2  that Officer Nichols did not succeed in initiating contact 

3  before the suspect got -- got out of the car, but Officer 

4 

--

5

 QUESTION:  Would he have to at least see the 

6  suspect in the car or would it be all right under the rule 

7  you're proposing where the police that come upon the scene 

8  just after the suspect exits from the car? 

9

 MR. GARRE:  Well, we think that the -- the most 

10  important thing for the Court to hold in this case -- that 

11  we would ask the Court to hold in this case is in the 

12  commonly recurring situation where police see the person 

13  exit the car and confront him moments later in the same 

14  vicinity that he might have occupied if he had been 

15  ordered out of the car, that it doesn't make a difference 

16  for the purposes of applying Belton as to whether or not 

17  the police succeeded in initiating contact or succeeded in 

18  initiating contact in a sufficient way. 

19

 There may be -- there are going to be other 

20  cases that arise, and -- and we don't think that this is 

21  an area in which the Court should try to establish a rule 

22  which is tethered to a particular distance or -- or a 

23  particular amount of time.  These are -- this is an 

24  extremely dangerous encounter for police.  This is an area 

25  in which police need to make judgments.  This Court

2

 QUESTION:  It seems to me your argument is that


3  we don't want a bright line rule.  We want a -- a facts


4  and circumstances rule and take everything into account,


5  which is sort of -- Justice Scalia often speaks of those


6  rules with some disparaging terms. 


7

8

 (Laughter.) 


 MR. GARRE:  No.  That -- that's not what we're


9  asking for, and I'm sorry if I -- if I misled the Court.


10  We're asking the Court to apply the generalization that it


11  adopted in Belton. 


12

 The -- the reaching distance rule that


13  petitioner has alternatively asked for would just


14  eviscerate Belton and put courts and police officers back


15  in the situation that they occupied before Belton in


16  trying to apply Chimel in -- in the recurring and


17  dangerous context of an automobile stop.  The Court


18  recognized in Belton on page 59 of its decision that that


19  -- the Chimel analysis had -- had provided to be -- shown


20  to be unworkable in this context and -- and had created


21  litigation for the courts and uncertainty for the police


22  officers.  So we're asking the Court to -- to stick to


23  that bright line. 


24

 QUESTION:  Justice Stewart wrote both Chimel and


25  Belton, did he not?


44


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. GARRE:  That's absolutely correct, Mr. Chief


2  Justice. 


3

 On the handcuffing in the squad car, I -- I did


4  want to make clear on that point that that argument was


5  not raised by petitioner below, and -- and the court of


6  appeals noted that at page 74, note 2 of the joint


7  appendix.  It's not pressed by petitioner in this Court. 


8  I think petitioner's reply brief makes that clear on page


9  16.


10

 QUESTION:  What do the police departments


11  normally tell the policemen?  What do they say?  They say,


12  when you arrest a person who just got out of a car, you


13  can search the car?


14

 MR. GARRE:  In terms of -- of -- I -- I can tell


15  you what the practice is at the Federal Law Enforcement


16  Training Center.  And -- and that practice is you -- is -­


17  is to take the -- the person outside of the car,


18  ordinarily away from the car back towards the police -­


19

 QUESTION:  No.  I'm not -- I'm not asking the


20  practice.  I'm asking -- the virtue of Belton is supposed


21  to be it's simple.  Explain it to a policeman.  So I want


22  to know how do they explain it.  I thought perhaps they


23  explain it by saying, policeman, if you arrest a person


24  who's just got out of a car, you can search the car.


25

 MR. GARRE:  That's -- that's correct, Justice

 QUESTION:  All right.  Then if that's -- then

 MR. GARRE:  And -- and if it's -­

 QUESTION:  So -- so inevitably we're in the 

6  business of trying to say what's just got out of.  Is it a 

7  minute?  Is it 2 minutes?  Is it 5 minutes?  There's no 

8  way to avoid that, is there? 

9

 MR. GARRE:  No.  There's not at the outer 

10  margins, but -- but the Court -­

11

 QUESTION:  All right.  So what in your opinion 

12  is the outer margin? 

13

 MR. GARRE:  Well, let me -- let me say 

14  affirmatively that this case we think places a proper 

15  temporal -­

17

 QUESTION:  This is well within it. 

 MR. GARRE:  -- and spatial limits on it where

20  long I imagine. 

21

22

24

 MR. GARRE:  Of course. 

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR. GARRE:  That's correct. 

 I think if the Court were to hold in this case 

25  that Belton applies in this situation where the police 

46


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  confront the person just after he gets out of the car,


2  that is going to provide a guidance to the police


3  officers.  And that's going to tell them they don't need


4  to undertake this additional fact-specific analysis as to


5  whether the person got out of the car of their own


6  volition or an initiation of contact.


7

 QUESTION:  Then perhaps we could use words like 

8  just got out of. 

9

 MR. GARRE:  Or within moments.  And -- and I 

10  think -­

11

12

13  no. 

14

15

16

 QUESTION:  Seconds? 

 MR. GARRE:  Seconds would be fine.  But -- but 

 QUESTION:  And what about in this --

 MR. GARRE:  I don't --

 QUESTION:  -- what about in this -- this is a 

17  serious question.  What about if he's just about to get 

18  into it? 

19

 MR. GARRE:  Well, and -- and that's -- that's a 

20  different fact pattern that has arisen.  We think Belton 

21  would apply in that situation, and police we think have 

22  reasonably concluded that and courts have reasonably 

23  concluded that. 

24

 But -- but that's not the question here.  And 

25  the most important question for the Court to answer, which 

47


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  is the situation where the police do see the person get


2  out of the car and do confront him moments later. 


3

 The -- the States -- a number of States have


4  filed an amicus brief in this case supporting the


5  Government's position and -- and urging against adoption


6  of an initiation of contact rule.  And -- and we do think


7  it's significant that each of the States and jurisdictions


8  that have adopted the initiation of contact rule, States


9  like Florida and -- and Illinois and Michigan, have signed


10  that brief and urged the Court to reject the initiation of


11  contact rule.  We think that that rule is unworkable. 


12  It's shown to be unworkable in cases like Gant v. Arizona.


13

 There are other cases in which added wrinkles


14  have been applied to the rule.  There's a Florida case,


15  which is not discussed in the briefs, but it is publicly


16  reported.  It's Kavallierakis v. State, 790 S.2d 1201.  In


17  that case, the courts in Florida, applying the initiation


18  of contact rule, concluded that in order to trigger


19  Belton, the contact had to be of a confrontational nature


20  and not of a friendly nature, so that in that case, the


21  courts reversed a conviction for possession of drugs found


22  in a car because the police officer met the person with a


23  greeting while he was getting out of the car as opposed to


24  a confrontational signal such as a -- as a siren or a


25  light.  Now, that -- that seems like an extreme


48


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  application of that rule, but it's nevertheless indicative


2  of -- of the variations in the line-drawing that can arise


3  and that have arisen.


4

 In this case we think that the court of appeals


5  properly held that Belton apply.  The record conclusively


6  shows that petitioner was a recent occupant of the car and


7  the search was contemporaneous with the -- the arrest, and


8  we would ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the court


9  of appeals. 


10

11

12

13

14

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Garre.


 Mr. Dunham, you have 4 minutes remaining. 


 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR.


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. DUNHAM:  I have four brief points, Your


15  Honor, that I'd like to make, if I could. 


16

 The first is that the State court opinion in


17  Michigan v. Long, People v. -- People v. Long, shows that


18  the car there was being chased by the police.  They just


19  weren't observing him drive by at a high rate of speed and


20  crash into a ditch.  They were in a high-speed chase, and


21  it's reasonable to infer that they had their lights on and


22  therefore had initiated contact.


23

 Furthermore, the State court opinion in People


24  v. Long shows that Long was in the vehicle when the


25  officers got out of their car, after he had crashed into


49


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the ditch, and began to approach the vehicle.  Then Long


2  exited his vehicle and walked towards the officers.  So I


3  don't think it's -- it's fair to say that there was no


4  initiation of contact by the officers with Long in the


5  Long case and that the footnote in the Long opinion


6  referencing to Belton is no expansion or further


7  brightening of the Belton rule.


8

 Second, I want to point out that the Frick case,


9  which is the one possible exception that I think Justice


10  Stevens referred to when he was talking about the cases


11  that Belton points to as defining its class -- the man is


12  either getting into or getting out of his vehicle.  He has


13  not -- he has not achieved the status of pedestrian.  Most


14  people -- I think you could still consider someone who was


15  in the act of either getting in or getting out -- you


16  could call that person an occupant.


17

 Third, if you -- the Fourth Circuit did not


18  adopt Mr. Garre's place where he would have occupied if he


19  had been arrested test.  We call -- that's the


20  Government's might have test.  But Mr. Garre would add


21  that to what the Fourth Circuit rule and would have him -­


22  and -- and would add a limit that, oh, as long as he's


23  arrested where he might have been if he might have been


24  arrested, if we'd stopped him when he was getting out of


25  his car.  It seems to me that that is an unworkable rule

1  and it just adds further confusion to the situation.  Yet,


2  it's necessary, necessary because it's the only way you


3  avoid reversing Chimel.

 Now, the -- the other point I want to make is


5  Justice O'Connor I think made a good point about the


6  inventory search.  Why can't we draw Belton narrowly


7  because in 90 percent of the cases, we're going to have an


8  inventory search anyway?  And why can't we maintain some


9  semblance of Fourth Amendment protection in automobiles?


10

 And finally, with regard to the handcuffs point,


11  Mr. Garre's point that people sometimes get out of their


12  handcuffs, I'd simply like to say if we indulge in the


13  presumption that suspects are going to get out of their


14  handcuffs, there's simply no search incident to arrest


15  rule that we can fashion that doesn't just have us


16  searching everyplace on God's green earth.

 QUESTION:  May I ask you a question -­


 MR. DUNHAM:  Yes.


 QUESTION:  -- if your time is up?  In your


20  experience, does an inventory search include the right to


21  search containers in the -- in the car?  Belton, of


22  course, gives the -- the Government the big advantage. 


23  You can search every container in the car.


24

 MR. DUNHAM:  I believe an inventory search does


25  not allow you to search opaque containers within the car.
