Lee.                     Mr. Beeney.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARRARD R. BEENEY                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 MR. BEENEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               I'd like to begin this morning with why the         use of the broadest­reasonable­interpretation expedient     in no way comports with the congressional purpose of         inter partes review, and then address why the Board's         ultra vires determination in instituting inter partes       review is subject to judicial review.                  Consistent with history, Congress left to      the judiciary to determine construction standards, and       therefore, in the American Invents Act, there is no         explicit statutory language directing the Patent and       Trademark Office to use any particular standard of claim         construction.             But this Court should reverse, as a matter         of statutory construction, for four reasons. First, in         summary, all agree that the     broadest­reasonable­interpretation expedient demands a    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review broad ability to amend claims, and that's so because the          broadest reasonable interpretation brings into play a       broader array of prior art that may be distinguishable         if the claims were given their actual interpretation.                    In establishing inter partes review,     Congress sought to substitute and provide a district         court­like litigation for the determination of      patentability, and therefore, did not provide the wide        liberty to amend claims, as Justice ­­                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I might be moved by your          argument if Congress had not given any right for the          Board to amend, because that would be consistent with         practices in the district court, where district court        can't amend under any circumstance. But basically,        Congress here said you can amend once. I'm not sure           that that supports your proposition.                 MR. BEENEY: I think ­­ Justice Sotomayor, I          think there is a distinction between allowing a party to            make a motion to amend and the absolute right to amend            even once. And Congress did not provide any right to           amend in inter partes review. It provided only an          extremely limited ability to seek to amend. And, in          fact, in practice, that opportunity to seek to amend is          almost always denied. And it is denied consistent with          congressional intent of establishing inter partes review       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review to be court ­­ a court­like adjudication. So simply as            a matter of numbers, the Board has denied percent of           the motions to amend. In months of inter partes           review, the Board has allowed five motions to amend and          allowed four ­­ less than claims to be amended, while           canceling , claims.               your four?              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the second of        MR. BEENEY: The second reason why,       Your Honor, the ­­ the result below should be reversed          is because the ­­ Congress, in establishing inter partes         review, intended inter partes review to adjudicate       property rights. And in doing so, it makes no sense to            attribute to those property rights a hypothetical        interpretation of their meets and bounds rather than        doing what district courts do, which is to give claims          their actual plain and ordinary meaning.                  The third reason, Your Honors, why this       Court should reverse and ­­ and have the Patent and          Trademark Office use the ordinary claim construction       matter is because there are a number of anomalies that           injure the patent system and injure patentees that stem         directly from the use of inter partes review. Those          include a claim meaning different things in the courts          and before the Board. Those include different results         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review in the courts and the Board as to whether a patentee's            property rights are taken away. And those include         claims meaning one thing for patentability in the Board         but a wholly different thing for infringement in the          district courts. That's simply untenable, and there's        no reason to suspect that that was anywhere within         Congress's intent in enacting inter partes review.                   Finally, this Court should reverse because      the government really has not in any way offered a          support of using the broadest reasonable interpretation       that is in any way tethered to inter partes review. It            simply says historically, we've done this before, and so         we should be permitted to do it again.                    Strikingly missing from the government's     position, however, is really any objection to taking the         district court's substitute that Congress enacted, and       using the claim construction that the district courts        do, the ordinary meaning of the claim terms.                    There is nothing really in the government's       brief that suggests that it would be inappropriate to         use that claim construction, and that's the claim        construction that should be used.                 JUSTICE ALITO: Is the standard ­­ is the         standard of proof for invalidity the same in an         infringement action in district court as it is in inter          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review partes review?              MR. BEENEY: It is not, Justice Alito. And          I think the reason ­­ there was a sensible reason behind            it in that Congress tweaked the court­like adjudicatory        system and recognized that it was establishing a board          of experts, and therefore, there was no reason to have          the presumption in favor of patentability that we find         in the district courts.                But that in no way suggests that the        Congress, in enacting inter partes review, was       suggesting that there be a different claim­construction        standard that are used in the district courts when inter          partes review was to be a substitute for district court           litigation.             If I may Your Honors, I'd like to delve into           the question that Justice Sotomayor asked about the        amendment process.                I think it's important to recognize, as the       Patent and Trademark Office repeatedly has before its        merits brief in this case, the profound distinction        between the ­­ permitting a party to make a motion to             amend in an adjudicatory context and the absolute right         to amend in the examinational contest ­­ context. And,          in fact, the PTO, as it participated in the Microsoft v.           Proxyconn case, submitted a letter to the Federal         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Circuit making exactly this point on April , .         What the PTO said to the court was that, in fact, there            is this very profound distinction between the right to         make a motion to amend in an adjudicatory context and           the ability to amend patents in the examinational        context where there is an iterative, back­and­forth,       generally cooperative process between the examiner and       the patentee.              That is diametrically different to the      system that Congress established in inter partes review,        as the Patent and Trademark Office represented to the         district court.              And going back to the statistics that I was          citing in response to Justice Sotomayor's original       question, percent of the motions to amend in inter          partes review are denied. Less than claims have been           amended, while , have been canceled. And there is          simply not the kind of ability that is necessary in          order to avoid the prejudice to the patentee of giving          her claims a construction broader than what they         actually are that's afforded in inter partes review.                    JUSTICE ALITO: Do the Board's institution       decisions always set out what it understands the        broadest reasonable interpretation to be? And ­­ and if          they do, is it ­­ must the Board stick with that           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review throughout the proceeding? And in that ­­ if that is           true, why does the patentholder need more than one         opportunity to amend?               MR. BEENEY: The ­­ IPR proceeds in two         separate stages, as ­­ as your question implicates,        Justice Alito. First, there is the institution        decision. In there, the Board typically does set forth          a preliminary­claim­interpretation standard. But for      the government to take the position that that's the end          of the ballgame is wholly inconsistent with its position         on the second question presented about appeal.       Obviously, the claim­construction interpretation is     subject to appeal, and so it can't be fixed in the           institution determination.              The final claim­construction standard that     the Board applies to make the ultimate decision as to          whether the patent is going to survive is in the final           decision that the Board renders. At that point in time,           it's too late for the patentee to make any kind of           determination as to whether it would like to amend and          cancel the claims that are under review.                     I also think it's important to distinguish      the examinational context, in which, historically, BRI       has been cabin to. Historically, in fact, what's used          in the court­like litigation structure that Congress       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review established in inter partes review is the       ordinary­meaning standard.              ­­            But ­­ but in addition to the fact that one          JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does this work? I         mean, suppose you're right and it should be ordinary         meaning. That doesn't determine who's going to win or          lose this case, does it?                 MR. BEENEY: What would happen, Your Honor,        if the Court agrees with us that the Board should be           using the ordinary­meaning test, is that the case should         be remanded to the Board to give Cuozzo's claims their          appropriate construction. That's never happened in this        proceeding. That would be the result of Your Honors          agreeing with us.               And we believe that once we go back to the          Board and the Board applies the appropriate construction        to our claims, our claims will survive review or ­­ or,           at ­­ at a minimum, we will be permitted to amend,            because the basis of the decision by the Board to deny           Cuozzo the opportunity to amend was that the claim         construction read out of the construction of the claims         an embodiment that's set forth in the specification.                    Under the ordinary­meaning standard that the      Board should be applying in this adjudicatory context        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review that Congress set up to litigate over substantive        property rights, the Board would be applying the        ordinary­construction standard which we believe would      include the embodiment that's in this specification,       and, therefore, we would receive relief.                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if ­­ if the ­­ if          the patent is invalid under its broadest, reasonable        interpretation, doesn't ­­ doesn't that mean the PTO        should never have issued the patent in the first place,          and doesn't that give very significant meaning and        structure to this process?                MR. BEENEY: Not necessarily, Justice      Kennedy. And ­­ and the reason is this: The purpose of             the broadest reasonable interpretation expedient, as the       government agrees it is, it is not a claim­construction          standard as the Federal circuit said in Skvorecz.                    What it does is try to test for ambiguity in          the claim language, not patentability. Patentability is        the standard that Congress set in inter partes review.         But what the broadest reasonable interpretation does is        try to test for ambiguity in the patent language so it           can be amended. So the fact that a patented invention            or an application may not pass the broadest reasonable         expedient does not mean that the inventor has not         claimed a patentable invention. It simply means that          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review the language is ambiguous, and the language needs to be          refined. And that is a wholly different exercise.                      JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I ­­ I guess I           was ­­ was thinking of the mind­set that ­­ that the           process, the structure, that the PTO uses in the first          place. It looks at a claim. If ­­ if I were the                examiner to determine whether or not I should grant the           patent, I'd say, I'm going to give this the broadest          interpretation to make sure I'm right. It seems to          me ­­ or am I wrong, that that's not what they do?                         MR. BEENEY: They do, but not to determine         whether the claims are patentable. They do to determine          whether there's ambiguity in the language.                  And, Your Honor, you can go back to a whole           line of district court cases from ­­ all the way from           Carr in, I think, in ­­ in the D.C. circuit to the               decision in PCC Broadband, and all the cases in          between, Skvorecz and ­­ and In re Hyatt and all the           other ones. The purpose of the       broadest­reasonable­interpretation expedient ­­ and it's     called an "expedient" for a reason ­­ is to determine           whether claim language has ambiguity in it.                   If it does, then the patent owner can amend         and ­­ and does so as of right in examinational context,           not in the IPR context, the patent owner can amend to           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review clarify that her claims really don't mean what they may          broadly be construed to mean.                 JUSTICE BREYER: But the question that       Justice Kennedy asked, and I think it's an important          one, to me, anyway, was, if you ­­ forget this          proceeding. If, in fact, in the broadest possible, or          whatever, reasonable interpretation and you were in       front of the Patent Office, and that's what they would          look at, and if it was too broad because that broad, you            know, it has flaws in it of whatever kind, the patent           doesn't issue. Is that right or not right?                                 MR. BEENEY: It's not a question ­­        JUSTICE BREYER: It's either right or wrong.        You can tell me I'm right, or you can tell me I'm wrong.                         MR. BEENEY: There isn't an iterative       process with the right to amend ­­                                          JUSTICE BREYER: I know that.       MR. BEENEY: So ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: I know that. I'm saying:          If at the end of the day, on the broadest reasonable           interpretation, it is not patentable, there is no patent         issued.                                     MR. BEENEY: That's correct.     JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now ­­      MR. BEENEY: That is correct.      Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ if that's so, you could         look at this new law as ­­ as ­­ as you were looking at              it, as trying to build a little court proceeding. If I             thought it was just doing that, I would say you were            right.             But there is another way to look at it. And           the other way to look at it ­­ and that's what I would              like your comment about ­­ is that there are these          things, for better words, let's call them patent trolls,         and that the ­­ the Patent Office has been issuing          billions of patents that shouldn't have been issued ­­ I          overstate ­­ but only some. And what happens is some           person in business gets this piece of paper and ­­ and           looks at it and says, oh, my God, I can't go ahead with              my invention.              And so what we're trying to do with this         process is to tell the office, you've been doing too          much too fast. Go back and let people who are hurt by             this come in and get rid of those patents that shouldn't           have been issued. Now, we will give you, again, once           the same chance we gave you before, and that is you can            amend it once if you convince the judge you should have           done it before. But if, on the broadest possible          interpretation, you know, reasonable interpretation, it      shouldn't have been issued, we're canceling it. And ­­         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review and that is for the benefit of those people who were           suffering from too many patents that shouldn't have been         issued in the first place. I don't know.                      If it's that second purpose, then I would         think, well, maybe this is right, what they're doing.         And if it's ambiguous between those two purposes, I         would begin to think, well, maybe they should have the          power themselves under Chevron, Meade, or whatever, to        decide which to do.                Now, that's ­­ that's the argument, I think,         that's in my mind registering the other way. So what do            you say?              MR. BEENEY: Justice Breyer, if I agreed ­­         and respectfully, I'd like to explain why I disagree.                      JUSTICE BREYER: Uh­huh.                MR. BEENEY: But ­­ but even if I did agree,            I ­­ I would say that Congress, in fact, established           exactly what Your Honor described. But it established a          system in which we are adjudicating property rights.        And it makes no more sense to adjudicate those property          rights in a court­like setting by pretending that those          rights are not what, in fact, was granted, what the          patentee claims, or what the patentee could assert in         district court infringement litigation than it does       to ­­ when you're in ­­ trying to determine whether          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review someone's property encroaches on another, which ­­ which        I would submit is really an apt analogy for the          obviousness­anticipation tests. We look at what the        boundaries ­­ the metes and bounds of that property         actually is.              So Congress, assuming that it did what Your        Honor suggested, established a system to do that, but it           established a system to adjudicate in a court­like          setting the actual patent rights that a patentee         obtains, not ones that someone suggests might be        broader. That is to determine ambiguity in claim         language, not to adjudicate rights.                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. If language        is ambiguous, it can't have that plain meaning, can it?                      MR. BEENEY: I'm sorry?                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How would you have a        plain meaning that a district court would apply if          language is ambiguous? How could it say that you have a            valid property right in something that's ambiguous?                   MR. BEENEY: The test of the ordinary        meaning, as enunciated by Philips and its progeny, will         first look at the claim language. If there's ambiguity          in the claim language, then what is the meaning of that           patent will be determined in light of the specification,         the prosecution history, and other intrinsic evidence.       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review                In the rare case where there still may be      ambiguity, then the Court may consider extrinsic       evidence, dictionaries, other writings by the patentee,       what somebody of ordinary skill in the art might         determine a particular claim limitation to mean.                    So there are a number of tools in the          ordinary­meaning­construction standard that should be     used here to ­­               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Aren't those tools used       in determining the broadest ­­ the broadest reasonable        reading, meaning how can the PTO decide what a broad           reasonable reading is unless it looks at all of those          factors and decides that the specifications and all the         other things don't cure, continue to provide ambiguity        in the patent?               MR. BEENEY: It ­­ it does not. The          broadest reasonable interpretation is considerably     different than the ordinary meaning of construction       standard, and the fact that the Patent and Trademark         Office has admitted as much. In the manual for patent           examination procedures, the Patent and Trademark Office       tells its patent examiners, we, quote, "do not interpret         claims in the same manners as the courts."                    Just recently, a very important tool that        courts look at in the ordinary­meaning context, the        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review prosecution history, in the Federal Register the Patent        and Trademark Office said that the only time it looks at           prosecution history is when it is actually raised by the          parties, relied on by the parties, and explained by the          parties.               There are very different sub tools, if you      will, within broadest reasonable interpretation and      ordinary meaning, and that's because they intend to        accomplish different purposes. One adjudicates      patentability, which is what Congress intended in IPR.        The other identifies ambiguity in claim language.                   In fact ­­              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why ­­                 MR. BEENEY: ­­ if one looks at ­­ if one           looks at the manual in Section , the PTO tells its           examiners that one of the reasons we use the broadest          reasonable interpretation is because, unlike the courts,       we don't have before us a fully­developed prosecution         history. Well, when you're in inter partes review, you          do have a fully­developed prosecution history, and        that's what we should be looking at.                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does the       relationship between the district court infringement      action and the proceeding before the Board actually work         out in practice? If you're suing someone, here's my          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review patent, you're infringing it, and the infringer goes to         the ­­ the Board and says I want you to determine the             validity of the patent, and the district court is doing          the same thing, or at least determining the scope of the           patent and whether or not it infringes?                   MR. BEENEY: What typically happens, Mr.       Chief Justice, is in those situations where a patent is           not subjected to inter partes review, and I file an           infringement case, is that the defendant may then seek         to file a petition before the Board ­­                                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.     MR. BEENEY: ­­ seeking review of the patent         and CICA stay in the district court.                   And in fact, in this rather substantial       transfer of the adjudicatory function from the judiciary        to the administrative agency, we find that about         percent of patents that are being adjudicated by the         Board are subject to district court litigation. And in          those percent of the time, district courts are         entering stays percent of the time. So in fact, what            is happening is the judiciary is deferring to the Board          in making decisions about the patentability of the        claims that are at issue.                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would think that's         a little burdensome to the district court. They sort of           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review have to get deeply into the patent case and then take           whatever the Board says is the proper ­­ whether it's          valid or not.               MR. BEENEY: Well, that, in fact, what        happens is that should a claim survive inter partes          review, then there are various estoppel provisions that        Congress enacted in the America Invents Act that prevent         the relitigation of the identical prior art that may         have been adjudicated by the Board in IPR.                    So the district courts don't need to revisit        what happened in inter partes review, which is yet         another example of why Congress intended inter partes        review to be a substitute for district court litigation.                      JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in the district       court ­­ please correct me if I'm wrong ­­ does the           district court have the obligation to ­­ to interpret         the statute in a way that preserves the patent's          validity?             MR. BEENEY: Only ­­ as I was going through           that litany of steps with Justice Sotomayor, only when         the claims are ambiguous. We go to the intrinsic          evidence. If that's ambiguous, we go to the extrinsic          evidence. And then if, really ­­                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I would not think that          the ­­ the ­­ that in the IPR, that rule would prevail.            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. BEENEY: In ­­ in inter partes review         there is no presumption of validity. Congress        recognized ­­             JUSTICE KENNEDY: That ­­ that shows a        difference in these proceedings.                MR. BEENEY: There no doubt is a difference          in the proceeding. But the fact that Congress         recognized the expertise of this newly created Board        that it was establishing, and thereby removed the        presumption because of the expertise, in no way suggests         that, in adjudicating patentability, the Board in IPR        should be dispensing with all the guidance that this         Court has ­­ has provided, and all the guidance that          other courts have provided, in giving patent rights in         adjudicating whether they are patentable, their ordinary       meaning.                         JUSTICE KAGAN: Are ­­ please.      MR. BEENEY: No. I was just going to say,            Justice Kagan, it just doesn't simply flow.                   JUSTICE KAGAN: Is ­­ is your argument, Mr.         Beeney, that Congress couldn't have thought anything       else except that the ordinary­meaning standard would       control? Because if I look at the statute, I mean, it              just doesn't say one way or the other. So we're a            little bit reading tea leaves, aren't we?       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. BEENEY: I think not, Justice Kagan.         And I think your ­­ your first sentence is perhaps           really only at the margin in exaggeration of our         position, and ­­ and it is because of this: Take one            factor that ­­ that Congress enacted in IPR, a ­month           period from which the time the Board must reach its          final decision absent good cause. Contrast that with         the examination proceedings. The examinational context       and the reexaminational context take two to three years.         Why do they take two or three years? They take two to             three years because this is iterative, back and forth,         looking for prior art, discussing with the patentee what         did she invent, asking her to amend her claims if          they're deemed to be ambiguous or too broad. That          doesn't happen in ­­ in inter partes review. It can't           happen because of the time frame that Congress        legislated.                         There are other reasons why ­­     JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, I guess if I'm           trying to put myself in Congress's position, I'm ­­ I'm          looking at the PTO, and it does pretty much everything          by this broadest­construction standard. And if I had          the clear intent that you're suggesting, given the        backdrop of how the PTO generally operates, wouldn't I         say so?  Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. BEENEY: I think not, Justice Kagan, for          the historical reason that Congress has never addressed        claim­construction issues. It's always been a matter         left to the judiciary, number one.                  And number two, the process that Congress       enacted in IPR is a brand new adjudicatory proceeding          unlike the PTO has ever confronted in the past. I mean,             arguing that one in inter partes review should use the          broadest reasonable interpretation is ­­ is really the        quintessential example of trying to pound a square peg          into a round hole simply because that peg used to fit a             very different hole.               Congress established a very different      proceeding in inter partes review. It is court­like; it          is done under very similar circumstances to the way a          case proceeds in a district court; it adjudicates actual          property rights and takes those property rights away.        And for all those reasons, if I may say, the statute            basically reeks that the ordinary­meaning­construction     standard used by the district courts should be used.                     JUSTICE GINSBURG: Kind of a hybrid. It has           ­­ in certain respects it resembles administrative       proceedings and other district court proceedings. So        there ­­ there is a right to amend, or an opportunity,            an opportunity to amend before the agency; there isn't         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review in court. There are discovery differences; there are         other differences. So it's a ­­ it's a little of one              and a little of the other, this inter partes review.                       MR. BEENEY: I think, Justice Ginsburg,        there are differences, but none of them go to the          fundamental fact of the claim­construction standard.      The system that Congress established is consistent only        with ordinary meaning.               And if you look again at this ability to         amend, in fact, in ­­ in examinational proceedings,        patent applications are almost always amended. In        reexamination they're amended percent of the time.        In inter partes review, they're amended less than one         half of one percent of the time, and that is why the            claim­construction standard should be the ordinary      meaning.             If I may, Your Honors, I'd like to just very           briefly turn to the issue of appellate review of the          Board's institution decision when the Board exceeds a        statutory authority.              Just a ­­ very briefly, our position is that          under the heavy presumption of judicial review of        administrative actions, there's nothing in the statutory       scheme that meets the heavy burden to overcome that         presumption. Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             The statutory scheme here can be read,       either as the government would like to read it, to bar           review forever; but then that provision has to be         limited to its terms, that what is barred is the          director's decision to institute under that section, as        the statute says, not all the other criteria used in          determining whether to institute review.                 But a better reading, as established by the         Federal circuit in Versata, and the government's       original position in Versata is that the statute only         prevents interim interlocutory review of the institution       decision at the time. Under Mach Mining, under Boeing,          this Court ought to find that the statute can be read to            permit review, and it should.                 And if there are no further questions, I'd        like to reserve my remaining ­­                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then I have just one         question about that.               Then this statute is doing no work, because        there would be a bar on interlocutory review under the           final judgment rule, in any event. You don't need a           statute to preclude interlocutory review when the       reviewing court can review only final judgments.                   MR. BEENEY: Correct, Justice Ginsburg.      But ­­ but what the statute does do that the          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Administrative Procedures Act does not do is, number        one, bars appeal forever of decisions not to institute.         Because those decisions will never become part of the         final decision which you can appeal under a separate          statutory scheme under the American Invents Act. The         statute does that work. And the statute also does the           work of barring interlocutory petitions for mandamus.                                                       CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       MR. BEENEY: Thank you.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gannon.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                 MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               The PTO has reasonably decided to use its        longstanding broadest­reasonable­construction approach   in inter partes review proceedings because, as       Justice Ginsburg just noted, that they are a hybrid          between ­­ they're ­­ they're not exactly like anything         that has gone before. But the PTO reasonably concluded          that they are materially more like all of the other          proceedings that the PTO, and before that, the Patent         Office, has had in which it has repeatedly used         precisely this approach. And it has expressly used it          when it is possible for claim amendments to be made          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review because it promotes the improvement of patent quality        that Congress was interested in promoting in the America         Invents Act by eliminating overly broad questions.                                                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. ­­    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please, please.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Gannon, I'm ­­ I'm a         little bit confused. You bring a patent. You go into             the reexamination back and forth, with the Patent Office         giving it the broadest reasonable interpretation. And        you make amendments until you get to the point where the           Patent Office thinks that whatever you have is clear         enough to get a patent, correct?                   MR. GANNON: Clear enough and also satisfies        the ­­ the requirements of patentability.                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So how        different at the end of that process is the ordinary          meaning from a continuing broad meaning? You've already          had all these chances to amend, to make things as          precise and as narrow as the Patent Office thinks it          needs to be.               MR. GANNON: Well, I do think that it is the            case that in most circumstances, these two different        forms of construction are going to end up in the same           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review place. That's true in most of the case law. The Dell             amicus brief supporting us explains this, in particular,        that it's ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So when        doesn't it end up in the same place?                    MR. GANNON: It doesn't end up in the same          place basically when you get to the very end and the           Court has to apply the presumption of validity that         Justice Kennedy was discussing before that requires the        Court to adopt a saving construction of a patent. It             gets to the end of the process. In both procedures, in            the broadest reasonable interpretation and in the       Philips standard, they're going to start with the        language of the claim in light of the specification as          it would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in            the arts. It's true in the initial examination context          that the PTO does not use prosecution history, but it          has expressly noted that it will use prosecution history         in a proceeding like this, the IPR ­­                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I ­­ that's         what I ­­               MR. GANNON: ­­ because it's already in        existence. And ­­ and my friend noted that it will only            consider prosecution history that's briefed by the       parties in the IPR. But the same thing is, of course,            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review true in a district court proceeding. The district          court's going to consider prosecution history that's       introduced to it before the parties.                  And so at the end of the analysis if a ­­ if             a court or the PTO are left with two different          potentially reasonable readings of a ­­ of a patent           claim, a court has to adopt the saving construction that           ends the PT ­­ the one in ­­ in ­­ if the concern is one               about obviousness or anticipation in light of prior art,         that's probably going to be the narrower construction.                    The Board ­­ the Board and the PTO, by         contrast, and before that, the Patent Office, have        recognized that if you have a claim that could          reasonably be read ­­ this isn't just a hypothetical          reading, but this is one, when you take all of this into            account, that could reasonably be read as reading on a          prior patent or as being obvious in light of a prior            patent, then that's a circumstance in which the Board is           going to say, you need to make this clear. Otherwise,           we're going to hold that it's not patentable.                    And that's exactly what's happening in the       motions to amend that are happening before the Board in          IPR proceedings right now. My friend is correct ­­                     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.                  MR. GANNON: ­­ in saying that the vast         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review majority of motions to amend in IPRs have thus far been           denied. Only about percent of ­­ of patentholders in           IPRs have actually filed motions to amend. And there          have now been six motions to amend that are granted.          There was one new one last week. It's a small number.                           But the vast majority of these amendments     are denied on grounds of unpatentability. And this is a           reason that actually isn't that different from what        would happen in the initial exam or in the ­­ or in the             reexam.             And so my friend quotes Section , which        is the standard allowing for a patentholder to propose          amendments in a course of an ex partes reexamination.          But note that it's the ability to propose amendments.         That's not an amendment as of right. Just because you           propose an amendment in a ­­ in a reexamination doesn't            mean that the PTO, at the end of that, is going to say             that's right. This is patentable as ­­ as you have           proposed the amendment. It still has to find that, as           amended, it does not read on the prior art.                     And ­­                         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the one ­­       MR. GANNON: ­­ what's happening here is the         PTO is denying motions because even with the amendment,         they would read on prior art and be unpatentable.         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think as Justice         Ginsburg described it, we're dealing with a hybrid         entity with characteristics of the PTO and the district         court. But it seems to me perfectly clear that Congress           meant for this entity to substitute for the judicial         action.             So why ­­ why should we be so wedded to the           way they do business in the PTO with respect to the           broadest possible construction when the ­­ the point is         not to replicate PTO procedures. It's supposed to take          the place of district court procedures.                  MR. GANNON: It's supposed to take the place         to some extent, but not to the ultimate extent. It's           not supposed to perfectly replicate the results of        district court litigation. And we know that because         Congress has imposed structural differences on the IPR        proceeding that will guarantee that there could be        different results at the end of the day.                    Most importantly, there's the different     burden of proof. If you ­­ even though you're arguing           about invalidity, the ­­ the ­­ in ­­ in the district           court proceeding you're going to have to prove        invalidity by clear and convincing evidence under this        Court's ­­             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but I think we          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review ought ­­ we shouldn't, except as far as the number of           broadest different procedures as we ­­ we can, it's a          very extraordinary animal in legal culture to have two         different proceedings addressing the same question that       lead to different results.                MR. GANNON: That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.        But they ­­ they can lead to different results here for           multiple reasons, even setting aside the question of        whether the broadest reasonable interpretation applies      here.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're just       saying that, okay, there's a problem here, and so we           should accept another problem that's presented where we        don't have to do it.                 MR. GANNON: Well, we ­­ we do think that          the reason why this ultimately ends up being more like a           Board proceeding or a PTO proceeding is because there's          the ability to make claim amendments. You're not, at          the end of the process, just stuck with having to adopt           a saving construction of the patents. The ­­ the patent           owner can come in and say, look, I can fix that problem.             I can keep this from being obvious.                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, are you saying        in the IPR proceeding?                MR. GANNON: In the IPR that's ­­       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's      happened six times ever.                MR. GANNON: It's ­­ it ­­ the ­­ out of ­­           yes, it's a small number so far. Many more motions ­­            actually, three times as many motions, motions have         been denied as moot. They were contingent amendments,         where the ­­ the patent owner said, well, if you're          going to adopt ­­ if you're going to disagree with my           claim construction, I would propose amending the patent         this way. And the Board said, we deny your motion as            moot because we agree with your construction that the         patent is actually patentable without the amendments.                   And this is not an instance where the patent         owner is shooting in the dark, where he has only one           chance to amend. As was already mentioned, the ­­ the           PTO, the Board, is generally going to give a preliminary           claim construction when it issues its ­­ its decision to          institute the proceedings. Here, at Pages to a          of the Petition Appendix, there are seven pages of the          Board explaining, in its decision to institute this        proceeding, what it thinks the phrase "integrally       attached" means for purposes of this patent.                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's already       been ­­ there's already been a case where you've had           contrary results with respect to the same patent, right?         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review In the same ­­ in other words, parallel litigation; one          says A and the other says not A.                                 MR. GANNON: Yes, that can happen.       CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what do you do         in that case?               MR. GANNON: Well, in that case, if the         patent has been invalidated by the PTO, then the         district court litigation is ­­ is going to abate. If           the ­­ if the ­­                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you put the        district court to all the trouble? I mean, we're           talking about district courts that don't do patent cases         on a regular basis. You put the district court to all             the trouble of trying to construe the patent, and then          the ­­ the defendant comes in and says, well, guess          what? I won before the IP review, and so sorry, but all              that was wasted energy.                MR. GANNON: Well, the ­­ I think this is           the reason why the ­­ most district court proceedings         have been stayed while pending a parallel IPR proceeding          before the Board. And there are time limits on the           ability ­­ Congress expressly addressed this in       Section , where it talked about ­­ about the         inability of somebody who's already brought a district         court suit alleging invalidity of a patent to bring an           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review IPR proceeding or somebody who's in privity with such a          person. And ­­ and there are a time limit that if             some ­­   if you've been sued for infringement by the        patent owner in district court, then you have to start          one of these IPR proceedings within months.                    And so usually, the district court hasn't       gotten that far along, and there isn't that much wasted          effort. And instead, what we do is we go back to the             PTO, and the PTO gets exactly the chance that Congress          expected it to have, to say, is this one of those           patents that we really oughtn't to have issued in the          first place?              JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Is that ­­                    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a difference        in the ­­ in the ­­ the Board proceeding, the IPR,           and ­­ and the district court litigation, in this         respect: With district court litigation, we're very        concerned because of Article III, and we have to have a           specific controversy, specific injury, and so forth, but        that an IPR proceeding can be more speculative, in that          the Board and the parties can say this could be          interpreted in the future in a particular way. Is           that ­­ is there a difference to the tone or ­­ or the              thrust of ­­ of the inquiries in the ­­ in the two            instances? Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. GANNON: Well, I think that, ultimately,         the question in the IPR is ­­ is narrow, because it's           only devoted to a couple types of unpatentability. And           it's going to be about whether the PTO ever should have           issued this patent because it was, in fact, anticipated         by a prior patent, or it was obvious in light of prior             art, and ­­              JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say it's a ­­         it's narrow, but we have the broadest possible        construction. I'll ­­ I'll work with that. I think            you're probably right.               (Laughter.)             MR. GANNON: But what I mean by "narrower"          is that in ­­ in a district court proceeding, there are            other grounds that could be used to challenge the         patents and ­­ and it ­­ it could proceed along          different lines. This ­­ this is a narrower trap in            which the only grounds that can be considered are going          to be invalidity on the basis of or . And it is              true that you do not have to be somebody who would have            Article III standing in order to initiate an IPR.         That's another thing that we think shows that this         wasn't intended to be just a perfect substitute for          district court litigation.               To be sure, most of these IPRs are going to          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review be instituted by parties who do have a competitive          interest, who were concerned about whether they're going        to be sued for infringement on the basis of this patent,           or ­­ or ­­ and, therefore, they want to make sure that            this patent that they think ought not to have been          issued is invalidated. And this is ­­                   JUSTICE BREYER: What's the evidence? That        is to say, I picked that up from your brief, that this             statute is, in part ­­ call it a partial­Groundhog­Day          statute. You'll do it again until you get it right, and            partly, it's designed here to go back to the ­­ I ­­ to              the Patent Office, probably because a large number of          businessmen told Congress that they were getting threats        of suits in respect to patents that obviously should         never have been issued.                  Now, if that was the problem, then it      doesn't make ­­ it does make sense to say at least the            PTO has the authority under a partial­Groundhog­Day        statute to do that part of it over. And that's not            surprising; there are only six that actually got        amended, because they narrowed it before and because the         PTO held these are invalid, anyway. Okay? That          isn't ­­ so that doesn't move me.                   But look at the view I just expressed of the           statute. There is another view that this is just a           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review little district court proceeding designed to save people        that time and money that they'd have to spend on a big             district court proceeding. All right?                  Now, what's the evidence that the first view        that I had, which would not say this is just a little              district court proceeding, is correct?                 MR. GANNON: Well, I think we have two          different types of evidence. We do have the legislative          history that we quote in our brief that said ­­ the           committee report said that a purpose of this was to           improve patent quality and ­­ and help justify the         presumption in favor of validity that a company's issued          patents in district courts.                But then in terms of the notion that it's         not just intended to be another little district court         proceeding that happens to be faster and cheaper is ­­         is all of the structural differences that Congress        imported here to ensure that it wasn't going to be          exactly the same. And so, as I mentioned, it was going             to be limited to certain particular grounds of ­­ of          unpatentability under and . The evidence that         could be considered there is limited. The only prior          art that can be considered is prior art that comes in           patents and prior publications. That's a narrower         universe than could be used in a district court          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review proceeding. And, of course, the burden of proof is          going to be different.                And so we think that in ­­ in speaking to          all of those things expressly and ­­ and then also in           ensuring that there still would be an opportunity to         amend claims, that, ultimately, is the reason why this         is not sufficiently like district court litigation for        the PTO to part ­­ to depart from its longstanding          practice of using the BRI approach in every type of          proceeding, including post­grant proceedings. This      isn't the first Groundhog Day­type statute that ­­ that         the PTO has had.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there ­­ what ­­        is the district court free to disagree with the PTO          reading of the patent? Could it say, fine, this is a            pertinent fact, a mixed question of law, in fact, in           litigation pending before me. And I appreciate the fact           that you think this agency thinks this, but my         responsibility is to decide this case according to the         facts and law, and I disagree with the PTO's reading.                       MR. GANNON: Yes. As long as the patent          still exists. If the end of the IPR proceeding is the            cancelation of the relevant claim, then there isn't        going to be something to be litigated about in district          court. Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well ­­     MR. GANNON: But otherwise, the claim                               construction that is adopted in ­­ in ­­ along the way           in getting to upholding the patent claim isn't going to          bind the district court any more than the district court          claim construction would bind a different district court         or the PTO.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, can it say        that I understand what PTO thinks the scope of the           patent is, but my responsibility is to interpret it         pursuant to a different standard, and under my different          standard I have a different result?                    MR. GANNON: Yes. That ­­ that could be the           difference, and that is exactly what the courts have         repeatedly recognized, going back, as my friend noted,        to the decision from the D.C. circuit in the Carr           case, which recognized that the PTO and the courts are          using different standards precisely because you can       still clarify the scope of the claim when you're before          the PTO.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the district        court interprets the patent, is ­­ is that binding on          the PTO?              MR. GANNON: No.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if the PTO        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review interprets the patent, that's not binding on the        district court.              MR. GANNON: That's right. And the same         thing is ­­ it's ­­                                        CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well ­­     MR. GANNON: The same thing ­­      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. It just         seems to me that that's a bizarre way to conduct           legal ­­ decide a legal question. I mean, who ­­ how              does it work? Whoever gets to the judgment first, or ­­                       MR. GANNON: Well, with respect to the        question of whether the patent still exists, if the PTO          cancels the claims at the end of the proceeding, then          there won't be something to be litigating about in         district court.              If the PTO holds that the burden of proving         that this claim is unpatentable has not been satisfied,         then somebody else can take another shot at that before          the district court.               the IPR ­­                          This particular party who proceeded before      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.     MR. GANNON: ­­ won't be able to, because         they'll be estopped by Section from pursuing the         same arguments in both forums.     Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though they're       different standards of proof?                MR. GANNON: Even though they're different       standards of proof.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that how estoppel        normally works?              MR. GANNON: Here, Congress has expressly       prescribed that you cannot use, in the district        proceeding, an argument that you could have advanced ­­                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the answer to my         question is, no, that's not the way estoppel normally         works.             MR. GANNON: That's right. But I would also           say that in this context, the Court has recognized in          Blonder Tongue that estoppel ­­ that ­­ that people can          repeatedly relitigate the question of patent validity in        district courts around the country.                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there another       example where you have a complaint filed that puts an           issue before the district court during which the ­­ the          parties can take that issue away from the district court          and come up with an answer that then binds ­­ well, I            guess you're saying it doesn't bind the district court.                     MR. GANNON: I ­­ I'm saying that if the PTO            has the ability in the meantime to cancel the claim, to           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review find that, yes, it is correct, this is one of those           patents we never ought to have issued in the first          instance, and that's true because when we've applied our         broadest­reasonable­construction approach ­­                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.     MR. GANNON: ­­ and the patent owner has ­­         has proffered amendments, they can't come up with        something that is actually patentable ­­                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And that's        because of their ­­ their view, and then it goes back to            the district court, and the district court said, well,         thank you very much for your opinion, but my job is to            give a different analysis. I'm not bound by this           broadest­possible reading. And when I read the patent,          I think it comes out the other way, and that's how I'm            going to decide this case.                 MR. GANNON: It is true that a district          court, as long as the patent still exists and the          district court has jurisdiction over the parties and the         parties aren't precluded from ­­ from raising those        claims, it could end up at a different result at the end             of the day, precisely because of a higher burden of           proof and the fact that it ­­ it has to adopt the saving             construction ­­             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And this is under ­­        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review MR. GANNON: ­­ that the PTO would not need          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And this is under a                     to adopt.              statute designed to make the patent system more        reasonable and more expeditious in reaching judgments?                   MR. GANNON: Yes. And ­­ and this is          something where Congress has expressly delegated to the        agency the authority to make regulations governing inter        partes review and say at (b) ­­                  JUSTICE BREYER: How ­­ how does this        happen? I ­­ I thought we send it back, and the PTO               says we shouldn't have issued it.                                                      MR. GANNON: And if ­­     JUSTICE BREYER: They say that we cancel it.         MR. GANNON: If ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: So there is nothing in the         district court; isn't that right?                 MR. GANNON: Yes. I mean, at that point,           the ­­ the patent owner can appeal to the Federal          circuit. The Federal circuit ­­                 JUSTICE BREYER: Can appeal what? Can        appeal the cancelation?               MR. GANNON: Can appeal the decision that ­­        the final written decision of the Board is one that will           say ­­ Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE BREYER: And if they never issue a         patent, I apply for a patent because I have this thing              that instead of putting red cellophane on the        speedometer, I put purple cellophane on the speedometer.         It signals the presence of a hot dog stand. All right?                         (Laughter.)             JUSTICE BREYER: I ­­ I then try to patent            it. And they look at this patent and, no, absolutely           not.             Can I appeal to the Court?                   (Laughter.)                         MR. GANNON: Well, if ­­ if ­­ I'm sorry.          JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. They don't        issue a patent.                                                                            MR. GANNON: But the point ­­      JUSTICE BREYER: I have an application.        MR. GANNON: The point ­­     JUSTICE BREYER: They don't issue a patent.         Can I appeal their decision to the Court?         MR. GANNON: You would be able to ­­ yes.          And ­­ and so here, ultimately ­­                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Just to         interrupt. You're talking about something else. You         mean appeal to the Federal circuit, right?                   MR. GANNON: That ­­ that ­­ he was talking          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review about a patent application, yes. And also, here,          there's going to be an appeal to the Federal circuit of           the ­­ of the substantive merits of the Board's decision          that this patent claim is unpatentable. It doesn't         satisfy the standard. And so ­­                  asking ­­                         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I ­­ what I was            MR. GANNON: ­­ ultimately, that's ­­      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What I         was asking, I think, is a different question. The            reason it's not ­­ it's not as if it's an appeal to the             district court because the district ­­ that ­­ that's an          issue before the district court: What is the scope of           this patent; what does it cover? And the Patent Office           is telling you, well, it covers this, and the district          court says, thank you, I apply a different standard. I             think it covers this. And when that's the case, it's a            valid patent.              MR. GANNON: That's correct. That could        happen. But if the claim has already been canceled, the           point is that if the ­­ if the ­­                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Gannon, could you       give an example? I'm ­­ so far I'm halfway with you.            If the PTO has canceled the patent, the lawsuit in the           district court ends.   Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review MR. GANNON: Yes.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's nothing else for                               it to do.               MR. GANNON: And ­­                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's assume ­­                  MR. GANNON: But although the patent owner        in the meantime could have appealed to the Federal         circuit ­­             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Federal circuit and ­­                  MR. GANNON: ­­ and determined ­­                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ assuming it loses in        the Federal circuit, the district court case has ended,         correct?             MR. GANNON: Well, if the patent is gone,         then ­­ then they're not going to be litigating about it           in district court.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So what does         survive? Let's assume the Patent Office decides that         the patent's still alive. The loser goes up to the           Federal circuit, and the Federal circuit says this is         still a patent. They've given it a meaning of ­­ the              broadest possible meaning and said it's still valid.        Now what happens in the district court? What's still          alive? Give a concrete example.                   MR. GANNON: Well ­­    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's going to happen       with ­­ in the district court?                  MR. GANNON: It ­­ it ­­                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or what can happen in        the district court?               MR. GANNON: It ­­ in the context of the          district court proceeding, I agree with the Chief         Justice that the district court may still find some         reason to think that if it's not applying the         broadest­reasonable­construction approach, that ­­ that     it ­­ it's going to end up in a different place, and             it's not going to ­­                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is it going to end         up in a different place?                  MR. GANNON: Well, I'm not sure. In ­­                     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Give me a concrete.                    MR. GANNON: I ­­ I'm not sure. I ­­ we              think that at the ­­ at the margin, this can well make a             difference. But ­­ but ­­                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it can only make a         differences for the district court finding the patent        invalid, no?              MR. GANNON: No. I don't expect that it           would, because the problem here has to do ­­ it ­­ it's            the overly broad readings that are going to result in          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review having the patent be declared invalid with respect to         prior art. The ­­ what exactly the claim construction          is could be relevant to other questions about whether it          reads on the ­­ the particular product that's at issue          in the infringement action or whatever. And so there's          a reason why the claim construction issue could still be          a live one and why the district court would need to           decide what it thinks the appropriate claim construction        is, and it may ­­ it won't ­­                                                                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Before you ­­     MR. GANNON: ­­ be bound to ­­ to adopt ­­          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ time runs out ­­       MR. GANNON: ­­ exactly what the PTO did.         JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ I do want to go back           to the appealability issue.                MR. GANNON: Uh­huh.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming I start from        the EEOC, the Mach Mining ­­ Mach Mining v. EOC, which           we don't easily think that Congress is intending to         prevent courts from enforcing its directives to Federal        agencies, okay?              Number two, this is a very specific statute         with steps about what ­­ when and when not the PTO can            institute one of these reviews. There's all sorts of          provisions that say you can only do it under these          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review circumstances and only after making these findings.       Your position now is that that decision is never         reviewable.             Justice Ginsburg asked a very intelligent       question, which is, if we ­­ what's the purpose of it           outside the APA? And your opposing colleague says         there's two purposes: It precludes mandamus, and it         precludes reviews of the denial to grant such a hearing.                       Why isn't that ­­ all of that enough to say          there should be some review? Why would Congress tell          the PTO don't do it except in these limited         circumstances, but nobody's going to ever watch you to         make sure that's what you're doing?                  MR. GANNON: Well, I ­­ I'd say a couple            things. First of all, calling something nonappealable        would be a particularly odd way of saying that the only            way to get review of this in the Federal circuit is           through an appeal rather than mandamus.                  And secondly, with respect to the question       of whether this is just barring review of the decision          not to institute a proceeding, we think that the          contrast with the statute that applies to ex parte         reexams is ­­ is very telling here. And this is because            in several provisions of the Patent Act, Congress has         used the same phrase. They have called certain         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review decisions by the PTO "final and nonappealable." That's         what they did here, but they ­­ they made that          applicable to a much broader category of decisions than          it had previously done.                But in the context of ex parte reexams, in         Section (c), which is reprinted on Page a of the          government's brief, they've made final and nonappealable       only the following: The determination by the director         that no substantial new question of patentability has        been raised.              And so that's a provision in which Congress         did exactly what my friend says it was trying to do           here. It said that the only thing that is final and            nonappealable is the decision that no new question has         been raised, and therefore, this proceeding will not be         instituted.             Here, the ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do we do with         the Federal circuit's reading in Portola ­­ Portola ­­        Portola where it basically had similar language and said         it's appealable only at the end?                  MR. GANNON: I ­­ we ­­ we think ­­ I'm ­­            I'm not sure which case Your Honor is discussing, but we           think that here, the ­­ the reading ­­ the language          that ­­ of the scope of what Congress has made final and            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review nonappealable is the entire decision whether to       institute an inter partes review under this section.                    JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gannon, would you       look at the reply brief at page , and they give a            series of rulings that the Board might make that, under          your view, would be immune from any judicial review.                        So the Board goes ahead and institutes an     IPR, even though the requester for that IPR has already          filed a parallel civil action, something that the         statute says should not happen. That would not be          reviewable, that wrong decision, under your view of it.         Is that ­­              MR. GANNON: We ­­ we think that they would          not be subject to an appeal. The court of appeals here            left open the possibility of mandamus, and we understand         why it did that. Because the phrase here is          "nonappealable," that doesn't necessarily rule out       mandamus.             We don't think that it would make sense to         have mandamus only at the end of the proceeding. We           think that if mandamus were to happen, it should be the           way it would normally happen, at the time when the error           ­­ the alleged error occurs, but it would be only          reserved for extraordinary circumstances.                The ­­ the party would go immediately to the         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Federal circuit and say, we have a clear and          indisputable entitlement to relief here because the       agency is violating the statutes. That's something        where there'd be expedited briefing, where the P tab          would not have invested all the resources into getting         to a decision on the merits before a court pulled it             back and said, you never should have gotten there.                       So we do think that there may be      circumstances that satisfy mandamus where there could be        review of the Board's departure from statutory criteria,        but what Congress has spoken to here and made         nonappealable is the decision whether to institute       proceedings under the section. That's not just a         determination of whether there's a reasonable likelihood        under Subsection A, it's everything. And that section         includes references to , to . It has at a           reference to a decision under this chapter.                    And so all of that, we think, is included in          the scope of the appeal bar, and that distinguishes it          from a case like Mach Mining where the presumption          against reviewability had not been overcome ­­ or the         presumption of favor of reviewability had not been        overcome. Here, Congress here clearly spoke to that.                     JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a question           that relates to the other ­­ other issue?        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             The district court holds that a patent is         valid. Could the ­­ the PTO, on its own initiative,           then engage not in the inter partes review, but         reexamination? The district court says valid patent,        and PTO says, we want to, on our own, have a           reexamination.             MR. GANNON: Yes. The reexamination can be         instituted by the director at ­­ at her own discretion          or ­­ or by other persons. And in that proceeding, the            patentholder would be able to make any necessary        proposed amendments that it wanted to make under ,         but the ­­ the PTO wouldn't necessarily approve those         amendments. It's not going to be an unfettered right to           amend.             JUSTICE GINSBURG: So ­­ and so it wouldn't         ­­ so the district court decision wouldn't be        preclusive, and the ­­ the PTO has the last word, then?                       MR. GANNON: With respect to the ex parte         proceeding, yes.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that an appeal        from the district court judgment to an administrative        agency?             MR. GANNON: It ­­ it's not an appeal from          the district court judgment. It's a separate proceeding          before the agency that has ongoing authority to        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review reexamine the validity of patents that has been        issued ­­ that it has issued. That's the statutory          framework since .               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So ­­ so the        district court reaches a judgment saying, you win based          on my reading of the patent, and then you can go to the             PTO and say, no, the reading of the patent of the           district court was wrong, so you lose?                   MR. GANNON: Well, my understanding of       Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical was that the ­­ the        director of the PTO could institute the reexamination        proceeding in ­­ in light of issues that were revealed          for the time in the district court proceeding.                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then can the        losing party in the district court go back to the          district court, or if it's on appeal, to the court of           appeals, and say the district court was wrong? The PTO           said that, and I should win.                   MR. GANNON: They ­­ they could say that.         If they already have a final judgment, then that's not           going to be an issue. And depending on if the patent            has not actually been invalidated, then ­­ then they're         going to still be using the district court claim         construction in the judicial litigation.                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             Mr. Beeney, you have a minute left.                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARRARD R. BEENEY                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                             MR. BEENEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.        Let me just begin by saying that as with the          government's brief, we heard nothing today that suggests        that the use of the ordinary­claim construction would        not accomplish Congress's purpose. But what we would         avoid is all of the bizarre harms that are caused by the            use of the broadest­reasonable­interpretation expedient.     We have different results, demonstrable different      results, as the Chief Justice pointed out. Many of the           cases are cited in our brief where a patent is upheld in             the district court and then invalidated by the Board.                     That wouldn't happen if we used the same        claim construction as Congress intended by having a        court­like system. We wouldn't be depriving patent        owners of their property rights based on pretending the         patent means something that it doesn't mean. Patent         rights should be taken away only if the patent that's          claimed, that was granted, and that was issued is         unpatentable.             And that, Justice Kennedy, is why we       shouldn't have speculation in IPR. They're property        rights, and they should be treated as to what those          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review properties rights encompass.               Putting together the government's position,     the government says BRI is, quote, "an examinational        expedient" used, quote, "before the patent issues" in,        quote, "an iterative process," quote, "to provide       clarity and precision in claims."        That is not IPR.    The government ­­ the Congress in enacting IPR got rid          of that examinational. They got rid of it.                     Thank you very much.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   The case is submitted.                (Whereupon, at : p.m.,
