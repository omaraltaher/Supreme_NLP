ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE E. JOHNSON


            8                   

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


            9              

MR. JOHNSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


           10    

the Court:


           11              

35 U.S.C., section 101 is set out at page 19a in


           12    

the appendix of the blue brief. 


           13              

The patents in this case that have been issued


           14    

on plant varieties under section 101 of title 35 are


           15    

invalid.  They're invalid because Congress has enacted a


           16    

specific statutory scheme that it crafted to govern


           17    

Federal statutory protection over this particular type of


           18    

living thing, plant varieties. 


           19              

The enactment of Congress by this specific


           20    

statutory scheme that it designed to provide the Federal


           21    

right to exclude others from reproducing plant varieties


           22    

evidences Congress' intent that it plant-specific Federal


           23    

statutory scheme is intended to provide the exclusive


           24    

Federal statutory means of excluding others from


           25    

reproducing plant varieties.

            1              

QUESTION:  The rights conferred by the statute


            2    

you're referring to are somewhat different than the patent


            3    

statute, aren't they? 


            4              

MR. JOHNSON:  I do not -- no, that is not


            5    

correct, Mr. Chief Justice.  The right that the patents


            6    

claim in this case, the plant patent -- or the 101 patents


            7    

claim in this -- in this case, is the right to exclude


            8    

others from sexually multiplying the corn plant varieties


            9    

in this case or to use or sell corn plant varieties that


           10    

have been developed by sexual multiplication and -- and


           11    

produced by sexual multiplication.  So, without using


           12    

these patents to exclude others from the right of sexually


           13    

multiplying these corn plants, the patent rights contended


           14    

for in this case would be of no value whatsoever.


           15              

QUESTION:  But I -- I had understood from the


           16    

briefs that the rights conferred under the Plant Act are


           17    

different in some respects from that under the general


           18    

patent section.  Am I wrong in that? 


           19              

MR. JOHNSON:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.


           20              

The attribute that is protected under the plant-


           21    

specific acts is under the Plant Right of Protection Act


           22    

of 1970, the right to exclude others from sexually


           23    

multiplying that plant. 


           24              

Now, this -- the statute is designed for


           25    

particular types of plants that require the ability to

            1    

sexually reproduce on a large scale in order to be


            2    

commercially valuable, and these are plants that are only


            3    

valuable if they can be produced commercially by seed.


            4              

Now, the -- the corn plants at issue in this


            5    

case -- the patents seek to protect the same utilitarian


            6    

feature or attribute of these corn plants, and that is the


            7    

right to sexually multiply -- exclude others from sexually


            8    

multiplying these corn plants. 


            9              

QUESTION:  Let me ask you a specific question. 


           10    

Under the PVP, can a farmer who buys the -- raises a crop


           11    

one year save seed to use for himself the next year?  If


           12    

that's the only protection that the -- that the developer


           13    

has is under the PVP, can the farmer do that?


           14              

MR. JOHNSON:  Yes, Mr. Justice Souter. 


           15              

QUESTION:  All right.  Can the farmer do that if


           16    

the protection is under section 101?


           17              

MR. JOHNSON:  No, Mr. Justice.


           18              

QUESTION:  Then isn't the answer to the Chief


           19    

Justice's question yes, there is a difference in the


           20    

rights which are conveyed by 101 and by a PVP license,


           21    

respectively?


           22              

MR. JOHNSON:  Yes, Justice Souter. 


           23              

QUESTION:  Well, then why didn't you answer me


           24    

that way in the first place? 


           25              

MR. JOHNSON:  I -- Mr. Chief Justice, because I

            1    

misapprehended the nature of the question and I thought


            2    

that you were asking about the attributes -- the


            3    

attributes protected. 


            4              

And yes, the rights that are contended for under


            5    

the patent would be rights that do not -- that do not


            6    

include the exceptions that Congress has specifically


            7    

legislated in the Plant Variety Protection Act, one of


            8    

which would be the seed saving exemption, which was


            9    

reaffirmed in the '94 amendments.


           10              

And another crucial exception is the research


           11    

exception because by the -- the use of patents, the free


           12    

exchange of plant genetic material which had occurred


           13    

prior to the use of patents, is prohibited by patents


           14    

because the seed companies now contend that under the


           15    

patent statute, since there's no research exemption, then


           16    

they can lock up the genes of the plant varieties on which


           17    

they have obtained patents.


           18              

Those are two important distinctions between the


           19    

rights conferred. 


           20              

Now, section 2541 -- section 2402 of the Plant


           21    

Variety Protection Act --


           22              

QUESTION:  Before you go on, has any court ever


           23    

held that it would be patent infringement for the farmer


           24    

to save the seeds?


           25              

MR. JOHNSON:  Yes, Your Honor.  There are many

            1    

suits in litigation now where district courts have held in


            2    

a judgment against farmers for saving seed that are


            3    

subject to patents.  And this is -- this is even true in


            4    

cases of -- for example, one of the amici in this case,


            5    

Delta and Pine Land Company --


            6              

QUESTION:  These are cases in the district


            7    

courts.  How about courts of appeals?


            8              

MR. JOHNSON:  I do not believe that -- that I


            9    

know of -- that a seed saving case has reached a court of


           10    

appeal -- a court of appeal yet.


           11              

QUESTION:  Does the PTO have a position on it?


           12              

MR. JOHNSON:  The Government is arguing as an


           13    

amici for Pioneer, for the -- for the appellee in this


           14    

case.


           15              

QUESTION:  Yes, but this case doesn't focus on


           16    

the saving seed exception. 


           17              

But in distinguishing the utility patent from a


           18    

PVP certificate, or whatever it is, you have pointed out


           19    

that the utility patent is more beneficial to the patent


           20    

holder because the farmer can't even use the descendants


           21    

of the first seeds to plant again.  So that -- that's --


           22    

and I asked you if the -- that -- that was the position,


           23    

that that's the interpretation of the utility patent, that


           24    

is the interpretation of the PTO.  And I think you said


           25    

yes.

            1              

MR. JOHNSON:  I have not seen anything on that


            2    

position -- that position, one way or another, from the


            3    

PTO.


            4              

QUESTION:  As far as the -- the issue that is


            5    

before us, we do have a position of the PTO and of the


            6    

Federal circuit, both having more expertise than the rest


            7    

of the Federal court we're on in these questions.  Don't


            8    

we owe those decision makers some deference?


            9              

MR. JOHNSON:  Justice Ginsburg, I believe that


           10    

this case is a case of statutory construction.  With


           11    

regard to the Chevron deference to the PTO, the Congress


           12    

has specifically legislated on the precise issue that the


           13    

PTO has decided, that is, the issue of whether or not it


           14    

has authority under section 101 to grant patent -- utility


           15    

patents on plant varieties.  Congress has specifically


           16    

addressed this issue on three different occasions


           17    

historically and ruled on it.  And I do not believe that


           18    

Chevron deference is -- can be accorded to an agency when


           19    

Congress has specifically legislated. 


           20              

Further, we are --


           21              

QUESTION:  Where has Congress said you can't get


           22    

a utility patent on a plant?  Congress has set up two


           23    

other protective regimes that are different from the


           24    

utility patent.  But where has it ever says -- said these


           25    

exclude a patent?

MR. JOHNSON:  It has explicitly stated this in


            2    

legislative acts on two occasions.  In 1930, when it


            3    

enacted the Townsend-Purnell Plant Patent Act, it amended


            4    

section 4886 of revised statutes by adding to it language


            5    

allowing --


            6              

QUESTION:  Because it thought, at least in part


            7    

-- it thought that a plant couldn't qualify for a utility


            8    

patent.  So, it wanted to have something.  Science has


            9    

advanced.  This Court acknowledged that you could get a


           10    

utility patent for whatever was the bacteria that was in


           11    

the Chakrabarty case.


           12              

MR. JOHNSON:  Let me go back, if I may, for a


           13    

moment, and I'll answer your question on Chakrabarty.


           14              

In 1930, Congress placed -- or added to section


           15    

4884 of revised statutes the limitation on the -- that it


           16    

was -- the right was limited to asexual reproduction --


           17    

excluding others from asexually reproducing the plant. 


           18    

But it is important to note -- and this is set out at


           19    

cert. app., page -- appendix 42. 


           20              

You will also see section -- I think it's 4888


           21    

of revised statutes.  And in that section, Congress in


           22    

1930 inserted the -- or put in the provision that relaxed


           23    

the written description requirement.  Now, if --


           24

QUESTION:  Page 42 of the --


            3              

MR. JOHNSON:  Page 42. 


            4              

QUESTION:  And which of the sections that are


            5    

cited there are you referring to?


            6              

MR. JOHNSON:  Just a moment here.  Section 4888. 


            7    

It put in the relaxed written description requirement. 


            8              

Now, there were two reasons why, as Justice


            9    

Ginsburg points out, there was some historic -- there was


           10    

some historic feeling against patents on plants.  It was a


           11    

living thing, a product of nature doctrine, written


           12    

description.  It relaxed the written description in 4888.


           13              

If the language that Thomas Jefferson penned in


           14    

1793, which is the definitional language for utility


           15    

patents -- and he was a plant breeder, knew what plants


           16    

were -- if that language already subsumed plants, then the


           17    

only thing that Congress needed to do in 1930 was to add


           18    

section 4888. 


           19              

And if it decided that it wanted to somehow --


           20    

if -- if the language that -- that Thomas Jefferson penned


           21    

included plants in 1930 and it included sexual


           22    

multiplication of plants and they wanted to limit it, then


           23    

they could have just put in the asexual limitation.  But


           24    

what they did is, they put in all three sections in 1930


           25    

because it was their intent to expand the definitional

            1    

limits of section 4886, which was the definitional


            2    

language that Thomas Jefferson originally wrote.


            3              

QUESTION:  Well, in other words, there's the


            4    

scheme established in 1930 and it is both more inclusive


            5    

than a 101 patent, and it gives you fewer rights.  But


            6    

that isn't -- doesn't mean, to track Justice Ginsburg's


            7    

initial question, that this is an explicit prohibition on


            8    

issuing a patent under 101. 


            9              

MR. JOHNSON:  We have to give meaning to what


           10    

Congress did in 1930.  It did not --


           11              

QUESTION:  If you want to say if -- that we


           12    

should infer it, fine.  That's your argument, but it's not


           13    

an explicit prohibition.


           14              

MR. JOHNSON:  In 1950, in the revision of the


           15    

Patent Act, Congress dissembled section 4886 and placed


           16    

the plant patent language from 4886 in a separate chapter,


           17    

and kept the Thomas Jefferson language in -- and placed


           18    

that in section 101.  And the other language from 486 and


           19    

488 -- or 4888 and 4884 were also placed in chapter 15, a


           20    

separate plant-specific act.


           21              

Now, if the language -- if the definitional


           22    

language of 101, the other definitional language, subsumed


           23    

plants, there would be no reason to -- to take that


           24    

legislative action. 


           25              

QUESTION:  Then why -- why shouldn't Chakrabarty

            1    

have come out the other way?  Because Chakrabarty involved


            2    

a plant.  It involved, I guess, an asexually reducing


            3    

plant.  I don't think bacteria reproduce sexually.  And it


            4    

seems to me on your reasoning, the Court in Chakrabarty


            5    

should have said this is the paradigm example of what was


            6    

covered by the -- or what is covered by the PPA and


            7    

therefore it shouldn't fall under 101.  And the Court went


            8    

the other way.  So, explain to me why -- why Chakrabarty


            9    

is not a problem for you.


           10              

MR. JOHNSON:  What the Court did in Chakrabarty


           11    

was affirm Judge Giles Rich's footnote 25 in the


           12    

underlying circuit court case, Application of Bergy.  In


           13    

Chakrabarty, the patented item was an oil-eating bacteria. 


           14    

Now, the Court discusses in Chakrabarty.  Nobody knows


           15    

exactly why, but bacteria are specifically excluded from


           16    

the Plant Variety Protection Act.


           17              

QUESTION:  They're -- they're -- yes, the PVP


           18    

but they're not expressly -- I guess the -- the PPA


           19    

doesn't say anything about them one way or the other.  It


           20    

simply remains the case that under the PPA, this is a --


           21    

the PPA deals with a -- with a plant insofar as it is a


           22    

non-sexually reproducing or a non-sexually reproduced --


           23    

and I think that's the -- the fact that the Court had


           24    

before it in Chakrabarty.


           25              

MR. JOHNSON:  Well, in Chakrabarty, Justice

            1    

Souter, the dissent argued that the existence of the


            2    

plant-specific acts evidenced Congress' intent that no


            3    

living thing could be subject to a 101 patent.  The


            4    

majority, 5 to 4, the tie-breaking vote said, that's not


            5    

true.  It -- it doesn't mean that the mere fact that


            6    

something is living denies that item potential or possible


            7    

section 101 -- a section 101 patent.  And it -- it


            8    

discussed these plant-specific acts. 


            9              

Then in the last paragraph of Chakrabarty, it


           10    

tells us the two ways in which Congress can evidence its


           11    

intent to exclude a specific type of living thing from


           12    

section 101 coverage.  It says, one, it can just -- it


           13    

could explicitly do -- it can explicitly state that carve-


           14    

out, and it used the carve-out of patenting of materials


           15    

that could be employed in nuclear weapons as an example of


           16    

a specific carve-out. 


           17              

And then it said secondly it can craft a


           18    

specific statute designed to provide protection for a


           19    

particular type of living organism.  And in that -- in


           20    

this case, that -- in the case of the PVP and the PPA,


           21    

that is plant varieties.


           22              

And Justice Rich stated this explicitly in the


           23    

underlying opinion, Application of Bergy, which the


           24    

Chakrabarty Court, of course, read and -- and was aware of


           25    

when it wrote this paragraph.  Justice -- or Judge Giles

quoted this -- this piece of legislative history where the


            2    

Senator said, anything under the sun that is made by man. 


            3    

It is this piece of legislative history that Pioneer's


            4    

case is built upon.  That's the foundation. 


            5              

QUESTION:  No, but could we go back, though, to


            6    

the facts of -- of Chakrabarty?  Because the problem that


            7    

I -- I have is it seems to me that on -- on just the


            8    

authorities that you're speaking of, Chakrabarty probably


            9    

should have come out the other way because you had a


           10    

specific statute, the PPA, which covered this asexually


           11    

reproducing plant, a bacterium, and yet the Court did not


           12    

say that the coverage of 101 was thereby defeated.  And --


           13    

and maybe I'm missing something.  I don't understand why,


           14    

on your theory, it shouldn't have come out the other way.


           15              

MR. JOHNSON:  I don't believe that the


           16    

Chakrabarty Court viewed the bacterium as a plant.


           17              

QUESTION:  Well, what else could it view it as? 


           18    

I mean, I --


           19              

MR. JOHNSON:  They spoke --


           20              

QUESTION:  I went to the dictionary.  I -- I


           21    

wasn't sure myself, and I went to the dictionary, and the


           22    

dictionary says it's a plant.


           23              

MR. JOHNSON:  I -- the Chakrabarty Court spoke


           24    

of it as a microorganism.


           25              

QUESTION:  Which is a generic term.

MR. JOHNSON:  And the -- as -- as I read


            2    

Chakrabarty, their discussion of the PVPA and their


            3    

discussion of the PPA was for the purposes of explaining


            4    

historically how they evolved and to disassemble the


            5    

dissent's argument that those two -- that those two


            6    

specific acts meant you couldn't patent any living thing. 


            7    

I do not think --


            8              

QUESTION:  Well, I don't want to prolong this.


            9              

MR. JOHNSON:  Yes. 


           10              

QUESTION:  But I take it then on -- on your


           11    

position, if we assume that the bacterium is a plant and


           12    

it asexually reproduces, the decision in Chakrabarty


           13    

should have been that it's covered by the PPA and there's


           14    

no 101 patent.


           15              

MR. JOHNSON:  If it would -- if it would be a


           16    

plant variety and if reproducing by dividing, which is not


           17    

sexual -- it's certainly not sexual multiplication as --


           18    

as plants do it, then that would be -- then the decision


           19    

should have been that it could have qualified for a PPA


           20    

patent.


           21              

QUESTION:  And therefore, it couldn't qualify


           22    

for a 101.  Right?


           23              

MR. JOHNSON:  Yes.  It would not -- well --

            2    

it is alive.


            3              

QUESTION:  No, but it would be blocked by the


            4    

fact, on your reasoning, that it was covered by PPA.


            5              

MR. JOHNSON:  Yes.


            6              

QUESTION:  Okay. 


            7              

QUESTION:  But is -- has anybody ever held it


            8    

was a -- a bacterium is a plant?  I mean --


            9              

MR. JOHNSON:  I have not --


           10              

QUESTION:  -- did any court ever say that or the


           11    

Patent Office or somebody?


           12              

MR. JOHNSON:  I have never seen anything, you


           13    

know, of that.


           14              

QUESTION:  So, the dictionary --


           15              

QUESTION:  My -- my dictionary holds that. 


           16              

(Laughter.) 


           17              

QUESTION:  Maybe when Chakrabarty was decided


           18    

people didn't look so carefully at dictionaries as they do


           19    

now. 


           20              

(Laughter.) 


           21              

QUESTION:  Because certainly the opinion doesn't


           22    

say this, does it?  The opinion doesn't call the bacteria


           23    

a plant.


           24              

MR. JOHNSON:  I certainly didn't -- it took

pains to point out that -- well, it said one of the

            1    

reasons why the PVPA may have exclusive -- or explicitly


            2    

excluded it was because it may have felt that it wasn't a


            3    

plant.  I think there was some case somewhere that they


            4    

cited that had alluded to that. 


            5              

QUESTION:  Mr. Johnson, there's one piece of


            6    

this case that's somewhat disturbing in that -- in that am


            7    

I right in thinking that it is relatively harder to get a


            8    

utility patent, that you have to convince the PTO and you


            9    

have to have more documentation and involve yourself with


           10    

a lawyer's fee -- much harder to get a 101 registration


           11    

than it is to get a certificate under the PVPA?


           12              

MR. JOHNSON:  Well, I saw a lot of that in amici


           13    

briefs, but there's not a scintilla of evidence on it in


           14    

the record. 


           15              

QUESTION:  But are you --


           16              

MR. JOHNSON:  I think the --


           17              

QUESTION:  Are you suggesting that -- let's take


           18    

this case -- that this particular item could not have


           19    

qualified, maybe it wouldn't qualify for a PVPA


           20    

certificate?


           21              

MR. JOHNSON:  Every -- all 17 corn plant


           22    

varieties that are the subjects of the patents that we


           23    

have challenged in this case also applied for and obtained


           24    

Plant Variety Protection certificates. 


           25              

QUESTION:  Oh, so they do have both.  They do

            2              

MR. JOHNSON:  In this case, they do have both,


            3    

and there's --


            4              

QUESTION:  And I thought that the infringing


            5    

action here would infringe a PVP certificate as well.  I


            6    

thought your position was -- was -- and I must be wrong


            7    

about that -- that -- that you would be an infringer if


            8    

they had a 101 patent.


            9              

MR. JOHNSON:  First --


           10              

QUESTION:  But they don't have a 101 patent, so


           11    

they have nothing. 


           12              

MR. JOHNSON:  Right.  We weren't sued under the

PVP Act.  We were sued under the Patent Act, number one.


           14              

Number two, we never sexually multiplied the


           15    

seed nor did we engage in any act which involves further


           16    

multiplication or propagation of the plant.  And under the


           17    

Plant Variety --


           18              

QUESTION:  So, you're telling me they did have


           19    

the dual protection, but either they chose not to charge


           20    

you with -- with infringing on the PVP protection or you


           21    

didn't do anything that would infringe that protection.


           22              

MR. JOHNSON:  We -- we didn't do anything to


           23    

infringe it.  The -- the section 2541(d) is set out at


           24    

page 18 of the appendix of the blue brief.  And it says


           25    

that any of the above acts -- and all the other acts that

            1    

are listed as infringement, which would include selling --


            2    

are not infringements unless they involve further


            3    

propagation of the protected variety.


            4              

The reason that that provision is in there is


            5    

because in 1970, the brokerage business in seed corn and


            6    

cotton seed, soybean seed was already a thriving business. 


            7    

It was not the intent of Congress to inject itself into


            8    

marketing situations that are governed by State law or by


            9    

the Federal Seed Act.  It had one thing in mind and that


           10    

was to regulate the right to exclude others from sexually


           11    

multiplying plant varieties.  It wasn't in the market of


           12    

suing people who just bought the bagged seed, didn't do


           13    

anything with it, sold it to farmers who just planted that


           14    

seed and took it to the elevator. 


           15              

So, it's not a PVP violation, number one, and


           16    

number two, we weren't sued under the Plant Variety


           17    

Protection Act anyway.  We were sued under the Patent Act. 


           18    

It was the act of choice.


           19              

Now, the 1970 Plant Variety Protection Act


           20    

provides at section 2581 that the purpose of the act is to


           21    

provide adequate encouragement for research.  Congress --


           22    

the presidential commission was convened in 1965 to decide


           23    

what sort of protection should we give to sexually


           24    

reproducing plants.  '68 the Senate Patent Subcommittee


           25    

had hearings on amending title 35.  There was -- there

            1    

were objections.  It took no further action. 


            2              

Hearings continued in the Agriculture


            3    

Department, and this 1970 PVP Act came out to -- to


            4    

provide adequate protection to encourage research.  That


            5    

was Congress' intent in crafting this statute.  They set


            6    

up a separate agency.  They set up a separate board with


            7    

mandated representation of affected political interests,


            8    

including farmers, including the public sector, including


            9    

researchers.  They set up the seed saving exemption, the


           10    

research exemption. 


           11              

Now, if -- if the argument is accepted that,


           12    

well, the reason that Congress did this was because they


           13    

misapprehended the ability to -- of technology to advance


           14    

and make it easier to, say, identify or describe a plant


           15    

variety or because of some other technological advance,


           16    

well, if -- that is simply saying that the intent of


           17    

Congress in 1970 was based on a mistaken apprehension or


           18    

something that's proved mistaken today. 


           19              

But to take that position assumes that if


           20    

Congress had apprehended correctly, as Pioneer's amici


           21    

said they should have, then that Congress would have


           22    

simply adopted section 101 without the special agency,


           23    

which -- without the board, which is -- which has to have


           24    

representatives of experts from the various varieties,


           25    

without seed saving, without research, without all of the

            1    

distinctions that it specifically intentionally enacted in


            2    

the Plant Variety Protection Act, and that is too great a


            3    

leap for us to take in my -- in a judicial setting.


            4              

It's a political question.  It's a question for


            5    

Congress to answer and Congress has answered it. 


            6    

Everything that went into the crafting of the Plant


            7    

Variety Protection Act was the result of politics.


            8              

And that is if -- if in some fashion, which I


            9    

see a lot -- a lot of the -- of Pioneer's and its amici's


           10    

argument points out that, well, it now looks like its a


           11    

better idea to have patent protection than Plant Variety


           12    

Protection Act protection.  Well, that is an argument to


           13    

be made in the -- on the Hill to the Congress where they


           14    

have the resources to examine all of this evidence that


           15    

has been put before this Court in the amici briefs that is


           16    

not in the record in this case.


           17              

As far as the ease -- the record -- the evidence


           18    

that's in the record in this case is that it's harder to


           19    

get a Plant Variety Protection certificate because there


           20    

was the corn hybrids that were patented in this case.  The


           21    

inbred parents were not deposited, only the hybrid seed. 


           22    

The hybrid seed, when you plant it, you get all different


           23    

types of plants.  You cannot recreate the hybrid without


           24    

having the inbred parents' deposit.  The PVP requires


           25    

deposit of the inbred seed.

            1              

The PVP requires that you give the breeding


            2    

history.  There's no requirement of that for the patent. 


            3              

The PVP allows the research exemption.  Why is


            4    

that important?  Because of this.  The DNA in plants is a


            5    

storehouse of knowledge, a storehouse of genetic


            6    

knowledge.  The RNA conveys that message and the message


            7    

is manifested in the characteristics of the offspring of


            8    

the plant.  Only when you have -- when a plant breeder has


            9    

the opportunity to actually grow the plant, observe it,


           10    

cross it, observe and test the offspring can the plant


           11    

breeder obtain the knowledge that is in the ostensibly


           12    

patented plant.  And without that -- without that


           13    

opportunity, then the full disclosure that supposedly is


           14    

made under the Patent Act when they patent plant varieties


           15    

is not -- is not made. 


           16              

And it is -- it is an extremely important matter


           17    

that the Plant Variety Protection Act guarantees to the


           18    

public, and that is the free use and transmission of


           19    

genetic material, which patents are being used to stop. 


           20    

There's been, as you know, a extreme consolidation of the


           21    

agricultural industry, and the switch to patents and the


           22    

locking up of plant germ plasm is a key impetus in that


           23    

consolidation.


           24              

If there are no further questions, I'll reserve


           25    

the rest of my time.

QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Johnson. 


            2              

Mr. Sease, we'll hear from you.


            3                 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDMUND J. SEASE


            4                    

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


            5              

MR. SEASE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


            6    

may it please the Court:


            7              

In response to my colleague's representation


            8    

that Pioneer's sole case here rests upon a snippet of


            9    

statement in the legislative history of the '52 act,


           10    

quoted in Chakrabarty where the Court said, machined or


           11    

manufactured can include anything under the sun made by


           12    

man, we do, of course, rely on that piece of legislative


           13    

history, as did Chakrabarty. 


           14              

But our case rests not upon that.  Our case


           15    

rests upon 35 U.S.C., section 101, which is in the regular


           16    

patent statute that says, and the plain meaning of those


           17    

words, as confirmed in Chakrabarty, that the corn plants


           18    

that are patented here are either articles of manufacture


           19    

or compositions of matter.  Or the fact of the matter is,


           20    

under the definitions cited with approval in Chakrabarty,


           21    

they're both because these categories of statutory subject


           22    

matter, under section 101 -- that is, they are sort of a


           23    

gatekeeper.  You got to pass through that gate to go on to


           24    

the next criteria of whether you are new, useful, or


           25    

nonobvious and can get a patent.

            1              

QUESTION:  Well, I -- I suppose their point was


            2    

that in many statutes, if A, B, and C are covered and C is


            3    

then removed, we make the inference that C is not intended


            4    

to be covered any longer.  But in this case, the under the


            5    

sun language shows that they are such expansive terms in


            6    

101, that perhaps we don't apply that usual rule and that


            7    

you would prevail because of the terms being so general


            8    

and so universal in their -- in their coverage.


            9              

MR. SEASE:  Justice Kennedy --


           10              

QUESTION:  I take it that's your position. 


           11              

MR. SEASE:  They -- that is our position.  They


           12    

need to be general because the patent law needs to fit


           13    

ever-changing circumstances because today's science


           14    

fiction is tomorrow's science, and we are not in a


           15    

position to foresee what tomorrow's inventions will be. 


           16    

And so, from 1793 till now, the statute has been crafted


           17    

and interpreted broadly.  And the -- the terms, indeed,


           18    

have been construed to overlap.  And so, the categories


           19    

that are expressed there are not necessarily exclusive --


           20              

QUESTION:  May I --


           21              

MR. SEASE:  -- something to fit one or more.


           22              

QUESTION:  I didn't mean to interrupt you. 


           23              

Will you comment?  Would you go on from what


           24    

you're saying to comment on -- on a point that Mr. Johnson


           25    

made a moment ago?  As I understand it, the -- the outline

            1    

of the argument is even though the language in 101 is


            2    

indeed just as broad as -- as you say and even though


            3    

Chakrabarty said living things aren't excluded, the


            4    

existence of -- of a separate statute dealing with the


            5    

same subject matter may be taken as -- as an implied


            6    

repeal to some extent if there's a conflict. 


            7              

And one argument for saying that there is no


            8    

conflict here, as I understand it, is the argument that


            9    

what is set up by section 101 on the one hand and the two


           10    

separate plant statutes on the other are really two


           11    

separate regimes.  It's harder to get a 101 patent, so you


           12    

get more protection.  It's easier to get a -- we'll say, a


           13    

PVP certificate, so you get less protection.  And


           14    

therefore, you shouldn't see them as -- as conflicting. 


           15    

You should see them as kind of hierarchical and the -- the


           16    

applicant can choose what he wants. 


           17              

Mr. Johnson says, as I understood him a minute


           18    

ago, that that's not a sound argument because in fact he


           19    

says it's more difficult to get a PVP certificate than it


           20    

is to get a -- a 101 patent.  And he -- he mentioned a


           21    

couple of things that you have to do that you might not


           22    

have to do under 101. 


           23              

Would you comment on -- on that -- that


           24    

difficulty point of his? 


           25              

MR. SEASE:  Yes.  With all due respect to my

            1    

colleague, I believe he's wrong.  The title 35 patents,


            2    

the regular utility patents, require novelty, usefulness,


            3    

and nonobviousness.  This Court defined how one determines


            4    

nonobviousness in Graham v. Deere in 1966, and it has been


            5    

universally applied by the Patent Office and by the courts


            6    

since that date.  And as a matter of fact, the patents


            7    

that we're sued on here, if you look in their file


            8    

histories, one would see that they were routinely rejected


            9    

for obviousness by the Patent Office, and that was the big


           10    

hurdle that had to be overcome before they could issue.


           11              

The Plant Patent Act requires asexual and


           12    

requires new, distinct, and probably also nonobviousness. 


           13    

The Patent Variety Protection Act requires new, distinct,


           14    

uniform, and stable.  There is no requirement whatsoever


           15    

akin to nonobviousness in the Plant Variety Protection


           16    

Act.  And it in fact, Your Honor, is almost a registration


           17    

system, very similar to like the copyright system where


           18    

you file, you fill out a form, and it's granted without


           19    

any kind of a rigorous examination as utility patents


           20    

undergo in the United States.  And our system, I might


           21    

add, is recognized as one of the stronger ones in the


           22    

world primarily because of our unobviousness requirement. 


           23              

QUESTION:  Is there any other situation in the


           24    

realm of intellectual property where you have this kind of


           25    

dual regime, where you have both the standard kind of

patents, then you have to the side of that a patent-like 


            2    

protection?


            3              

MR. SEASE:  Justice Ginsburg, the answer to that


            4    

is there's nothing like it in the patent world, but there


            5    

are analogous dual systems, if you will, in the


            6    

intellectual property world, whereas it's common, for


            7    

example, for the same tangible item to have both design


            8    

patent protection and to have copyright protection.  That


            9    

was looked at in the case of Mazer v. Stein.  It is common


           10    

for trade secret protection and patent protection to


           11    

peacefully coexist --


           12              

QUESTION:  You can have overlapping patents,


           13    

trade secrets.  But -- but this is kind of a specialized


           14    

patent.  It's called a plant patent.  That, you say, is


           15    

unique to plants. 


           16              

MR. SEASE:  I -- I think it is, Your Honor.


           17              

And the reason historically that it came about


           18    

that we have these three separate regimes that occur for


           19    

plants is that plant inventors, if you will, were being


           20    

discriminated against in that they were unable to comply


           21    

with the rigorous requirements of title 35 for a regular


           22    

utility patent not because there was any definitional


           23    

wrong in section 101, but because in application, the


           24    

Patent Office was routinely rejecting them -- and I'm


           25    

talking about prior to 1930 -- as products of nature, and

            1    

the inventors were unable to meet the written description


            2    

requirement necessary to get a patent, so important to a


            3    

patent because the written description requirement is how


            4    

the public benefits from the knowledge from the patent so


            5    

that they can use it to advance and build greater


            6    

knowledge.  And so, the Plant Patent Act of 1930 was


            7    

passed to allow some limited rights for asexually


            8    

reproduced plants, and the Plant Variety Protection Act of


            9    

1970 was passed to allow again some rights for sexually


           10    

produced plants. 


           11              

Now, this petitioner would turn those two acts


           12    

and their legislative history on their head and use them


           13    

to limit patent coverage when, in fact, they were passed


           14    

by Congress for the purpose of granting some coverage that


           15    

was like a patent in order to get over the two historical


           16    

hurdles of section 112, written description requirement,


           17    

and the so-called product of nature doctrine.


           18              

QUESTION:  Why is it --


           19              

QUESTION:  May I ask a question about -- about


           20    

this particular case?  Is it true, as Mr. Johnson told us,


           21    

that you have dual protection and that you sued only under


           22    

section 101, that all these 17 varieties also have Plant


           23    

Variety Protection certificates?


           24              

MR. SEASE:  Justice Ginsburg, I -- there is no


           25    

real record on that.  At the trial court, the complaint

            1    

was filed, the answer was filed, and then the motion for


            2    

summary judgment was filed, and that's where we are.


            3              

There was, however, a transcript at the trial


            4    

court where a Pioneer lawyer was asked by the judge if


            5    

Pioneer gets PVPA certificates routinely with respect to


            6    

matters that they also get utility patents, and I believe


            7    

the question was answered yes with respect to inbreds. 


            8    

But in this instance, there are hybrid patents as well,


            9    

that there are no corresponding PVPA certificates, and the


           10    

suit was filed on only the utility patents. 


           11              

QUESTION:  You -- consistently with your answer


           12    

to me a moment ago that the PVPA certificate is almost a


           13    

kind of registration mechanism, I -- I'm assuming that


           14    

therefore it probably doesn't take long to get it.


           15              

MR. SEASE:  They take much less time, yes,


           16    

through the Department of --


           17              

QUESTION:  So that you would -- if you -- let's


           18    

assume you filed for both.  You would -- if -- if you're


           19    

plant breeder, you would expect to get your certificate


           20    

rather quickly, and you'd expect to wait longer for the


           21    

101 process to wend its way.


           22              

MR. SEASE:  If at all you ever get through the


           23    

101 process.


           24              

QUESTION:  Yes. 


           25              

MR. SEASE:  One never knows, at the time you

make the invention, whether you are going to meet


            2    

successfully the higher standards of the Patent Utility


            3    

Act or not.  And so, I mean, the unique -- the truth is


            4    

that I think everybody in this world, not unique to just


            5    

this client -- they try for both and see what happens. 


            6    

Sometimes they are successful, sometimes they are not.


            7              

I -- I would like to --


            8              

QUESTION:  Well, wait.  On that particular


            9    

point, the only way in which it would seem to be of some


           10    

significance that the patent statute would be stricter 


           11    

is in respect to what you just said, nonobviousness.  And


           12    

-- and the other you could -- you have to show it's new. 


           13    

So, in the one, the more detailed one, you have to show


           14    

it's new, and in the patent one, you have to show it's new


           15    

and nonobvious.


           16              

MR. SEASE:  That's right. 


           17              

QUESTION:  All right.  That's a little bit of a


           18    

difference. 


           19              

MR. SEASE:  That's correct. 


           20              

QUESTION:  Fine. 


           21              

Now, what conceivable thought would have been


           22    

going through a Congressman's mind to enact the following? 


           23    

He says, okay, I see there's this difference here.  So, if


           24    

a seed is new, but obviously new, I'll let the farmers


           25    

save the seeds for next year, and I will let people do

            1    

research.  But if the seed is new and nonobviously new, I


            2    

won't let the farmers keep the seeds for next year, and I


            3    

won't let people do research. 


            4              

Now, in other words, what could anybody have


            5    

been thinking who would write that?  And on your theory,


            6    

that's what they must have been thinking.


            7              

MR. SEASE:  Your Honor, I -- I would disagree


            8    

with that, respectfully.  Under --


            9              

QUESTION:  But the question was not -- what was


           10    

the theory?  That isn't a question you could disagree with


           11    

or not disagree with. 


           12              

MR. SEASE:  The theory -- the theory was -- and


           13    

one must look at the statute, Your Honor.  The save seed


           14    

exemption and the research exemption under the Plant


           15    

Variety Protection Act are -- are not grants of rights to


           16    

anybody.  They are simply saying that by doing these,


           17    

these are not infringing acts under the Plant Variety


           18    

Protection Act.


           19              

QUESTION:  But you see -- let me show where I'm


           20    

coming from.  A property -- intellectual property involves


           21    

the following:  copyright, a tax on readers for producing


           22    

books; patent, a tax on users for the purpose of


           23    

encouraging invention.  Those are the wholesale statutes. 


           24    

Patent, copyright.  Sometimes Congress -- and quite often


           25    

-- says, the wholesale statutes, they're too wholesale.

            1    

We're going to go into this thing and retail.  Now, that's


            2    

what they did here, and they came up with a slightly


            3    

different kind of protection. 


            4              

So, having done that for whatever reason,


            5    

whether because of mistake or because of this or because


            6    

of that, they did it.  So, why should we assume they'd


            7    

like to go back to the wholesale statute, once having gone


            8    

through the work of written the retail and indeed created


            9    

special exemptions of importance that don't exist at


           10    

wholesale?


           11              

MR. SEASE:  Well, nothing in the Plant Variety


           12    

Protection Act or the Plant Patent Act or its legislative


           13    

history shows that Congress ever intended to take anything


           14    

out of section 101 that was already included in section


           15    

101, and that included these plants.  They were articles


           16    

of manufacture and they were compositions of matter.


           17              

QUESTION:  Well, they had before them, quoted in


           18    

your brief I think, Simon Rifkin's committee's report,


           19    

which says all provisions in the patent statute for plant


           20    

patents should be deleted and another form of protection


           21    

provided.  That was the President's commission's


           22    

recommendation.  And having received that recommendation,


           23    

they didn't follow it completely, but they did write some


           24    

things in detail.  So why, given that in front of them,


           25    

should we assume Congress wanted to go back to this

            1    

wholesale statute?


            2              

MR. SEASE:  Because if you were to say that the


            3    

passing of the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970


            4    

somehow is an implicit narrowing of 35 U.S.C., section 101


            5    

or an implicit exclusion of subject matter from that, you


            6    

need a far greater signal than just that. 


            7              

QUESTION:  You've got the principle in your


            8    

favor that repeals, by implication, are not favored.


            9              

MR. SEASE:  Yes. 


           10              

And the case law of this Court says that there


           11    

must be -- they must be plainly inconsistent in order to


           12    

have a repeal by implication.  And that is an important


           13    

standard, that plainly inconsistent, because Congress


           14    

needs to be able to rely on that in order to understand


           15    

the consequences of acts that they are -- they are


           16    

passing.


           17              

QUESTION:  So, what does the farmer do who wants


           18    

to save his seeds? 


           19              

MR. SEASE:  What the farmer does who wants to


           20    

save his seed is he can, indeed, save those seed if they


           21    

are protected under the Plant Variety Protection Act only,


           22    

but not if they are protected under the utility patent


           23    

statute.


           24              

QUESTION:  Well, he can get permission.  He can

pay for permission.

MR. SEASE:  He can pay for permission.  That's


            2    

correct.


            3              

QUESTION:  Is it your view -- nobody has really


            4    

talked about the infringement under the basic patent


            5    

statute, but if I was a farmer and I just bought the


            6    

seeds, you tell me it's a patented product and I plant the


            7    

seeds.  The next year I want to use the product of the --


            8    

that plant and save some of those seeds to plant the next


            9    

year.  That's an infringement?


           10              

MR. SEASE:  That's an infringement of the


           11    

utility patent. 


           12              

QUESTION:  Why is that an infringement?  Why


           13    

doesn't he just own -- own what he purchased? 


           14              

MR. SEASE:  He does own what he purchased but


           15    

only in the volume that he purchased.  He cannot self-


           16    

replicate that because the right to exclude --


           17              

QUESTION:  You're -- you're saying that -- that


           18    

the infringement -- it's not just an infringement of a


           19    

license agreement or anything like a contractual


           20    

undertaking, but the patent statute itself is sufficient


           21    

to make his saving seeds an infringement in your view.


           22              

MR. SEASE:  Under the utility patent statute


           23    

because the utility patent statute gives the right to


           24    

exclude others from making, using, or selling.


           25              

QUESTION:  But he's not -- but he's purchased

            2              

MR. SEASE:  He purchased -- he purchased one set


            3    

volume of the product.


            4              

QUESTION:  Correct. 


            5              

MR. SEASE:  The recreation of that by planting


            6    

and regrowth is a subsequent infringing act. 


            7              

QUESTION:  What is the best authority you have


            8    

for that proposition? 


            9              

MR. SEASE:  Pardon?


           10              

QUESTION:  Is there any case holding that, any


           11    

appellate court case holding that?


           12              

MR. SEASE:  There is no specific case in the


           13    

seed area that -- that I'm aware of that holds that, but


           14    

it -- it is sort of analogous to the repair/reconstruction


           15    

doctrine in the utility patent statute.


           16              

QUESTION:  It's not analogous to running a -- a


           17    

mimeograph machine and requiring the user to use your


           18    

paper.  It's not analogous to that. 


           19              

MR. SEASE:  It isn't. 


           20              

But one of the reasons why utility patent


           21    

protection is so critically important to people in this


           22    

industry is because that seeds are so easily copied by


           23    

self-replicating.  And so, if you can qualify for the


           24    

higher standard, you need to have that higher standard


           25    

because of the ease of replication.

And may I point out, Your Honor, we know --


            2              

QUESTION:  What -- what do they do with the


            3    

seeds?  They throw them in the river or what?


            4              

MR. SEASE:  What does who do?


            5              

QUESTION:  What -- do they throw -- have to


            6    

throw the seeds away or something? 


            7              

MR. SEASE:  Well, hybrid seed is only good --


            8    

and these patents are on hybrid seed, most of them -- is


            9    

only good for 1 year because you cannot take the seed from


           10    

a hybrid seed and then plant it and get the same plant


           11    

back.  That does not work with a hybrid.


           12              

QUESTION:  But for something that it does work


           13    

for, is -- is the answer but you can't use the descendants


           14    

of your original seed, so you have to throw them away?


           15              

MR. SEASE:  You can't use the descendants of


           16    

your original seed to plant a new crop.  You sell your


           17    

crop.


           18              

QUESTION:  Yes.  But what can -- what can you


           19    

use them for? 


           20              

MR. SEASE:  You -- you can use them for their


           21    

ordinary intended purpose which, for example, if the seed


           22    

is soybean, you -- you sell your crop at the end of the


           23    

year like a farmer does.  You buy more seed for the


           24    

following year.


           25              

QUESTION:  Yes, but the seeds that you would

            1    

otherwise have saved, the seeds that you would have saved


            2    

if -- if it were only plant variety protection, you can't


            3    

do anything with them.


            4              

MR. SEASE:  If there --


            5              

QUESTION:  As Justice Kennedy said, you just


            6    

have to throw them out?


            7              

MR. SEASE:  If -- if there is utility patent


            8    

coverage, you can't do anything with them unless you make


            9    

some sort of arrangement with the patent owner.


           10              

QUESTION:  You could put them out for the birds. 


           11    

Yes. 


           12              

(Laughter.) 


           13              

QUESTION:  Yes.  The one thing you can do is


           14    

sell them so some creature can eat them. 


           15              

MR. SEASE:  We are not operating in a vacuum


           16    

here about what Congress believes is correct, Your Honors,


           17    

and I would like to make that point.  In 1999 in an


           18    

amendment to section 119 of the patent statute, which


           19    

allows foreign inventors to take advantage of their


           20    

foreign filing date when they come here and file in the


           21    

United States, we passed an amendment under section 119(f)


           22    

that allowed foreign breeders, certificate holders,


           23    

analogous to these Plant Variety Protection Act


           24    

certificates, to use that filing date in their foreign


           25    

country to get utility patents when they come into the

            1    

United States.  So, Congress passed a law which is


            2    

implementing and enhancing the very thing that is


            3    

occurring here. 


            4              

And to make any doubt about that crystal clear,


            5    

in 1994, when there were amendments to the Patent Variety


            6    

Protection Act, Senator Kerrey set out the whole regime in


            7    

the legislative history of that modification that occurred


            8    

in 1994, explaining utility patents, explaining Plant


            9    

Variety Protection Act certificates, and explaining the


           10    

PPA, and noting the differences between them.  And he did


           11    

that on the floor of the Congress.  So, it is hardly news


           12    

to Congress that this is and has been occurring.


           13              

QUESTION:  Yes, but that's -- that's


           14    

inconsistent with the argument you make on the first half


           15    

of the case, that Congress' understanding of the -- of the


           16    

statute is irrelevant in light of our interpretation.  You


           17    

can't have it both ways. 


           18              

MR. SEASE:  Well, I don't say that Congress'


           19    

understanding of the statute is irrelevant.  I point out


           20    

that corn plants, which are the subject matter of these


           21    

patents, fall within the plain meaning of the terms of


           22    

section 101, and therefore are a patentable subject


           23    

matter.


           24              

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Sease. 


           25              

Mr. Wallace, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE


            2         

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


            3                   

IN SUPPORT OF THE RESPONDENT


            4              

MR. WALLACE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


            5    

may it please the Court:


            6              

In Diamond against Chakrabarty, the Plant Patent


            7    

Act and the Plant Variety Protection Act played a central


            8    

role in the debates between counsel and between the


            9    

Court's opinion and the dissenting opinions.  The Court in


           10    

Chakrabarty rejected the position of the Government and of


           11    

the dissenting Justices that those two statutes showed a


           12    

congressional understanding that living things are not


           13    

protectable under section 101 and could be protected only


           14    

insofar as that subject matter was covered in those two


           15    

statutes and to the extent to which it was covered.  The


           16    

Court, instead, adopted a -- a broad interpretation based


           17    

on the plain meaning of section 101 referring to the


           18    

anything under the sun quotation, but also said quite


           19    

specifically at page 313 of volume 447 that the relevant


           20    

distinction is not between living and inanimate things for


           21    

purposes of applying 101, but between products of nature,


           22    

whether living or not, and human-made inventions.  So,


           23    

there is no doubt that all categories of living things are


           24    

within the interpretation of 101 that the Court adopted.


           25              

And the anomaly of this case is that in

            1    

petitioners' contention, the Court is being asked to


            2    

disfavor, for purposes of applying section 101, and


            3    

indeed, to exclude from eligibility for section 101


            4    

protection the very subject matter for which Congress had


            5    

shown special solicitude and saw a particular need for


            6    

patent protection in these two acts at a time when it was


            7    

doubtful whether living things could get section 101


            8    

protection.


            9              

QUESTION:  Is there any -- anywhere have you


           10    

come across in your research any empirical estimate of how


           11    

many of the things that qualify under the two special acts


           12    

might also qualify under the Patent Act where you would


           13    

have to show it was nonobvious as well as new?  Is there


           14    

any guess?  Did anybody ever make -- you know, in the


           15    

Government have any idea on that? 


           16              

MR. WALLACE:  Well, we do -- I can't give you


           17    

any direct answer to that, but there -- there are certain


           18    

-- there have been more plant variety certificates issued


           19    

than there have been utility patents issued on plants. 


           20    

The --


           21              

QUESTION:  I noticed that there is a document


           22    

filed, which I got, that they referred to in the briefs. 


           23    

This is Mr. Rifkin's report that went to Congress, and it


           24    

makes the recommendation I've referred to:  no protection. 


           25    

Then it says backup documents will explain all the

reasons.  So, I've been trying to -- they're Government


            2    

reports.  I've been trying to find them.  I can't.  Does


            3    

anyone know where they are?  I'd like to read it, frankly.


            4              

MR. WALLACE:  We perhaps could provide some help


            5    

on that, but I cannot at the moment.  I'll see what we can


            6    

do on that -- on that question. 


            7              

As of September 30th of this year, the


            8    

Department of Agriculture had issued 5,022 plant variety


            9    

certificates, whereas, as we explain in our brief, there


           10    

have been a total of 1,800 utility patents issued for


           11    

plants or plant components such as seeds and the like.


           12              

The -- the PVPA protection, the Plant Variety


           13    

Protection Act, is only on the plant variety itself so


           14    

that the availability of patents on seeds and other plant


           15    

parts is available only under section 101. 


           16              

The court in Chakrabarty itself said that


           17    

nothing in the language or legislative history of the


           18    

Plant Variety Protection Act indicated any intention to


           19    

limit section 101 availability for patents when the


           20    

standards of section 101 are met.  And as a matter of


           21    

fact, the relevant committee report on the PVPA in 1970,


           22    

which we quote on page 22 in our brief in the middle of


           23    

the page, said quite specifically that that statute, the


           24    

PVPA, quote, does not alter protection currently available


           25    

within the patent system.  So, we see no incompatibility

between the two systems of protection. 


            2              

QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, can I ask you your view


            3    

on the question of whether a person who buys a patented


            4    

seed and plants it and then gets some seeds and saves them


            5    

and then replants them the following year, would he be an


            6    

infringer? 


            7              

MR. WALLACE:  That depends on the terms of the


            8    

license agreement.  That -- that is within the -- the


            9    

power of the patent holder to --


           10              

QUESTION:  Supposing the -- supposing the


           11    

license agreement is -- is silent on the matter, but


           12    

merely identifies it as a patented seed. 


           13              

MR. WALLACE:  Well, that -- to the -- you'd have


           14    

to interpret what the arrangement is and what has been


           15    

granted and what has been withheld.


           16              

QUESTION:  The arrangement is that the -- the


           17    

farmer bought some seeds knowing they were patented. 


           18    

That's the whole arrangement.  Would he be -- would he


           19    

violate the terms of the patent and infringe the patent if


           20    

he saved the seeds? 


           21              

MR. WALLACE:  If the -- if the plant could


           22    

reproduce the same seeds that are patented, he could not


           23    

make and use the patented seeds without permission from


           24    

the license holder. 


           25              

This license is not silent.  It appears on page

QUESTION:  Well, I know, but I'm not asking a


            3    

question about the license. 


            4              

MR. WALLACE:  Yes. 


            5              

QUESTION:  I'm asking a question about the law. 


            6              

MR. WALLACE:  Right, yes.  And the license says


            7    

-- I think this tells you something about the law.  The


            8    

license says it is granted solely to produce grain and/or


            9    

forage, which could include any seeds that are produced. 


           10    

For other licenses --


           11              

QUESTION:  Why is that not like a license to use


           12    

a patented mimeograph machine that's licensed only to use


           13    

with -- with the seller's paper?  Why isn't that the same


           14    

kind of thing? 


           15              

MR. WALLACE:  Well, because your crop can be


           16    

used as a means of producing patented seeds and


           17    

reproducing the patented plant product, and it becomes a


           18    

form of manufacturing of the patented item without the


           19    

patent holder's permission unless arrangements have been


           20    

made.

QUESTION:  I -- I can't think of a machine that

MR. WALLACE:  Well, plants are -- are different


            7    

in that Congress, while saying that nothing was intended


            8    

to limit section 101 availability, saw a special need to


            9    

assure that for plants there would be protections

available even when it was doubtful, whether for

microorganisms or animals, there would be.  We now have --

that's actually bothering me as much as the seeds.  They


           15    

wanted to be sure that people could do research, so they


           16    

create a special exemption.  And now your reading of the


           17    

patent law will wipe out what sounds like a very important


           18    

special exemption. 


           19              

MR. WALLACE:  The exemption is for purposes of


           20    

that act only.  When greater research and development,


           21    

greater disclosure, and higher standards for qualifying a


           22    

patent have been met, there has been more of a


           23    

contribution to public knowledge which, under our


           24    

intellectual property laws, justifies a greater exclusive


           25    

right for a limited period of time.

QUESTION:  Which is why I wanted to know the


            2    

empirical contours of that argument. 


            3              

MR. WALLACE:  And then the public benefits from


            4    

all of that.  It's -- ultimately these intellectual


            5    

property protections are for the benefit of the public.


            6              

QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, what would it take to


            7    

craft a statute specifically designed for such living


            8    

things?  When I read that sentence in Chakrabarty, I was a


            9    

little puzzled because I said, well, why isn't this PVPA a


           10    

statute specifically designed for such living things?


           11              

MR. WALLACE:  It is to the extent it goes, but


           12    

of course, it has a much less -- lower threshold of


           13    

qualifying for eligibility and a lesser standard of


           14    

protections.  The anomaly would be to say that the


           15    

microorganism and animal patents issued under section 101


           16    

should have rights that are not available for those who


           17    

invent plants when it was plants that Congress wanted to


           18    

give special assurance for in -- in enacting this


           19    

legislation at a time when it was thought that, either for


           20    

practical reasons or because of doubt about the


           21    

applicability of --

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Wallace.
