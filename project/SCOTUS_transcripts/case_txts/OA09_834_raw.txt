 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. KASTER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. KASTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

 When Kevin Kasten told his employer that the 

location of the time clocks was illegal and that if they 

were taken to the court they would lose, he filed any 

complaint within the meaning of the 215(a)(3) under the 

Fair Labor Standards Act, because filing includes an 

oral communication, because "any" means any, which 

includes formal or informal, written or unwritten 

communications.  And the words in the statute were 

designed to have a broad construction under section 2 of 

the statute 202 and under Mitchell v. DeMario and the 

21 

Tennessee Coal case. 

22

23 

24 

25

 I would like to begin with the Tennessee 

Coal case, Tennessee Coal v. Muscoda.  The Court 

interpreted "work" in a broad fashion to include the 

time in a mine when workers were moving from one place 

3

to another, not actually engaged in physical labor.

 In interpreting work that way, the Court 

said that the act is not to be interpreted in a narrow, 

grudging fashion.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me give you this 

example.  Suppose a company has an established policy 

that if you want to make a complaint, there's a 

particular supervisor you should go to.  And let's say 

they say you can make this complaint in writing, you can 

make it orally. 

 Now, there's -- something's going on in the 

workplace and the supervisor happens to be walking by, 

maybe a machine is broken, an employee has been hurt, 

and an employee walks up to the supervisor who is 

walking briskly by, taps the supervisor on the shoulder 

and says the company is violating the Fair Labor 

Standards Act because of the placement of a clock.  You 

said that filing has no formality requirement.  Would 

that be the filing of a complaint?

 MR. KASTER:  I think it would, Your Honor. 

I don't think that the fact that the employer has a 

policy that says you do it on Tuesday morning would 

control what the statute says one way or the other, so I 

think it would constitute a filing.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you mean that if the

Government says you've got to file a complaint with us 

by either calling us or submitting something in writing, 

and at a cocktail party a worker goes up to a Government 

employee in that agency, and says, you know, my company 

is violating the law.  That that's enough? 

 MR. KASTER:  I don't -- you know, I don't 

believe that that's -- in the context of a non-work 

environment, Your Honor, I would note that, I don't know 

exactly the answer to the Court's question, to be 

honest. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The reason I'm asking 

that question is related to Justice Alito's question, 

which is, what does filing a complaint mean?  Does it 

have to be relative to the procedures adopted by the 

person that you are reporting this to? 

 MR. KASTER:  Filing means directing it to 

somebody who can do something about it.  And it doesn't 

necessarily have to be. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, at a cocktail 

party that employee may be there on personal time, but 

when he goes back to work the next morning he could do 

something.  Is that enough? 

 MR. KASTER:  Well, it may be.  If it's 

24 

directed towards the responsible party, then it would be 

25

filing a complaint.  So it could occur outside of

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what you are doing is 

he is estopping the Government from saying, the only way 

that you can file a complaint with us is to do it in 

writing.  We are now forcing the Government to adopt an 

oral procedure even if it chose not to?  Even if it 

thought an oral procedure would create havoc, et cetera, 

et cetera? 

 MR. KASTER:  If the person is directing the 

complaint to the Government and communicates that to the 

responsible party who can do something about it, I think 

that they are filing a complaint, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  It's one thing to say that 

14 

filing doesn't necessarily mean that something is 

15

written, although that's usually what the word means, 

16 

isn't it? 

17

 MR. KASTER:  It can often mean a written 

18 

communication. 

19

20

21

22

23

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you filing your comments 

right now? 

 MR. KASTER:  I think I am, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You are?  Really? 

 MR. KASTER:  I am directing them to the 

24 

Court.

25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  That's the ordinary usage of 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

the word.  But to say that it includes no degree of 

formality, that's your argument? 

 MR. KASTER:  Well, Your Honor, I would say 

4 

there are no formal requirements for the filing.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If that's the law and the 

employee gets fired and the employee says, well, this 

was done in retaliation for my having filed an FSLA 

complaint three weeks ago, and the employer says what 

complaint?  We have no record of any such complaint and 

the employee says, oh, yes, I said it orally to a 

supervisor who was passing by and my buddy Joe was there 

and he's going to corroborate this.  So now we have a 

trial about whether a complaint was filed? 

 MR. KASTER:  You might have a trial, Your 

Honor, depending on the circumstances.  There might be 

one.  The thing is that that's no different from any 

other retaliation case.  They are trying to establish an 

exception to the rule that retaliation occurs in verbal 

forms.  The communication, the underlying protective 

conduct occurs in verbal forms all the time.  They are 

trying to establish the exception here.  And I would 

note that even under the National Labor Relations Act in 

Scrivener, filing charges includes the verbal 

communications that are antecedents, the predicates to 

filing a charge. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO:  With whom? 

 MR. KASTER:  With the responsible party who 

can do something about it.  I would note also, Your 

Honor -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well -­

 MR. KASTER:  -- that Kevin Kasten doesn't 

have an office.  In terms of the formality of 

communication, there is discussion about the fact that 

this occurred in a hallway outside of the place where 

1

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why do you feel the need to 

go beyond, say, what the AFL-CIO identifies as a normal 

oral failing -- filing?  They use language like, at the 

initial stage of the grievance procedure, there is 

confrontation with an eye to fact finding, and the 

dispute is joined when the employee or the steward or 

supervisor come face-to-face to identify, to discuss, 

and hopefully to resolve a problem.

 Now that's a formal kind of relationship. 

It doesn't involve a cocktail party, and yet it is done 

orally.  And there is a tradition as to how that works. 

But from you've said, I gather that you want to go well 

beyond that and provide that cocktail parties -- perhaps 

not cocktail parties, but just a tap on the shoulder 

8

would be sufficient, where I take it that would normally 

be sufficient in the grievance process.

Honor, a grievance process is a formal process, and so I

wouldn't compare the average workplace -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Suppose I think 

that that provides a good precedent for -- for oral 

filings.  What happens then?  What am I supposed to do 

in your case?

 MR. KASTER:  Your Honor, in the general 

proposition we would be accepting of the Scrivener rule 

that the Court adopted in the '70s, that is that the 

filing of a charge includes those things that happened 

orally prior to and around the time of the filing of the 

charge.  That's what this is about. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, we are talking about a 

filing.  In the grievance process -- I don't want to 

repeat it, but it seems to me form having read the brief 

that filing takes place without writing, provided that 

there are these other safeguards which are described. 

 Now, I want to know in your opinion, is 

there a reason for not importing that into this system? 

I take it you win the case -- or maybe you lose it, I 

don't know how it works on the fact.  I don't know what 

the filing was.

 MR. KASTER:  In terms of the formality of 

requirements, the Court may adopt formal requirements. 

The employer certainly did, Mr. Kasten followed those. 

What I am looking at are the words of the statute that 

cover normally -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There is a word "filing" in 

the AFL-CIO statute as well.  So I am looking for a way 

of interpreting the one in light of the other.  Do you 

favor that?  Are you against that?  If so, why or why 

not? 

 MR. KASTER:  In terms of the procedure that 

they adopt, Your Honor, that may be an acceptable 

procedure.  The thing that I am looking at is the 

statutory language in the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And there wasn't -- he 

16 

didn't invoke the grievance procedure. 

17

18

 MR. KASTEN:  He didn't -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In this case, he didn't 

19 

invoke the grievance procedure.

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. KASTER:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that would keep you 

out, if that were the test, that you have to formally 

invoke the grievance procedure.  But we are told that 

every other time the word "file" is used in this Act, 

Fair Labor Standards Act, it refers to a writing.  And 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

so you are urging a meaning that deviates from the 

standard meaning of the term in the very Act at issue. 

 MR. KASTER:  I don't think I am doing that, 

4 

Your Honor, with all due respect.

5

6 

7 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there another 

provision where the word file is used to mean something 

other than a writing. 

 MR. KASTER:  It means, according to the 

9 

first enforcement action back in 1961, it means submit

or lodge, Your Honor.  I would note that the defendant's 

own policies use it to describe a verbal communication 

by protecting against retaliation for somebody who has 

filed a complaint for sexual harassment.  They have used 

it in a manner that -- as an example to obviously 

include both verbal and written communications. 

 I would note there was a procedure in place 

here, Your Honor, that was the policy manual.  This -­

there was no grievance procedure for Mr. Kasten.  He did 

not have a -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's -- that's the 

problem.  I mean, you can talk about a grievance 

procedure.  I suppose there's always one in -- in 

companies that -- that are unionized, but an awful lot 

of companies aren't.

to argue that this statute doesn't apply to private 

filings of complaints anyway, that it relates only to 

the filing of a complaint with the government.  And 

that -- that's a new -- a new point in this case, and 

normally I would not be disposed to consider it. 

 My problem is, I cannot decide on -- on the 

question of whether filing means filing only in writing 

or also includes verbal filing, without resolving that 

other question.  That is to say, if indeed the complaint 

has to be quote, "filed" with the government, I'm 

inclined to think that an oral complaint pursuant to 

procedures established by the agency which permit an 

oral complaint, even a complaint by telephone that would 

be okay.

 But my goodness, if it applies to private 

employers as well including employers that have no 

grievance procedures, including employers who have 

employees who go to cocktail parties, I am -- I am very 

disinclined to think that it -- that it could mean an 

oral complaint in -- in that context. 

 MR. KASTER:  Your Honor, I'm just looking at 

the statutory language -- file "any complaint."  It's 

important -- the word "any" has a particular meaning.  I 

would not that if -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What does file -- what 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company

is the meaning of "filed"? 

2

 MR. KASTER:  It means to submit or lodge, 

3 

Your Honor. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you are filing your 

argument right now.  Now come on, people don't talk like 

6 

that.

 MR. KASTEN:  I think -­

absurd.  You are not filing an argument right now.

 MR. KASTER:  If I submit or lodge, that is 

the -- and it's directed at a particular -- I have to be 

asserting a statutory right. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'd like to go 

back to the question -­

the question Justice Scalia filed just earlier.

25

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what would you say 

about his point that it seems to me had substantial 

merit?  It - it's really our determination -- our 

interpretation of what filing means might well depend on 

whether filing in -- or a complaint includes 

intracompany complaints, the grumbling of an employee

and so forth; and I recognize this -- this argument 

comes up late.  Has it been addressed in any of the 

other circuits? 

 MR. KASTER:  Yes, Your Honor.  There has 

been -- a number of the circuits have interpreted this 

statute and included -- the Ninth Circuit, the First 

Circuit, the Tenth Circuit have all -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All have said that 

9 

intracompany complaints -­

14 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

MR. KASTER:  Intracompany complaints; that 

is true as well in the Sixth Circuit.  And it's easier 

to talk about the cases where that hasn't been true -­

in Memphis Barbecue, the Fourth Circuit; in Genesee 

Hospital, the Second Circuit.  Memphis --the Memphis 

Barbecue case really addresses the testimonial clause. 

 Genesee Hospital is the only case in the 

Second Circuit where they have held that all complaints 

need to go to the Department of Labor.  The one thing I 

would say about that particular argument, Your Honor. 

Is it makes superfluous instituted proceeding.  It makes 

superfluous instituted proceeding which -- or cause to 

be instituted. 

 If you file a complaint -- it - then -- with 

24 

the Department of Labor, their argument is, and I think 

25

it's true, that you institute a proceeding.  So the 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

statute would be redundant, and "file any complaint" 

would cover a null set. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure that's true. 

4 

You -- you can complain orally to somebody at the Labor

Department who decides that the complaint isn't serious 

enough to -- to warrant commencing a proceeding.  I 

mean, if you go in and insist, I -- you know, I want to 

begin a proceeding, that's -- that's something else. 

But you can file a complaint orally without -- without 

doing that, it seems to me. 

 MR. KASTER:  Well, Your Honor, if you have 

made the phone call and started the process I think you 

have instituted a proceeding.  Now whether it gets -- at 

what stage of formality it gets to, I'm not sure, Your 

Honor, but I think you have begun the process of 

instituting a proceeding or causing it to be instituted. 

That's one.  The other thing I -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not if it's never 

19 

instituted.  Not if it's never instituted.  If no 

20

proceeding is ever instituted, you can hardly be accused 

21 

of having caused a proceeding to be instituted. 

22

23

 MR. KASTEN:  There's a -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So if you make an informal 

24 

complaint and it doesn't go any further, and they ask -­

25

"You know, do you want to" -- "No, I don't want to start 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

a proceeding, but -- but this company is just, you know, 

it's acting improperly, you guys ought to look into 

that." 

 That's -- I'm 00 I'm prepared to say that's 

filing a complaint, if you are only talking about filing 

complaint with the government.  But if you are talking 

about oral filings of the complaints with employer, I am 

very troubled. 

 MR. KASTER:  Well, Your Honor, I'm going to 

reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

The Government wants to start by pointing out there are

anti-retaliation provisions.  Most of those statutes 

cover all the complaints, either because Congress has 

said so in administering, agencies have said so or the 

courts have said so.  And the kind of practical

difficulties that the court is raising have not proven

 MR. WALL:  Justice Scalia, it's not the 

older.  It was model on the NLRA, which is even older. 

For instance, the NLRB has found that if, you know, 

employees are complaining to each other, that they can't 

be discharged under the NLRA's anti-retaliation 

provision, or if an employee orally says to his 

employer, I'm about to go to the Board and tell them you 

are doing something unlawful, the Board has said you 

can't be discharged. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what is the 

24 

language in those statutes?  All those statutes use the 

25

language "file a complaint"?

 MR. WALL:  The language in the NLRA is "file 

charges" or "give testimony."  So, instead of filing a 

complaint, it says "file charges."  But the language in 

many of these statutes, and they are cited in all of the 

briefs, is extremely similar.  They refer to filing 

complaints or charges, instituting proceedings.  As you 

pointed -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you -- you -- are you 

9 

urging that if you just tell a coworker, that that's 

10

11 

12 

13

enough?  I thought the whole idea is to give the 

employer notice that something is amiss.  So, how would 

telling a coworker serve that purpose? 

 MR. WALL:  It wouldn't under this particular 

14 

statute, Justice Ginsburg.  I didn't mean to imply under 

15

the FLSA.  The FLSA anti-retaliation provision does not 

have an opposing any practice clause in the way that 

some civil rights statutes do like Title VII.  So, it 

does require submission of a complaint to an employer, 

but that could take many forms.

 And as you pointed out, Justice Scalia, in 

this particular context, filing something orally makes 

perfect sense.  We are not -- we are talking about the 

kinds of industries, truck drivers, coal miners and 

migrant workers where that's a perfectly normal use of 

speech.  Oral communication -­

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Fine.  It's a 

perfectly normal use of speech, I accept that.  But what 

is it that would surround this use of speech on a 

particular occasion with enough formality that we know 

it isn't something that could pass unnoticed and bring 

in a whole lot of things like the cocktail party 

example, et cetera? 

 I noticed there was a paragraph in the

AFL-CIO -- that's why I brought it up.  Is that the 

10

11 

12 

13 

14

15

right standard?  What we say here may take effect or 

have influence, so -- so I want to say it correctly. 

What kinds of oral complaints count as filing a 

complaint? 

 MR. WALL:  Justice Breyer, I don't think the 

Government has any objection to that standard.  Although 

16 

I do think -­

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But I would like more than 

that.  The Government sees these statutes as a whole, so 

I would like the Government's assistance on what words 

to write to be able to get this right so it will not be 

too formal, it will not be too informal, it will do the 

job. 

 MR. WALL:  I -- I think the kind of indicia 

24 

or formality you are talking about are signs that the 

25

employer has submitted to his employer an assertion of 

19

statutory rights under the FLSA.  I think those are the 

two things that the lower courts have consistently 

looked to.  And I think those indicia of formality are a 

good sign that the employer has, but they are not the 

only sign. 

 If I walk into the happy hour and I have 

actually written down on a form that my employer 

promulgates and I hand it off to my supervisor -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, fill in 

this blank then, there must be surrounding the oral 

11 

complaint sufficient elements of formality such that -­

 MR. WALL:  That the employer has -- the 

employee has indicated to his employer, someone in 

supervisory authority, that he is asserting statutory 

rights under the FLSA. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if he just says 

to the employer, "You know, I think we ought to have a 

little more time to put on our gear," is that an 

assertion of statutory rights under the FLSA?

 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's 

a difficult question.  I don't think it is presented 

here, because this isn't a content case. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, I know, but the 

24 

idea -- one of the objections to your position is that 

25

it's going to be very hard to figure out in any

particular case what is a filing an oral complaint under 

the FLSA, because one, it's got to be reconstructed, 

unlike the situation where you had have a government 

agency that's doing it, or you have a written complaint; 

and second of all, it's -- it's unclear perhaps for the 

employer to know that he's being charged with a 

violation of the FLSA. 

 MR. WALL:  But that question comes up in 

9 

every case, whether the complaint is written or oral to

the Government or an employer.  If I write down -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if it's 

written -- if it's written, you have got a document that 

people can look like -- look at, whether it's the NLRB 

or a court, that -- that they can look at and say, yes, 

this is a -- an assertion of a violation. 

 MR. WALL:  If I write down on a form 

promulgated by my employer I don't like where the time 

clocks are or I think the time -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But it's on a form.  So we 

have got that -- that helps a lot.  Also an employer 

could have a notice.  Notice, if you really are upset 

because you think there is a violation going here, go to 

this microphone which is directly connected to the 

complaint department and cite the statute.  That would 

work, too.

 (Laughter. ) 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But -- but there have been 

years and years of -- you have just said, of statutes 

like this, you say that many of them operate orally. 

All right.  What kind of thing, if you can help, maybe 

you can't -- which is dangerous, but then we just try to 

do our best, and we don't have the labor law experience 

necessarily, but -- but what is the -- the form of words 

that we can use to separate the wheat from the chaff?

 MR. WALL:  Justice Breyer, I'm sorry if -­

if -- if it the formulation I have given you is not 

helpful, but in -- in these statutes where either by 

expressed language or regulation, so for instance, the 

Surface Transportation Assistance Act, and ADA or OSHA, 

the -- the language varies from regulation to 

regulation.  In some of them it says lodge complaints, 

and some of them it says make a complaint.  But what the 

courts have -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Let me see if I can look, 

because in about 2 minutes you are going to hear, I 

suspect and the other side, say see, see, we told you, 

that's why you have to have it in writing.

apply.  Is the rule -- your -- your -- Mr. Kaster's 

argument seems to be anything goes, any oral 

communication to a supervisor goes. 

 MR. WALL:  I think -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me go back to the 

example I started out with.  A worker has been hurt, a 

supervisor is going to attend to the hurt worker, and an 

employee says, the company is violating the FLSA.  And 

the supervisor says, don't tell me, and don't tell me 

about it now.  I'm doing something else.  That's enough?

 MR. WALL:  I think the test, Justice Alito, 

is whether the employee has submitted a complaint to his 

employer that has put the employer on notice that that 

employee is asserting statutory rights under the FLSA, 

claiming that he is legally entitled to something he is 

not receiving. 

 If the supervisor walks in the next morning 

and says to his boss, yesterday morning while I was 

attending to the plant accident, Joe told me that the 

time clocks are in the wrong place.  He's about to file. 

I think we need to fire him, he's a troublemaker.  That 

23

employee has stated a claim to the FLSA.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what if he 

goes to the boss and says, boss, you ought to do 

something, that railing is -- is pretty dangerous over 

there. 

 MR. WALL:  Again -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is the boss supposed 

to know, well, he is asserting statutory rights under 

the FLSA?

 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think there 

11 

probably not.  The employee -­

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That would not be 

13 

filing a complaint? 

14

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

 MR. WALL:  I mean, I think as a content 

case, which it is not, it's unlikely that that is. 

Saying that you don't like something or you think it is 

unsafe is not actually saying you have are asserting a 

right to have it differently.  But those are content 

cases.  And here there is no question the Petitioner 

asserted his statutory rights to a number of different 

21 

people at the company. 

22

23 

24 

25

 What Respondent is saying is he didn't do it 

the right way.  If he had done exactly what he did in 

exactly the same words, but he had done it some other 

way, then it would be covered.  So, this is a form case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What did he do?  What did 

he do specifically?  I mean, you are saying that -- that 

the employer has to know that he is making a complaint 

under the Act.  So what -- and you said here are the 

facts that was clear that he did. 

 MR. WALL:  If you credit his allegations, 

which you have to at this point, because the district 

court granted summary judgment on a legal ground, what 

Petitioner says he did is he went to his supervisor.  He 

said the time clocks are in the wrong place.  We are not 

getting paid for all of our time.  And then he went up 

the ladder to human resources personnel at the company, 

and he said exactly the same thing, and he said I 

thinking about challenging you on it in court, and if I 

challenge you, you will lose. 

 Now, whatever the test is, that clearly 

meets the bar for asserting statutory rights under the 

FLSA.  And I think what is important to not is that this 

Court has consistently, from the 1940s on, both with 

respect to the FLSA and anti-retaliation provisions more 

generally in Title VII and other statutes, it has always 

given them a broader reading to effectuate their 

purposes. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Wall, I -- this 

is just a factual.  Were you saying that the employee 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

has to know that he is submitting a claim of statutory 

violation or the employer? 

 MR. WALL:  I think what the lower courts

have said, and I think this makes sense, is that the

question of whether a reasonable, objective person would 

have understood the employee to have submitted a claim 

complaint.  So if the employee does everything he can to 

put the employer on notice, it's not a defense for the 

employer to say that subjectively he didn't understand 

it to be a complaint. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In those circuits where 

they allow intercompany complaints that are oral, can 

you give me any sense of how often this leads to claim 

for retaliation?  I mean, are they in the hundreds or.

 MR. WALL:  I can't, Justice Kennedy.  All I 

can tell you is that the vast majority of circuits have 

found that intracompany complaints are protected and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why is it inherently 

unworkable here in any greater extent that it is 

unworkable in all of the other statutes where oral 

complaints are permitted?  What makes this worse than

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't know that it is 

necessarily any worse in this particular context.  I do 

think what it suggests is that the Congress that looked 

at this problem, which as Justice Scalia pointed out was 

the 1938 Congress, and what that Congress was saying is 

we are taking a very dramatic step.  We are moving in 

the direction of Federal regulation -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is the -- this was 

the Lochner era where they weren't even sure they could 

do this.  But why should we read their language with a 

narrow reading of any complaint? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think you have to 

24 

read their language as the way it was written and as the 

25

way they would have understood it at the time, which was 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

to file any complaint, which as it would have been 

understood in '38 and frankly after that, when you file 

a complaint that usually entails some notion of 

formality and when you put it in the context of a 

specific provision where it is not only filing a 

complaint, but institute any proceeding, caused any 

proceeding to be instituted, justify any proceeding. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What grievance -- would 

9 

the bringing of a grievance, the example that 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

Justice Breyer suggested, an employee goes to his union 

and says, they are violating the statute.  Let's grieve 

it.  And according to the proceedings established by the 

employer, they meet with the employer, and the employee 

does everything in the grievance and they now fire that 

employee.  Under your reading, that's not instituting a 

16 

proceeding? 

17

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24

25

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No, because a proceeding is 

understood and it's used consistently in the FLSA as an 

official action by a government agency.  So no, I don't 

believe that is instituting a proceeding. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then we have to address 

your second question, not the first.  You are saying the 

oral wouldn't work in there? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  The oral doesn't work 

in that particular context.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would it work if they 

instituted a proceeding orally and the proceeding 

required itself to start orally? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't -- the truth is, if 

the employer envisions in its mind that it is 

instituting a proceeding, that's still not a proceeding 

within the meaning of what Congress meant in 1938.  It 

had in mind an official action by a government agency. 

And no private employer is ever going to institute a 

proceeding within the meaning of that particular scheme. 

 You know, it's extremely important in the 

context of this particular statute, and the one thing I 

should have answered, Justice Sotomayor, to your 

question is, what's different about this statute than 

any other?  This statute carries a criminal penalty with 

16 

it.  And no other retaliation statute except for one -­

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is a protection 

built in, Mr. Phillips, it says it's criminal liability 

only if it's willful.  And on the civil side, the civil 

liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act, you 

certainly don't have to prove willful, you just prove a 

violation. 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but the reality is 

24 

that this Court held in the CIT case that the Court 

25

would not construe this statute broadly in order to 

29

expose people to potential criminal liabilities.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wouldn't any retaliatory 

action be willful?  I mean, to say it's in retaliation 

means you are firing this person because of the 

complaint. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The question is whether 

the violation is willful.  The willful qualification in 

the criminal context is are you willfully denying your 

workers the wages and hours the statute requires?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Nothing to do with 

12 

retaliation. 

13

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No, I -- well, it does have 

14 

something to do with retaliation, but, Justice Ginsburg,

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

it seems to me it's all of a piece, though.  Because the 

reason why you can be comfortable with a willfulness 

standard even which extends to conscious disregard 

beyond the intent as well, but the reason why you can be 

comfortable with that is if you look at the way the 

statute is crafted in terms of the retaliation provision 

itself, it speaks specifically to formal actions that 

are taken, the filing of a complaint, the institution of 

a proceeding. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you know, how common 

is it to have criminal prosecutions under this section

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't believe -- I mean, 

it's not a null set, but I don't believe it's a 

particularly, I don't think it's a large number of 

proceedings.  But it seems to me, though, in trying to 

understand what the Congress of 1938 would have done and 

trying to understand why it would have approached this 

in a narrow way, and why this provision is aimed not 

generally to protect workers, but is aimed really to 

10

make sure that information gets to the Federal 

11 

Government.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that the whole 

idea of this statute is to protect the workers, and I 

would like you to address particularly the amici's 

point, that this statute in 1938 affected people -- many 

were illiterate, they couldn't write a complaint, many 

were immigrants who weren't familiar with the language, 

for that universe of people, wouldn't Congress have 

meant that all complaints are okay?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Let me start by saying, first 

of all, even if the FLSA has broadly a pro employee 

protective purpose, it's still important to recognize 

that the retaliation provision we are talking about here 

specifically did not provide a cause of action, a 

private cause of action until 1977.  So that when

Congress enacted this statute in 1938, it didn't say boo 

about allowing the employees to show up in court and to 

assert their rights.  This is not part of that 

expansive, grant rights to the employee's portion of 

this legislation. 

 And then second, Justice Ginsburg, with 

respect to the specifics of what did Congress have in 

mind, it seems to me the better way to evaluate this is 

not did Congress have in mind a group of illiterate 

employees or not, but what language did Congress use in 

trying to formulate the specific provision that gives 

rise to the protections against retaliation. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your case would be a lot

number one, it only applies to filing a complaint with

applies to written complaints to the Government.  I 

mean, why don't you -­

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I will take the former 

argument, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why don't you give a break 

to the illiterate and let them file oral complaints with 

the Government? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, my guess is the truth 

is they will be able to file oral complaints with the

Government because, the only thing that is left open is 

the precise hypothetical you gave, Justice Scalia, where 

you make an oral complaint and nothing gets instituted 

in those circumstances.  And it seems to me, clearly, in 

the Federal Government's authority to simply adopt a 

rule that says any time anybody makes an oral complaint 

to us we will institute a proceeding.  And if the agency 

adopted that view, I don't think there is anything we 

could do about it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose it says we won't 

necessarily institute a proceeding, but we will regard 

it as a complaint? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- I mean, my own view is 

14 

the better way of reading -- that is a much closer case,

I will concede that, Justice Scalia.  My own view is 

that when you talking about file a complaint, that is 

just not the way Congress ordinarily thinks about file a 

complaint.  File always has in mind written -- I'm 

sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Scalia's 

hypothetical, unless I am misremembering, I think, is 

very common.  For example, the EEOC, people often file 

complaints and then the EEOC considers whether it's 

going to institute a proceeding or not.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And I'm not

quarrelling with that.  I mean, I understand that.  And 

the truth is, you know, I think for another day the 

issue will arise and the Court can decide whether or not 

a mere oral complaint to a government agency is 

sufficient to file a complaint within the meaning of 

6 

this statute. 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

 I do think it is fundamentally important for 

this Court to decide the underlying question of whether 

oral complaints are sufficient only in the context in 

the first instance of deciding whether or not it has to 

go to a government agency as opposed to any kind of 

private or intracorporate activity. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does it work with 

14 

respect to the more recent statutes?  Title VII, The Age 

15

16

Discrimination Act, Disabilities Act? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  In terms of retaliation, 

17 

Justice Ginsburg? 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  If you have not 

19 

filed anything with the Government, but you have to your 

20

22

24 

25

supervisor opposed a practice. 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No, the vast majority of 

those statutes talk about any action that -- opposing a 

practice, and therefore they deal with a lot of 

intracorporate activities, and obviously at some point 

there is an issue as to sort of what the employer's

intent is and how far it got up the ladder -­

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is it -- so in those 

cases I think you are quite right, intracorporate 

complaints count as opposing any practice.  Has there 

been any huge problems about people saying, oh, I made 

an oral complaint to my supervisor, and supervisor said 

I never heard of it? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I suspect that issue 

9 

comes up almost every day, and it is a problem; but it's

a problem that Congress made a judgment that we would 

rather go ahead and allow those matters to be litigated; 

and language that is very expansive in protecting 

employees from retaliation.  And while I -- I may chafe 

at that at times as a managing partner of a law firm, I 

recognize that that is the judgment that Congress made. 

 Here we are talking about a Congress that 

made a very different judgment about how it wanted to 

protect retaliation.  And it was a judgment that was 

made, it seems to me, very much in the context of 1938. 

Justice Sotomayor, you are very right; they were not 

sure they even had constitutional authority to be 

adopting this approach; and they are attaching to it 

criminal sanctions, and they are not providing a private 

right of action; and in that context it seems to me that 

this Court should comfortably say that this is a much 

35

narrower proposition.

3 

Ginsburg's question?

8

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What about her question? 

In 1938 a lot of illiterate people couldn't have filed 

written complaints. 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  And Congress must have 

9 

recognized that fact, and -­

10

11 

12 

13

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if they did, isn't it 

reasonable to think that they would have included in 

filing, in such circumstances, oral filing? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No, because if under those 

14 

circumstances when you're going to impose criminal 

15

sanctions on somebody, you're going to say we are not 

16 

going to do that. 

17

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But your easier answer is, 

"yes, but only with the government."  Why isn't that an

comfortable with that. 

22

23

is -- that in front of us, do we have to decide that 

now?  We've granted a different question, etc.  So -­

is -­

13

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I don't want to give up 

either of the points, actually.  But the bottom line is, 

Justice Breyer, the question presented is -- is very 

broad.  I mean, the question of whether this goes to a 

governmental entity is fairly -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  Then it's odd that 

you say -- it -- I gather, as well, for about 50 or 

60 years the relevant agencies have interpreted the -­

the statute the way that -- to include oral complaints. 

 And that seems to me a fairly strong reason 

14 

for continuing to do so, if -- where the language is 

15

so -- allows it and there aren't any strong reasons the 

16 

other way. 

17

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I don't know that 

18 

there's 50 or 60 years of allowing oral complaints -­

19

20

21

it's 30. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe it's 30 years.  Maybe 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  -- to be in the -- in the 

22 

private context. 

23

 There may be 50 to 60 years of allowing oral 

24 

complaints being brought to the government agency, which 

25

I do think would go to Justice Scalia's point, but with

respect to intracorporate communications there is no

the Government's position on this point?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I would not give any 

deference to the Government's position.  Certainly not 

Chevron deference because this is not a -­

9 

would depend on an intent.  I guess you are getting into 

10

11 

12 

13

an argument here that there's no reason to repeat in 

public.  I mean, Justice Scalia and I don't necessarily 

agree on this.  Why would you -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I mean, regardless of 

14 

whether we do, why -- why don't you think we --we have

18

20

21 

22 

23

to give any deference, Chevron -- Chevron deference. 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean I -- yes. 

 There is no Chevron deference -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  -- because this is not a 

matter that has been allocated to either the EEOC or the 

Secretary of Labor to administer and to adopt 

regulations. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  How do we know?  I mean, 

24 

all right, if you want to get into it, this is a very 

25

minor sort of interstitial point in a statute that they

administer, and there are lots of instances, I think 

where the Court has said, where these minor matters of 

how you work out the actual application of the word are 

implicitly delegate it to the agency to determine within 

the context of reasonable view. 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  But Justice Breyer, that 

would strike me as a more persuasive argument if 

Congress hadn't -- hadn't delegated to the Secretary of 

Labor specific rulemaking authority with respect to 

specific provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and 

does not have a similar provision in connection with 

section 215(a). 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But not everything has to 

14 

be done through formal rules.  There -- there are many,

many ways of agencies determining practice. 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But -- agency 

decisionmaking, but we don't have that either.  All we 

have here are certain enforcement actions that are being 

brought by the agency and indeed, if you look at the 

enforcement actions, they all ultimately tie to some 

official action by some government entity.  None of the 

actions that -- that you can go back to say I am going 

to defer to this, go into the circumstance we are 

talking about here, where it's a purely private action 

as opposed to some kind of a public -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  Why would it be 

different?  If an agency work out a system of deciding 

when a person is really making a complaint, as opposed 

to an offhand remark, and that is good enough to run the 

government of the United States, where they have -­

where they are in this business, why -- why couldn't 

whatever their indicia are there, also be transplanted 

to the private sector -­

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it might be -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and get that to work out 

all right -­

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but we don't have -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in which case you would 

be left, if you are going to say that might work, 

then -- the you are left with the simple argument that 

you don't think that this statute means to apply to

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I -- I think the answer 

to that question is you don't have anywhere near the 

50 years of practice dealing with the specific 

hypothetical you posed, Justice Breyer. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Would you accept -- you 

think -- that a tenable interpretation?  What this means 

is that written complaints are good enough to count as 

filings where you complained to your private employer, 

10

but written or oral count as a filing where you deal to 

11 

-- with the government agency?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  -- that a -- that an oral 

complaint is -- is not sufficient, but if -- but I don't 

think you have to decide that issue.  I think the better 

way to decide this case and the more fundamental one; it 

is the one Justice Scalia was coming back to, is does it 

apply beyond the government agency context?  And if

 MR. PHILLIPS:  It wasn't brought up 

specifically in the brief in opposition.  On the other 

hand, it was clearly presented and decided by the 

Seventh Circuit, so it was in the case as it came to 

this Court; and this Court's rule is that you can defend 

the judgment on any ground that's fairly presented.  And 

10

-- and this ground seems to me more than fairly 

11 

presented, since it -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  On the ground itself, is 

there anything in the legislative history of the statute 

that says it's limited to the government?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the -- yes -- if you go 

back to the legislative history there is a colloquy 

between the two Senators, and I recognize some members 

of the Court are unenthusiastic -- but -- but you know, 

in that colloquy, they talk about malicious complaints, 

and it seems to me malicious in that context is talking 

about where you have essentially defamed your employer 

through a government agency. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That could be.  It could be 

24 

that they are thinking of malicious complaints and they 

25

are thinking of government agencies at the time, but 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

neither their language nor their purpose, as history 

later shows, requires that limitation on scope. 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think if you are

1938 had in mind, the best way to do that is to look at 

the language chosen and the company that that language 

keeps.  And when you take about filing a complaint and 

you file a -- you talk about instituting a proceeding or 

causing a proceeding to be instituted, or testifying at 

a proceeding that's formal, or belonging to a -- to a 

company committee that is again, a governmentally 

instituted methodology, the best way to read that is to 

say what they have in mind is an official government 

action of some sort.  And it makes perfect -­

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I have no doubt that an 

employee under those circumstances if -- if discharged 

would be able to make a claim under Title VII of 

retaliation for that particular conduct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And there's been -- you 

said there was no evidence of the government for 

60 years -- but there has been some 30 years or more 

experience under Title VII of the statutes, with oral 

complaints to the employer as being sufficient to ground 

a retaliation claim. 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And I -- I think the 

key to this process, Justice Ginsburg, is what lens you 

are looking at.  Are you looking through the cracked and 

yellowed glass that I am looking through from 1938, or 

the glass as it looks through in 2010, and the truth is

but the -- but the -- this statute was enacted in 1938, 

and it was enacted as fairly radical and made an -- an 

initial incursion from protecting people from 

rehabilitation.  It doesn't purport to be as expansive 

44

as any of the subsequent -- and the truth is -- can I

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Since the Federal Arbitration

Arbitration Act. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How old? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, it would have been back 

around the same period of time, in the 1930s. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think that when 

Congress wrote or caused to be instituted any proceeding 

under or related to this chapter, that they intended to 

exclude that proceeding and intended to exclude people 

who testified in that proceeding about a violation of 

16 

the statute? 

17

18 

19 

20

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  I don't -- I believe 

that proceeding is used in the Fair Labor Standards Act 

consistently throughout the statute to talk about 

Government -- official Government actions and not 

21 

simply -­

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you point me to 

23 

something in the act that defines "proceedings" -­

24

25

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No, nothing.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- "related" -- the 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

words "proceedings related to this chapter," as limited 

only to Government proceedings? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, that -- in the

brief we identified a number of places where Congress

22 

23 

24

25

uses the word "proceedings," and every place where they 

use the word "proceedings" they have in mind an official 

Government activity.  And so I think it is the most 

reasonable -- logical way to read this particular 

language as incorporating that.

 Of course, even if that were true, even if 

you would preserve that, that still wouldn't be a basis 

for going forward with this case, because there was no 

proceeding that was instituted pursuant to the informal 

actions that were taken.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then we're back to if 

Congress meant filing any complaints, either oral or in 

writing.  I'm asking a different question, which is -­

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I understand that, but I'm -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That Congress's intent 

was not to protect a worker who publicly took an oath in 

front of an arbitrator and testified about a violation 

of law, that they would not have considered that 

retaliatory under the statute. 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I do not believe they would 

have regarded that as retaliatory under the statute

because of the fact that the way this is all set up is 

the -- and the -- it's just the narrowness of the Fair 

Labor Standards Act. 

 And, Justice Ginsburg, to your question 

about the subsequent legislation that has all been 

enacted, it seems to me in a lot of ways that that 

reinforces the core interpretive approach that I have 

taken in this case, because if it were absolutely clear 

that the language about filing a complaint and 

instituting a proceeding were as broad as -- certainly 

as the Petitioner proposes in this case, where any kind 

of oral grumbling is sufficient, Congress never would 

have needed to deviate from that template and all the 

legislation that came afterwards.

 And there are tons of statutes that say: 

File a complaint, institute a proceeding, and otherwise 

oppose.  And there would have been no reason for 

Congress to do that if this language would have 

accomplished precisely the same thing.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's more of a question 

for the Petitioner's counsel than you, but are you aware 

of any cases in any other jurisdictions where there have 

been proceedings, actions for retaliation, based on 

complaints to third parties, like complaining to the 

press?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I'm sure there are such 

cases, Your Honor.  I mean, I doubt -- it probably 

wouldn't come up so much in the Fair Labor Standards Act 

process.  And that's the problem:  This has got a fairly 

narrow sweep to it. 

 Obviously, wage and hours is not a 

significant activity, but it doesn't tend to generate 

the same kind of intensity that you might expect out of 

Title VII or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act or 

some of the other provisions. 

 If there are no further questions, Your 

12 

Honors, I would ask the Court to affirm the judgment. 

13

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Just one more question. 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Sure.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It seems to me you are 

saying the only complaint that counts is the one to the 

Government. 

 Isn't -- in the work setting that's being 

19 

regulated, wouldn't there be every reason to want the 

20

21 

22 

23

employee to complain first to the employer rather than 

making a Federal case out of it by complaining to a 

Government agency? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Intuitively, I don't disagree 

24 

with that, Justice Ginsburg, but we have to go, again: 

25

What was the purpose of this particular statute?  And

this statute was not intended as a protection to the 

employer or to the employee -- or to the employer.  This 

was a provision that was designed to give information to 

the Federal Government.

 And we know that because there's no private 

right of action to the employee that it is enforceable 

as a criminal sanction.  And if you go back to the 

precursors of the Fair Labor Standards Act -- and 

somebody asked; this was the first one.  I gathered 

10

there was a third one.  There was the Railway Labor Act, 

11 

the NLRA, and then there was this particular provision.

 But if you go back to these precursors, you 

see that it's, again, a very narrow approach that was 

taken under those statutes as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if you are an 

employee of the Treasury Department and there is an oral 

complaint to your superior?  Is that filing a complaint 

with the Government? 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I mean, part of it depends on 

whether the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to Federal 

employees.  There is a whole separate regime that deals 

with Federal employees.  And I can't -- I'm not 

100 percent sure whether this provision applies under 

those circumstances.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, it seems to me it's 

a matter for the courts.  An agency interprets the 

statutes that direct the agency's own actions if it has 

to enforce things and so forth.  But where there is a 

provision for a suit in court, it seems to me it's up to 

the courts to decide what it means.

 MR. KASTER:  That may be true, Your Honor. 

We have the identical language in the Surface 

Transportation Act in OSHA, which the agency does have 

regulatory power over and has interpreted this precise 

language to include oral communications. 

 In addition, the Migrant Workers Act -­

counsel wants to suggest that all of this is a throwback 

to '38.  The Migrant Workers Act, which was adopted in 

1982, has the very same language.  It is implausible to 

suggest that Congress would think that a migrant worker 

was leaving the field and writing up a memo and bringing 

it back to his supervisor in order to assert his 

statutory rights. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you mean by the 

very same language?  Just -­

 MR. KASTER:  Filed any complaint.  Filed a 

17 

complaint.

MR. KASTER:  It goes beyond -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Be a member of a committee? 

He is relying on large part on the context of filing a 

complaint.  Does this statute have those other 

provisions?

 MR. KASTER:  It does not have those other

provisions, Your Honor.

 I also suggest that what we are talking 

about in the very first case that this Court dealt with 

after the act was passed were coal miners.  Nobody is 

taking -- I don't think it would be plausible to suggest 

that Congress thought that coal miners -- coal miners, 

factory workers, line workers -- they don't write memos. 

With all due respect, Your Honor, lawyers write memos. 

People who this act was intended to cover, the poorest 

and the least educated people in the country. 

 That's why under Mitchell v. DeMario and 

that's why under Tennessee Coal the Court has taken the 

position that this deserves, has to have, a broad 

interpretation.  Employees are the engine that actually 

enforces this act. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That goes to your 

adversary's first argument or second argument where he 

says when this act was passed for all of those people, 

they would never have thought of going to their employer 

because the work ethos at the time was that those 

employees couldn't complain to their employers.  They 

would always naturally go to the Government.

 How do you answer that?  How do you disprove 

that point:  That historically at the time this was 

passed in 1938, that there was a number of those 

employees who as a regular course of their business, 

filed complaints with their employers as opposed to the 

6 

Government?

 MR. KASTER:  Any complaints, Your Honor. 

Filed charges was the -- was the previous language in 

the National Labor Relations Act.  Congress adopted a 

different phrase here, "any" -- "filed any complaint" -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry. 

 MR. KASTER:  "Filed any complaint."  In 

Rosenwasser, this Court said that the criminal liability 

concerns of the employer were addressed by the word 

"any."  In other words, when they suggested under the 

act that there was criminal liability and they didn't 

know the piecework employees were covered, the Court 

responded in 1945, the word "any" resolves any kind of 

ambiguity that the employer should have had.

 In this case "any" means any and all, and 

that is without limitation.  That is the kind of 

complaint that is protected under the act.  On 

December 11 -- there is no question in this case Kevin 

Kasten asserted his statutory rights.  This is a case 

about form over substance.  Form over substance.  That's 

53

 On December 11, 2006, Mr. Kaster was fired. 

The same date, they changed the time clocks so that 

everybody else would get paid, just as he complained 

they weren't properly legally being paid before that. 

They changed the clocks the same day.  If -- now, there 

were a half a million complaints last year in the 

Department of Labor. 

 If the Court should find that every 

complaint needs to go to the Department of Labor, then 

when I get a call from an employee, a disgruntled 

employee who says, my paycheck was wrong, or there is 

something wrong with my overtime calculation, I'm going 

to say, You can't afford to call the human resources 

department and have a conversation, a friendly 

conversation about this, because if you do, and you 

happen to trigger a statutory assertion, that will be 

unprotected.  You are going to foreclose all the 

internal communications that could occur.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

 MR. KASTER:  Thank you.
