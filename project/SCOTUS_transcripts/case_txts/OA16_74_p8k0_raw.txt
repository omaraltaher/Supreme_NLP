CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

  

 

 

 

 

argument first -- first this morning in Case 16-74, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton and the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT 

 

 

 

 

 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Pension plans for religious non-profits have 

 

 

 

 

 

been exempt from ERISA for over 30 years, whether or not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a church established the plan.  And the contrary holding 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the three courts below should be reversed for three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons. 

            

First, the text does not require a church to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish benefit plans for someone else's employees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second, the government's consistent view, over three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decades, has generated enormous reliance interest and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants deference.  And third, affirmance would 

  

 

 

 

 

resurrect the precise problems that everyone understood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 1980 amendment would fix. 

 

 

 

 

              

I could start with the text.  And the main 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

text at issue here is subparagraph C(i) of section

1002(33).  And if you -- the government's brief actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has all the relevant provisions, so I think that's the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

easiest, if you want to look at their appendix.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C(i) is -- is reprinted on -- on pages 11A. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So again, we're looking at paragraph --

 

 

 

 

 

 

subparagraph C(i) of paragraph (33), which everyone in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case agrees expands the original church plan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition in subparagraph A. 

 

 

 

            

Now, the only plausible reason that C(i) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repeats the entire phrase "a plan established and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintained by a church" is Congress intended that C(i) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

redefine and modify that entire phrase. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  There was a 

  

  

 

 

 

provision that was proposed that would have done very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly what you think this provision does now.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress didn't pass it.  So an earlier version did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what you wanted.  It said you can -- a plan that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establishes and/or maintained by a church. 

   

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  It -- it said established and --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and maintained.  And the problem, Justice Sotomayor, is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it -- the -- the assumption is incorrect that that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision did everything that folks wanted.  It actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't.  It -- it excluded the very plans that everyone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concedes was intended to be --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The pension plans.

MS. BLATT:  -- covered. 

  

 

 

6 

Well, plans established by churches and 

 

 

 

 

 

maintained by somebody else. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A plan established and 

    

 

 

 

maintained by a church includes a plan established and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

maintained by a church-affiliated organization. 

   

 

 

            

excluded --

 

            

            

MS. BLATT:  Right.  And that would have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Who? 

  

 

MS. BLATT:  It would have excluded plans 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that -- where the church established and the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pension board maintained.  And the other side --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  A plan 

    

  

 

 

established and maintained by a church, so that's any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan established by -- this is the old language, by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way, so --

 

 

            

            

MS. BLATT:  Right.  So here --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's any church 

  

 

 

 

 

plan.  Plus it defined includes a plan established and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

maintained by a church-affiliated organization. 

   

 

 

            

            

Why is not a pension plan? 

   

 

 

 

MS. BLATT:  Because the problem is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provision, the way it read, required the pension board 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to not only maintain it, but it would have had to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish it.  And so that excluded -- but -- but

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A plan established and 

    

 

 

 

7 

maintained by a church-affiliated organization.  So --

   

  

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Right.  But it said "and."  And 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

so if -- if the church established it, then it wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been a church plan established and maintained by a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church, and it wouldn't have been a plan established and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintained by a pension board. 

   

 

 

            

So -- and I think the clear thing in terms 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this uninterrupt -- I mean unpassed piece of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation is it came out in the last couple of days of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this several-year process, and it -- the change went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unmentioned, Justice Sotomayor, and it is -- it's just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implausible that that change went unnoticed when it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have excluded all the plans that the religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

community was up in arms about, and all the plans that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prompted the amendment in the first place. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, still, Ms. Blatt, 

  

 

 

 

 

there is a -- you know, there would be a simple way of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accomplishing what you think this provision 

 

 

 

 

 

accomplishes.  You know, something along the lines of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just saying any plan maintained by a church-affiliated 

   

 

 

 

 

 

organization is a church plan or something like that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's -- it's very odd language, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory language, and I'm wondering why you think that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress chose to do what you think it chose to do in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

this perplexing way rather than in a straightforward 

   

 

 

 

 

 

way? 

            

MS. BLATT:  Sure.  I don't -- I don't find 

    

   

  

 

 

 

8 

it that -- that perplexing.  When your -- your version 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have messed up -- when you tried to -- tried to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put it all in 33(A), it would have -- by saying just a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church plan, it would have redefined all of (A), which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had a second compound definition it -- of it had to be a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tax exempt under Section 501. 

 

 

 

 

            

But, Justice Kagan, let me cut to the chase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  If I had started from scratch, I don't know if I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have done this better.  I doubt it, because it's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so complicated.  But let's look at what actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened in 1974 and how -- just how different (C) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself looks.  Because, remember, they started in 1974, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there was an (A) and there was a subparagraph C. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And now we still have subparagraph C.  So they were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working with an existing apparatus. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, old subparagraph C, itself, expressly 

 

 

 

 

 

required the church to establish C plans.  And these C 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans had to include the church's own actual employees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And Congress did two huge things in paragraph C now.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eliminated not only the express church establishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement, but the very reason for that requirement in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first place; namely, that these plans include the

church's own employees. 

 

 

9 

            

So what we have now today, and I don't think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is disputed, we know -- the one thing we do know is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that (C)(i) plans can be maintained wholly and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely and absolutely outside the church and can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include solely, completely, and wholly outside the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church all the employees of any tax-exempt, religiously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affiliated employer. 

 

            

So it just defies both common sense and our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background understanding under ERISA to require the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church to establish someone else's benefit plans when we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know employers are usually the ones who set the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment benefits for their own employees. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's not the problem with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your reading.  This (C)(i) seems to be predominantly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about principal-purpose organizations.  And I think the 

   

  

 

 

 

Respondent suggests that you would like it to read -- as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reproduced on page 27 of their brief, you would like it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say includes a plan maintained by an organization 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlled by or associated with a church.  But this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

provision seems to be giving authority to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal-purpose organizations and not to entities 

 

 

 

 

 

controlled by or associated. 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Right.  Well, you're absolutely 

  

  

 

 

 

right except for the point about how I would like it to

does is it -- and there's no question that our reading

organization.  We concede that an absolute full 

  

 

 

 

 

 

requirement is that the plan must be maintained by an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organization, whether external or internal, that has its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal purpose the administration or funding of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan. 

            

But, Justice Ginsburg, the definition of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal-purpose organization includes a plan for any 

   

 

 

 

 

employee of a church.  An employee of a church is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

defined expressly in (C)(ii) to mean any employee not of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a church; namely, any church-affiliated, tax-exempt 

 

 

 

 

 

organization.  So whether it's a pension board that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

either sitting in the hospital or religious charity or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a pension board that's externally incorporated, 

   

 

 

 

 

Congress made sure that the maintaining organization, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the one with control over the funds and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administration itself, has to be religiously affiliated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this is a tricky 

   

  

 

 

 

question, but is this the question that was decided by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the courts of appeals and is it the question that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreed to review? 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  No.  No.  So on remand, they 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

have an argument that, assuming we win, and that there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

11 

no formal requirement that the church establish the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan, that the maintaining organization in this case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these retirement committees, don't qualify. 

 

 

 

 

            

But I do think it's -- it's quite important 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to understand that, Justice Ginsburg, when Congress was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafting this maintaining by a PPO, or principal-purpose 

   

 

 

 

 

 

organization, it was merely defining exactly what before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and after 1980 and, regardless of the church plan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, what every employment pension plan in America 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks like.  They're being maintained by either a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate retirement committee or a separately 

   

 

 

 

incorporated retirement committee. 

 

 

            

Now, the other -- what I think, Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alito, they were trying to say, it's anomalous that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan could be established by the hospital, but it has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be run by a -- you know, an internal committee that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either controlled or affiliated with a church.  But the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

anomalies are exponentially, you know, monstrous on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side.  Justice Ginsburg, in their view, Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entrusted a pension board to have control over all the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administration and the funding, but didn't allow it to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish the plan, which is absurd given the historical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context that pension boards were both establishing and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintaining. 

            

The other thing that's anomalous about

their -- their proposal is it leaves out in the cold the

nuns and it assumes that Congress rebuffed every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious denomination in America who complained to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress about how the IRS had been interpreting this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision.  And so what the IRS had done in 1977 is it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked at a -- it was attempting to define what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutes a church.  And the IRS ruled that because 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

nuns were not -- two orders of Catholic nuns were not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the church when they were caring for the sick, their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospital plan could not be covered. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Ms. Blatt, I -- putting 

   

  

 

 

 

aside that purpose, do you think Congress had in mind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- corporations that are essentially like every other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation except they're not for profit?  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

these hospitals, some of them, like Dignity, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Catholic church has disavowed any formal affiliation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with it. 

 

            

ahead. 

            

MS. BLATT:  Well, let me just -- sorry.  Go 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that -- is that -- do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you think that -- I understand the nuns, but you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking now about an extreme. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Well, the nuns established 

  

 

 

 

 

Dignity, and a priest established St. Peter's, or a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

bishop, rather.  So -- but let me just get back to the

plan at issue. 

 

 

13 

            

            

In 1977 --

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The nuns may have, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they're -- no longer are affiliated with the church. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  I'm happy to argue the facts of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dignity and we can -- I mean, that is an argument the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side on remand. 

 

 

 

            

But the place where Congress dealt with your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern about the institution that's not religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough was not with establishment, but (C)(iv) requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any church plan that's -- that's being maintained by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these affiliated organizations to have common bonds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- common religious bonds and convictions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, Dignity itself has that in spades.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has six orders, not one, not two, not three, not four, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not five, six orders of women religious running its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mission integrity committee --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not going to fight 

  

 

 

 

 

 

over --

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Okay.  Well, Dignity --

  

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that.  I -- but let's 

    

  

 

 

 

 

go back to my basic question.  They're not doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything different than any other hospital. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Well, that -- that --

center.  They are competing.  They're the fifth largest 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

healthcare provider in the nation.  They have 60,000 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

employees.  Do you believe that Congress's vision was to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let, what is essentially, a corporate entity opt out of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protecting all of those employees? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  I mean, the Roman Catholic 

    

 

 

 

 

church is itself, I assume, some sort of corporate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity.  But let me get to the bottom line here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If you read Paul Clement's brief filed by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Catholic church itself and the brief filed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United Church of Christ and the Evangelical Lutheran 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Church of America and the Seventh-Day Adventists, that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four churches, your decision applies to big and small, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medium, extra-religious, nonreligious.  So whatever you 

  

 

 

 

 

think of Dignity -- and I have no doubt that it's --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's both -- it has both Catholic bonds and Catholic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affiliations.  But there's nothing about the size of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  We know Congress had in mind a hospital plan. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The word "hospital" appears on every page of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative history. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Blatt, I'd like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to get to your question about -- the point you raised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier on about the significance of the interpretation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the IRS, the pension benefit board, and who -- what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other one?  The IRS --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah. 

  

 

 

MS. BLATT:  -- pension benefit. 

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What are the limits 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of that proposition?  I mean, I don't quite understand, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

you're saying because these three government agencies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted the statute one way, we shouldn't be more --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we should be inclined to interpret it that way? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Yes.  I think that reliance is 

    

  

 

 

 

 

an important -- important reason why you should defer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Skidmore.  And --

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  It's just --

  

  

 

 

 

 

maybe it's that I've never understood Skidmore.  To me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyway, as it's been articulated, it seems to be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle as you should defer to agencies when you agree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with their interpretation. 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And -- and I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

see --

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Yeah.  Well, Skidmore actually 

  

  

 

 

 

says --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, the statute 

    

 

 

 

 

means -- the statute means what it means, and it's nice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that these agencies have interpreted it your way.  But I

think we have to go back and interpret the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ourselves. 

            

MS. BLATT:  Of course.  But, I mean, 

   

  

  

 

 

16 

Skidmore is still a decision, and it says what you said. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But it says anything you find persuasive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But the IRS --

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why should it be 

  

 

 

 

 

persuasive?  I mean, you faulted, I think, the courts of 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

appeals.  You -- you described their opinions as thinly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasoned.  But that DCM that started it all from the IRS 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is certainly thinly reasoned. 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  So let me go back to what our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument is under the IRS.  They prompted the amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by trying to say what a church was.  Congress responded 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not by telling the IRS what the church was or that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nuns for the church, but by making that question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrelevant.  The IRS objected and immediately after the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

law was passed, started reverse course on the very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non-plan at issue here. 

 

 

 

            

But let me get to the reason about Skidmore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what this case is about.  In just two of these cases, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice, the Respondents seek 11 billion; I am 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not kidding, 11 billion per year.  That's $66 billion in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two cases if ERISA's six-year statute of limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies.  The risk that the other side could recover,

even any fraction of that amount, is reason enough for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

you to make sure that the IRS's decision is somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable, that would jettison 30 years of settled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expectations. 

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, back to the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, quite -- quite apart 

  

 

 

 

 

 

from the IRS reasonable.  The response says -- know that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there were, I assume, hundreds of IRS letters, and it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was because of -- of -- of this problem that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acted.  Without getting into the legislative history, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which I found totally uninformative, is -- is there --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why is it that we can give so much weight to these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letters when there was no notice and comment regulation?

Congress introduced the bills in response to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

religious community, and immediately after -- and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pension Rights Center that's an amicus was testifying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's -- it's just -- it's silly to think that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't know how to use the Internet, at least by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whenever the Internet came around, and couldn't figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out -- or go to the library and didn't -- couldn't read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a private letter ruling. 

 

 

 

            

But I -- I think the significance is -- it's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

not just even the retroactive penalties.  Countless 

  

 

 

 

 

 

plans have been structured around the IRS, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department of Labor, and the PBGC's view, and if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirm, just for all the existing plans that were not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established, you're unleashing a torrent of undesirable 

   

 

 

 

 

and unintended consequences, not just for the -- the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hospital --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My question is:  What can 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you point to, to tell us that the IRS letters were an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important part of the motivation for Congress to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this change? 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  Okay.  So it was the IRS's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

ruling under -- for the 1977 Catholic nun plan, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 -- I think 20 letters and the Church Alliance 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representing over 27 denominations, 50 million people, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complained bitterly to Congress.  The entire -- I know

you don't want to look at legislative history, but every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single thing is about how hospitals and church agencies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are part of and essential to the church.  And the only

way, Justice Kennedy, to interpret that is that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were talking about the IRS's definition that because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nuns were not performing priestly functions, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't the church.  And I just think -- so the IRS was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the table.  The IRS is objecting.  The IRS goes home 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and starts immediately reversing course.  And you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that the -- I mean, we've talked about the IRS. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The other side concedes that another major 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose was to put congregational religions on parity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with hierarchical congregations.  And we know that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1974 Act excluded these pension board-established 

 

 

 

 

 

and maintained plans.  And under Repondents' 

  

 

 

 

 

interpretations, these plans too were left out in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cold. 

            

We know that since the 1900s, these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Protestant pension boards were not only maintaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans they established, but plans that their church 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies had established. 

 

 

            

            

If I could reserve the rest of my time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

I'd like to first to pick up on a point that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms. Blatt alluded to when she was describing the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history of the statute and its amendment.  I think the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute in its current form is probably not the type of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision that Congress would draft if it were doing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole thing in one fell swoop.  But it's important to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand that the text of the -- the current provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the combination of things that were done in 1974 and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that were done in 1980. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress enacted the original church plan 

 

 

 

 

 

provision.  Presumably, it had in mind particular plans 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that were established and maintained by churches and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered those; and pretty quickly, problems came to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

light.  Other types of plans were found not to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered by the administrative agency that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidently believed should be covered.  And so when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress amended the provision in 1980, it chose to work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the existing framework.  We're not quite sure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why, but at least one plausible explanation would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there were some church plans that had been found to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered under the old "established and maintained by a

church" language.  Congress may have wanted to avoid any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible inference that those plans were no longer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered, and so it retained the original language, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined it to include something else. 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

And when Congress passed the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision that Ms. Blatt was discussing earlier, (C)(i), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that refers to a plan established and maintained for its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees includes a plan maintained by a principal 

   

   

 

 

 

purpose organization, I -- I think it's -- it's helpful 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

to recognize that there are two different sorts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitional provisions that Congress sometimes enacts. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Sometimes when Congress enacts a definition, 

   

 

 

 

it's trying to clarify what the defined term really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means.  And when Congress acts in that way, we tend to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strain to read the definition in a way that makes it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent with ordinary understandings of a defined 

   

 

 

 

 

term.  But sometimes Congress will enact a provision 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that says something like the -- for purposes of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, the term "State" includes the District of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Columbia and Puerto Rico.  When Congress does that, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not trying to explain what State really means; it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply using a shorthand formulation to say, for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of this statute, we want D.C. and Puerto Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be treated the same way that the 50 States would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated.  And that's really what Congress was doing in

the 1980 amendment. 

 

 

22 

            

When it defined the term "plan established 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and maintained by a church" to include plans that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied the prerequisites in the amendments, it -- it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not saying this is what a plan established and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintained by a church really is.  It was saying, for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of the exempt -- of the church plan exemption, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we want these to be treated the same. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stewart, can I ask you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

about some of the Respondents' hypotheticals where they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offer hypothetical statutes that are very similar in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structure to this one?  And it's pretty clear that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would read, you know, the one about disabled veterans 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the one about the two presidential criteria, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's pretty clear that you would read those sentences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their way rather than your way; in other words, as just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to one of the criteria.  And I'm wondering why you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that's true, that they can come up with these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypotheticals that so clearly should be interpreted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their way rather than your way. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  I guess I would say about 

    

   

 

 

 

the -- the hypothetical that is used most often -- most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

often, person disabled and a veteran includes a member 

   

   

 

 

 

 

of the National Guard.  I think if you read it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely literally, you would still say a National

Guard member who is not disabled is covered.  Now, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

think the --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, that would seem 

    

 

 

 

 

ridiculous, right? 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  I think the instinct -- the --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the context would be such that courts would assume, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe, that Congress had simply made a -- a sort of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrivener's error, that Congress had used language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sloppily. 

            

Part -- part of that has to do with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instinct that I -- I alluded to earlier.  That is, we 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

would tend to regard a provision like that as one in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which Congress was really trying to explain what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term "person who is disabled and a veteran" means, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so we would strain to read the definition in a way that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made it consistent.  If Congress passed a statute that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

said something like:  Person who is disabled and a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

veteran shall include any Federal employee with 30 years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or more of service, at -- at that point, we would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand Congress has just abandoned the effort to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain what person who is disabled and a veteran 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually means.  It has decided for whatever reason that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it wants employees with -- Federal employees with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unusually long service to get the same benefits as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled veteran would get under a particular statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

and has used shorthand to -- to accomplish that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  See, I -- I would think that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

24 

the way that hypothetical works, it's sort of -- we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

setting these two criteria, you have to be a veteran and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to be disabled, and then we're going to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a special case of veterans.  We also mean to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

include National Guard folks, and that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disqualifying, the fact that it's a National Guard 

   

 

 

 

 

 

folks.  But the two criteria are still the two criteria. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All we're suggesting is that it's not disqualifying that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are a National Guard.  And you could read this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

language similarly.  It's not disqualifying that it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

maintained by a different kind of organization. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  I guess I -- all I would 

    

   

   

 

 

concede based on these hypotheticals is that sometimes a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision that is structured in this way will give rise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the natural inference that Congress wanted to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something other than simply deem a particular thing to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fall within the whole defined term and that it had in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind a part. 

   

            

But I think, in construing this provision, 

   

 

 

 

 

it may be helpful to look at page 24 of the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief which explains -- which kind of clarifies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that Ms. Blatt was referring to earlier, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that on page 24 of the -- the government's

brief, we lay out the way in which this amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

changed from the time it was first introduced in 1979 to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it was enacted in 1980. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And as the questioning in the first part of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your argument explained, the original introduced 

 

 

 

 

 

provision said a plan established and maintained by a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

church shall include a plan established and maintained 

   

 

 

 

 

 

by a principal-purpose organization.  And so the -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

words "established and" appeared two places in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduced provision.  And as -- we agree with Ms. Blatt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the most likely explanation for what -- why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress took out the -- the second "established and" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was that it was worried about plans that would fall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between two stools, a plan that was established by a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church, but maintained by a principal-purpose 

   

 

 

 

organization.  That the --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  The -- the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical would be like this case, or this case would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be like the hypothetical.  If the requirement that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan be established by the church was absolutely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical, as the requirement that the -- the individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a disability is absolutely critical in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical, which gets to the question:  What is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significance, in practical terms, of a plan's being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

established by a church?

Now, Mr. Feldman says that an entity that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establishes a plan is financially responsible for paying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

26 

benefits under the plan if the plan is unable to do that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with its assets.  But you say that's not correct; is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that right? 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  That's not correct.  I mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

in -- in the typical ERISA case, you will have a plan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established and maintained by a single employer, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that employer will be responsible for making good on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

promises, and -- and that employer may be a defendant in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a suit if the promises are breached.  But that doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean that the entity that established as the plan qua 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"establisher" is always going to be on the hook. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

It -- it in --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Sometimes on the hook? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. STEWART:  Sometimes on the hook, if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

establisher maintains ongoing responsibility.  But 

  

 

 

 

there's -- first, there's no reason to think, even if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you applied ERISA standards, that a church that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

established the plan, but then left the administration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the plan entirely in the hands of somebody else, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be held liable under ERISA. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second, the whole point of the church plan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption is that plans that qualify will not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulated under ERISA at all.  They will be regulated

under State law.  So if a church, in order to satisfy 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

this requirement, established the plan and then left its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintenance to somebody else, whether the church would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have any ongoing liability would depend on State laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that might vary around the country.  So --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Can you -- can you tell me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what provision of ERISA -- and I'll ask Mr. Feldman the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same thing if I have the chance -- what provision of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA explains which entity, if any, is responsible for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paying benefits if, for example, a defined benefit plan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is unable to do that with the assets in the plan? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  I -- I don't believe there is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

a provision of ERISA that spells that out.  My 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding -- and I'm -- I'm sorry, I don't have the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory cite -- is that there is a provision of ERISA 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that authorizes the plan beneficiaries to sue, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't specify who the defendant should be.  And so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the courts have devised tests and approaches to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine in particular cases who the proper defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is.  And to some extent, that will depend upon the way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the plan itself is constructed; that is, the plan may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that the responsibility for doing certain things is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that of the employer, for doing other things, it may be

determine on where responsibility is allocated under the

terms of the plan. 

 

 

 

28 

            

And -- but so I agree that one big 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference between this case and the hypotheticals is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the hypothetical is constructed in a way that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests disability has to be crucial to entitlement to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits, whereas here, there's no reason to think that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress, in 1980, regarded church establishment as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crucial to the exemption. 

 

 

 

            

And -- and the point I was trying to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

make about -- was going to make about --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but I guess that's the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question, right? 

 

            

            

same. 

            

MR. STEWART:  But -- but --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And the structure is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. STEWART:  I -- I guess the point I was 

    

   

   

 

 

 

going to make about -- if I -- if I could finish this? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

MR. STEWART:  -- about the way in which the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute changed from introduction to final passage is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that everyone agrees that Congress could have more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly achieved the objective that Respondent says they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were trying to achieve if it had said a plan maintained 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by a church includes a plan maintained by a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

principal-purpose organization.  And so the idea seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

to be Congress was just a little bit careless in leaving 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in "established and maintained" at the beginning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

            

That seems particularly implausible given 

 

 

 

 

the care they took to knock out the second iteration of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"established and" in the same provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Feldman. 

 

            

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Mr. Chief --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Feldman, I have a 

   

  

 

 

 

starting question, which is I'm torn.  This could be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read either way in my mind.  If I believe that, what do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I go to, to break the tie? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I think if you look at what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress was -- this is what I would say.  If you accept 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their view, what you end up with is a statute that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't fit what Congress enacted at all and creates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anomalies that are impossible to explain.  And for those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons at least, as well as the fact that Congress was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very jealous about creating exemptions to ERISA, ERISA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covers every private employer, every non-profit, every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospital in the country, and there's only one -- except 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is only one category excluded, and that's church 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans.  And Congress actually defined church plans

carefully.  They wanted a close tie between the church 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

30 

and the plan because their purpose was they didn't want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to go involved in -- get involved in church affairs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so they said church plan has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established and -- established and maintained by a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church.  It needs to fit both criteria because we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want -- if there's church involvement here, we want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hands off.  If there's no church involvement, though, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no reason why these hospitals, like any other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospital in the country, and like many other -- every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other firm in the country shouldn't have to provide the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees with the pension insurance to protect them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against the possibility that when the plan goes bust, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they end up with nothing --

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isn't there --

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't Congress provide for church involvement by making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the employees covered by the principal-purpose entity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church employees? 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  No, it's actually -- well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just -- no, it didn't, actually.  The -- the -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute actually doesn't say anything about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal-purpose entity. 

 

            

So there's three different kinds of things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are talking about here.  There are churches 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves, there's principal-purpose organizations,

which are organizations that are in -- in the business 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

of just giving --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, the -- the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

church agency employees. 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  And the church --

  

  

 

 

 

 

it -- it -- what it said was, yes, it's -- it's -- was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facing a problem in 1980, which was the original statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said if you're a church, you can cover not only your own 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees, but you can also cover the employees of your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church agencies.  That's what the original statute said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but only until 1982.  And that is what everybody was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objecting to, and that's why people was -- people were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objecting to the withdrawal of that sunset provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was going to happen in 1982. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the reason why they were talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies are very closely related to churches, that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a -- it was not to say -- their view is Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to allow fishing.  They wanted these agencies to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

split up -- these plans to split apart, and the agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have their own plan and the church to have their own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan, and that's what they wanted.  But it's exactly the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite.  They wanted to allow churches to continue, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they had been, to provide -- to have a plan that would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cover both the churches' employees and the agencies' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees.  And they -- they were interested in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

continued fusion.  They weren't interested in fishing. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

32 

And actually, there's nobody anywhere who talked about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this statute who said, well, what we really need is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow another whole class of private entities to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish their own plans. 

 

 

 

            

So in the provision that Your Honor referred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, where they -- they say, well, the employees of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church-associated agency will be deemed to be employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the churches, Congress passed that provision to solve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly the 1982 problem.  Okay?  The -- a church plan 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

has to be established and maintained by a church -- this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is in (A), which was left unchanged -- established and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintained by a church for its employees.  And then in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the original statute they said:  Well, we don't really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care whose employees they are, but you also can cover 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the church agency --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If that -- if that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were so evident, why do the three government agencies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible in this area -- the IRS, the Department of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Labor, the PBGC -- why for 30 years did they take the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite view? 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, it's -- they took this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

view in the early 1980s at a time when they were facing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one or two -- I -- I'm not sure they knew at the time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when they started down this road what it was going to

lead to in terms of the hundreds of hospitals and other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

businesses that were going to be able to just deprive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

their employees of ERISA benefits. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it -- but it led to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it led to hundreds of letters from the IRS.  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there -- is that an exaggeration or is that -- aren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there hundreds of IRS letters approving --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  That's true.  And actually, 

  

  

 

 

 

the first -- the mother of them all, which was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general counsel memorandum from '82, '83, it says this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may not be relied upon or cited as precedent.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute that authorized all these private letter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulings, which were all done on an ex parte basis and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without the opportunity --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but nevertheless, 

  

 

 

 

 

it shows that an entity that had one of these plans that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- where there was some doubt was proceeding in good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith with the -- with the assurance of the IRS that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what they were doing was lawful. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Yes.  And that entitled them 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to exactly what it was supposed to -- the government had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that "this may not be relied upon" language because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't want to be bound to this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That -- that's 

  

 

 

 

 

standard language in a private letter ruling, isn't it?

MR. FELDMAN:  There's nothing --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So there is nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

special about this. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When this goes on and on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite without reference to the legislative history to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which senator said what, which I think is unhelpful.  We 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do know that the climate, the culture, the economic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem after 30 years was that many of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

associations, which are preceded in good faith based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the IRS, were at risk of tremendous liability.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a -- certainly a reason for -- for understanding, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

A, why Congress acted, and B, the problem it wanted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solve in the way the Petitioner said it did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I -- Your Honor, I don't 

    

   

   

 

 

 

think that that's right.  So these cases are about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primarily overwhelmingly forward-looking remedies. 

 

 

 

They're about bringing these plans into accord with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA to get an insurance for these plans so that their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees can be sure that they get their benefits when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're supposed to get them. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, wasn't Ms. Blatt 

  

 

 

 

 

incorrect when she said that the complaints seek

MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  The complaint -- we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

35 

don't know all the facts of these cases.  But I --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what --

 

            

question? 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the answer to my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  Yes.  They -- well, they --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

they don't actually name -- I don't believe they name a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollar figure for the penalty. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they -- if you figured 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

out the penalties, would they be billions of dollars? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  No one has ever --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Then how can you say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is primarily about forward-looking things? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Because I think that everybody 

   

  

 

 

 

admit -- admits in this case -- not everybody admits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The statute -- the authority to issue penalties is in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court's discretion.  And the -- the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nobody has ever -- no court has ever, I don't think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued -- had an ERISA penalty close to that.  And this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has repeatedly emphasized that when you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressing a remedy under -- under 502(a)(3) or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

502(c)(3), you're supposed to take into account the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equities of the situation.  So the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And one equity would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the reliance.  One court might well say:  Well, we read 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the statute the way the courts of appeals have, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not going to give you any retrospective relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because you legitimately, in good faith, relied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I completely agree.  And 

    

   

  

 

 

36 

I think the good faith of the party is actually --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I understand that.  But, I 

    

  

 

 

 

mean, you said that this is primarily -- oh, don't worry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the penalties; this is primarily about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward-looking things.  And yet the complaints asked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for the penalties.  Are you willing on behalf of your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clients to disavow any requests for penalties? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  No, I'm not. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Then how can you say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's primarily about forward-looking. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Because --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- remedies. 

  

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  I can say that because we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

don't know the facts of this case.  I'm willing to say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if all the facts suggested that they acted in good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith throughout and just made a mistake and they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't have been expected to do anything else, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I would think they wouldn't be awarded --

reliance was reasonable based on these hundreds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

letters, that's one thing.  How about relying on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

literal meaning of the central statutory provision? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Yes.  And then I think that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

the literal meaning of that, as all three courts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals unanimously agreed, the literal meaning of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- this is not a -- a standalone statute that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

says -- there are statutes in the U.S. code that say --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that don't define a term, and then they say, but a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony includes something or other.  Okay?  They don't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

define "felony," they just say a felony includes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

something or other.  That's one kind of statute.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then courts are supposed to figure out what else a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony includes. 

 

            

But this statute doesn't do that.  And in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, the language at the beginning of (C)(i), a plan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established and maintained by a church, ties it to --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- you actually can't read (C)(i) as a standalone 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, because it wouldn't make any sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'm talking about --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  It ties it to a --

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- the literal language of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

(C)(i), and you're now talking about everything else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The literal language of (C)(i) says:  A plan established 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

and maintained by a church includes a plan that is

maintained by a principal-purpose organization. 

   

 

 

38 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And it's as simple as that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that read literally, it is not required that it be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established --

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  And --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- by a church.  Now, you 

   

  

  

 

 

 

have other arguments, but --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I -- Your Honor, I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

respectfully disagree.  The Court -- if the Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said one thing more often than anything else in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of statutory interpretation, it's that you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to read things in context and you have to read statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a whole.  And this (C)(i) has language that ties it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly back to A, which Congress said in 1980, we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retaining A the way it is.  And I think you have to read 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them both together. 

 

 

            

If you read them both together, what you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say -- the basic form is whether it's the example of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled veterans, the present or the examples that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give in the reply brief, the basic form of this is if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have a statute that says here's a rule that applies 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to A and B, and then it says A and B includes a 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular kind of B -- which is what this says, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? -- established and maintained includes a

particular kind of maintenance, then that is naturally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

taken to mean, well, we're -- we're --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why would you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  -- we're qualifying the B, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not doing anything to the A. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why would you repeat the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

requirement of the A?  In other words, Congress could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have just said a plan maintained by a church includes a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan maintained by one of these organizations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  And --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right.  And that -- so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

another way of asking the question is, under your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation, established and have no -- have no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

function. 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I actually don't think 

    

   

 

 

 

that that's quite right.  They could have worded this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other ways.  They certainly could have worded the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute in many other ways to accomplish Respondents' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position -- Petitioners' position -- positioning. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But this -- the point of repeating that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language was directly to tie it -- it was one way to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly tie it back into A and say:  Okay, now we're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about these things.  We want to include a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular kind of B.  Now, that is one thing to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice -- it's not B -- it doesn't say -- I mean, and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

40 

Petitioners have no answer for this at all, why Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to have -- require them to have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal-purpose organization at all.  Churches don't 

  

 

 

 

 

have to have that.  And why did Congress trust them to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish their own plans and then say, but we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually -- you can establish your plans, Dignity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hospital, but you don't have to maintain the plan -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't maintain.  We are prohibiting you from maintaining 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your plan.  You have to go to a principal -- an agency 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's principally involved in dealing with employee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits that otherwise satisfies the requirements, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to have them maintain it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  From your --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  And there's no --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- your perspective, 

  

 

 

 

 

what is the practical significance of requiring that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- excuse me -- plans be established by a church? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I think the practical 

    

 

 

 

significance is Congress's purpose here -- and, again, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think this is in dispute, and there's no other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose that's been suggested, was hands off the church. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If a church is involved with a plan, we don't -- we 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't -- we want to have -- leave them the freedom to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside of ERISA.  But there's no church involved.  When 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no church involved, as there is in this case,

the church has --

 

 

 

41 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  But --

  

  

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  -- no direct involvement --

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- well, but you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I guess you began with that, and the church is involved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent the law says that the principal purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- agency is maintaining that fund for people who are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined to be church employees. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  But the --

  

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you can't say the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

church is not involved in that -- in the situation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before us. 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  No.  Actually -- I think you 

   

  

  

 

 

 

can.  But what I'm saying is the church itself, these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees who are so defined are actually employees of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the church agency.  But the church itself has no --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the church --

  

 

 

 

 

 

the church --

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  -- zero involvement with this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

plan.  There's nothing that says the church shall be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deemed to have established the plan or the church --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that these -- these plans have zero involvement with any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church.

MR. FELDMAN:  They do.  And --

  

  

 

 

 

42 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I thought the 

   

  

 

 

 

whole concern with the original IRS problem was that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IRS was treating church agencies as if they were not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged in a church function. 

   

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  No.  I --

    

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They were saying --

  

 

 

 

 

 

they were saying, okay, the -- the church has an agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whose mission is to, you know, feed the hungry, clothe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the naked, all of that, and the IRS was saying, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's not a church; it's got nothing to do with it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And now it's changed and those -- those individuals that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are engaged in that social mission are treated as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members of the church agency. 

 

 

 

 

            

that the --

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  They are treated that way so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The church agency. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  They are doing that so that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the church can include them in its plan if they wanted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that -- if the church wants to do that, that's fine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they can do that.  But -- but they're not -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point of that provision was to eliminate the 1982 cutoff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that wouldn't have allowed the churches -- the churches 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to continue to do that.

MR. FELDMAN:  And the churches --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's go to that 1982. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

43 

Tell me how your reading of the statute includes the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organizations that were clamoring and for whom the IRS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had said were covered by this provision:  The pension 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boards that were separate from the church, and Ms. Blatt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed to the sisters, the nuns, who were also seeking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coverage.  How does your reading take care of those two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations facing Congress? 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I think it actually perfectly 

    

 

 

 

 

matches with those two situations.  The (C)(ii) and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(C)(iii) provisions, as I said, they allow churches to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue if they wanted to cover church agencies and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eliminate the 1982 cutoff that people were concerned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about.  The (C)(i) provision said that was not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision about let's drastically expand the types of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entities that are -- and by millions of employees, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

types of employees who don't have ERISA protection. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This was what Representative Conable termed a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

technical --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I would have thought 

   

  

 

 

 

that the -- the one thing that seems most clear from a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty murky legislative history is the church pension 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boards were supposed to be included in this.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church pension boards, some of them were established --

their plans were established by the church, some of them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not.  So you would be taking out some of these church 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pension boards that I thought are the sort of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

quintessential group that this was designed to include. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I really -- I disagree 

    

   

   

 

 

with the premise of that.  If you look back, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no -- there is nothing in the legislative history that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, you know, anybody -- there's -- let me say this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correctly.  You know, there's a few stray references in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

letters from pension boards saying yeah, we established 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a plan.  But we actually go over each of the ones in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, and these are the ones that they cite, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're actually -- Congress had no -- that was not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way they operated then.  It's actually not the way they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operate now. 

 

            

The way they operate is, these are for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congregational churches primarily, and in a 

 

 

 

 

 

congregational type of set up, you have an assembly or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

synod of the church itself, and this is just an assembly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of all the local churches and they -- they will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish the plans.  But if they don't have the --

important in your view of it.  So and -- I didn't see 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

any statutory definition of what it takes to establish a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan. 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  And as -- as this Court -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Halifax case, I think, establishes it.  It means making 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a commitment to provide some kind of a reasonably 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

definite benefits over -- to -- in under -- to some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees, you know, reasonably well defined.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what it means. 

 

 

            

If you don't make that commitment, if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say the church said we want somebody else to have a plan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and lay out what the terms would be, actually the church 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would definitely not have established the plan.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be somebody else who if they took them up on it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would. 

            

But for the church to establish a plan, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case is actually -- the Dignity case is a perfect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example.  The district court here -- and it's usually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a difficult inquiry.  The district court here found, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and if you look around page 56A of the cert petition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix, in the Dignity case, the district court said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, who established this plan, well, Dignity, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospital, they passed a corporate resolution and they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

adopted a summary -- the appropriate corporate officers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

adopted a summary plan description, and they established

the plan and that committed Dignity to doing certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

things, and it wasn't somebody else who did it.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's usually what that inquiry is.  You need some kind 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of commitment. 

 

            

Now, Congress -- Congress, when that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commitment was made by a church, Congress said we want 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hands off, and they had good reasons for doing it.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very much like in the tax code, there's numerous other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

places where you have to distinguish between churches 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and church agencies. 

 

 

            

In Section 26 U.S.C. 7611, gives churches 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite extraordinary protection against audits, against 

 

 

 

 

 

the circumstances under which they can be audited, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

types of things that can be looked at and the rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they have during the audit.  It applies only to churches 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not to agencies, and the principle is the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle here.  We don't want the government looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the books and records of churches, and I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that --

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in the situation where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the church establishes the plan and then turns over the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintenance of the plan to a principal-purpose 

   

 

 

 

 

organization, the audits would be the books of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal-purpose organization.  There wouldn't be very 

  

 

 

 

 

much to look for in the records of the church.

So if that's the -- if that was the purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of it, I don't see what the establishment requirement --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I would think that it's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

47 

more than just looking at the books and records at that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular time.  There being -- when the church is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is establishing a plan, it's making some kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

commitment of what kind of benefits who's going to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and when.  That's what it means to establish a -- a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan, and how it's going to be funded.  And it might --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But you say -- where --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where do I look to find that?  And where do I look to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find the provision that says what you say, which is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the entity that establishes the plan is financially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible? 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  The -- the financially -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

financially responsible to the extent that what it says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it established the plan.  I mean, I suppose, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

especially if it's not --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's -- it's responsible --

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's responsible to the extent the plan makes it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible?  Is that the answer? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  It -- it's -- it's -- under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA, plans can't limit their liability.  But, I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I -- the -- the person -- parties establishing plans 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't.

But under -- if it's not an ERISA plan, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably can have provisions that say we're only going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

to give you what's -- the money that's in the plan --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But where is the 

  

 

 

 

 

provision that --

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  But they still have to make a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commitment and that would be governed by, presumably, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case of non-ERISA plan, by state law.  But --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But where is the provision 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of ERISA that supports what you said, which is -- it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to me to be a significant point, that the entity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that establishes the plan is financially responsible for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the plan.  What is the provision of ERISA --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  It makes --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- that says that? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  It -- I think it's -- I can't 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

cite it to you right now, the -- the number, but it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the provision that says you have to carry out the terms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a plan and what it --

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought 

    

 

 

Mr. Stewart suggested the opposite. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  No.  He -- I don't think so. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

I believe he -- he said the employees can sue -- if it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an ERISA you can sue under 502 for what -- whatever the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits are that you're -- you've been promised.  So --

MR. FELDMAN:  You could -- you -- first of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all, frequently they are the same.  But if they are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different, it certainly would defer --

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, in this case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they are not, right? 

 

 

 

            

actually. 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  In this case I think they are, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

about -- I thought the principal-purpose agency is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

one that --

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  The -- the principal --

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- is the one that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintaining --

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right, and the 

  

 

 

 

principal-purpose agency in these cases is an internal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committee of -- of Petitioners, so I don't think there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be any difference in suing -- I think you would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue Petitioners.  That is all that -- there wouldn't --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is nobody else to sue. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But I -- I guess you would sue both of them,

committee of a church-affiliated organization qualify as 

   

 

 

 

 

50 

a principal purpose organization? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  We believe that it can't. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And, in fact, there would be no reason at all for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress to have -- we -- a part -- according to my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend, Congress wanted to be sure that whoever is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintaining the plan is somebody who is associated with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the church. 

 

            

But there was no reason to talk about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal-purpose, employee benefit organizations that 

 

 

 

 

are primarily involved in employee benefits if that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you wanted to accomplish.  The only -- the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- this makes sense if you look at it as something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that congregational denominations were doing as of 1980, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is they found it convenient to have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintenance of the plan done by an organization that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an employee benefits organization and nobody objected to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  They said that's fine.  Mr. Halperin didn't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

object to it; nobody did.  That's fine if you want to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if that's a convenient way to -- they were talking about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how to run a plan, not opening up the plan to a broad 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

range -- not opening up the exemption to a broad range 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of plans and probably millions of employees.

many -- how many employees did come in under the IRS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation for 30 years that wouldn't have come in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had the IRS followed yours, if you know?  About, just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rough hand. 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I would assume all of them. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I would like to get 

    

   

 

 

 

 

a rough idea of what you are talk -- we're talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about, because your argument practically depends on if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we keep following the IRS interpretation there will be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vast numbers of plans that come in that wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise.  They followed it for 30 years. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd like to get a rough, empirical idea of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

how many have come in because they didn't accept your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation, how many employees are -- are exempt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that wouldn't have otherwise been. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  They say that there 

  

  

 

 

 

 

are a million employees that have been in these plans. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Actually, though, there's probably millions or more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees in the future, once this Court reaches a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision that --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  Why won't they be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

kept out by the principal purpose definition unless they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really are the Little Sisters of the Poor? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  They wouldn't be kept out any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than -- than Petitioners in this case, would they?

which ones come in and which ones don't.

you don't know. 

 

 

            

haven't --

MR. FELDMAN:  -- all these cases haven't

another -- I have another thing I want to know.

it's established by the Little Sisters of the Poor, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out? 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  That's -- that's right, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

54 

the reason is because Congress --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. FELDMAN:  -- what Congress was most 

  

 

 

 

 

 

concerned about here was not going into the church's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

books and records.  These agencies like the Petitioners, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

these -- their books and records are open to the public, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're open to --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That is true.  But, I mean, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

if it's a legitimate organization like, let's say the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Little Sisters of the Poor, really affiliated with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church, you know, really affiliated with the church, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they do have a lot of involvement --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  And if they really are part of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the church, I would add one other thing.  If they really 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, they really are the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

church, and they retained a -- purpose. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  -- part of the church and they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can qualify as a church, that's fine.  They can't --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this line between churches and church agencies is one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that gets drawn throughout the law.  It gets drawn in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seven or eight provisions of the U.S. Code --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the whole 

    

 

 

 

 

55 

purpose was to avoid that inquiry.  I mean, that was the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistake that the IRS made, is that it was saying these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church agencies were actually not part of the church --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I thought --

    

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- because they 

  

 

 

 

 

weren't engaged in sacerdotal or whatever activities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the IRS thought characterized what a church should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

be. 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I just don't think that that's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

what the problem was.  The problem was that they were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facing a 1982 deadline after which church agencies would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not have been able to be in a -- in a plan, no matter 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who did what for anything, and the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

the tenor --

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What the -- what was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  -- of that. 

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What was the tenor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the hundreds and hundreds of letters that -- that

did they understand the IRS to be doing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  So, if you look at the 20 --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on page, I think, 10,054 or so of the congressional

letters that Senator Talmadge put in the record.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked at them.  Of those, six of them used the term 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Internal Revenue Service."  But the Internal Revenue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Service, at that time, was promulgating regulations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is not about the Little Sisters of the Poor.  None 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of them mentioned that.  In fact, there's no mention of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Little Sisters -- or the sisters who had the plan in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New Jersey.  There's no mention of that at all. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you saying that the only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of the amendment was to avoid the sunset 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision? 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I think there were two 

    

 

 

 

 

purposes.  There's C(ii) and C(iii) --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So the --

  

  

 

 

 

 

that avoiding the sunset provision was not the only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose.  I think that's what you just said a couple 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

minutes ago. 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  That -- well, okay.  Excuse 

  

  

 

 

 

 

me.  I didn't mean to say that.  What I meant to say is 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the purpose of the C(ii) and C(iii) provisions, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was completely accomplished, was to get rid of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sunset provision.  And these letters are overwhelmingly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about the sunset provision. 

 

 

 

            

And every time Senator Talmadge or anybody

are -- the church agencies are very closely tied to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church, that really it's part of the church --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Because they honestly would 

  

 

 

 

 

have to do something else, right?  And that's what C(i) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

--

            

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- what --

  

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  And the other thing they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to do was what Representative Conable called a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

technical problem, which is they wanted to enable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church -- these congregational churches to maintain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans in a different way than they had been -- to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintain plans through this separate agency because that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the way they found it most convenient to do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that actually explains this language of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why they're talking in the first place about principal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose agencies and why that doesn't apply to -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

churches can establish and maintain a plan, and that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Feldman, why do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think -- I mean, I've -- I have read all your arguments 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about why the IRS letters are not entitled to deference. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I come at it from a different point, which is it was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in part these private organizations, religious 

 

 

 

 

 

organizations, but the IRS, too, who was lobbying

Congress to express itself on this issue and take care 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58 

of what the IRS knew was a problem for all these people. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then all of a sudden, almost immediately after the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation is passed, the IRS is believing and stating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's done more than you claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Isn't that, in itself, evidence -- not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Skidmore deference -- but evidence that the agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believed that the answer was different than you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

promoting right now? 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I -- you know, the agency 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

did believe the answer was different, that that is in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the letters.  There is no reasoning, actually, in those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letters at all.  And insofar as there is any, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except they knew there 

  

 

 

 

 

was a problem. 

   

            

            

assumed --

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  They -- they --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They thought or they 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  And they were --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Rightly or wrongly, they 

  

 

 

 

 

assumed that this language fixed it and fixed it how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were describing it in these letters. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  They -- they did interpret it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way they did.  I wouldn't deny that they did that.

But they -- they give no reason for doing that.  These 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were ex parte letters.  Every one of them, up until the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last couple of years, was done on an ex parte basis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59 

The competitors had no chance to say this is what we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think.  The employees had no chance to say this is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we think.  They didn't analyze the importance of ERISA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions.  They didn't analyze what would --

  

 

 

 

 

 

inevitably did happen, which is there are six or seven 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church plans already that have failed and left the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees with nothing; but had they been covered by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA, they would have had PBGC insurance.  The IRS 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't take any of that into account at all.  And to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, they were just wrong in 1982. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in fact, it's hard to -- it's clear in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one part that they're wrong that we talk about in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  But it's hard to see what other reasoning they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have about why they didn't take -- they didn't consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the practical consequences of this, they didn't consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the history of it, they didn't consider the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationships between the A and the C(i) provision. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

They just didn't consider what any of the particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words of the statute meant.  They really didn't do any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that. 

 

              

I would like to make one other point on --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on reliance, which is, you know, this is about bringing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

these plans into compliance with ERISA.  That shouldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a hard thing to do, and a district court should be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60 

able to do it, giving them whatever period of time is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable.  That's the overwhelming thing that's at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

issue here.  And in fact, if, as they say, they haven't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

departed from ERISA that much, which we don't agree or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe, then it should be particularly easy to bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them into compliance with ERISA. 

 

 

 

 

            

The only two things that are 

 

 

 

 

 

backward-looking at all are the civil damages, which I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned, and the fact that you may have to adjust some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vesting schedules between three and five years, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely to be a minor problem.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BLATT:  So I'm just going to start with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the funding issue. 

 

 

            

The one thing that's pellucid about C is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that the church does not have to fund C(i) plans because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute explicitly allows the maintaining 

 

 

 

 

 

organization to fund it.  And C(i) moves maintenance 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside the church, which means the church are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely off the hook.

They also -- you know, they -- they raise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the dignity plan.  The sponsoring congregations did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

establish those plans, and the other side argues the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61 

sponsoring congregations are not the church.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess that's because they're not priests. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The other thing I would ask you to read is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the brief by the United Church of Christ and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Evangelical Lutheran Church of America.  They explain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that the centralization that an establishment 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement would impose is anathema to their religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beliefs.  And it's the same reason that the maintenance 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is.  It's the continuum, establishment and maintenance. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Establishment turns on day one.  And then day two, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout time immemorial, there being -- the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side concedes you can maintain them.  But the notion 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there is some umbrella church for -- for the Jews 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the Protestants is just -- it's fantastical that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could possibly establish these plans. 

 

 

 

 

            

The other thing I wanted to mention, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

other side keeps talking about these closely-tied joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans.  But the only other thing we know that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pellucid about C is that an exempt plan can cover every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single employee in this country for a religious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

non-profit institution and not a single church employee 

   

 

 

 

 

 

needs to be in that plan.

The other side is asking you to engage in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62 

counterintuitive kind of weird thing that a church would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

set the dental plans and vesting requirements for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees of an affiliated organization, especially in a

that -- that just is not credible. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And finally, on the anomalies.  I mean, they 

    

 

 

 

 

 

have the anomalies that the pension board would want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorce the establishment from the maintenance.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have the anomaly that -- that the nuns are left out in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cold.  They have the anomaly of the YMCA -- and I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see my time is up.  I don't want to --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do finish your 

  

 

 

 

 

sentence. 

            

MS. BLATT:  Oh.  That the YMCA is the only, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, religious organization in America that got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this exemption, and they have this sort of silliness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a church would establish plans for someone else's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Case is submitted. 

 

 

            

(Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
