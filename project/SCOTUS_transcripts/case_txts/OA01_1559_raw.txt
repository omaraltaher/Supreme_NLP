CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in Number 01-1559, Joseph Massaro


versus The United States.


Mr. Fahringer.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERALD P. FAHRINGER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. FAHRINGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


We urge that the appropriate rule for the


resolution of ineffective assistance claims of counsel


guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States


Constitution is best handled in a collateral proceeding in


the first instance, without first resorting to direct 

appeal and, if that claim might qualify for direct appeal,


it should not be a procedural bar.


QUESTION:  What is the source of -- of law for


our decision?  Is it our supervisory powers, whatever we


think best, or --


MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, certainly, Your Honor,


that is implicated, your supervisory powers.  I also think


that under the Fifth Amendment, which has often been


construed to contain the equivalent of equal protection of


the law, that this is a circumstance, with the division in

the circuit, that calls out for uniformity.


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you're saying that if


there's a circuit different, there's a denial of equal


protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment?


MR. FAHRINGER:  In this circumstance, Your


Honor, and I'm not urging the Fourteenth Amendment.  What


I'm urging is, you have in the past had this circumstance


with, for instance, the Wade hearings, where it was deemed


necessary that you unify the system in the country so that


there is the equal protection, particularly in an area as


important as criminal prosecution.  Certainly, we would


all agree that the -- the most important right a defendant


possesses in a criminal proceeding is the right to


effective assistance of counsel --


QUESTION: 


Well, you know, that's why we grant 

certiorari in cases, because we don't think one -- one


rule should be -- obtained in New York and another rule in


New Orleans, but I don't think we ever thought it was the


Equal Protection Clause that --


MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, Your Honor, if -- if I've


overstated, that I apologize, but certainly under your


supervisory powers, I think that this case calls for


unity.


QUESTION:  We could unify it the way that you


don't want.

 MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, I -- I appreciate that,


Your Honor.  I -- I would urge that it is -- it lends some


force to our argument up here that certainly a majority of


the circuits and the highest courts of 36 States have


embraced the collateral review, and -- and the reason --


QUESTION:  Well, let -- would -- would it


ever -- would the basis for an inadequate assistance of


counsel claim ever be apparent on the trial court record


without resort to extrinsic evidence?


MR. FAHRINGER:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  I


think that --


QUESTION:  Never?


MR. FAHRINGER:  -- it -- there may be one, one


rare case, but -- as Judge Easterbrook in the Seventh


Circuit said so eloquently, and that is that in the --

because of the unique nature of the ineffective assistance


of counsel, because of the relationship between the


attorneys, and the -- and so much is a matter of omission


and the confidential relationship that he stated in every


case there is something that you could do to add to the


record that might reinforce the claim.  The Second


Circuit, most respectfully, Your Honor, has said that only


in a very few cases would it be completely clear on the


record.


The other reason that I think this rule is

superior to the procedural default rule is that it would


bring certitude to this area, where people would know with


some degree of confidence that it should be brought in a


collateral proceeding.  It has the element of efficiency,


in that it brings together in the 2255 proceeding all of


the ineffectiveness claims, so they can be resolved in an


adversary hearing, which is certainly the best method of


raising these claims, particularly when you need a full


record.


QUESTION:  Is your position that it's 2255 only,


or that it is the new counsel's option whether he thinks


it's appropriate to raise the ineffective assistance claim


on direct appeal, or whether he thinks it's best to wait


until the 2255 stage?


MR. FAHRINGER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Or are you saying he can't bring it


earlier, even if he thinks that --


MR. FAHRINGER:  No, Your Honor, I think it


should be an option.  I don't think we can ever stop a


defendant from raising it on direct appeal if he makes


that choice.  He -- he assumes the risk, then, most


respectfully, that he -- it -- it will be resolved,


whether he could have expanded the record or not, but


my -- my suggestion to the Court is, and I think logic


supports me in this respect, that with the 2255 collateral

available to him proceeding, that certainly the


overwhelming majority of cases would be brought in that


forum.


QUESTION:  But there's something to be said for


winding the thing up and getting it over with, isn't


there?


MR. FAHRINGER:  But those fears, Your Honor,


that were expressed in Frady, for example, have not been


pretty much put to rest by AEDPA, because now you have a


statute of limitation, so that these are not going to go


on and on.  As a matter of fact, if you --


QUESTION:  If you -- if you have a choice


between two proceedings and one proceeding, certainly


there's something to be said for one proceeding, although


your argument is that one proceeding simply isn't as 

effective as two, but I think you have to recognize that


all things being equal, it would be better having one


proceeding than two.


MR. FAHRINGER:  And -- and that one proceeding,


Your Honor, I -- I understand with the exception of an


individual choice that one proceeding really should be the


2255.  What I might say, as an example to this Court,


think of the dilemma a defense lawyer faces in the Second


Circuit where one, if he sees evidence of ineffectiveness


but it's not fully developed, and he doesn't raise it


7

25

because he doesn't think he's obliged to, there's a risk


of procedural default.


If he does raise it and it's not been fully


developed, it may be resolved by the court on a partial


record, whereas if he'd been in a 2255 proceeding, he


could have expanded and amplified the record, which would


have strengthened the claim.


The third option is, that the Second Circuit


seems to direct is, raise it at the earliest possible


moment, identify it, and then perhaps we will send it back


for remand.  Well, that, that seems to just complicate the


matter.


And then finally, Your Honor, I think one of the


most compelling arguments, which the Solicitor General


agrees with, that this would put an end to needless 

expenditure of judicial resources on resolving the -- the


cause and prejudice rule.  Remember, in a circuit like the


Second Circuit, every single man, woman that goes into a


2255 proceeding because they have this direct appeal rule


as an exception must establish cause and prejudice at the


threshold.


QUESTION:  Well, not -- not everyone.  I -- I


mean, only one who -- who got new counsel on the direct


appeal.


MR. FAHRINGER:  That's right, Your Honor.  I'm

sorry.  I'm speaking in the terms of that.  Obviously, if


you had the same lawyer, that would -- Your Honor, that


would really be cause, so it may be that he would be able


to easily overcome the cause aspect, but he still has the


prejudice aspect that he has to establish.


In the other circuits, he can go right in on a


2255, and -- and 2255 itself says that unless it's


conclusively established that his -- his papers are


without merit, a hearing shall be granted, so there's a


terrible disparity in the way defendants are treated who


are trying to -- to restore this most important right.


QUESTION:  Suppose you have a case where -- and


you stated earlier that this doesn't happen very often,


but suppose it's evident on the face of the record that


the counsel was ineffective. 


He stands up and says on the 

record, Your Honor, I wish the record to show I've been


asleep for an hour during the key cross examination.


Isn't it there also an efficiency in just


sending it back for new trial right away, rather than


going through all of the other claimed errors?


MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, Your Honor, I think yes. 


I --


QUESTION:  I mean, if it's evident that the case


has to go back, why have the district court -- or, pardon


me, the appellate courts examine the entire record and --

and give a lengthy opinion that's obviously going to be


unnecessary?


MR. FAHRINGER:  And Your Honor, I hope I'm


answering your question, because I want to be direct.  You


avoid that by the 2255 collateral review rule.  Right now,


the Second Circuit is involved in a large number of cases


where they come up and they just say, well, this really


should go back, and -- and that -- that prolongs the


appellate process.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm a little confused on the


same point.  I thought that, suppose -- does -- would you


say that a defendant is forbidden to raise an ineffective


assistance claim on direct appeal?


MR. FAHRINGER:  No.


QUESTION:  No. 


You're just saying that if he 

doesn't, you can -- he can raise it later in 2255.


MR. FAHRINGER:  That's right.


QUESTION:  And the appellate court can't say to


him, oh, you should have raised it earlier, so you're out?


MR. FAHRINGER:  Precisely, Your Honor.  The --


QUESTION:  All right, and so all we're doing is


defining the -- the scope of the procedural bar rule when


a person goes into 2255.  We're not controlling what he


says on his appeal.


MR. FAHRINGER:  That's correct, Your Honor,

and --


QUESTION:  We're not.


MR. FAHRINGER:  -- it seems to me that if -- but


please understand, I think I have to say in all fairness,


if he takes and goes up on the direct appeal with his


ineffectiveness claim and the appellate court resolves it,


then he may be barred.


QUESTION:  Yes, so -- so in other words, if he


chooses to go and appeal, direct appeal --


MR. FAHRINGER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- he's not going to be able to make


exactly the same claim later in 2255.


MR. FAHRINGER:  Precisely.


QUESTION:  But if he doesn't make it on direct


appeal, you want him to be able to make it on 2255 and not 

be met with the argument, oh, you should have brought it


on direct appeal.


MR. FAHRINGER:  Your Honor, in response to that,


there really is --


QUESTION:  Yes, all right.  I --


MR. FAHRINGER:  -- unanimity among all of the


circuits that the best forum -- the best -- the Second


Circuit agrees with this, too.  The best forum for


resolving ineffectiveness claims is in the collateral


proceeding, when you have access to discovery.

 QUESTION:  May I ask you about this -- this


possibility?  Sometimes there are -- there are claims in


which there are two bases for challenging the competence


of counsel.  Assume that one of them is plain on the face


of the record, he didn't object to -- you have a whole


bunch of, line of interrogation was plainly improper, and


the second ground is not plain on the record.  Supposing


he raises the first ground on direct appeal and loses.  Is


he barred, in your view, from raising the second ground on


collateral review?


MR. FAHRINGER:  No, Your Honor.  He would be


able to do that.  The -- the -- but if I may, Your Honor,


that's triggered another grave concern here.  In -- under


Strickland you indicated that, you know, ineffectiveness


claims really should be judged in aggregate because one 

lends force to another.  It ought to be the overall


performance of the attorney.


What you have in the Second Circuit now is the


very piecemeal type of resolution of ineffectiveness


claims that you just described.  What has actually


happened, and we cite the cases in our brief, they take


one because that's, they say is fully developed on the


record.  They resolve it.  Two more go back down to the


2255 proceeding, and that seems to be in direct defiance


of the spirit, at least, of the Strickland rule that they

should all be decided together in one proceeding, and so


that, you know, it's -- the -- the powerful arguments of


efficiency, simplicity, and fairness to all parties seems


to -- to argue for the -- the collateral review rule.


The only argument they lean against this is this


notion of -- of finality, but -- but I submit to the Court


most respectfully that that's an -- that's in a -- an


almost nonexistent, narrow margin of cases, because


there's always more you're going to develop on the record. 


The lawyer's explanation, for instance, you know, you


never have that --


QUESTION:  Well, you know, you could go -- you


could have an entire separate proceeding, Mr. Fahringer,


and just have exhaustive discovery and so on, but there --


there comes a time when there is an interest in finality, 

that you don't want the thing just postponed to another


day, which this does.


MR. FAHRINGER:  But Your Honor -- and -- and I


welcome that question, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is


this, that if, as the Second Circuit itself says, it is


only in a very few cases where it would be fully developed


on the record, that seems to me to be a small price to pay


for a much simpler, more straightforward rule that


everybody knows where they stand.  Lawyers are not


struggling with this decision in the Second Circuit,

should I raise it, should I not raise it, am I at risk,


and now what you've done is, under the Second Circuit's


rule, you have spawned a whole generation of -- of second


ineffectiveness claims, because if the lawyer doesn't


raise it and the defendant understandably says, well, you


should have raised it because they say it was fully


developed on the record and you thought it wasn't, now you


have another whole level that is added to this, so the


complexity is staggering that is developed.


QUESTION:  Mr. Fahringer, is -- does AEDPA


require that all such claims have to be brought within 1


year in any event?


MR. FAHRINGER:  It does to this respect, Your


Honor, yes, because as a practical matter now, under AEDPA


as it had amended 2255, if you bring an ineffectiveness 

claim in a 2255 proceeding, and they are resolved, and you


want to try to bring another one, you have to get


permission of the circuit court, of course, so you've got


some control over it, and -- and then all claims have to


be brought within a year in any event, so the fears that


were expressed in Frady have been put to rest, I believe,


and there's really no good reason.  I -- I think the


reason the Solicitor General endorsed this rule for over


20 years, and they've changed their mind now, but


certainly we've cited case after case where they argued to

this Court that -- that this is the best way to do it, to


bring it in a collateral proceeding, because that is the


fairest, the simplest.


QUESTION:  Am I right in thinking that most


cases, even in the Second Circuit, do go into the 2255


mold, because in most cases it will not be clear on the


record, and the Second Circuit rule that you must bring it


on direct review applies only when it is clear, the


ineffectiveness is clear on the record, if you need to


look outside the record, then the Second Circuit agrees it


doesn't belong on direct review?


MR. FAHRINGER:  Your Honor, in all due respect,


I'm not sure that's right.  Since Billy-Eko came down, 35


cases that we were able to find in addition to this one


were defaulted, because the Second Circuit said it should 

have been brought, there was enough on the record.  So


this is a terribly ambiguous and controversial -- and we


don't know how many cases where district courts just


simply issued an order.  These are written opinions, many


of them, Your Honor, unpublished, but it --


QUESTION:  But there -- but are there not cases


where the Second Circuit has recognized this particular


claim depends on extra-record material?


MR. FAHRINGER:  Absolutely, Your Honor. 


Absolutely.  As a matter of fact, what I think lends force

to our argument here is that even the Second Circuit


acknowledged it, and yet they persist in holding to that


narrow exception that it should be raised on direct


appeal, and that narrow exception means that in every 2255


proceeding, a defendant must overcome what is a fairly --


a large hurdle of -- of cause and prejudice, and that's


not true in the other -- in the other circuits, so we


believe, on balance, the better rule, and the one that


will more effectively administer justice, should be this


one.


With that being said, I'd like to close by just


simply urging the Court that since one of the most


cherished policies of this Nation is that, and of the


criminal justice system is that a person is entitled to


the effective assistance of counsel, but if that right is 

rendered meaningless because if he's denied that


safeguard, he has no effective remedy to cure it, then it


seems to me the right has been sadly lost, and I would ask


this Court to adopt the rule that we urge.


Thank you so much.


QUESTION:  Do you wish to reserve your remaining


time, Mr. Fahringer?


MR. FAHRINGER:  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chief


Justice.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRIKANTH SRINIVASAN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


QUESTION:  Mr. Srinivasan, suppose you start by


telling us why the SG changed the position that it had --


that he had taken for so long on this point?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice O'Connor, the -- the


Solicitor General's Office today, as before, believes that


in the majority of the cases, in the overwhelming majority


of the cases, claims asserting ineffective assistance of


counsel will be better resolved on collateral review.  The


question has been whether the costs of applying a


procedural default rule outweigh those benefits, and it


has been our experience, with the application of the rule


in the Second and Seventh Circuits over the past several


years, that the administrative costs that initially were 

feared haven't -- haven't been borne out, and that the


degree of uncertainty that initially led us to -- to reach


the position that a procedural default rule should not be


applied hasn't been borne out either.


QUESTION:  So in effect you think that what's


happening now in CA-2 and CA-7 is just fine?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  In the main, we think that's


correct, Justice O'Connor.  It should not -- the rule's


operation should not result in unfairness to defendants,


and should not overload the courts with ineffectiveness

claims that are asserted prematurely on direct appeal.


QUESTION:  How many cases are we talking about? 


I mean, it's the -- we're arguing about a sub-class of


cases in which counsel changes between the trial and the


direct appeal.  Either in percentage terms or absolute


terms, how many are we talking about?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Souter, the best that


we can tell, and this is based on essentially anecdotal


reports of U.S. Attorney's Offices, it's somewhere on the


order of 20 to 40 percent, roughly, of cases in which new


counsel represents the defendant on appeal, but that --


I'd -- I hesitate to rely too much on that figure, because


it is based on the anecdotal reports --


QUESTION:  And --


MR. SRINIVASAN: 


-- and additionally, it varies 

significantly by locality, depending on the particular


rules that are in place for replacement of counsel on


appeal.


QUESTION:  Within that 20 to 40 percent,


whatever it may be, do you have any kind of a rough guess


as to the number of instances of this issue that arise?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  This issue?


QUESTION:  I mean, how -- how many times within


that 20 to 40 percent category do we get into an argument


later on as to whether 2255 can be availed of because, in

fact, a -- a record was sufficiently developed to -- to


raise the -- the claim on direct?  How -- how many cases


are there?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  We don't -- we don't have the


figures on that.  We don't -- we don't track the figures


by substantive claims, and so it's been difficult to come


up with numbers that reflect the treatment of


ineffectiveness claims in particular.


QUESTION:  So it's -- it's hard to say what the


sort of cost to the system, if there is one, would be of


going one way or the other?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  It's -- it's hard to say


because there's no hard scientific data, and I --


QUESTION:  Well, how could there be?  I mean,


what the problem is, is in a very small number of cases, 

hardly any, you have a case in the district court where


the judge is serving as a habeas judge, and the Government


in a very small number of cases comes in and makes the


argument, judge, he cannot raise this ineffective


assistance claim because he should have raised it on


direct appeal, although he didn't, and then the cost to


the system is hidden in the mind of the judge, in the


minds of the lawyers who have to spend time briefing that


and going and finding some affidavits, and trying to get


around it.

 I mean, how could you get empirical information,


and what led you to change your opinion?  Have you been


investigating the minds of the judge or the minds of the


lawyers in some way, that you know that they aren't


actually aggravated, that you know that they aren't


actually disturbed at having to waste their time on such


an issue?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, we haven't been conducting


an examination of that, of that sort, of course.


QUESTION:  Oh, I'm sure you haven't.  I'm being


a little facetious, but it seems to me it's not empirical


data.  The world won't come to an end if you lose this


case.  All it will do is save judges and lawyers a certain


amount of time, which, if you win this case, they will


have spent for no reason.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  That -- Justice Breyer, it's


correct that it saves time at the stage of collateral


review, but the question for procedural default purposes


is the effect of the rule at the time of direct appeal,


and --


QUESTION:  You could save no time on direct


appeal, it's nothing.  I mean, what we're talking about is


cases where the person didn't raise the argument on direct


appeal.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  But the consequences of having

a procedural default rule is that it encourages the


raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal in any


essential issues.


QUESTION:  Yes, yes.  Everybody will have to go


and make the same argument twice.  First they'll have to


go and make the argument on direct appeal, a lot of them,


and then they will have to remake the argument on


collateral review, this time trying to explain why it's


somehow different.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Breyer, there are


situations in which ineffectiveness claims can be raised


and resolved on direct appeal, and --


QUESTION:  There are.


QUESTION:  Are there -- a fairly small number, I


would assume?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  It is a narrow category of


cases, Justice O'Connor, but those cases do exist.


QUESTION:  In any event, the AEDPA time limits


apply, do they not, even if we followed a different rule?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  As a -- that's correct, Justice


O'Connor, the 1-year statute of limitations applies, but


that's also true of other substantive claims, and yet the


Court has continued to apply the cause in prejudice


standard to encourage the raising of those claims at the


earliest available opportunity, and that's the -- that's

the principal policy interest behind applying the


procedural default rule in this context.


QUESTION:  Is this just a Federal question,


Mr. Srinivasan, or are -- does it carry over to cases


going through State courts, too?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, the question


before the Court is -- is purely a Federal question.  The


States have adopted varying approaches, as we've suggested


in our briefs.  A significant number of States require the


raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, and


judge the raising of an ineffectiveness claim on


collateral review by a cause in prejudice standard.


QUESTION:  Isn't it true that the majority of


States go the other way?


MR. SRINIVASAN: 


The majority -- it appears that 

the majority of States go the other way, but it's not


entirely clear, Justice Stevens, because some of the


States haven't spoken directly on the question.  What


we -- what we know is that 19 States -- it was 20 at the


time we filed our brief, but it's now 19, follow the cause


in prejudice approach and require the raising of


ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, and there's at


least a significant number of States that don't require


the raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal,


but it's unclear whether there's more than 20, and so we

don't know exactly whether it's a majority or not, but --


but there at least are a significant number that apply


procedural default principles to the raising of claims on


direct appeal, and that's --


QUESTION:  Am I right that the Government's


position before the -- before we granted cert in this case


was, this lack of uniformity is all right, that either


rule will do, and that lawyers, defense lawyers in the


Second Circuit will file the Second Circuit's rule, and


defense lawyers in the Fifth Circuit will file the Fifth


Circuit rule, and that was okay?  Wasn't that the


Government's original position -- you were never saying,


it must be direct review if it's clear on the record?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Ginsburg, our position


was that there was no need for national uniformity in the 

sense that the Court need not grant review to impose a


national -- national uniform rule.  We didn't -- we


thought that there was no unfairness in the existing


divergence of approaches among the courts of appeals,


because in each court of appeals, a defendant had notice


of the particular approach that applied in that circuit,


and so a defendant knew ahead of time whether he had to


raise its ineffectiveness claim on direct appeal, or


whether he could wait without penalty and raise it on


collateral review.

 QUESTION:  So effectively, you told us not to


bother with this case, but once we granted cert, then the


Government had to take a position?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Correct, Justice Ginsburg.  Now


that the Court has granted certiorari, we think it would


be appropriate for this Court to adopt a Nationwide rule


similar to what the Court essentially did in Bousley,


where the question was the proper time for raising an


objection to a guilty plea on grounds that the plea was


not voluntary, or -- or intelligent, and the Court reached


a resolution that required the raising of those claims on


direct appeal and adopted, it -- it appears, a Nationwide


solution, and we think a similar approach would be


appropriate in this case, that the Court should decide


whether on a national scale ineffectiveness claims can 

always be brought on collateral review without any


concerns about procedural default, or, as we think is


appropriate, that ineffectiveness claims should be


required to be raised on direct appeal in those situations


in which counsel is new and the record -- the record for


the claim is fully developed in the trial record.


QUESTION:  One can imagine, if the requirement


that the counsel be new in order to force you to raise it


on direct appeal, that in itself could be the subject of


controversy.  That is, if you take a Public Defender

Office, and one Public Defender, one member of that office


conducts the trial, and then another member of that office


conducts the appeal, is that new counsel?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Ginsburg, there --


there are decisions that address that issue in the State


courts, and I believe at least a couple that address that


issue in the Federal courts, and generally, the approach


has been that defenders from the same Public -- attorneys


from the same Public Defender's Office are considered the


same attorney for purposes of conflict, determining


whether there's a conflict in one alleging that the other


rendered ineffective assistance.


And that, I think, comes from the ABA


professional rules, and I -- and I believe it's Model Rule


1.1, which suggests that competence is imputed to 

attorneys that operate within the same firm, and that


confirms that, at least for private firm purposes, two


attorneys from the same firm would be considered to be the


same attorney for procedural default -- default purposes,


and we think the same approach would follow with respect


to Public Defender's Offices, so I don't think that the


question of the same attorney is going to give rise to a


great deal of litigation or uncertainty.  The rules in


that area ought to be pretty clear.


QUESTION:  Well, there's one aspect of the

Government's decision, now that it has to take a position


one way or another.  These questions, ineffectiveness of


counsel, deal with what went on in the trial court, and


ordinarily, the first view of such questions is taken by a


court of first instance, not an appellate court, and yet


here, the first look under the rule you are now supporting


would be taken by an appellate court.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Ginsburg, that's


correct, but I think it's important to point out that that


question, that situation is going to arise regardless of


how this Court resolves the procedural default question,


because in all the courts of appeals a defendant can raise


an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal.


QUESTION:  What -- what is the procedure in


the -- in the Federal system for a collateral --

collateral action, they have a claim that's ineffective. 


Does that go back to the judge who was the trial judge?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Typically, yes, that's the way


2255 works, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  May I ask, under the Second Circuit


rule, if the defendant is represented by the Public


Defender's Office in the trial court, and then on appeal,


the Public Defender's Office continues to represent him


but by a different lawyer, they have different -- does


that -- is that a different lawyer within the meaning of

the Second Circuit rule, or is it the same lawyer?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, I think as I was -- as I


was attempting to suggest in response to Justice


Ginsburg's question, I think that would be considered the


same attorney, and that follows from conflicts principles.


QUESTION:  I see.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  That attorneys within the same


office are considered to be the same attorney for purposes


of conflicts, and that informs the proper approach in --


in the procedural default inquiry, but I think it's


important to note that all the courts of appeals are


confronted with ineffective assistance claims that are


raised on direct appeal.  No court of appeals prohibits


the assertion of an ineffectiveness claim on direct


appeal, so in every court, the court of appeals is faced 

with one of three options at the time an ineffectiveness


claim is raised.


They can deny the claim on the merits if they


can conclude that in no circumstances the claim could


succeed, they could grant relief on ineffectiveness


grounds in the narrow category of cases in which


entitlement to relief will be apparent from the trial


record, or they could decline to resolve the claim and


remit its resolution to 2255, and that's precisely the


same three options that confront the Second Circuit and

the Seventh Circuit, who apply the procedural default


rule.


So Justice Ginsburg, in response to your


question, the courts of appeals are faced with the same


array of options whether this Court adopts a procedural


default principle or not, and in the Ninth Circuit, for


example, in 2001, the Court faced roughly on the order of


50 direct appeals in which ineffective assistance of


counsel was asserted as a basis for relief, and in 10 of


those cases, the Court was able to decide conclusively


that the claim was lacking in merit and therefore couldn't


be brought again under 2255, and --


QUESTION:  Then the court of appeals can always


say, we think it would be better to have this aired in


the -- in the court of first instance, so there will be no 

prejudice to our rejecting it now, you can bring it in


2255, but the one that -- the concern here is the


defendant and his new counsel, whether the new counsel can


safely say, if I have any doubt, I'm going to hold it back


to the 2255, and one point that was made was that on


direct appeal, it's important for the appellate counsel to


have the cooperation of the trial lawyer to help him go


through the record and point out possible grounds for


appeal.


But if the new counsel is going to insert

ineffective assistance of counsel at that stage, it will


make the relationship between trial and appellate counsel


rather tense, will it not?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  That -- that possibility


certainly is there, Justice Ginsburg, but I think the same


possibility arises at the time of collateral review, when


the attorney -- when you'd expect the attorney equally to


desire the cooperation of trial counsel, but any effort to


assert ineffectiveness could create the same sort of


tension in the relationship.


QUESTION:  Mr. Srinivasan, do you have any idea


of what percentage of cases, of criminal convictions


result in inadequate assistance of counsel claims?  Is it


90 percent of them, 50 percent of them, what?  Do we know?


MR. SRINIVASAN: 


I -- I don't have statistics of 

that variety, Justice O'Connor.  I think it's been


generally recognized by several courts that ineffective


assistance claims are often raised on collateral review,


and I think it's fair to say that in a significant portion


of -- of 2255 petitions, an ineffective assistance of


counsel claim will be at least one ground for relief.


And one effect of applying a procedural default


principle would be to encourage the raising and resolution


of those claims on direct appeal in those situations in


which it's appropriate, and I think it's important to


29

point out that there are at least some cases in which a


court of appeals can resolve, on the basis of the trial


record, that the -- that trial counsel either was or was


not ineffective, and this Court, for example, in its -- in


its Kimmelman decision, the -- pointed out that trial


counsel's ineffectiveness, at least in terms of the


performance prong of the Strickland inquiry, was apparent


from the trial record, and there will be situations like


that that arise every so often, and perhaps more


frequently an appellate court will be able to determine


that trial counsel's performance was not ineffective and


will be able to make that determination perhaps because,


no matter how deficient the performance was, the -- the


particular matter at issue could never have resulted in


prejudice for the defendant.


For example, if the claim of ineffectiveness is


that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to


competently impeach a particular witness, an appellate


court could perhaps look at the trial record and determine


that the testimony of that particular witness was not


central to the prosecution's case, and in those


circumstances, could a more effective impeachment have


given rise to a reasonable probability that the result at


trial would have been different.


So there are going to be some situations in

which a court of appeals can resolve an ineffectiveness


claim at the time of direct appeal, and in those


situations, it seems appropriate to encourage the raising


of the claim at that stage in order to promote respect for


the finality of criminal judgments and also to promote the


resolution of legal claims at the earliest feasible


opportunity.


QUESTION:  Under your rule, as I understand it,


new appellate counsel has the obligation to search through


the record to show, to find ineffective assistance of


counsel, and the trial counsel doesn't have that


obligation.  That, number one, seems to me a little bit


arbitrary and, secondly, I'm wondering if that might not


itself have an effect on how often petitioner gets new


appellate counsel as opposed to having his trial counsel. 

Do you think there might be some effect of this rule on


the decision to retain new counsel at the appellate stage?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  We're not aware that --


QUESTION:  Or maybe even some gamesmanship


playing, where that trial counsel is counsel of record,


but he really gets new appellate counsel to help him out?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, we're not aware of any --


of any effect of that sort in either the Second or Seventh


Circuits which apply the procedural default rule, and --


and I think if trial counsel's involved in the

gamesmanship, one would have to conceive of a situation in


which trial counsel found it in his interest to ensure


that appellate counsel could confirm his ineffectiveness


at trial, and that situation perhaps is unlikely to arise.


And in terms of the distinction between


appellate counsel calling into question trial counsel's


ineffectiveness, and trial counsel calling into question


his own ineffectiveness, Justice Kennedy, this Court in


Kimmelman observed what I think would -- is a common sense


proposition, which is that trial counsel is unlikely to


bring into question his own competence at trial and, in


fact, he would -- he would create a conflict situation,


and therefore the system just doesn't operate on the


assumption that trial counsel should be required to


identify his own ineffectiveness and bring it to the 

attention of the trial court.


QUESTION:  What about Mr. Fahringer's point that


if you follow your rule, you're going to get a second


generation of ineffective assistance claims, that is, that


the counsel who didn't raise or did raise something on


appeal was ineffective?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, it's true


that -- that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel


is -- would constitute cause for failing to raise the


claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel at -- on

direct appeal, that that is also true in -- with all other


substantive claims, that ineffective assistance of trial


counsel for failing to raise any substantive claim at the


time of direct appeal could constitute cause excusing the


default, yet this Court has continued to apply procedural


default principles in the case of other substantive


claims, and so I'm not sure that that particular


consideration tips the balance decidedly in one direction


or the other.


And in fact, the Court has made clear in


decisions such as Murray versus Carrier and Smith versus


Murray, and -- and recently in Smith versus Robbins, that


it's difficult to make out a claim of ineffective


assistance of appellate counsel because appellate


counsel's decision whether to raise a particular claim is 

the hallmark of effective advocacy, and one would have to


show that appellate counsel was unreasonable in failing to


present one claim instead of another at the time of


appellate briefing in order to establish that there was


cause for failing to raise ineffective assistance of trial


counsel at the time of direct appeal.


QUESTION:  Of course, the Government loses one


thing on -- on your theory in -- in certainly some of the


ineffective assistance records I've had here, or seen here


where the -- the issue arises whether, in fact, an

apparently foolish move on the part of trial counsel was


dictated by what ultimately was a very sensible tactical


reason which is not apparent on the face of the record.


In cases like that, the Government isn't going


to get a chance, in effect, to make that kind of rebuttal


if the issue is raised on -- on direct.  The Government


simply won't know.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Souter, the Government


won't get that chance if it's resolved on direct appeal. 


If it's raised on direct appeal, the Government, of


course, shares an interest in assuring that the trial


court -- that the appellate court, excuse me, does not


resolve the claim because it would say --


QUESTION:  No, but you run the -- there's no


question the -- but the -- the trial court may not give 

you the chance.  I mean, you run a risk that you're going


to get cut short on your opportunity to get trial counsel


to explain what may look like a very dumb thing on the --


on the record.


The risk you run is that the trial -- that


the -- that the appellate court on direct appeal is going


to say, this was crazy, no -- you know, there -- there


couldn't be any sensible explanation for this, and I -- I


don't understand -- I don't know, just as we were saying


before, there's no way to tell how -- how frequently a

situation like this will arise, because we don't have any


hard statistics on any of it, but I -- I don't know why


you're giving that up.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, in order to ameliorate


that possibility, Justice Souter, the Seventh Circuit, for


example, has adopted a standard under which it will not


decide a claim of ineffectiveness in the defendant's favor


unless there's no possible strategic rationale for


counsel's decision and, of course, to the extent that


there may be a strategic rationale for the counsel's


decision, it'll be in the Government's interest to bring


that to the court's attention in its appellate briefing,


and we haven't seen too many situations in which a court


grants a claim of ineffectiveness on direct appeal, but


yet there was potentially a strategic rationale for 

counsel's decision.


In fact, the court should grant relief on


ineffectiveness grounds on direct appeal only in


situations such as the one that confronted the Court in


Kimmelman, where there was an extended dialogue between


trial counsel and the trial court concerning trial


counsel's assertively deficient decision --


QUESTION:  I --


MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- and trial counsel was able


to explain to the trial court the basis of its decision,

and from trial counsel's explanation, one could determine


that it wasn't based on a strategic rationale, but instead


was based simply on a misunderstanding of the time, of the


timeliness of the rejection rule that was at issue.


QUESTION:  In a collateral proceeding,


Mr. Srinivasan, you're developing evidence, you have


the trial -- you put the trial counsel on the stand and


the new counsel cross examines him to see -- prove how


badly he did?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  That -- that could arise,


Mr. Chief Justice.  That's -- that's one potential


evidentiary way to show that trial counsel was


ineffective.


QUESTION:  And is there any limit on the -- can


you, you know, examine the trial counsel for his mental 

processes and that sort of thing?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  I'm not -- I don't know the


answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice.  I don't know to what


extent privileges weigh into it.


QUESTION:  But the Government frequently in


these cases elicits testimony in response from the trial


counsel saying, well, yeah, I -- I didn't ask the question


because I didn't want to get into this sort of subject, so


I mean that --


MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's correct.

 QUESTION:  -- I take it, is a relatively common


feature in these cases.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's -- that's correct,


Justice Souter.  It's in the Government -- the Government


does do that, and it's in their interest to do that to


ensure that the result of trial is upheld.


QUESTION:  There are no privilege problems, are


there -- or maybe I'm wrong -- if -- if the client himself


has the new attorney examine the old one.  He waives the


privilege.


MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think that's right, Justice


Kennedy.


If I could turn just for one moment to the


application of a procedural default rule to the facts of


this case, in -- if the procedural default rule were to be 

applied, the question at the time of collateral review is


whether -- is whether the defendant has introduced


extrinsic evidence not available in the trial record in


support of this claim of ineffectiveness, and the court of


appeals in this case found that there was no extrinsic


evidence material to the claim of ineffectiveness


introduced in the affidavits on which petitioner relies


because the affidavits suggests avenues of inquiry the


trial counsel could have pursued that trial counsel in


fact did pursue.

 For example, on the facts of this particular


case, that there was no blood spatter remaining from the


wound, and that -- that no blood spatter reflected on the


upholstery of the car, or no blood itself on the front


passenger seat, or that the body of the -- the position of


the body wasn't consistent with the testimony concerning


the firing of the second shot, and I think it's important


to point out that in all of those avenues were, in fact,


explored by the trial record -- excuse me, by trial


counsel, and were presented to the jury, and the jury


evidently found them not persuasive.


QUESTION:  And yet the -- the trial judge


herself said to defense counsel, aren't you going to move


for a continuance, when this bullet came -- was unearthed


after all that time. 


Didn't she, a couple of times, hint 

that it would be -- might be a good idea for defense


counsel to seek a continuance?


MR. SRINIVASAN:  She did.  She offered a


continuance on repeated occasions to trial counsel, and


trial counsel turned it down, but I think the defendant's


burden at the time of collateral review now is to show


that the refusal of a continuance worked to the


defendant's detriment and resulted in a reasonable


probability that the result at trial would have been


different had he -- had he accepted a continuance, and the

affidavits only present avenues of inquiry that trial


counsel in fact pursued, which indicates, and I think in


some sense confirms, that a continuance would not have


affected the result at trial.


If there are no further questions, Mr. Chief


Justice --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.


Mr. Fahringer, you have 14 minutes left.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HERALD P. FAHRINGER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. FAHRINGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think


I'm going to have to use them, but let me go right to this


matter of prejudice.


The Court should understand that the district


court, nor the court of appeals, decided the prejudice 

issue.  This was decided purely on procedural ground that


there was a sufficient record to raise it on appeal, and


what I think it's important for you to understand is that


although in the trial record you had the justice pleading


with defense counsel to take a continuance, investigate


this bullet that became the most important piece of


evidence in the case -- the prosecutor stated that in the


Second Circuit, this was our most important piece of


evidence.  That became the pivotal point of the trial,


and -- and the affidavits don't simply talk about avenues

the defense lawyer should have taken, what the affidavits


say is that it is highly unlikely that this bullet was


fired in that car, and they say that it is not consistent


with the chief and one and only witness that was involved


in the homicide, so what was missing, the indispensable


component for an ineffectiveness claim was the prejudice. 


That was not on the record.  What you had is, you're not


taking an adjournment, but all you have in the record is,


the bullet and the prosecution's proof.


QUESTION:  Of course, we're not trying to decide


here whether --


MR. FAHRINGER:  No.


QUESTION:  -- or not this claim should be


sustained or rejected.


MR. FAHRINGER: 


No, I -- you're -- Mr. Chief 

Justice, I agree.  What I would like to say is, I think


the Solicitor General is mistaken when he responded to


your question and said that there would still be


ineffectiveness claims against appellate counsel.  If this


Court adopts the rule that a ineffectiveness claim can be


brought under 2255 and does not have to be first explored


in those few cases on direct appeal, then there certainly


can be no claim made against appellate counsel for not


raising that claim.


The other issue that's been identified here,


40 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

which is one of some moment, is new counsel.  The -- the


Second Circuit has held in a case, it's unreported so I


won't discuss it, but you should know that there's a


holding that the Legal Aid Society, when it went over to


the Appeals Bureau, that was a different lawyer, even


though it was the same society, so it -- it is -- there's


ambiguity there, too.


What if the trial lawyer goes out and gets what


he thinks is a good appellate lawyer to come in Of Counsel


with him, and the new appellate lawyer comes in and he


sees the colleague who brought him into the case has


got -- I mean, it just is generating one complexity after


another.


If you look at the Seventh Circuit rule, they 


have put so many exceptions onto this, as has been 

identified, that -- that it's just becoming I think


unmanageable and the rule is becoming unadministratable,


and for that reason it cries out for a new rule.


Thank you, Your Honor.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,


Mr. Fahringer.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 10:58 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
